They request access to certain Agency guidelines and instructions contained in a manual and to various memoranda issued to employees who audit oil refineries regulated by the FEA. A prior request for the same matter had been denied by the Agency. The District Court granted the request in part and denied the remainder. We agree generally with the court\u2019s disposition and accordingly affirm its judgment with slight modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-25\">I. APPELLANTS\u2019 REQUEST</p>\n<p id=\"b791-26\">The FEA is charged with administering the Federal Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations and various federal laws and regulations relating to the refining of petroleum products. Industry compliance is monitored through periodic audits, and appellants seek to require the FEA to provide them access to the Agency\u2019s Guidelines and instructions to these employees. Specifically appellants request access to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-27\">any and all manuals, instructions, memoranda, guidelines, training materials, reporters, booklets, and other documents utilized by FEA to train, instruct, direct, guide, or supervise refinery auditors in the performance of their duties, including, but not limited to, the manner in which such audits are to be conducted and the time frame, if any, within (which) such audits are to be completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au7e\">(J.A. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-28\">Appellants were unable to state with any more specificity the exact documents they desired to inspect, but the written material which evolved as the target of their general request turned out to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-29\">(a) an FEA instruction manual for refinery auditors entitled \u201cBasic Refiner Course\u201d and (b) FEA\u2019s \u201cRefinery Audit Review Field Audit Guidelines\u201d (as supplemented on February 28, 1975, by the FEA\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for Audit Modules\u201d) [hereafter, \u201cGuidelines\u201d]. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-30\">(J.A. 5, 9). Both the Agency and the trial court decided that the \u201cBasic Refiner Course\u201d manual was <em>not </em>exempt from disclosure. Hence this opinion is concerned solely with the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>II. APPELLANTS\u2019 THEORIES</p>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">Appellants base their claim on two legal theories. First, they contend that the Guidelines are subject to disclosure because they \u201cconstitute an \u2018administrative staff manua[l] and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public\u2019 such as [are] referred to in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(C).\u201d (J.A. 6). Second, as an alternative theory, appellants claim that FEA\u2019s refusal to produce the Guidelines violated 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires agencies to make most records promptly available to any person whose request for them conforms to published rules and reasonably describes the records requested (J.A. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">III. THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF MANUAL THEORY</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Appellants\u2019 first and principal contention is that the Guidelines are an \u201cadministrative staff manual\u201d that the statute requires to be disclosed. The relevant statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">4c 4c * $ 4c $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-16\">(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-17\">4s * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-18\">(C) <em>administrative </em>staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public; unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale. . . ,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an agency against a party other than an agency only if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-20\">(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as provided by this paragraph; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-21\">(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-22\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C) (Supp. V 1975) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-23\">When enacting this statute, Congress made it clear that it distinguished between manuals relating to \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d and manuals relating to \u201cadministrative matters,\u201d and that it did not intend to require disclosure of the former.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ate Committee Report on this section of the bill repeats the statutory language that \u201cadministrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public\u201d are to be made available, but elsewhere specifically excludes \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d from the disclosure requirement for \u201cadministrative matters\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-4\">The limitation of the staff manuals and instructions affecting the public which must be made available to the public to those which pertain to administrative matters <em>rather than to law enforcement matters </em>protects the traditional confidential nature of instructions to Government personnel prosecuting violations of law in court, while permitting a public examination of the basis for administrative action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">S.Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, 7 (1965) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The House Committee Report reflects the same intent as the Senate Report, but the House version discusses the nature of the intent in greater detail. The House Report specifically states that the legislative intent was to require disclosure of \u201csecret law,\u201d and not Agency \u201cguidelines for auditing and inspection\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">In addition to the orders and opinions required to be made public by the present law, subsection (b) of S. 1160 would require agencies to make available statements of policy, interpretations, staff manuals, and instructions that affect any member of the public. This material is the end product of Federal administration. It has the force and effect of law in most cases, yet under the present statute these Federal agency decisions have been kept secret from the members of the public affected by the decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">As the Federal Government has extended its activities to solve the Nation\u2019s expanding problems \u2014 and particularly in the 20 years since the Administrative Procedure Act was established \u2014 the bureaucracy has developed its own form of case law. This law is embodied in thousands of orders, opinions, statements, and instructions issued by hundreds of agencies. This is the material which would be made available under subsection (b) of S. 1160. However, under S. 1160 an agency may not be required to make available for public inspection and copying any advisory interpretation on a specific set of facts which is requested by and addressed to a particular person, provided that such interpretation is not cited or relied upon by any officer or employee of the agency as a precedent in the disposition of other cases. <em>Furthermore, an agency may not be required to make available those portions of its staff manuals and instructions which set forth criteria or guidelines for the staff in auditing or inspection procedures, or in the selection or handling of cases, such as operational tactics, allowable tolerances, or criteria for defense, prosecution, or settlement of cases.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5O\">H.R.Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 7-8, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1966, pp. 2418, 2424 (1966) (emphasis added). It would be difficult to find a more precise basis for disposing of this case than the congressional intent expressed in the statement in the portion of the Report italicized above.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">The specific agreement of the House and Senate Committee Reports, to exclude from disclosure \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d and \u201cstaff manuals and instructions which set forth criteria or guidelines for the staff in auditing and inspection procedures\u201d forecloses appellants\u2019 claim for disclosure regardless of possible ambiguities raised by other more general portions of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>and the Committee Reports,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as specific statements of legislative intent usually prevail over more general provisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The information sought by appellants involves guidelines and instructions that unquestionably relate to law enforcement. The basic purpose of the Guidelines is to assure that the costs oil refiners use in computing their prices are correct and that the reports they make to the FEA are accurate. Where non-compliance is detected, corrective action is instituted <em>by Agency auditors </em>after concurrence with the National office. General Guidelines, p. 2. Thus, these individuals clearly serve as an arm of law enforcement, and their Guidelines are exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Recent court decisions are in accord with an interpretation of the legislative history that would classify the documents requested by appellants as \u201claw enforcement matters.\u201d In <em>City of Concord v. Ambrose, </em>333 F.Supp. 958 (N.D.Cal.1971), where the plaintiffs sought access to the \u201ctexts used by the Bureau of Customs to train [its] law enforcement agents,\u201d Judge Wollenberg stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">The Senate Report reveals that the word \u201cadministrative\u201d was inserted by way of committee amendment, and its purpose was to limit the provision to those materials \u201cwhich pertain to administrative matters rather than to law enforcement matters\u201d to protect \u201cthe traditional confidential nature of instructions to Government personnel prosecuting violations of law in court, while permitting a public examination of the basis for administrative action.\u201d The House Report states the concept similarly: \u201cFurthermore, an agency may not be required to make available those portions of its staff manuals and instructions which set forth criteria or guidelines in auditing or inspection procedures, or * * * operational tactics * * * Under either report, the documents sought here would clearly fall within the excluded class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aly\"><em>Id. </em>at 959-60 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">Our disposition of the request in <em>Cuneo </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 484 F.2d 1086 (1973), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Rosen </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974), is consistent with the above interpretation of section 552 (a)(2)(C). <em>Cuneo </em>involved the non-public portions of a Defense Contract Audit Manual which set forth the selective spot-check procedures to be followed by some 3,000 auditors in auditing approximately 43,000 Defense Department contracts involving upwards of $50 billion. The confidential portions of the manual prescribed what was to be audited, how audits should be conducted, the frequency of audits, and the reliance to be placed on the internal controls of contractors. Publication of such information would greatly assist those who desired to conceal overcharges to the Government, and the trial court held that the agency\u2019s audit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>ing procedures need not be disclosed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The case was remanded so that the Government could attempt to \u201cjustify\u201d that the manual was exempt from disclosure under Exemptions (2) or (5)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as against appellant\u2019s contention that the undisclosed material constituted \u201csecret law\u201d of the agency. The implicit holding in <em>Cuneo </em>is thus that the \u201cgame plan\u201d for auditing Government contractors \u2014 to the extent that it does not involve secret law \u2014 may be withheld under Exemptions (2) or (5); otherwise, there would have been no necessity to remand the case. It is also significant, but not controlling on us, that appellant in <em>Cuneo </em>admitted that to the extent the Defense Contract Audit Manual set forth the \u201cgame plan\u201d for the audit and investigation of contractors, \u201cthe public is [not entitled] to it.\u201d 157 U.S.App.D.C. at 371 n.8, 484 F.2d at 1089 n.8. This is sufficient to dispose of the case since, as stated above, what is specifically exempted by one portion of a statute is not to be reincluded by other general provisions. The foregoing interpretation gains added force from the failure of the dissent to contest it. <em>Supra </em>nn.4, 5; of 192 U.S.App.D.C, 721 of 591 F.2d, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we find against appellants\u2019 principal contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">IV. THE THEORY BASED ON A GENERAL REQUIREMENT OF DISCLOSURE</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Appellants\u2019 \u201calternative\u201d theory (J.A. 6) relies not on characterizing the Guidelines as an \u201cadministrative staff manual,\u201d but on a <em>general </em>provision of the Freedom of Information Act which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request for records which (A) reasonably describes such records and (B) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEs4\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3) (Supp. V 1975). By the same principle of statutory construction referred to above, since both Houses of Congress specifically indicated in their Committee Reports that law enforcement matter such as is involved in this case should be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C), <em>it would be a mistake to interpret this latter general provision as requiring the disclosure of matter which the committee reports of both houses of Congress specifically indicated they intended to exempt from </em>disclosure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, once it is determined that the Guidelines meet the description of the exempt matter referred to in the Committee Reports with respect to subsection (a)(2), the nature of the <em>specific </em>Congressional intent indicated by both of those reports with respect to this matter should preclude appellants\u2019 claim on the theory that such matter must be disclosed under the <em>general </em>requirement of subsection (a)(3). Even though we need proceed no further in the consideration of appellants\u2019 alternative claim, we nevertheless choose to consider it more deeply so that the entire scheme of the Freedom of Information Act with respect to law enforcement matters may be properly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">A. <em>Appellants\u2019 Basic Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">The foundation of appellants\u2019 claim under its \u201cGeneral Requirement of Disclosure\u201d theory is the contention that the broad language of section (a)(3) requires disclosure of matter that the Committee Reports indicated was not required to be disclosed by section (a)(2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is beyond dispute that the Act is to be given a broad interpretation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>determining the documents that are subject to disclosure. <em>Department of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). In <em>Rose, </em>an opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan, the U. S. Air Force Academy was required to disclose the case records of cadets involved in a grade-cheating scandal. The decision denied the claim of the Academy that the requested material related solely to \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d protected from disclosure under Exemption 2 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In denying any exemption from disclosure for the cadets\u2019 case records, Justice Brennan reiterated our statement in <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 340, 343, 484 F.2d 820, 823 (1973) <em>(Vaughn I), </em>that \u201c \u2018[t]he policy of the Act requires that the disclosure requirements be construed broadly, the exemptions narrowly.\u2019 \u201d 425 U.S. at 366, 96 S.Ct. at 1601. This interpretation conforms to statements of Representative Moss, the principal House author of the Act, 112 Cong.Rec. 13654, and is certainly an important principle to be followed when construing the provisions of the Act. It should not, however, be so expansively applied as to render the specified exemptions practically meaningless. In <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>173 U.S.App.D.C. 187, 523 F.2d 1136 (1975) <em>(Vaughn II), </em>Judge Leventhal, concurring, found \u201cmore scope than the majority opinion contemplates for exemption 2.\u201d 173 U.S.App.D.C. at 198, 523 F.2d at 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The exemptions are a vital part of the Act and should be given effect. The Supreme Court has invoked them on numerous occasions. <em>See Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration v. Robertson, </em>422 U.S. 255, 95 S.Ct. 2140, 45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1975); <em>Renegotiation Board v. Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp., </em>421 U.S. 168, 95 S.Ct. 1491, 44 L.Ed.2d 57 (1975); <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975); <em>Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). <em>See also Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., </em>415 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 1028, 39 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974). During the floor debate in the House of Representatives, the exemptions received considerable emphasis. Indeed, the exemptions were felt by the Act\u2019s sponsors to be so integral a part of the legislation that they were emphasized by outlining their complete scope and effect on two separate occasions (112 Cong.Rec. 13645, 13655). Representative John E. Moss of California, who was Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee which handled the bill and who is generally recognized as one of the major forces that brought the Freedom of Information Act to fruition, and one of the leading authorities on the subject (112 Cong.Rec. 13643), also pointed to the \u201cexempt . . . categories\u201d as one of the \u201cthree major changes in the law.\u201d 112 Cong.Rec. 13642.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>B. <em>The Nature of Exemption 2, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><em>1. Legislative History. </em>\u2014 Exemption 2 was added to the Freedom of Information Act in 1966. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">(b) This section<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> does not apply to matters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ard\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) (1970), 81 Stat. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">When the 1966 amendments to the Act were progressing through Congress, somewhat different explanations of Exemption 2 were set forth in the respective Senate and House Reports. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary \u2014 which reported out the Senate bill, S. 1160, that was eventually enacted \u2014 stated in its report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">Exemption No. 2 relates only to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. Examples of these may be rules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agh\">S.Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (October 4, 1965). This was all the direct comment in the Senate Report on that exemption. The subsequent House Report on the Senate bill, filed during the next session of the 89th Congress, was more detailed as to the intent of Exemption 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">2. Matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency: Operating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners would be exempt from disclosure, but this exemption would not cover all \u2018matters of internal management\u2019 such as employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures which are withheld under the present law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">H.R.Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (May 9, 1966), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 2427 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-17\">Examining the language of Exemption 2 and the Senate and House Committee Reports thereon, we conclude \u2014 as seems logical \u2014 that Congress did not intend to repeat itself in referring to \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ascribing this intent to Congress would result in the <em>practices </em>of an agency including its \u201cinternal . . . rules.\u201d Thus, if \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cinternal personnel\u201d were construed to also modify \u201cpractices of an agency,\u201d the phrasing of Exemption 2 would be largely redundant. We believe that the two phrases should be read to refer separately to (1) internal personnel rules and (2) practices of an agency and to have the limited intent ascribed to them by both the House and Senate Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-19\">The legislative history also clearly suggests that the Congress intended to ascribe an independent meaning to the phrase \u201cpractices of an agency.\u201d Seventeen House bills were introduced, ten of them on the same date as S. 1160, 111 Cong.Rec. 2780, 2946 (Feb. 17, 1965). Each contained an identical exemption for matters that are . (2) \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-20\">The House hearings on the bills opened on March 30, 1965, six weeks before the Senate hearings began on May 14th, and some six months before the Senate Committee Report was filed on October 4, 1965. When a question was raised on the opening day of the House hearings as to the intent of the language that became Exemption 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Representative John E. Moss, Chairman of the House Subcommittee, see 112 Cong.Rec. 13640-46 (1966), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-4\">What [Exemption 2] was intended to cover was instances such as the manuals of procedure that are handed to an examiner \u2014 a bank examiner, or a savings and loan examiner, or the guidelines given to an FBI agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><em>House Hearings, supra </em>at 29. Representative Moss\u2019s comments are supportive of a congressional intent to read the two phrases with a large degree of independence from each other. \u201c[IJnternal <em>personnel </em>rules\u201d refers more to employee relations between the agency and its employees, while \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d refers more to the conduct of the employees in discharging the regulatory duties of the agency \u2014 in this case, enforcing the law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">If the Senate Report stood alone, one might offhandedly conclude that no significant difference should be drawn between the references in Exemption 2 to \u201cpractices\u201d as distinguished from \u201crules.\u201d Placing exclusive reliance on the Senate Report for the meaning of the entire exemption, however, would be misguided. The Senate Report does <em>not </em>attempt to cover the <em>entire </em>scope of Exemption 2. It makes no reference at all to \u201cpractices,\u201d but limits its comment to \u201crules\u201d; it does not even purport to give a complete explanation of the \u201crules\u201d exemption but only cites a <em>few \u201cexamples,\u201d i. e., </em>\u201c[ejxamples of these may be <em>rules </em>as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">The House Committee, on the other hand, dealt further with the exemption and provided a more complete explanation, though limited, of the meaning of \u201cpractices of an agency.\u201d Its report does not deal solely with <em>\u201cpersonnel </em>rules\u201d but in obvious reference to the \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d states that \u201c[ojperating rules,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> guidelines and manuals of procedure for government investigators or examiners would be exempt from this disclosure.\u201d House Report, <em>supra </em>at 15. Read closely, the House Report merely supplements the Senate Report by specifically limiting the exemptions Congress intended to make by the statute. The House Report does not <em>conflict </em>with the Senate Report (except in one minor aspect not relevant to this case). <em>See </em>note 16 <em>supra. </em>The Senate Report refers only to the \u201crules\u201d portion of Exemption 2. The House Report, on the other hand, refers both to the \u201crules\u201d and to the \u201cpractices\u201d elements of the exemption. Since the Senate Report does not purport to deal with the \u201cpractices\u201d portion of the subsection, the two reports are not contradictory on the only phase of the exemption that is applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ble here.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The intent expressed in the House Report is, therefore, controlling on the only application of the phase of the exemption with which we are here concerned. Excluding completely the House Report from any consideration and deeming the Senate Report controlling on the grounds that the House Report is contradicted by the Senate Report and that the latter was the only report before both Houses of Congress, would rest upon inaccurate perceptions of the legislative history of Exemption 2, which devolves from the explanations given by the respective Committee Reports, and from congressional practices in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The 1966 bills to amend the Freedom of Information Act were introduced in the House and the Senate on the <em>same day, </em>and the exemptions provided in these bills were practically identical. <em>See </em>text at - of 192 U.S.App.D.C, at 721 of 591 F.2d, <em>supra. </em>This indicates that the principal sponsors in both houses were in agreement, prior to the introduction of the bills, upon the proposed rewriting of the \u201cexemptions\u201d as set forth in the respective bills \u2014 and as they were finally enacted. Even if the fact that the Senate Report was issued before that of the House entitles it to any superior influence, such precedence would be offset by the fact that the specific wording of the bill was generated by sources in both Houses prior to the introduction of the bills and thus prior to the drafting of either Committee Report. In view of such joint authorship, it would be hard to conclude that Representative Moss was not expressing the joint intent of the other principal sponsor (Senator Long of Missouri in the Senate, 112 Cong.Rec. 13642) when he stated at the <em>first </em>hearing on March 30, 1965 \u201c[w]hat [Exemption 2] was intended to cover.\u201d House Hearings, <em>supra </em>at 29, quoted in text at --- of 192 U.S.App.D.C, at 724 of 591 F.2d, <em>supra. </em>The long-time participation of Representative Moss in this field of legislation also commands considerable if not controlling deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Reading the statute \u2014 as one must \u2014 in light of both the House and Senate Reports, we conclude that those who drafted the exemption intended the two phrases \u201cinternal personnel rules\u201d and \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d to have some disjunctive intendment, otherwise they would not have included both phrases. Although it is possible to read Exemption 2 as distinguishing \u201cinternal . . . practices of an agency\u201d from \u201cexternal\u201d practices, and thus bringing only \u201cinternal\u201d directions to the staff within the exemption, reading the phrases partially in the disjunctive gives the fullest effect possible to both Committee Reports and therefore should be preferred. Under this reading, even rules concededly having some \u201cexternal\u201d significance, and not related to \u201cpersonnel\u201d, could still be included within the exemption to the extent that they could be classified as \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d as referred to in the House Report. The dissent admits \u201cit is conceivable that \u2018personnel\u2019 applies only to \u2018rules.\u2019 \u201d Dissent at - of 192 U.S.App.D.C, at 742 of 591 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number><em>2. The Charge of Improper Congressional Conduct. </em>\u2014 The dissent charges the House Committee (which was spearheaded by Representative Moss) with \u201cchicanery\u201d in attempting to inject false legislative history into the Senate bill through the House Committee Report. Responses to that charge will not be made except as it relates to this bill. The record here shows that there was no \u201cchicanery\u201d in the House Report as to Exemption 2 and the dissent does not charge \u201cchicanery\u201d with respect to any other provision of the Act that is here relevant. When the bill reached the House from the Senate, the Senate Committee Report on Exemption 2 only gave a few \u201c[ejxamples\u201d of the types of <em>\u201crules\" </em>it was <em>exempting from disclosure. </em>It never referred to the \u201cpractices of an agency.\u201d Thus, if no further explanation of Exemption 2 were given the \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d would be wide open to be given their normal meaning and that would constitute a very <em>broad exemption. </em>It might even be deemed to cover \u201cmatters of internal management,\u201d but as the dissent states at - of 192 U.S.App.D.C, at 742 of 591 F.2d, one of the principal purposes of the bill was to repeal the internal management exemption which was a feature of the then existing law. \u201cPractices of an agency\u201d would also cover <em>investigatory practices </em>and many other practices and <em>all practices </em>would be exempt from disclosure unless some limitation were placed on the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Thus, because the Senate Committee Report left the \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d part of the Exemption open to a very broad interpretation, which admittedly none of the authors ever intended, the House Committee Report severely and specifically limited the breadth of the Exemption to <em>investigatory manuals </em>and further <em>restricted </em>the Exemption by providing that specific \u201cmatters of internal management\u201d such as \u201cemployee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures\u201d <em>must be disclosed. </em>The dissent mistakenly views this House action as broadening the Exemption (Dissent at - of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at 744 of 591 F.2d). In reality the House Report closed a big loophole. With respect to investigatory manuals it did nothing more than state the precise intent elsewhere stated by the Committee Reports in both the Senate and House with respect to administrative staff manuals <em>(supra </em>at-of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at 719 of 591 F.2d). And as to \u201cmatters of internal management\u201d there is no disagreement that both Houses intended to repeal that existing statutory exemption. <em>See </em>Dissent at - of 192 U.S.App.D.C. at 742 of 591 F.2d. Thus, the House Report did a more workmanlike job in setting forth the admitted intent of both Houses on this Exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">As to the charge of \u201cchicanery\u201d with respect to Exemption 2 the <em>record </em>completely belies the accusation and since the dissent did not extend the charge to any other feature relevant to this lawsuit, it is unnecessary to consider the charge in any other respect. We say the record here belies the charge for several reasons. First, Congressman Moss, the principal House author of the bill, stated <em>publicly </em>on the very first day of the House hearings, March 30, 1965, that the intent of Exemption 2 was to exempt \u201cmanuals of procedure [for] . examinerfs].\u201d <em>supra </em>at of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at 723 of 591 F.2d, dissent at-of - U.S.App.D.C, at 743 of 591 F.2d. Second, Congressman Moss publicly declared at the same time that he would \u201chope to see a way of doing the job [exempting examiners\u2019 manuals] without exempting internal rules and practices.\u201d In the same vein Congressman Moss added, \u201cwe are perfectly willing to work at it.\u201d House Hearings, <em>supra </em>at 29-30. Third, the Senate hearings did not begin until May 14th, some six weeks later, and the Senate Committee Report was not filed until October 4, 1965. Thus, no person can contend that something deceitful was being done with respect to Exemption 2 when the House did precisely what the principal author of the bill publicly stated they intended to \u201cwork at.\u201d Nor can it be contended that the Senate did not have ample opportunity to be informed of the House position. Fourth, the charge that there was some sinister <em>\u201clast minute chicanery </em>by interest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>ed members of the House . . . just as the full committee in the House was about to report out the bill. . . (Dissent at --- of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at 746 of 591 F.2d, emphasis added), is flawed by the fact that committee reports are usually prepared at that stage in a bill\u2019s passage. In view of the public statement of Congressman Moss made on March 30, 1965, over 13 months before the House Committee Report was filed on May 9, 1966 (H.Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess.), it cannot be contended that that portion of the report dealing with Exemption 2 constituted <em>\u201clast minute chicanery\u201d </em>\u2014 and refuting that charge is all that concerns us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\"><em>S. Alternative Interpretive Approaches. </em>\u2014Thus far, we have demonstrated that the House and Senate Reports do not conflict with each other, at least with respect to the portion of Exemption 2 with which we are concerned in this case. However, <em>even if </em>it were true that the Reports did conflict in their relevant parts, we would still be unable to accept appellants\u2019 argument that disclosure is required. One interpretive approach considers the timing of the publication of the relevant reports. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that temporal priority in public declaration and publication is a factor to be considered in determining which sources of legislative history should be given precedence, Rep. Moss\u2019s interpretation of Exemption 2 would be controlling, as his public statement as to the scope of the exemption was made on March 30, 1965, while the Senate Report was not published until October 4, 1965, over six months later. It could just as easily be said that the statement of Representative Moss, reproduced in the House hearings, was before both Houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Even conceding that the statement in the Senate Report was the first committee expression of the meaning of Exemption 2 <em>and </em>that the Senate Report <em>conflicted </em>with the House Report, temporal priority in publication would not normally entitle the Senate Report to be considered as controlling <em>congressional </em>intent, short of some adoption of the Senate Committee Report during consideration of the bill in the House. We have been unable to find any such adoption in the House proceedings. Contending that the Senate Reports should control on the facts of this case also misapprehends normal congressional procedure. Under settled congressional procedure, each House is a semi-autonomous body that legislates independently of the views of the other chamber. Reference may <em>not </em>be made to Senate debates in the House, and vice versa:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\">It is a breach of order in debate to notice what has been said on the same subject in the other House, or the particular votes or majorities on it there; because the opinion of each House should be left to its own independency, not to be influenced by the proceedings of the other; and the quoting them might beget reflections leading to a misunderstanding between the two Houses. 8 Grey, 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Jefferson\u2019s Manual [\u00a7 371] and the Rules of the House of Representatives, 95th Cong. 176 (1977).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The rule, which was the same in the 89th Congress, indicates the extent to which each House maintains its independence from the other. It is foreign to the normal practices and customs of either House to legislate on the basis of a printed report of the other House when it has a printed report of its own, and there is no indication in the legislative record of this bill that reference was made in the House proceedings to the Senate Report or that the latter was actually \u201cbefore both houses <em>fl</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">The suggested alternative interpretive approaches do not help us here. When the House Report is not in conflict with the Senate Report, but rather covers a phase of the bill not mentioned by the Senate, the House Report should be relied upon to that extent. This renders inapplicable the dissent\u2019s references to the treatise of Professor Davis, dissent, - of 192 U.S.App.D.C., 747 of 591 F.2d, because the two reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>are <em>not </em>contradictory so far as their relevance to this case is concerned. <em>If the two reports were contradictory upon a certain point, and no other circumstance existed for relying on one over the other, neither could be relied upon as expressing the legislative intent of Congress as all legislation requires the joint concurrence of both Houses. </em>However, since the House Report was written later, it is actually a more complete expression of congressional intent than the Senate Report. The House Committee had an opportunity to review the inadequacies of the Senate Report and to remedy its omissions. In explaining the practices that were to be exempted, the House addressed in detail matters to which the Senate had given only limited attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><em>4. Case Law Guidance. </em>\u2014 Even if it were decided that the House and Senate Reports were in conflict, and if, given that ambiguity in the legislative intent, one should turn to judicial interpretations in attempting to discern the Congressional purpose, in no case would the purpose of the Act be seen to support appellants\u2019 demand for disclosure.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Rose, supra, </em>Justice Brennan left open the question whether Exemption 2 required agencies to disclose their auditing and inspection guidelines:<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8m\">Those cases relying on the House, rather than the Senate, interpretation of Exemption 2, and permitting agency withholding of matters of some public interest, have done so only where necessary to prevent the circumvention of agency regulations that might result from disclosure to the subjects of regulation of the procedural manuals and guidelines used by the agency in discharging its regulatory function. <em>See, e. g., Tietze v. Richardson, </em>342 F.Supp. 610 (S.D.Tex.1972); <em>Cuneo </em>v. <em>Laird, </em>338 F.Supp. 504 (D.C.1972), rev\u2019d on other grounds, <em>sub nom. Cuneo v. Schlesinger, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 484 F.2d 1086 (1973); <em>City of Concord v. Ambrose, </em>333 F.Supp. 958 (N.D.Cal.1971) (dictum). Moreover, the legislative history indicates that this was the primary concern of the committee drafting the House Report. See Hearings on H.R. 5012 before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 29-30 (1965), cited in H.R.Rep. No. 1497, p. 10 n.14. <em>We need not consider in this case the applicability of Exemption 2 in such circumstances, however, because, as the Court of Appeals recognized this is not a case \u201cwhere knowledge of administrative procedures might help outsiders to circumvent regulations or standards. . . . \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">425 U.S. at 364, 96 S.Ct. at 1600 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">The manuals and guidelines requested by appellants consist of agency directions to the auditors of the FEA and thus contain \u201cknowledge of administrative procedures [that] might help outsiders to circumvent regulations or standards\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> of the Agency. In another remark in <em>Rose </em>Justice Brennan also indicated that Exemption 2 might apply where disclosure would risk circumvention of agency regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>In sum, we think that, <em>at least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation, </em>Exemption 2 is not applicable to matters subject to such a genuine and significant public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">425 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 1603 (emphasis added). It is therefore clear that <em>Rose </em>leaves unresolved the issue before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Indeed, more than merely leaving the issue in this case unresolved, <em>Rose, </em>if anything, lends support toward the holding we reach today. We conclude above that assuming the Senate Report conflicts with the House Report and assuming that the statement in the Senate Report was the first congressional expression of the meaning of Exemption 2, the fact that the Senate Report was published first would not normally entitle it to be considered as controlling congressional intent, absent some sort of adoption of it during consideration of the bill in the House. <em>Rose </em>is consistent with this conclusion: the Court, quoting with approval from <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>supra, referred to the commentary of Professor Davis, stating that \u201c[t]he content of the law must depend upon the intent of both Houses, not of just one.\u201d 425 U.S. at 366, 96 S.Ct. at 1601.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Recognizing the requirement for the concurrence of both Houses in discerning the law\u2019s content, Justice Brennan stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">For the reasons stated by Judge Wilkey [in <em>Vaughn v. </em>Rosen], <em>and </em>because we think the <em>primary focus of the House Report </em>was on exemption of disclosures that might enable the regulated to circumvent agency regulations, we too \u201cchoose to rely upon the Senate Report\u201d <em>in this regard.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">425 U.S. at 366-67, 96 S.Ct. at 1601 (emphasis added). This statement, which is basic to the holding in the case, contains Justice Brennan\u2019s reasons for relying upon the Senate Report <em>in this regard, </em>meaning in regard to both the Evaluations by the Civil Service Commission at issue in <em>Vaughn </em>and the personnel case summaries in <em>Rose: </em>The Senate Report was available to both Houses, <em>and </em>the Senate Report was not in conflict with the <em>\u201cprimary focus </em>of the House Report.\u201d Of course, if the two Reports had been in conflict, the dual concurrence necessary for an ascertainable legislative intent would not have been present as Justice Brennan reasoned in <em>Rose.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In other words, the Senate Report in <em>Rose </em>did not support an interpretation that the cadets\u2019 personal case summaries were within the \u201cinternal personnel rules\u201d exemption, and this construction was <em>not </em>contradicted by the \u201cprimary focus of the House Report.\u201d Thus, far from ignoring the 'intent expressed by the House Report that \u201cdisclosures that might enable the regulated to circumvent agency regulation\u201d were within Exemption 2, <em>Rose </em>lends weight toward the view that the House Report should be accorded some significance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">In this connection, it should also be noted what <em>Rose </em>does <em>not </em>hold. It does not hold that a Congressional committee report, prepared by the House initiating a bill that eventually becomes law without being returned to the initiating body, is controlling as to legislative intent solely because it was available to both Houses. Nor does <em>Rose </em>hold that the first Committee Report is prima facie controlling in its entirety if the bill is not returned to the House where the bill was first passed. Nor does it hold that a Committee Report need be passed upon by the other House in order to be held as reflective of Congressional intent: if that were the rule, the Committee Report of the second House would <em>never </em>be reflective of Congressional intent where the bill was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>returned to the House where it was introduced. <em>Rose </em>does not restrict our ability to analyze legislative history in any of these respects. Thus, in circumstances like those presented in this case, the second report may be relied upon to reflect legislative intent because each House acts <em>independently, </em>and, if any Committee Report is not helpful, the dual intent of both Houses can be garnered from the action of the other House from the language of the bill itself, from floor debates, from the hearings, from prior legislation, from an analysis of the mischief sought to be recorded, from other provisions of the bill, and from other manifestations of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Yet the primary importance of <em>Rose </em>for this case is its holding that the Court is free to rely upon the intent expressed by the Committee that first processed the bill through a House, because the intent expressed in the <em>first report </em>was <em>not contradicted </em>by the \u201cprimary focus\u201d of the report of the second Committee on the <em>particular </em>issue before the Court. Thus, <em>Rose </em>allows us to rely upon the 1966 House Report for matters of legislative intent with respect both to Exemption 2 and to other parts of the bill to the extent that the intent therein expressed is not contradicted by the Senate Report or is not unreliable for other reasons. The earlier quoted statement of Justice Brennan has special significance concerning the commentary of the House Report on the law enforcement guidelines: it is a particularly clear expression that <em>Rose </em>left open the issue as to the effect of Exemption 2 on law enforcement guidelines, where (as is the situation in this ease) \u201cdisclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Thus, it can be concluded that Justice Brennan in <em>Rose </em>would hold that the two reports here in question were <em>focusing </em>on two statements of Congressional intent that were not in conflict. Justice Brennan did not hold that the <em>contradicted </em>intent of only one House controlled solely because it was available to both Houses. This conclusion is relevant here. The intent expressed in each Report, with a minor exception, can be given its full effect without infringing on the other. Most importantly, there is nothing in the language of the 1965 Senate Report that would exclude law enforcement guidelines from the exemption; hence, neither is our decision in conflict with <em>Vaughn v. Rosen </em>or <em>Rose </em>nor does it seek to reverse those decisions. This case simply involves a different phase of the statute and of Exemption 2 than that which was ruled upon in <em>Vaughn </em>or <em>Rose, </em>as Justice Brennan pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\"><em>5. Policy Considerations. </em>\u2014 Not only does the language of Exemption 2, which protects the \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d to the extent expressed in the House Report and to the extent that secret law is not involved, indicate that agency manuals covering the <em>operational </em>practices of its auditors and investigators are meant to be exempt from disclosure, as the House Committee Report states, but normal policy considerations also require that such documents remain confidential. Why should an employee who seeks to embezzle money from a bank be given access to the examiner\u2019s special instructions for auditing his type of bank so that he can discover how to disguise his defalcations? The same situation can be posited with all auditing and investigation manuals utilized in investigating compliance with federal law. To turn such manuals over to those who are the subject of regulatory supervision is to dig a den for the fox inside the chicken coop. These manuals clearly set forth agency <em>practice </em>and procedures in law enforcement and it would be absurd to attribute to Congress an intent to require such documents to be disclosed to those whose compliance with the law is being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\"><em>6. Summary. </em>\u2014 Judicial precedent and legislative history both support the view that the documents requested by appellants need not be disclosed under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The guidelines that are requested plainly fall within the language of Exemption 2 to that Act. They set forth special <em>\u201cpractices of an agency\u201d </em>(emphasis added) that direct auditors of the Energy Administration in the manner of executing audits of publicly reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ulated refinery companies. Given that the purpose of these audits is to aid in investigations designed to enforce the law, the documents requested are in fact <em>\u201claw enforcement guidelines\u201d </em>for Government investigators and examiners which are specifically protected from disclosure, rather than <em>\u201cadministrative </em>staff manuals\u201d (emphasis added) which must be revealed under section 552(a)(2)(C) or under the general requirement for disclosure.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">V. THE SCHEME OF THE OTHER EXEMPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AlW\">We have thus far concluded that the Freedom of Information Act must be interpreted as exempting from disclosure staff manuals and instructions insofar as they constitute law enforcement matters which set forth criteria or guidelines for the performance of audits or investigations in connection with matters involving compliance with the laws and rules administered by the Federal Energy Administration. We have based this conclusion primarily on a careful analysis of the language of the statute and the corresponding Congressional intent. Our conclusion is buttressed by that fact that it is consistent with the general scheme of other exemptions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">A. <em>The Effect of Exemption </em>7 <em>on the Interpretation of Exemption 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"A86\">Strong support for interpreting Exemption 2 as excluding \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d is also found in the provisions of Exemption 7. The relevant subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">(b) This section does not apply to matters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-11\">(7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would [inter alia] (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings, . (E) <em>disclose investigative techniques and procedures . . </em>. ,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) (Supp. V, 1975) (emphasis added). Since this portion of the statute <em>exempts </em>investigatory records from disclosure where their disclosure would help those who are subject to agency regulation to discover <em>investigative techniques and procedures, </em>it would be unreasonable to hold that Congress did not also intend by Exemption 2 to exempt the investigatory staff manuals insofar as they explicitly set out these <em>same </em>investigative techniques and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Exemption 2 would be inconsistent with the adoption of Exemption 7 if the former exemption is construed to require the disclosure of matter related to \u201claw enforcement purposes [that would lead to the disclosure of] investigative techniques and procedures.\u201d It would be absurd to find that Congress intended to exempt such matter from disclosure by one provision of the statute and require its disclosure by another. Indeed, from the very beginning, Congress indicated its concern that the Freedom of Information Act not impede enforcement of the criminal laws. This is particularly evident in Exemption 7. Yet since the Act constitutes an entire <em>scheme, </em>it would be improvident to interpret one exemption, such as Exemption 2, in a manner that authorizes disclosure not contemplated by the <em>scheme </em>of the Act. The various parts of a statute should, if possible, be harmonized so as to provide throughout for a consistent interpretation. <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>302 U.S. 540, 547, 58 S.Ct. 353, 82 L.Ed. 413 (1938); <em>New Lamp Chimney Co. v. Ansonia Brass &amp; Copper Co., </em>91 U.S. 656, 663, 23 L.Ed. 336 (1876); <em>Perrine v. Chesapeake &amp; D. Canal Co., </em>50 U.S. 172, 187, 13 L.Ed. 92 (1850). We thus refuse to interpret Exemption 2 as requiring the disclosure of matter that it is the objective of Exemption 7 to protect.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">B. <em>Intra-Agency \u201cMemoranda\u201d and Exemption 5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">An additional basis for not requiring disclosure is set forth in Exemption 5 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-12\">(b) This section does not apply to matters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-13\">$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-14\">(5) inter-agency or <em>intra-agency memorandums </em>or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP2\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">The basic purpose of this provision is to exempt from disclosure the internal communications of an agency in order to protect its deliberative processes.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the exemption protects from disclosure those documents which would not be routinely available to a party in litigation with an agency through civil discovery procedures. <em>Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 85-86, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). Documents normally privileged in the civil discovery context need not be disclosed. <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 149, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975). As discussed in <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>one purpose of the exemption is to prevent injury to the quality of agency decisions and another is to protect the \u201cwork-product privileges\u201d generally available in the attorney-client context to all litigants, 421 U.S. at 149, 95 S.Ct. 1504. The Court has stated that the quality of a decision is not impaired by disclosures made after the decision which are designed to explain it; however, the Court has indicated that the disclosure of predecisional communications can impair the deliberative process by inhibiting discussion by policymakers and their advisors. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, </em>at 151-2, 95 S.Ct. 1504; <em>Mink, supra, </em>410 U.S. at 87-89, 93 S.Ct. 827. The same can be said with respect to the instructions given to auditors for predecisional audits and investigations where the audits are conducted preliminarily to the making of law enforcement decisions. As Judge McGowan stated in <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Federal Open Market Committee, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 203, 211, 565 F.2d 778, 786 (1977), \u201c[e]fficient fact-gathering is an essential first step in the decisionmaking process.\u201d To disclose the agency\u2019s auditing and investigatory guidelines to those regulated companies that are to be audited and investigated would interfere with the ability to gather correct factual information and, by forcing those engaged in the deliberative process to base their decisions on investigatory records in which vital incriminating facts may be concealed because of prior warning, would undercut efficient law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Applying these principles, the Supreme Court held in <em>Renegotiation Board v. Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp., </em>421 U.S. 168, 184, 95 S.Ct. 1491, 44 L.Ed.2d 57 (1975), that certain documents gathered by a Regional Board and its \u201cdivisions,\u201d which had the duty under the Renegotiation Act of 1951 of determining whether certain government contractors have earned and must refund excessive profits on their government contracts, constitute pre-decisional consultative memoranda exempt from disclosure by Exemption 5. These documents contained data germane to the question of whether statutory requirements for recoupment of excess profits should be imposed against government contractors in particular instances. Since such pre-deeisional consultative memoranda are exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5 as \u201cintra-agency memoranda,\u201d the instructions to auditors and investigators for their preparation of similar factual data to be used in determining law enforcement in all cases should likewise be exempt on the same theory, <em>i. e., </em>that the data is collected prior to the agency reaching a decision as to the compliance of the investigated party with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Of course, as we noted earlier, to the extent that any of these instructions contain \u201csecret law,\u201d they must be disclosed (Op. at ------ of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at 718 of 591 F.2d). But these Guidelines concern the methodology for predecisional fact-gathering, which is one of the \u201cingredients of the decision-making process\u201d and which should similarly be exempt from disclosure. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 422, 61 S.Ct. 999, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941); <em>Morgan v. United States, </em>304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 999, 82 L.Ed. 1129 (1938). Thus, while the language of Exemption 5 should not be applied to all memoranda, it definitely does include executive memoranda which constitute instructions to investigators for discovering facts as to whether regulated par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ties are complying with the law that the agency is charged to enforce.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Whether the agency materials take the form of a memorandum, letter, bulletin, or some other kind of internal communication which may embody a compilation of intraagency memoranda in a manual, would seem to be immaterial. Certainly any form of intra-agency communication \u2014 excluding, of course, directions as to agency law \u2014 that discloses investigatory strategy or operational tactics related to law enforcement should be exempt from disclosure if the agency is to function efficiently.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> While smaller agencies may be able to instruct their auditors by memoranda and letters, larger agencies find it more convenient to set forth their instructive guidelines in manuals. We are unable to perceive any significant difference between \u201cmanuals\u201d and \u201cmemoranda\u201d that contain guidelines and instructions for law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Moreover, we have, as did the trial judge, closely examined <em>in camera </em>the matters requested by appellants. We note that the matter comprises a loose-leaf compilation, the periodic supplementation of which is clearly contemplated, and that over one-third of the documents requested were originally released to the staff as \u201cmemoranda\u201d and still bear such title. We therefore find that the Guidelines here in question meet the basic requirement of being internal staff communications and are exempt from disclosure not only under Exemption 2, but also under the limited congressional intent expressed by Exemption 5 as \u201cintra-agency memoranda,\u201d <em>City of Concord v. Ambrose, supra, </em>333 F.Supp. at 960-61, prepared as the initial step in the deliberative process of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">VI. THE GOVERNMENT IN THE SUNSHINE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">It is contended by the dissent<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> that the recent enactment of the Government in the Sunshine Act (hereafter, Sunshine Act), P.L. 94-409, Act of September 13, 1976, 90 Stat. 1241 <em>et seq., </em>supports the construction by the dissent of Exemption 2 in the Freedom of Information Act. The claim is that the language of Exemption 2 in the Freedom of Information Act and the Committee Report on that subsection of the Sunshine Act is allegedly supportive of the construction that the dissent argues for here.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The Committee\u2019s report states <em>generally </em>that \u201cmanuals or directives setting forth job <em>functions </em>or <em>procedures\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(emphasis added) are not exempt from disclosure. Even if this provision were to be held to be controlling it must be noted that the special investigatory guidelines and memoranda instructions for auditing refineries are not to be considered as <em>\u201cjob </em>functions or procedures.\u201d They are <em>special </em>investigatory instructions dealing with a special audit. For example, the job function is to audit refineries to determine whether they are complying with the law and the regulations in computing their prices. The special investigation instructions required by a shortage of personnel may be to conduct only certain spot checks and certain random sampling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>and possibly ignore travel expense statements except for principal executives. The former functions are disclosable, the latter instructions are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">But a more important reason exists for Congress not giving Exemption 2 in the Sunshine Act a more expansive intendment as it did in the FOIA. This is because Exemption 7 of the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(7), specifically provides that the requirement that \u201cevery portion of every meeting of an agency shall be open to public observation,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b, does not require any agency to\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">(7) disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, <em>or information which if written would be contained in such records, </em>but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings, <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(7). Thus, Congress in the Sunshine Act writes in practically the same exemption that it did in the Freedom of Information Act but it does it in a different manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-23\">In addition the Sunshine Act carrying out the same intent for other agencies has a specific exemption for information related to examination of financial institutions (Exemption 8) and \u201cinformation [related to the markets or financial institutions] the premature disclosure of which would \u2014 . be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action.\u201d (Exemption 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-24\">The foregoing should be sufficient to disprove the suggested relevancy of the Sunshine Act to this case. One involves \u201cmeetings\u201d and the other primarily documents. Where they have some overlapping objectives we see that neither was unmindful of the special status that should be afforded to matter relating to \u201cinvestigatory\u201d instructions. Thus, the Sunshine Act does not cloud up the Freedom of Information Act.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>VII. MODIFICATION OF THE DISTRICT COURT ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">It was heretofore noted that the trial court (Flannery, J.) ordered the disclosure of certain designated parts of the requested matter. We have checked the court\u2019s order against all the requested matter and we affirm the disclosure it directs. However, there are two additional items that, while their required disclosure might be more doubtful, because we perceive they <em>partially </em>include instructions as to agency law, we conclude should be disclosed. These two items are:</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Guidelines for Audit Modules:</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">(a) G-II-h. Revised February 1975</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">(b) C-II-c, (4) March 21, 1975</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">Our judgment will accordingly direct the court to add these two items to the matter to be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">The Freedom of Information Act requires the disclosure of all agency matter necessary for any person to deal with the agency (such as secret law), but must be interpreted as exempting from disclosure those staff manuals and instructions insofar as they are law enforcement matters which set forth criteria or guidelines for the performance of audits or investigations in connection with matters involving compliance with the laws and rules administered by the Federal Energy Administration. The Agency, however, may release any of such material if it considers it to be in the public interest to do so.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>For the foregoing reasons we affirm the judgment of the District Court with the single modification indicated in Part VII, supra.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-8\">. <em>See </em>text of statute at p. - of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at p. 721 of 591 F.2d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">.

Appellants admitted that \u201claw enforcement material whose disclosure would significantly impede detection or prosecution of law violators\u201d is not required to be dislosed\u201d (J.A. 14). The FEA decision stated that \u201cthe materials [Guidelines] specify various methods of investigating the accuracy of the data contained in reports which refiners are required to submit to the FEA in support of the propriety of prices charged for covered products . . . under the FEA Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations\u201d (J.A. 17). This is obviously an instruction relating to law enforcement. In its Statement of Material Facts as to which there is no genuine issue, the agency described the Guidelines and their use by the FEA Office of Compliance; the specific statement is made that, \u201cthe contents of the Guidelines show how to test for compliance, not how to achieve compliance\u201d and \u201cNothing in the Guidelines explains or interprets the regulations or sets forth legal standards not otherwise published\u201d (J.A. 34, 35). Appellants, not having examined the document, did not agree with the agency\u2019s Statement (J.A. 36), but the trial court had the Guidelines before it and made an <em>in camera </em>inspection. Its judgment found part to be exempt and required part to be disclosed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-25\">[I]t appears to the court that the FEA \u201cRefinery Audit Review Guidelines\u201d and \u201cGuidelines for Audit Modules\u201d describe investigatory strategy and, to that extent, are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2), and it further appears that portions of the Guidelines express interpretations of applicable regulations and must be disclosed.

This is the common intendment of people in writing and conversing, and is recognized in the application of provisos and special statutes over general statements and laws.

Whether \u201coperating rules, guidelines and manuals of procedure\u201d are all restricted to \u201cgovernment investigators [and] examiners\u201d need not be decided as we are only concerned here with \u201cinvestigators and examiners\u201d and it is clear that their manuals are covered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">.

The original statutory provision providing the public with some access to Government information was contained in \u00a7 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act (Public Law 404, June 11, 1946, 60 Stat. 238). However, there were several conditions that greatly inhibited disclosure and these were fully disclosed in the Moss hearings (1955-58). Congress finally, by Public Law 89-487, July 4, 1966, 80 Stat. 250, broadened the disclosure provisions and included an exemption section which closely paralleled the present law. Further amendments were made the next year by Public Law 90-253, June 5, 1967, 81 Stat. 54-55.

Certain disjointed points in the dissent are commented upon as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">1. Much of the dissent is based upon the constant reiteration that disclosure is the general rule and that exemptions are to be narrowly construed. Dissent at -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at 738, 739, 740, 742, 744, 746, 749, of 591 F.2d. This.is correct but it does not justify ignoring the expressed intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">2. Specific disagreement is noted as to the statement in the dissent that it \u201cis immaterial under the FOIA . . . that the documents would be \u2018useful only for the purpose of evading regulation . . . Dissent,-- of 192 U.S.App.D.C., 738 of 591 F.2d. Also, in stating that matter can <em>only </em>be exempted from disclosure by one of the nine exemptions, the dissent overlooks the fact that Congress otherwise specifically indicated an intent to <em>not cover </em>law enforcement matters including auditing instructions. <em>Supra, </em>at -, - of 192 U.S.App.D.C., p. 719 of 591 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-20\">3. It is correct, as the dissent states at - of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at p. 738 of 591 F.2d that applicants need not state their purpose, but when this is known it may constitute positive proof, as here, that the intent of the act would be violated by compelling disclosure. In other words, that exemption from disclosure would be consistent with the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-25\">4. When the District Court stated that the public does not have a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d in the requested disclosure it was merely saying that the disclosure sought by appellant would accomplish a result that the law intended to prohibit. <em>Cf. </em>dissent at -, - of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at pp. 738, 739 of 591 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-28\">5. The attack the dissent makes on the trial court applying a \u201cbalancing\u201d test, id, -\u2014 of - U.S.App.D.C., 739 of 591 F.2d, has no relevance to the majority opinion which bases its exclusion from disclosure on the expressed intent of Congress. The \u201cbest interests of this country\u201d (Id., - of 192 U.S.App.D.C., 739 of 591 F.2d) need not be ignored if that is consistent with congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-33\">6. In text at - of 192 U.S.App.D.C., at 723 of 591 F.2d and in footnotes 23, 24 and 25 the dissent contends that three witnesses before the Senate Sub-Committee expressed the opinion that the bill did not protect investigative manuals and that some change would be required in the bill if that result was intended. However, these opinions were expressed at the sub-committee hearings on May 12, 14 and 21, 1965 long <em>before </em>the Senate Committee Report of October 4, 1965 stated the congressional intent to be that \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d were to be protected from disclosure. Appellants also admit that \u201claw enforcement material whose disclosure would significantly impede detection or prosecution of law violators\u201d is not required to be disclosed (J.A. 14, and n.3, supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>7. In its point II the dissent <em>(Id. </em>of 192 U.S.App.D.C., 740 of 591 F.2d) incorrectly characterizes the arguments of the Agency on this appeal. These are more accurately stated in the Government brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">. . . we demonstrate that the prior decisions involving law enforcement manuals and the legislative history of Exemption 2 support withholding of information which would permit individuals to foil effective agency regulation. By the same token, the cases upon which plaintiff places primary reliance have not involved questions of possible evasion of agency regulation and therefore provide no support for plaintiffs case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">Govt. Br., at 6. Principally the Government does not argue for a \u201cbalancing\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">8. The dissent asserts that every other court and commentator that has dealt with Exemption 2 has treated the Senate and House Reports as being contradictory. Even if that were correct it would not change their true character. Some of the prior opinions have not read the two reports closely as applied to investigatory instructions that could frustrate enforcement, have not adequately reflected upon the earlier statement of Congressman Moss on the opening day of all congressional hearings, and where they have reflected upon law enforcement manuals that do not set forth secret law they have held for non-disclosure. Justice Brennan recognizes this in his comment and the cases he cited in <em>Rose, see </em>text <em>supra, </em>23. Judge Leventhal\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>173 U.S.App.D.C. 187, 203, 523 F.2d 1136, 1152 (1975) correctly describes the situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">Cases that have previously analyzed the applicability of exemption 2 have done so largely in the discrete context of deciding disclosability of government manuals. These manuals set guidelines for employees carrying out agency policies applicable to the public. The courts have ordered disclosure of \u201csecret law\u201d as within the disclosure mandate of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C) (\u2018administrative staff manual . . . that affect[s] a member of the public\u2019), <em>while protecting agency techniques that if disclosed would materially lessen the agency\u2019s effectiveness vis-a-vis the public it regulates. . </em>(emphasis supplied; footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-19\">9. Our decision in <em>Doe v. McMillan, </em>148 U.S.App.D.C. 280, 287, 459 F.2d 1304, 1311 n.10 (1972) is distinguishable from the instant case in that the complaint in <em>Doe </em>never asserted any cause of action based on the House Rules which they attempted to raise for the first time in the Court of Appeals. <em>See </em>459 F.2d at 1308. We stated that this was impermissible but also pointed out the deficiencies in that claim. <em>See </em>note 10. In this case, however, the Government in its pleadings alleged that the entire complaint failed to state a claim, that plaintiff lacked jurisdiction because the records sought were exempt under all of \u00a7 552(b) (R.3) and denied completely that appellants had any rights under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C) or \u00a7 552(a)(3) (R.3) Thus, the pleadings in <em>Doe </em>and this case are completely different and the latter permit the opinion to rely upon statutory defenses raised by the pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b810-20\">. The Attorney General\u2019s Memorandum on the Public Information Section of the Administrative Procedure Act, as revised effective July 4, 1967, made the following comments with respect to Exemption 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-21\">(2) INTERNAL PROCEDURES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aql\">\u201c[The provisions of] this section [shall not be applicable] to matters that are * * * (2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The House report explains that the words \u201cpersonnel rules and practices\u201d in subsection (e) are meant to relate to those matters which are for the guidance of agency personnel only, including internal rules and practices which cannot be disclosed to the public without substantial prejudice to the effective performance of a significant agency function. The examples cited in the House report (H.Rept., 10) are \u201coperating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners.\u201d An agency cannot bargain effectively for the acquisition of lands or services or the disposition of surplus facilities if its instructions to its negotiators and its offers to prospective sellers or buyers are not kept confidential. Similarly, an agency must keep secret the circumstances under which it will conduct unannounced inspections or spot audits of supervised transactions to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. The moment such operations become predictable, their usefulness is destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">As the examples cited in the House report indicate, the exemption in subsection (e)(2) is designed to permit the withholding of agency records relating to management operations to the extent that the proper performance of necessary agency functions requires such withholding. However, as the House report states, at page 10, \u201cthis exemption would not cover all \u2018matters of internal management\u2019 such as employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures which are withheld under the present law.\u201d It follows that the exemption should not be invoked to authorize any denial of information relating to management operations when there is no strong reason for withholding. For example, the examining, investigative, personnel management, and appellate functions of the Civil Service Commission relate solely to internal personnel rules and practices of the Government and, as such, are covered by the exclusion in subsection (e)(2). However, the Commission now publishes all its regulations in the Federal Register, and its instructions are available to the public through the Federal Personnel Manual, which may be purchased at the U. S. Government Printing Office. This is an example of the exercise of the principle that the exemption, even though it may be literally applicable, should be invoked only when actually necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-11\"><em>Id. </em>30-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b811-12\">. The charge that the intent of the Senate Report with respect to Exemption 2 is contradicted by the House Report on that exemption (H.R.Rep.

The \u201cGuidelines\u201d for FEA audit personnel deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>with the methods to be used, the areas in which inquiries are to be made, and the degree <em>of </em>intensity to which each area is to be subject to review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The FEA contended that disclosure of the Guidelines \u201cwould allow refiners with access to the Guidelines to impede FEA\u2019s law enforcement activities by developing strategies to avoid detection of violations.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff asserted that the information sought was necessary to curb allegedly improper actions by FEA auditors, making improper demands on the refiners, j. e., to make sure that the auditors kept within their own guidelines.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The District Court agreed with the defendant FEA, finding that \u201cthe public may have an interest in the Guidelines, but it is not a legitimate interest, since the document is useful only for the purpose of evading regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">II. PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">A. <em>Purpose Guiding Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">Whether the trial court was correct in its conclusion that the documents would be \u201cuseful only for the purpose of evading regulation\u201d is immaterial under the FOIA. Indeed, the above-quoted conclusion of the trial court illustrates the basic error in sustaining the refusal of the FEA to produce the requested Guidelines. Although the District Court\u2019s conclusion, and the agency\u2019s refusal to disclose its Guidelines for investigation, is a position with much common sense logic to commend it as a policy matter, the agency position is not sustainable under the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">The history, language, and structure of the Freedom of Information Act shows clearly that its purpose is that all Government documents must be disclosed on request, unless such documents fall within one of the nine enumerated exemptions from disclosure contained in the Act. \u201cDisclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act.\u201d Accordingly, the exceptions particularized in the Act are \u201cexclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no requirement whatsoever that the seeker of information from Government files state the purpose of his obtaining the documents; the theory of the Act is that the public has a right to know and the procedures of the Act are to provide the enforcement mechanism, subject to the enumerated exemptions, which are to be narrowly construed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since no motive or purpose is required to be stated by the requester, it is immaterial what the requester\u2019s motive or purpose is, or to what extent or for what purpose the documents sought would be useful to the requester when he obtains them. This may be a serious flaw in the FOIA, but it is inherent in the purpose and structure of the Act, and has been recognized since its inception.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>So when the trial court concluded that \u201cthe public may have an interest in the Guidelines, but it is not a legitimate interest,\u201d the trial court thus was evaluating the merits of the purpose or use to which the plaintiff would put the documents once he obtained them. Under the FOIA this is an erroneous approach, for the trial judge was in effect balancing the public\u2019s right to know against the public good to be obtained by permitting the Government agency to keep confidential its instructions for its audit agents. This balancing between the public interest in disclosure and Government confidentiality had already been done by Congress when it passed the Act. Those matters in the Government files in which the public\u2019s interest in maintaining confidentiality outweighs the public\u2019s right to know have already been the subject of a policy judgment made by Congress; they are enumerated in the nine exemptions to the Act, nowhere else.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">It will not do to argue that the exemption should be broadly construed to protect the public interest, because we have been told (and we have said) precisely the contrary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Freedom of Information Act is to be viewed as a remedial statute and is to be construed liberally, and it is the exemptions that are to be construed narrowly. This, too, may not be ultimately in accord with the best interest of this country, but that is what the law says and the courts have largely followed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">B. <em>Structure of Compelled Disclosure and Exemptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Turning to the structure of the Freedom of Information Act itself, the statute begins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u00a7 552 Public information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records and proceedings,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbT\">(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ9k\">There then are enumerated three categories or methods of making information available to the public. The first requires certain matter to be published in the Federal Register; the second requires certain matter to be made available for public inspection and copying; and the third requires certain matter to be available upon request to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">The second method or category affirmatively requiring disclosure of certain matter under Section 552(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-12\">(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">The third category is most pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">(3) Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request for records which (A) reasonably describe such records and (B) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any) and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">It has been argued by the FEA that the manuals issued to staff only here do not properly fall within Section 552(a)(2) because they are designed for internal use only; they guide the conduct only of staff personnel, and therefore do not \u201caffect a member of the public.\u201d In the District Court plaintiff replied that no such staff manuals or instructions could affect a member of the public more than these do, because they determine what the auditors look for and what the auditors do in regard to the members of the public with whom they have contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">The majority asserts that appellant\u2019s \u201cfirst and principal contention\u201d is that the Guidelines are \u201cadministrative staff manuals]\u201d required to be disclosed under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C). Actually, this argument seems to have been largely abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>by appellant. The District Court did not deal with this issue in its memorandum opinion. Appellant has not raised the issue on appeal, either in briefs or at oral argument.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Indeed, appellant stated the issue on appeal as being solely the trial court\u2019s holding on Exemption 2. Thus, far from being appellant\u2019s \u201cfirst and principal contention\u201d, from the time of the District Court\u2019s memorandum, the applicability of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C) simply no longer has been a significant issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Whether these staff manuals and instructions fall under (a)(2) or not, it is clear that, if they do not, they do fall within the catch-all description of the third category, Section 552(a)(3), calling for records to be made available to the public on request, \u201creasonably describing] such records . in accordance with published rules,\u201d which no one denies that the plaintiff has done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The above is the affirmative part of the FOIA which unquestionably covers the request for disclosure made by plaintiff. Under the law, that request must be honored unless the matter sought falls within one of the nine exemptions, which are listed in Section 552(b), immediately following the affirmative disclosure requirements of subsection (a). The nondisclosure part of the FOIA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">(b) This section does not apply to matters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">As my discussion of the purpose and structure of the Act above shows, it is on the wording of this exemption and this exemption only that the authority of the FEA to withhold the requested documents rests. If the Guidelines are not described by this specific language of the statute, they are not exempt and must be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-21\">This conclusion rests on the specific language of the Supreme Court in <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-22\">As the Act is structured, virtually every document generated by an agency is available to the public in one form or another, unless it falls within one of the Act\u2019s nine exemptions. . . . \u201c[T]he disclosure obligation \u2018does not apply\u2019 to those documents described in the nine enumerated exempt categories listed in \u00a7 552(b).\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-24\">III. EXEMPTION 2 AS APPLIED TO THE FEA GUIDELINES SOUGHT</p>\n<p id=\"A3i\">The FEA argues on three grounds that its \u201cRefinery Audit Review Guidelines\u201d and supplement \u201cGuidelines for Audit Modules\u201d were intended to be protected from disclosure by Exemption 2: First, the specific language of Exemption 2; second, the legislative history of Exemption 2; third, the balancing of the public interest in disclosure or nondisclosure of these Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-25\">A. <em>Specific Language of Exemption 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-26\">There are three key words in the short description of the matter specifically covered by this single exemption: The three key words are \u201csolely,\u201d \u201cinternal,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-27\">\u201cInternal,\u201d as modifying or limiting \u201cpersonnel rules and practices of an agency,\u201d would seem to refer to those rules and practices which concern relations among the employees of that agency, as distinct from rules and practices which might relate to, or have an impact upon, members of the public. How an agency orders its own affairs among its own personnel would seem to invite little public interest in disclosure.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On the contrary, rules and practices which have a definite impact on the public would seem a fit subject for disclosure to the public. The first might properly be described as internal, the second as external. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>this basis the Guidelines should be more properly described as external rather than internal, although this is not a decisive division.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">\u201cPersonnel\u201d is the real problem for the Government agency here seeking to avoid disclosure. It is almost impossible to look at this short, simple exemption on its face, \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency,\u201d and say that this description was intended to cover the Guidelines and instruction manuals here. \u201cPersonnel rules and practices\u201d would normally have to do with rules such as pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc. \u2014 precisely the kind of trivia that was indeed described by the Senate\u2019s comment on the coverage of this particular exemption.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Just why the statute should go to the trouble to include a special subsection exempting this trivia is not certain.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But this is what the plain language of the statute points to, and it is confirmed by the Senate\u2019s comment, as will be seen below. An instruction manual of this guideline type is simply not a \u201cpersonnel\u201d rule or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">It is argued that the Guidelines are instructions limited to the personnel of this particular agency, and are thus personnel rules and practices. This argument is somewhat circular reasoning, however, because the question at issue here is whether these Guidelines can be limited to the knowledge of the personnel of the agency. Furthermore, it is apparent that if these Guidelines, instructions for agency personnel as to how they shall conduct themselves with the public to which their official duties relate, can be termed \u201cpersonnel\u201d rules and practices because they are directed to agency personnel, there is very little that the agency produces, except what it deliberately wants to make public, which could not be so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">The word \u201csolely\u201d emphasizes the limited scope of Exemption 2, whatever the other words are deciphered to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">It can only be concluded from the face of the statute that the Guidelines at issue here are not within the specific language of Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">In an attempt to circumvent the plain meaning of Exemption 2, my two colleagues have come up with a novel reading of the provision. It is claimed that the phrases \u201cinternal personnel rules\u201d and \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d are to be read disjunctively, with the former phrase referring to relations between the agency and its employees and with the latter phrase referring to operational conduct of the employees. This interpretation cannot be sustained. It is violative of basic rules of English grammar, contrary to the legislative history of the exemption, and incompatible with the general purpose of the Act. Indeed, every court which has considered the specific language of Exemption 2 has concluded, for good and sufficient reasons, that the phrase \u201cinternal personnel\u201d modifies both \u201crules\u201d and \u201cpractices\u201d.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Grammatically, it is clear that \u201cinternal\u201d modifies \u201cpractices\u201d. \u201cInternal\u201d is an adjective which requires completion by the prepositional clause \u201cof an agency\u201d. Whatever is modified by \u201cinternal\u201d must be in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>ternal <em>to something. </em>\u201cInternal\u201d is orphaned unless it is related to the clause \u201cof an agency\u201d. It is basic grammar that <em>both nouns </em>bracketed by the word \u201cinternal\u201d and the phrase \u201cof an agency\u201d are modified by \u201cinternal\u201d. Moreover, while it is conceivable that \u201cpersonnel\u201d applies only to \u201crules\u201d, the preferred construction is that it modifies both nouns in the dyad \u201crules and practices\u201d. If Congress intended to sever \u201cpractices\u201d from \u201cinternal personnel rules\u201d, it would have preserved parallel construction by inserting the article \u201cthe\u201d before the word \u201cpractices\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We need not rely solely on the <em>rules </em>of grammar to determine that Congress had no intention of exempting a general category of information relating to \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d. It is clear from the legislative <em>history </em>of this particular clause, with direct reference to its grammatical construction, that Congress intended the exemption to be read as a composite clause, covering only internal personnel matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The phrasing of Exemption 2 is traceable to Congressional dissatisfaction with the exemption from disclosure under former Section 3 of the Administrative Procedures Act of \u201cany matter relating solely to the <em>internal management </em>of an agency.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Agencies had relied on this broad language in refusing to disclose matters \u201crangpng] from the important to the insignificant.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The language \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices\u201d was first used in a bill specifically designed to <em>narrow </em>the \u201cinternal management\u201d exemption in former Section 3 of the APA. S. 1666, introduced in the 88th Congress, proposed an exemption for \u201cinternal management\u201d only in the subsection of the bill requiring certain matters to be published in the Federal Register. In the subsection requiring agency rules, orders and records to be made available for public inspection, an exemption was proposed only for information related \u201csolely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d This distinction was highlighted in the Senate Report on S. 1666 by reference to the latter as \u201cmore tightly drawn\u201d language.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Freedom of Information bills introduced in the 89th Congress, including S. 1160 which became the law in 1966, dropped the \u201cinternal management\u201d exemption altogether and carried over the \u201cmore tightly drawn\u201d language of S. 1666 as a single exemption. Thus, as the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Department of Air Force v. Rose,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cthe legislative history plainly evidences the Congressional conclusion that the wording of Exemption 2, \u2018internal personnel rules and practices\u2019, was to have a narrower reach than the Administrative Procedure Act exemption for \u2018internal management\u2019 \u201d. My colleagues\u2019 interpretation of Exemption 2 which sets apart \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d as an independent category of exempt information would be contrary to Congress\u2019 clear intention that this exemption be interpreted specifically and narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">Even more convincingly, it is clear from both the House and Senate hearings on Freedom of Information legislation in the 89th Congress that everyone concerned in both the legislative and executive branches understood that the words \u201cinternal personnel\u201d applied to all of Exemption 2. For example, on the first day of House hearings on H.R. 5012, Congressman John E. Moss, Chairman of the Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee, Benny L. Kass, counsel to the subcommittee, and Norbert A. Schlei, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the scope of the phrase \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices\u201d:<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Mr. Kass. Mr. Schlei, what is your interpretation of exemption No. 2? What information would fall under those records relating solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency? How does your agency interpret that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-4\">Mr. Schlei. Well, we were inclined to be critical of that exception because it did not seem to us actually that the personnel rules and practices of an agency, many of them, ought to be exempt. They ought to be public. How you handle various personnel problems and where somebody goes to complain if he is treated wrongly by his superior, and so on. All those things I would suppose should be public. They should be published somewhere. They should be up on a bulletin board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">And there are some personnel rules and practices that ought to be exempt, and I think that \u2014 let\u2019s see\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">Mr. Kass. It is No. 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">Mr. Schlei. And so that exception, it seemed to us, protected from disclosure things that did <em>not </em>need protection, as well as perhaps not going far enough as to some aspects of information that the Government gets about its employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">Mr. Kass. Where an individual is, let\u2019s assume, fired from the agency \u2014 for cause we hope \u2014 would the facts and circumstances surrounding this discharge fall within the <em>personnel practices </em>of an agency as you read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">Mr. Schlei. I should not think so, although you are talking here about records that are related to the <em>\u201cpractices\u201d </em>of an agency, and conceivably a record, although it contained only a summary of some facts, say, might be related to the <em>\u201cpractices, personnel practices,\u201d </em>of the agency, part of a file, part of a series of documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">I am just talking off the top of my head about that problem, but I would say that you could get a situation where a factual statement or document came within that exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-11\">Mr. Kass. We are all talking, as you say, off the top of our heads. We are trying to create legislative history to determine what we intend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-12\">Mr. Moss. <em>What this was intended to cover was instances such as the manuals of procedure that are handed to an examiner </em>\u2014 a <em>bank examiner, or a savings and loan examiner, or the guidelines given to an FBI agent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-13\">Mr. Schlei. <em>Ah! Then the word \u201cpersonnel\u201d should be stricken. </em>Because \u201cpersonnel\u201d I think connoted certainly to use the employee relations, employee management rules and practices of an agency. What you meant was material related solely to the internal rules and practices of any agency for the guidance of its employees \u2014 something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-14\">I do agree that there should be protection for the instructions given to FBI agents and bank examiners; people who, if they are going to operate in expectable ways, cannot do their jobs. Their instructions have to be withheld.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-15\">But I think that word \u201cpersonnel\u201d does not do the job well enough, Mr. Chairman. I am sure it can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-16\">Mr. Moss. We will hope to seek a way of doing the job without exempting internal rules and practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-17\">Mr. Schlei. I suppose that could cover quite a lot of ground, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-18\">Mr. Moss. Because I am afraid that we would there open the barn door to everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-19\">Mr. Schlei. Well, it is one of those things, Mr. Chairman, that just shows how hard it is to cover the whole Government with a few words. There are a number of problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-20\">Mr. Moss. Oh, we recognize the difficulty and the complexity, but we are perfectly willing to work at it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-21\">It is clear from this exchange that Congressman Moss, author of H.R. 5012, had intended the words \u201cinternal personnel\u201d to apply to both \u201crules\u201d and \u201cpractices\u201d. He apparently wanted investigative manuals covered by the exemption, <em>but he was told flatly that the word \u201cpersonnel\u201d precluded such interpretation. </em>He acknowledged this, but stated his concern that excising \u201cpersonnel\u201d would \u201copen the barn door\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>leaving a broad exemption for all \u201cinternal rules and practices\u201d. The Senate was also told by several witnesses (at its hearings on the FOIA) that the proposed legislation did not protect investigative manuals and that if the Senate wanted to protect this material it would either have to expand Exemption 2,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Exemption 7,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or some other provision of the Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> However, at no time did the Senate Committee or any individual Senator express a desire to cover investigative manuals and, accordingly, no change in the bill was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Finally, it is clear in reading Exemption 2 in the context of the Act as a whole that Congress intended to limit the word \u201cpractices\u201d to \u201cinternal personnel\u201d matters. The recognized purpose of the Act is to assure the broadest possible access to governmental records. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements are to be construed broadly, the exemptions narrowly. If the majority\u2019s reading of Exemption 2 were accepted, the Act would not apply to \u201cmatters that are related solely to the . . . practices of an agency.\u201d This would be an unlimited exemption, so broad that it would effectively swallow the rest of the Act. What <em>is not </em>an agency practice? What agency documents are there which <em>do not </em>relate to agency practices? And if one were to use the majority\u2019s constructional canon against superfluous language, one would ask why Congress has bothered to enumerate the other eight exemptions \u2014 \u201cpractices\u201d covers it all.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">In short, a survey of every intrinsic and extrinsic aid relevant to interpretation of Exemption 2 supports my reading of the provision\u2019s specific language. My colleagues\u2019 attempt to carve out a tenth exemption for \u201cpractices of an agency\u201d has nothing to recommend it but wishful thinking.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">B. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">On the legislative history of this particular exemption, the Government agency is in an even weaker position than on its argument on the face of the statute, because the Supreme Court in <em>Department of Air Force et al. v. Rose, et al.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and this court in <em>Vaughn v. Rosen (Vaughn </em>II)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> have construed and discussed at length the legislative history of this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">The perils of reliance on legislative history are nowhere better illustrated than with regard to Exemption 2, for rarely can there be found two such contradictory explanations of a statute\u2019s meaning than in the Senate and House Reports. The Senate Report on the Freedom of Information Act stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-15\">Exemption 2 relates only to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. Examples of these may be rules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">Diametrically opposite was the House Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-17\">2. Matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency: Operating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners would be exempt from disclosure, but this exemption would not cover all \u201cmatters of internal management\u201d such as employee relations and working conditions in routine admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>istrative procedures which are withheld under the present law.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANl\">Thus, the Senate Report interprets Exemption 2 as exempting only trivial \u201chousekeeping\u201d matters in which it can be presumed the public lacks any substantial interest. The language of the House Report however, \u201ccarries the potential of exempting a wide swath of information under the category of \u2018operating rules, guidelines and manuals of procedure.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As a threshold matter, it must be remembered that committee reports are not the law; they are only aids in interpreting statutory language and are useful only to the extent they fairly reflect Congressional intent.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Sometimes committee reports are not reliable guides to legislative intent as, for example, where they contain statements that contradict the plain meaning of the statutory language<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or that conflict with the expressed purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">We first confronted the amazing discrepancy between the Senate and House Reports to the Freedom of Information Act in <em>Vaughn v. Rosen (Vaughn II).</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case we rejected the House Report as a reliable guide in construing Exemption 2 and chose to rely instead upon the Senate Report as being a truer indication of legislative intent. Every court which has <em>considered the difference </em>between the reports has done the same.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In an attempt to validate the House interpretation of Exemption 2, and thus evade this court\u2019s decision in <em>Vaughn II, </em>the majority make the novel argument that there is no contradiction between the House and Senate Reports, and that both can be given effect. Every court and commentator dealing with this Exemption up until now has treated the two interpretations as contradictory<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> And, of course, this is plainly so. Judge MacKinnon\u2019s opinion emphasizes the first half of the sentence from the House Report relating to operational rules, claiming that the House was here referring to something different from what the Senate had covered in its report, namely \u201cpractices\u201d instead of \u201crules\u201d. I have already shown that this is a false distinction. Be that as it may, the contradiction is present in the second half of the House statement beginning with the words \u201cbut this exemption would not cover . . . .\u201d This last part does not deal with anything the Senate overlooked; this last part deals with precisely those things the Senate mentioned, and puts a directly opposite interpretation on Exemption 2 as to whether routine internal management matters are covered or not. The Senate Report says they are; the House Report says they are not. What could be more contradictory? But the mere fact that the House Report directly contradicts the Senate Report is not the only basis for our determination in <em>Vaughn II </em>that \u201ca court viewing the legislative history must be wary of relying upon the House Report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">In <em>Vaughn II </em>we expressed several reasons for preferring the Senate Report. First, we noted that the Senate Report language was more consistent with the actual wording of the statute, whereas the House Report appeared in several areas to depart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>from and indeed contradict the statutory language of the Act. This is an important factor in determining the relative reliability of committee reports.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Second, we observed that the House Report potentially exempted \u201ca wide swath of information\u201d but gave no guidance as to which matters are covered by the exemption and which are not, whereas the Senate Report provided a standard which agencies and courts could apply with certainty, consistency and clarity. The extent to which a committee report actually clarifies statutory language is also a relevant factor in determining its reliability, for reports are to be used to resolve ambiguities, not to create new ones.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Third, we noted that the sweeping interpretation of Exemption 2 favored by the House Report was incompatible with Congress\u2019 expressed intent to cut back on the previous exemption for \u201cinternal management.\u201d Fourth, we observed that the language of the House Report seemed less consonant with the overall scheme and general purpose of the Act than did the Senate Report:<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">Reinforcing this interpretation is \u201cthe clear legislative intent [of FOIA] to assure public access to all governmental records whose disclosure would not significantly harm specific governmental interests.\u201d As a result, we have repeatedly stated that \u201c[t]he policy of the Act requires that the disclosure requirement be construed broadly, the exemptions narrowly.\u201d Thus, faced with a conflict in the legislative history, the recognized principal purpose of the FOIA requires us to choose that interpretation most favoring disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Finally, we addressed in <em>Vaughn II </em>what one commentator has called the \u201cabuse of legislative history\u201d which was involved in adoption of the House Report.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This refers to the fact that the expansive gloss placed on Exemption 2 and other sections of the Act by the House Report was the product of last minute chicanery by interested members of the House <em>after </em>the Senate had passed the bill and just as the full Committee in the House was about to report out the bill. The details of this episode have been placed on the public record by Benny L. Kass, who was counsel to the Foreign Operations and Government Operations Committee from 1962 to 1965, and who was later assistant counsel to the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Testifying in 1973 at Senate hearings on proposed amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, Mr. Kass explained \u201cwhy the House report is so different from the rest of the bill\u201d:<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">The basic reason that the House bill is different was after the Senate passed the Freedom of Information Act and it was about to be reported out of the House Government Operations Committee, the Justice Department \u2014 Mr. Katzenbach, Mr. <em>Wozencraft </em>\u2014 came <em>up and talked to Congressman Moss and said, look, we cannot support the bill. There are a number of changes that have to be made.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">I kind of appeared as an emissary on behalf of the former chairman of this subcommittee to Congressman Moss and I said it is our reading from the Senate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>that the <em>Senate has already passed this bill twice, that there should be no amendments. </em>We wanted to move forward with it. We have played with it long enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-4\">So basically what was done under really almost an implied veto \u2014 I don\u2019t think they ever specifically said they would veto it but there was an implied threat\u2014 <em>we tried to compromise a number of the specific objections into the House report. </em>I don\u2019t think time permits going into these details. I have a very brief analysis which I was going to submit. I have to type it and I will submit it for the record, pointing out where the <em>House kind of gave in to what the Justice Department wanted, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Mr. Kass then pointed out eight sections in the House Report in which the Justice Department was able to get the language it wanted. Not surprisingly, the seventh area was the Report\u2019s description of Exemption 2. Mr. Kass concluded:<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad5\">I don\u2019t think it was a sellout but in any event it was really the price of getting the bill. It was my legal advice to both the chairman of this committee and the chairman, Congressman Moss, that <em>the legislative history only interprets and does not vitiate in any way the legislation and that the legislation was strong and was there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-6\">I think this is important just for the record to point out why the House report is different. Fortunately, as Mr. Dobrovir said, there have been a number of cases all of which have said that the House report is so different that we have to look to the statute and that <em>the House report should not in any way undermine the basic statute that was passed by Congress in 1966. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">This background is relevant to the weight that the House Report should be accorded as an item of legislative history. Statements in the report of a single House are not reliable guides to Congressional intent where, as here, they have been inserted in an effort to <em>change </em>the meaning of the statutory language already adopted by the House which initiated the legislation. As Professor Davis said:<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-11\">The basic principle is quite elementary: The content of the law must depend upon the intent of both Houses, not of just one. In this instance, only the bill, not the House committee\u2019s statements at variance with the bill, reflects the intent of both Houses. <em>Indeed, no one will ever know whether the Senate Committee or the Senate would have concurred in the restrictions written into the House committee report.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-12\">The reasons why the courts will reject the House committee\u2019s abuse of legislative history, even though the Attorney General supports it, are overwhelming. Allowing the meaning of clear statutory words to be drastically changed by the House committee report would have many unsound consequences. Three major ones are: (1) The House that acts first would be deprived of any voice in the final meaning of the enactment, for the House that acts second could always adopt the same bill but alter its meaning through committee reports. (2) The sound system of the conference committee would be defeated, for the House that acts second, even when it knows the other House disagrees, could always make law as it chooses through the committee reports. (3) Statutes which are clear on their face would become unreliable indicia of the effective law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">The position of this Court in <em>Vaughn II </em>has recently been vindicated by the action of the House of Representatives itself in passing the \u201cGovernment in the Sunshine Act of 1976.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Professor Davis has recently suggested the relevance of the Sunshine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Act to interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act:<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\">The Freedom of Information Act, Advisory Committee Act, Privacy Act, and Government in the Sunshine Act all deal with the subject matter of openness of records and of meetings. Each of the four statutes has its own function. Each provision of each statute may be interrelated to one or more provisions of the other statutes. Furthermore, the various statutes often use language that is identical with the language of another statute. The meaning of that language may depend not only on legislative history and interpretations with respect to the language of the one statute, but it may depend upon legislative history and interpretations with respect to the identical language that is used in one of the other statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Of course, Professor Davis is correct, for it is a well established principle that courts may look to subsequent legislation as an aid in the interpretation of prior legislation dealing with the same or similar subject matter.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall stated the principle that, if it can be gathered from a subsequent statute <em>in pari materia </em>what meaning the legislature attached to the words of a former statute, this will amount to a legislative declaration of its meaning, and will govern the construction of the first statute.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Applying this principle, it is highly significant that the Government in the Sunshine Act, enacted in 1976, carries over verbatim most of the exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act, including the specific language of Exemption 2. Thus, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(2) exempts from the Act\u2019s open meeting requirement portions of meetings likely to \u201crelate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d <em>The House Report to the Sunshine Act gives the same narrow interpretation to this exemption as the Senate did in </em>1965:<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQj\"><em>(2) </em>This exemption includes meetings relating solely to an agency\u2019s internal personnel rules and practices. It is intended to protect the privacy of staff members and to cover the handling of strictly internal matters. <em>It does not include discussions or information dealing with agency policies governing employees\u2019 dealings with the public, such as manuals or directives setting forth job functions or procedures. </em>As is the case with all of the exemptions, a closing or withholding permitted by this paragraph should not be made if the public interest requires otherwise, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">It thus appears that by 1976 the House of Representatives had repudiated the sweeping language concerning Exemption 2 contained in its 1966 report on the Freedom of Information, thus leaving my colleagues out of date on the House\u2019s own interpretation. Chief Justice Marshall would thus have repudiated Judge MacKinnon\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">This Court\u2019s rejection of the House Report has recently been vindicated by the Supreme Court. Five months after our decision in <em>Vaughn II, </em>the Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>Department of Air Force, et al. v. </em>Rose<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> specifically considered the legislative history of Exemption 2, quoted at some length from our opinion in <em>Vaughn II, </em>and approved our reasoning therein, and likewise concluded, \u201c[A]nd because we think the primary focus of the House Report was on exemption of disclosures that might , enable the regulated to circumvent agency regulation, we, too, \u2018choose to rely upon the Senate Report\u2019 in this regard.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">In concluding its discussion of Exemption 2, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIn sum, we think that, at least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation, Exemption 2 is not applicable to matters subject to such a genuine and significant public interest. . Rather, the general thrust of the exemption is simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and maintaining for public inspection matter in which the public could not reasonably be expected to have an interest.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">From the words \u201cat least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation,\u201d the FEA argues that the Supreme Court implied that Exemption 2 should be stretched to cover such a situation. I cannot agree; this language of the Supreme Court means no more than that the Court cautiously left open the question of what to do about any exemption \u201cwhere disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d With the question left open, we have confronted the problem here, and, as my analysis of the statutory language of Exemption 2 and its legislative history demonstrates, Exemption 2 was not designed to protect documents whose disclosure might risk circumvention of agency regulation, whatever would be the merits of such a provision. Exemption 2 is much more limited, as I have described. And, it is evident from the reasoning of the Supreme Court in adopting the meaning of Exemption 2 as described in the Senate Report, and in the Supreme Court\u2019s citation with approval of our reasoning in <em>Vaughn II, </em>that a stretching of Exemption 2 to protect the Guidelines would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Rose </em>and our court\u2019s analysis in <em>Vaughn II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">C. <em>Balancing of the Public Interest in Protecting These Guidelines Against Disclosure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">The Government agency urges that this Court should balance the public interest in protecting these particular Guidelines against disclosure versus any legitimate interest these plaintiffs or other members of the public may have in utilizing these Guidelines. This is an exhortation to balance disclosure of the individual documents involved in this particular case against the public interest in confidentiality. This the Court cannot do. The Freedom of Information Act certainly does not permit a court to balance the public good or harm involved in a disclosure or confidential retention of any individual document. The balancing of the public interest in disclosure or nondisclosure has been done by Congress, as discussed above. And it was done by Congress in terms of <em>categories </em>of documents which were to be exempt from disclosure. All of the cases which to my knowledge have touched on this question, beginning with our own decision in <em>Soucie v. David,</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark><em> </em>have discussed the balancing of the public interest in terms of categories of documents, not in terms of the individual documents concerned.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">On reflection, it becomes clear that for a court to balance the public interest in disclosure or nondisclosure, with reference to the particular documents involved in a case, would destroy completely the effectiveness of the Freedom of Information Act. This procedure was what occurred before the passage of the Act in 1966. The whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>scheme of the Act, as analyzed above, is to decree: first, in Section 552(a) the particular methods by which all records are to be made available to the public, whether (1) published in the Federal Register, or (2) made available for inspection and copying, or (3) to be made available upon request; second, following the mandate of disclosure, in Section 552(b) are listed the nine specific enumerated exemptions.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><em>The whole question of whether any Governmental document should be disclosed or protected against disclosure is a matter of public policy for legislative determination in the first </em>instance<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> There is no constitutional question involved here on which a court might feel free to express itself. The whole question of what is to be disclosed is one on which the Congress has spoken in precise, enumerated detail. If Congress has erred, Congress has erred, and it is not for this or any other court to rewrite a statute, in which we might consider to have been omitted necessary items in a list of exemptions against disclosure. On the face of the statute, on its legislative history, the Guidelines here at issue do not fall within the specific language of Exemption 2. This Court cannot write in an exemption to protect these Guidelines without rewriting the statute.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Rewriting, especially to add a separate and distinct item to a carefully limited list, is for Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">One can easily see the public interest to be served by keeping confidential these Guidelines designed, as plaintiff contends, to prevent FEA auditors from exceeding their instructions and authority, and from unduly harassing the business enterprises inspected, for if revealed no doubt they will serve as useful guidelines somewhere for those bent on evasion of the law by concealing accounting data in those areas in which the auditors are instructed not to look or to look lightly. Furthermore, these FEA Guidelines for its auditors are but examples of similar instructions found in many other Government agencies, and their revelation to the public must be accompanied by a diminution in the effectiveness of law enforcement. It may be thought strange that Congress did not provide for their exemption from disclosure; certain it is that Congress did not protect such Guidelines by Exemption 2.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">IV. THE MAJORITY\u2019S IMPROPER RELIANCE ON EXEMPTIONS 7 AND 5</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">The majority supports its interpretation of Exemption 2 by reference to Exemption 7, concluding \u201cWe thus refuse to interpret Exemption 2 as requiring the disclosure of matter that it is the objective of Exemption 7 to protect.\u201d However, Exemption 7 was <em>not </em>designed to protect the Guidelines in question. That exemption applies only to \u201cinvestigatory records.\u201d A document is an \u201cinvestigatory record\u201d if its purpose for creation was part of an agency inquiry into <em>specific </em>conduct which might be found to have violated a statute or regulation admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>istered by that agency.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The Guidelines here are clearly not such records, and the District Court properly so held. No appeal has been taken by the Government from this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The majority argues further that because Exemption 7 protects against disclosure of investigatory records which would reveal investigatory techniques and procedures, this court should construe Exemption 2 expansively to protect against disclosure of other kinds of information besides investigatory records which could likewise reveal such techniques and procedures. This argument might be appropriate if the language of Exemption 2 and its legislative history admitted of such an expansive interpretation. However, as I have demonstrated above, such a construction would amount to blatant judicial legislation. Section 552(e) provides that the Act cannot be invoked as a basis for withholding information \u201cexcept as specifically stated\u201d in one of the nine exemptions. The narrowness of the phrase, \u201cspecifically stated,\u201d forbids the expansion of the exemptions beyond their terms both by the agencies <em>and by the courts. </em>Although I would agree that Congress <em>should </em>have written in an exemption covering the documents here sought, it is my firm belief that Congress did not, and therefore I cannot accept a spurious construction of an exemption in order to cover the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Astonishingly, as an \u201cadditional basis\u201d for its holding, the majority finds that the Guidelines in question are exempt from disclosure as \u201cintra-agency memoranda\u201d under Exemption 5. However, the only exemptions asserted by the Government as grounds for withholding the Guidelines have been Exemptions 2 and 7. The District Court held Exemption 7 inapplicable, and, having taken no appeal from this ruling, the Government has relied solely on Exemption 2 before this court.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> At no time has the Government raised Exemption 5 as a ground for withholding the Guidelines. It was not raised in the Agency\u2019s initial denial; it was not raised in the Government\u2019s pleadings in the District Court. In its motion for summary judgment and supporting affidavit in the District Court, the Government neither asserted Exemption 5 nor provided any factual basis for concluding that it applied. It was not mentioned in the District Court\u2019s opinion, nor was it raised in any way by the Government on this appeal, either in its briefs or at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">It is basic that the FOIA establishes a statutory presumption that all federal records are available to \u201cany person.\u201d The presumption is rebutted only by evidence presented by an agency that the item sought is exempt from disclosure under one of the nine enumerated exemptions. The agency bears the full burden of proof when an exemption is claimed to apply<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> To meet this burden the agency must specifically identify the exemption relied upon and demonstrate that the exemption applies to the documents in question. <em>If an agency neither asserts an exemption nor adduces evidence demonstrating its applicability, a court may not step in sua sponte on behalf of the Government' and assert as grounds for withholding information from disclosure an exemption which the Government itself has not asserted.</em><footnotemark><em>62</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">This principle derives not only from the basic requirements of the FOIA itself, but also from the fundamental precept that issues on appeal are to be confined to those duly presented to the trial court \u2014 a precept which Judge MacKinnon recalled and applied recently in <em>Doe v. McMillan.</em><footnotemark><em>63</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>principle reflects, in part, due process considerations, for if the Government does not raise a particular exemption as a defense in the district court or on appeal, the appellant will have no opportunity to present arguments or evidence against the applicability of the exemption. Thus, in view of the fact that in this case the Government has at no time asserted or presented evidence on the applicability of Exemption 5, the majority\u2019s resort to the exemption is gratuitous and improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Furthermore, even if the argument for applying Exemption 5 to the Guidelines is considered on its merits, there is clearly no basis for holding Exemption 5 applicable. The basic purpose for Exemption 5 is to exempt from disclosure the predecisional, deliberative internal communications of an agency in order to protect its decisional processes. An agency asserting this exemption must show that disclosure of the memoranda sought would harm one of several policies: (1) the policy to protect creative debate and discussion within an agency,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> (2) the policy to avoid misleading the public as to the grounds for a particular agency action or to avoid premature publication of novel and unadopted concepts under consideration,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and (3) the policy to protect the integrity of the decision-making process.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The Guidelines sought in this case are not pre-decisional documents. They discuss and instruct agency personnel concerning decisions already made and policies already set. The Government has adduced no evidence whatsoever that disclosure of the Guidelines would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on creative discussion within the FEA, precipitously disclose novel and unadopted concepts still under consideration, or interfere with the decision-making process in the FEA. Thus, there is no basis for applying Exemption 5 in the instant case.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">The position taken by the majority here regarding Exemptions <em>7 </em>and 5 is based on claims not asserted by the Government. If this litigation progresses farther, either to an <em>en banc </em>in this court or to the Supreme Court, I strongly suggest that it is incumbent upon the Government to advise the court in its first papers filed whether it will now attempt to rely upon either Exemption 7 or 5, and if so, to justify such reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">Before BAZELON, Chief Judge and WRIGHT, McGOWAN, TAMM, ROBINSON, MacKINNON, ROBB and WILKEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-15\">.

The disclosure of th\u00e9se Guidelines would be especially regrettable because the FEA and other agencies have spent a great deal of effort in compiling guidelines for their investigators, not only to increase the efficient use of their time, but also to prevent dangerous freelancing and extemporizing by agents, to give them common directives within recognized legal limits. Agencies would instinctively tend to eliminate written guidelines which they would be obliged to disclose, to direct their operatives by word of mouth, variations in procedure would set in, agents would exceed reasonable limits, all to the public harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">Such harm could be prevented, however, by an exemption in the Freedom of Information Act forbidding the disclosure of such guidelines prescribing rules for auditors or investigators. As the dialogue between Congressman Moss and Assistent Attorney General Schlei showed (p. \u2014 of 192 U.S.App.D.C., p. 743 of 591 F.2d, supra), some members of the House wanted such an exemption, but they were told that the language of Exemption 2 did not cover this, and the parliamentary situation (the Senate having already passed the FOIA) prevented any change in the text of the bill which was subsequently enacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\">.
