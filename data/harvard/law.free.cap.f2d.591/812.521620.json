The Commission disagreed and renewed the license without a hearing. Although the Commission was regrettably elliptical in disposing of certain allegations contained in the petition to deny, we cannot say that it acted unreasonably. We share, however, petitioner\u2019s distress at the occasionally garbled rationale which the Commission constructed, and our affirmance is consequently somewhat reluctant.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b888-21\">KCOP filed its application for renewal of license on 30 July 1974. On 1 November 1974 NABB filed a petition to deny KCOP\u2019s application, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) deficiencies in seventeen areas of KCOP\u2019s programming, (2) failure to ascertain and meet the needs of the Los Angeles community, (3) violations of FCC rules through the miselassification of programs and various acts of \u201cdeception\u201d, and (4) breaches of an agreement KCOP had made with a Los Angeles citizens group and incorporated into its 1971 renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-22\">The Commission denied NABB\u2019s petition and declined to hold an evidentiary hearing on the renewal application, finding that NABB had failed to raise any substantial and material question of fact or to present <em>prima facie </em>evidence that license renewal would not be in the public interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the Commission necessarily found affirmatively that renewal would be in the public interest, it granted KCOP\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-23\">' II. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b888-24\">The Commission\u2019s disposition of license applications is governed by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>309(d) of the Communications Act of 1934.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 309(d) provides that the FCC shall grant or renew a license if it finds, after considering the application and all pleadings submitted, that there \u201care no substantial and material questions of fact and that a grant of the application would be consistent with [the public interest].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any \u201cparty in interest\u201d objecting to the renewal may file a petition to deny.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A petitioner\u2019s allegations must be both \u201csubstantial and specific,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> sufficient \u201cto show that a grant of the application would be <em>prima facie </em>inconsistent with [the public interest];\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201callegations of ultimate, conclusionary facts or more general allegations on information and belief, supported by general affidavits . . . are not sufficient.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Where the Commission finds that such a showing has not been made, it may refuse the petition, \u201cissupng] a concise statement of the reasons for denying the petition, which statement shall dispose of all substantial issues raised by the petition.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Aside from the sufficiency of the petition to deny, a hearing will not be required where the facts are undisputed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the \u201cdisposition of [an appellant\u2019s claims [turn] not on determination of facts but inferences to be drawn from those facts.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, a hearing is not required to resolve issues which the Commission finds are either not \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmaterial,\u201d whether or not the underlying facts are disputed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">This court has recently had occasion to consider the special circumstances presented by allegations of discrimination in a licensee\u2019s employment practices. In <em>Bilingual </em>II,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we restated that proven intentional discrimination would put seriously into question a licensee\u2019s character qualifications. Allegations of such practices are to be tested against the usual statutory requirement of specificity and substantiality. We observed, however, that the peculiar difficulty of proof in such matters will alter the character of the evidence sufficient to warrant at least an inquiry by the FCC. Thus evidence of \u201csubstantial statistical disparity,\u201d without any direct evidence of actual discriminatory conduct, will ordinarily trigger the FCC\u2019s duty to inquire.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is consistent with other instances in which the rigor of \u201cwell pleaded\u201d allegations may be relaxed; as, for example, when relevant evidence is known only to the licensee.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The net result is that the provisions of section 309(d) are to be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>pragmatically, with sensitivity both to the need for administrative economy and also to the varying nature of the relevant proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We review the Commission\u2019s decision to determine if it reasonably concluded that there were no \u201csubstantial and material questions of fact\u201d and that license renewal would be in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The extent of our review in such cases as this is narrow. \u201cWe defer to the expertise and experience of the Commission within its field of speciality.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The decision whether to hold hearings \u201cis a matter in which the Commission\u2019s discretion . is paramount.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although we must be satisfied that the Commission took a hard look at all the relevant issues,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> if the Commission\u2019s action was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, we must affirm.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">We now address the FCC\u2019s disposition of the allegations raised by NABB in its petition to deny, which may be conveniently grouped as programming criticisms and a failure to implement the CORT agreement as represented to the FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">A. <em>Programming Criticisms</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">NABB extensively criticized the quality of KCOP\u2019s programming generally and cited particular areas of alleged deficiency.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> These allegations were of three types: (1) that the quality of certain program areas was inferior; (2) that programming ignored certain community needs; and (3) that particular programming was offensive. Within the first category are the allegations that KCOP\u2019s programming is overly commercialized, that news programming is largely of a perfunctory \u201crip and read\u201d variety, that there is too little local programming, that public affairs programming is \u201ccheap, shoddy, and ineffectual,\u201d and that there is an excessive amount of \u201cold and stale programming.\u201d The Commission correctly concluded that such generalized criticisms, about matters typically consigned wholly to the discretion of the licensee, were irrelevant to the inquiry<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As we have recently observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-16\">[t]he Commission simply determines whether the licensee has operated in the public interest in the past, and whether its proposed programming makes it likely to operate in the public interest in the future. Once that determination is made the Commission does not try to evaluate whether the licensee could have done a better job of operating in the public interest.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">Thus we have no doubt that the Commission reasonably found appellant\u2019s allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>tions so imprecise and unspecific as to be irrelevant to the issue of renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The allegations within the second category are at least not facially immaterial to the public interest inquiry, referring as they do to the FCC\u2019s ascertainment requirement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus NABB alleges that KCOP has ignored the special needs of children and minorities, has produced no specialized agricultural programming, and has aired only imbalanced religious programming, too little news and too many commercials.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The ascertainment requirement is a sensible means of assuring that licensees obtain the sort of information which may make diversity of expression more likely. Imposing such duties of inquiry without more appears to raise no First Amendment questions, since they do not directly regulate protected speech. When the FCC scrutinizes programming content to determine if it is responsive to ascertained needs, or employs programming \u201cguidelines\u201d in processing renewal applications, arguably it is on more delicate ground.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Despite NABB\u2019s contention that enough was not done, we think the Commission\u2019s depth of inquiry in this noncomparative renewal pro-ceeding was sufficient to sustain its finding that KCOP\u2019s programming had amply met the ascertained needs of the community<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and had satisfied the percentage guidelines for various program types.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We recognize, of course, that a more thorough inquiry into program content would be necessary in comparative licensing proceedings, where making a minimally rational choice would suppose some programming comparison.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">The third category of appellant\u2019s allegations are those objecting to specific programs. Of course, not all speech is protected by the First Amendment and conduct which is otherwise unlawful is not immunized when put on television. Certain of NABB\u2019s allegations did pertain to arguably unlawful conduct. Thus NABB alleged (1) that airing certain game shows constituted the unlawful broadcast of lotteries;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (2) that <em>Championship Wrestling </em>violated various California athletic rules;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and (3) that certain faith healing programs were fraudulent.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We believe that the Commission reasonably found the allegations insufficient to show <em>prima facie </em>any illegality.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Other of NABB\u2019s allegations concern programs whose content, although not unprotected by the First Amendment, is arguably regulatable in the public interest. NABB contends that: (1) KCOP violated the \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d and \u201cpersonal attack\u201d rules;<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and (2) some of KCOP\u2019s programs are excessively violent, particularly when children might be expected to be viewing.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">As to the fairness doctrine and personal attack allegations, the Commission reasonably found that no violations had been shown to have occurred.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Had there been some showing of a violation of either rule, it would have been appropriate to review the licensee\u2019s conduct, likely in the context of a hearing.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The allegations concerning excessive violence are on quite a different footing; the conceptual difference between them and alleged violations of the fairness doctrine is instructive. To be sure, <em>both </em>allegations depend upon the <em>content of </em>speech. The difference is that in one case, regulation generates diversity of expression, only incidentally and marginally displacing some of the licensee\u2019s speech, and that <em>without regard to its content.</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the other case regulation would plainly suppress expression based on its supposedly offensive content.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Such subsequent review of program content as is proposed by appellant is not \u201ccensorship\u201d within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 326.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Furthermore, this last term the Supreme Court did uphold the FCC\u2019s authority pursuant to statute to impose sanctions upon a licensee for a broadcast that was \u201cindecent <em>but not obscene.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The FCC arguably could have conducted an inquiry here as to the violent content of programming, but it chose not to do so. We hold only that the Commission did not abuse its discretion in declining to pursue appellant\u2019s allegations of excessive violence in programming on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>B. <em>The CORT Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Several of appellant\u2019s allegations pertain to a 1971 agreement between KCOP and a citizens group called Council on Radio and Television (CORT). CORT had opposed KCOP\u2019s 1971 license renewal, but withdrew its petition to deny when the agreement at issue here was filed as an amendment to KCOP\u2019s renewal application. NABB alleged that KCOP violated the agreement in three respects: (1) that it failed to \u201cremove all racial and ethnic slurs\u201d from its programming;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> (2) that it failed to \u201ccarry a locally produced religious program representing the major American Religious denominations\u201d;<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and (3) that it had failed to produce a monthly \u201cdocumentary type\u201d program dealing with minority affairs.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">It is settled that programming proposals contained in a private agreement which is incorporated within a license application become representations to the Commission and are treated as are other promises of future performance<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Thus a licensee is obliged to comply substantially with its proposals or to justify any substantial variations.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Insubstantial variations do not ordinarily raise a question of the licensee\u2019s ability to operate in the public interest.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, modifications of the proposals may be warranted in light of the non-static character of community needs.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The Commission confines its review to determining if the licensee has made \u201creasonable and good faith efforts to effectuate its proposals.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> This is not to say that the Commission\u2019s review is unexacting. The Commission properly takes such propos\u00e1is seriously, and evidence of bad faith or of insubstantial performance would be quite material to a renewal inquiry.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This is fitting in light of the utility of public reaction in regulating televised speech comfortably within the First Amendment. Private agreements afford a rough way to accommodate \u201cthe public\u2019s right to hear\u201d with the licensee\u2019s otherwise broad programming discretion, without implicating the government in the actual choice of content. The same rationale underlies the FCC\u2019s reliance on viewer-initiated complaints as the vehicle for enforcing the fairness doctrine.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">The Commission dismissed NABB\u2019s allegations pertaining to the CORT agreement, finding that they failed to show any of the purported violations. With respect to the claim that KCOP had breached its promise to remove all racial and ethnic slurs from its programming, the Commission said that NABB\u2019s allegations were not specific enough; that in any event characterization of language as a racial slur was \u201cmerely a matter of subjective interpretation,\u201d and that accordingly it would not \u201carbitrate the definition of vague terms\u201d which \u201cfairly lend themselves to varying interpretations.\u201d Moreover, inasmuch as the standard of compliance is reasonableness and good faith the Commission concluded it \u201ccould hardly be said . . that KCOP failed to meet that standard.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">NABB attacked the Commission\u2019s alternative findings as both wrong and mutually inconsistent. It was logically impossible, NABB supposed, to find compliance with an agreement which the Commission would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>interpret. Consequently, NABB believed that a hearing was essential to resolve the factual question of the intent of the parties to the CORT agreement. To bolster its request for a hearing, NABB adduced some evidence that KCOP had persisted in precisely those practices to which the racial slur provisions arguably were addressed.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">We agree that the Commission\u2019s treatment of this issue was muddled. Further, we believe that under some circumstances, not presented by this case, it would have been impermissible to decline to interpret such a representation made by a licensee. But on the record in this case it is apparent that the instances of alleged racial slurs adduced by appellant were infrequent and insubstantial. Further, such offensive language as was shown is just part and parcel of the hyperbole and pseudoanimosity which has always characterized \u201cprofessional wrestling.\u201d It is unfortunate that the Commission did not address the substantiality of appellant\u2019s allegations more plainly, but we think it did at least intimate the view in finding good faith compliance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arz\">[T]he standard by which a licensee is judged concerning its compliance with such agreements is whether it made reasonable and good faith efforts to effectuate its proposals, and it can hardly be said from the allegations of NABB\u2019s original pleadings that KCOP failed to meet that standard.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Thus it was reasonable to find that appellant\u2019s allegations were simply not substantial enough to warrant further inquiry, and on this basis, articulated as it was, we can sustain the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">NABB was similarly troubled by the Commission\u2019s disposition of its remaining contentions. NABB had included in its petition to deny, together with allegations of KCOP\u2019s general neglect of minority interests, allegation that KCOP had failed to produce the monthly minority affairs documentary called for in the agreement. The agreement had provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-11\">KCOP shall develop, finance, produce and present monthly, in its prime time \u201cBig Question\u201d or \u201cMinority Community\u201d regularly scheduled programs, a documentary type program which will feature interviews, film clips and commentary. This program will be produced and directed by KCOP in consultation with minority groups and will include the use of local minority talent in program production.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyE\">NABB alleged that too few of the documentaries had been produced, and those without involving minorities. The Commission said that the allegations lacked \u201cboth specificity and factual support,\u201d some being based wholly on \u201cinformation and belief\u201d regarding matters not within NABB\u2019s personal knowledge.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Moreover, the relevant provisions in the agreement were \u201cambiguous,\u201d failing to state precisely the character of the intended programming. Although it was \u201cunclear from the record whether licensee actually broadcast such a program,\u201d inasmuch as \u201coverall minority programming\u201d was adequate, the Commission found that KCOP had made a good faith effort to comply.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">Apparently the Commission was of the opinion that NABB\u2019s allegations, in light of KCOP\u2019s overall record of public affairs and minority programming, failed to raise a serious question whether renewal would be in the public interest. Consequently, the exact nature of the alleged variance from the CORT agreement (admittedly a factual question) became irrelevant. Had the Commission said this more plainly, it would have avoided the awkwardness of admitting doubt concerning the occurrence of the programming specified in the agreement, while at the same time finding substantial compliance with that provision. The result reached by the Commission is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>nevertheless, not unreasonable and we will not remand merely to obtain redrafted language which more precisely fits our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">Finally, NABB alleged that KCOP breached its promise, contained in the CORT agreement, to broadcast balanced religious programming. Paragraph III F of the CORT agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-5\">F. Religious Programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">1. In keeping with KCOP\u2019s efforts to cover the range of religious thought, KCOP will carry a locally produced religious program representing the major American religious denominations, which will include discussion of current issues, commentary, or religious music.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In its first opinion the Commission found \u201cthat the terms of the CORT agreement now at issue have been met and that KCOP has provided balanced religious programming.\u201d The Commission said that KCOP had complied with the agreement in good faith through a public affairs program presenting \u201creligious topics and speakers.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> NABB disputed that a public affairs format could satisfy the agreement, especially in light of the fact that the Commission itself distinguished between categories of religious and public affairs programming.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The Commission declined, however, to infer \u201csuch a narrow intention\u201d from the agreement\u2019s ambiguous language, especially in light of the substantial discretion in programming choice accorded licensees.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Again, the result reached by the Commission is not unreasonable, despite the obliqueness of its approach. The Commission described what it was doing in the language of contract interpretation, permitting NABB to counter with the allegation that the intention of the parties was in fact contrary; yet it is clear, though implicit, that the Commission concluded that the deviation from the promise, even as alleged, was insufficient to raise a substantial question of licensee integrity or capacity to broadcast in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">In revising the procedures for opposing license renewals, Congress made clear its intention to eliminate wasteful inquiry into immaterial or insubstantial matters. However, summary process, without the safeguards of an adversarial proceeding, makes it even more essential that the Commission clearly state the reasons for its decision on the merits. That it was fairly unsuccessful in doing so in this case is troubling. The function of judicial review is enormously complicated by a failure of clarity on the part of the agency. Ordinarily the appropriate course will be to remand for some explication, for we cannot supply a rationale omitted by the agency. That course is just barely unnecessary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-15\">. <em>KCOP Television, Inc., </em>59 F.C.C.2d 1321 (1976), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>62 F.C.C.2d 93 (1977) .
