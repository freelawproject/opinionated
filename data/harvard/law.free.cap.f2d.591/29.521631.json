The defendants are the Federal Election Commission, the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House, the members of the Commission, and the Attorney General. The plaintiffs seek to challenge the constitutionality of various provisions of the Act which they say restrict their financial activities in the political arena. The issue on this appeal is whether these plaintiffs may invoke the expedited review provision, \u00a7 437h,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and have their constitutional challenges certified for initial review by this court sitting en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">After filing their complaint in the district court, plaintiffs moved, under \u00a7 437h, for immediate certification to this court of the constitutional questions presented. The district court held a hearing and rendered an oral decision denying the motion to certify. The court construed \u00a7 437h to restrict the availability of expedited review to the three types of plaintiffs listed in the first sentence of \u00a7 437h(a): \u201c[t]he [Federal Election] Commission, the national committee of any political party, or any individual eligible to vote [in a Presidential election].\u201d The court held that since \u201cthe plaintiffs in this action do not fall within the group specified in \u00a7 437h, . . . they are not entitled to expedited review ..\u201d The district court did not dismiss the action, however, holding that it did have jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 claims under its ordinary federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">Plaintiffs then moved for the district court to certify the question of whether appellants were plaintiffs entitled to invoke \u00a7 437h for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). The district court granted that motion and this court granted appellants\u2019 subsequent motion for leave to take this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-18\">Construction of \u00a7 437h must begin with the language of the statute itself. Subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tion (a) of \u00a7 437h is the provision for instituting actions for review of the Act and for certifying constitutional questions to the court of appeals sitting en banc. Subsection (a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">(a) The Commission, the national committee of any political party, or any individual eligible to vote in any election for the office of President of the United States may institute such actions in the appropriate district court of the United States, including actions for declaratory judgment, as may be appropriate to construe the constitutionality of any provision of this Act. The district court immediately shall certify all questions of constitutionality of this Act to the United States court of appeals for the circuit involved, which shall hear the matter sitting en banc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">It is clear that the plaintiffs here do not fall within any of the three types of plaintiffs described in the first sentence of subsection (a). The question is, therefore, whether Congress intended to exclude all other plaintiffs from invoking the provisions of \u00a7 437h by naming the three types found in the statute. The district court so held and the defendants support that position on this appeal. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the purpose of \u00a7 437h is to provide expedited review of all challenges to any of the provisions of the Act and that Congress intended to expand notions of standing to achieve that purpose. They conclude that the purpose for naming the three types of plaintiffs specified was not to exclude other plaintiffs, but to remove any doubt that the specified plaintiffs would have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The language of subsection (a) supports the plaintiffs\u2019 construction. The first sentence itself, after specifying three types of eligible plaintiffs, authorizes suits \u201cto construe the constitutionality of <em>any provision </em>of this Act\u201d (emphasis added). This language indicates that Congress intended that constitutional challenges could be brought in the federal courts under \u00a7 437h against every part of the Act. On the other hand, if the specification of the three types of plaintiffs limits the use of \u00a7 437h to those plaintiffs, it is unlikely that every provision of the Act could be challenged under \u00a7 437h. This case illustrates the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The plaintiffs in this case seek to challenge provisions of the Act which regulate the activities of trade associations. If these plaintiffs cannot invoke \u00a7 437h to challenge these provisions, it is doubtful that anyone could do so. This is so because in enacting subsection (a), Congress could not grant the specified plaintiffs standing beyond the limits of Article III. Thus, even the specified plaintiffs would have to show a sufficient \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the outcome of such a suit to satisfy constitutional \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirements. <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 11-12, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976). In a suit like this one \u2014 challenging provisions regulating trade associations and their political action committees\u2014 it is unlikely that any of the specified plaintiffs could show any \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the outcome. If not, under the district court\u2019s construction, \u00a7 437h would be unavailable to challenge the provisions challenged here and the apparent Congressional intent to provide expedited review to attack \u201cany provision\u201d of the Act would be subverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The second sentence in subsection (a) contains additional support for the plaintiffs\u2019 position. That sentence requires the district court to \u201ccertify <em>all </em>questions of constitutionality of this Act\u201d (emphasis added) to the court of appeals sitting en banc. This language further focuses Congress\u2019 intent on the questions presented in a suit such as this, rather than on the identity of the plaintiffs. The direction to certify all constitutional questions indicates again that Congress intended the expedited review procedure to apply broadly to challenges to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Reading the two sentences together, we find an expressed Congressional intent that \u00a7 437h apply to all questions of the constitutionality of any provision of the Act. As noted above, this purpose would be severely restricted if the first sentence is read as an exclusive grant of standing to the three specified plaintiffs to obtain expedited review.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Further support for the plaintiffs\u2019 position is found in the overall structure provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ed in the Act for judicial determination of questions arising under the act. Section 437h provides for actions brought specifically to decide the constitutionality of the Act. Section 437g contains procedures for enforcement of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A comparison of the schemes for review under \u00a7\u00a7 437g and 437h shows the difficulty with the district court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 437h.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Under \u00a7 437g, either the Commission<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or an individual<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> may bring a civil action in a district court to enforce the Act. The decision in such an action may be appealed to the court of appeals, but will only be reviewed by the Supreme Court on a writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 437g(a)(11), an enforcement action must be advanced on the calendar of each court ahead of all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>cases, save those filed under \u00a7 437h. Since challenges to the Act could be raised as defenses in such an enforcement proceeding, \u00a7 437g provides an alternative method for obtaining judicial review of the Act. Such defensive challenges to the Act could be on either constitutional or non-constitutional grounds. And since the entire enforcement proceeding would be advanced on the calendar of each court hearing the matter, both constitutional and non-constitutional challenges raised as defenses would receive this partially expedited review.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In contrast, \u00a7 437h provides that an action brought expressly to challenge the Act on constitutional grounds should receive the even more expedited review outlined in that section and that such actions may be taken to the Supreme Court by direct appeal. And \u00a7 437g(a)(ll) makes it clear that Congress intended \u00a7 437h actions to take precedence even over enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The district court\u2019s construction would add a third method for reviewing the Act. Under that construction, the present plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenge would not be reviewed under either of the statutorily expedited methods. It would proceed through normal three-tier review under ordinary federal question jurisdiction. Thus, non-constitutional challenges in enforcement proceedings would receive more expeditious review than would <em>constitutional </em>challenges brought by plaintiffs other than the three specified in \u00a7 437h(a). While Congress could have discerned differences in the need for expedited review among constitutional challenges raised by different parties, it is difficult to conceive a rationale for viewing any non-constitutional challenge as more urgent than one raising constitutional questions, regardless of the identity of the plaintiffs. Moreover, there is no indication in the language of the statute that Congress did in fact perceive a greater need for speed or ultimate Supreme Court review of constitutional questions raised by the specified plaintiffs than constitutional questions raised by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Based on the language of \u00a7 437h and the overall scheme of judicial review provided in the Act, we hold that \u00a7 437h applies to these plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenge to certain provisions of the Act and that they may invoke the expedited review provision. As we have noted, the language used and the nature of the review mechanism provided in \u00a7 437h show a Congressional intent to allow speedy judicial review of all possible constitutional challenges to any provision of the Act and to make certain that such challenges would be decided by the Supreme Court. Thus three Congressional purposes are clear: comprehensive review, speedy review, and ultimate review by our highest court of constitutional challenges to the Act. The district court\u2019s construction that Congress intended to restrict standing to invoke \u00a7 437h to the specified plaintiffs is inconsistent with these expressed purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">There is no indication in the language of the statute of any intent to exclude any plaintiffs who have standing under traditional rules. In our view, Congress intended to expand the limits of standing under \u00a7 437h to the extent possible under Article III. This intent is wholly consistent with the expressed purposes of the statute. Under this view, Congress\u2019 purpose for naming the three types of plaintiffs found in subsection (a) was to insure, within constitutional limits, their standing to raise constitutional challenges to the Act. Congress may well have entertained doubts about the standing of the specified plaintiffs to challenge many of the Act\u2019s provisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Congress apparently thought that it was important that those plaintiffs, in addition to others with obvious personal interest in the restrictions imposed by the Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> be allowed to test the constitutionality of the Act. Each of the specified plaintiffs has a generalized interest in the operation of the entire Act, which may not have provided standing under the prudential rules of the federal courts, <em>see Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), but which Congress may have deemed sufficiently important, due to the central role of each specified plaintiff in the election process, to justify a Congressional grant of standing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, id. </em>at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The sparse legislative history of \u00a7 437h adds little to the analysis of its purpose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to case law, the decisions in <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <em>aff\u2019g in part and rev\u2019g in part, </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 519 F.2d 821 (1975), strongly support our construction of \u00a7 437h. In <em>Buckley, </em>the original plaintiffs included four individuals and the following organizations: the Committee for a Constitutional Presidency \u2014 McCarthy \u201976, the Conservative Party of the State of New York, the Mississippi Republican Party, the Libertarian Party, the New York Civil Liberties Union, the American Conservative Union, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the Conservative Victory Fund, and Human Events, Inc. It is clear that few, if any, of these organizations could be classified as the \u201cnational committee of any political party\u201d so as to fit within the specified groups in \u00a7 437h. The district court in <em>Buckley, </em>in certifying the case to the court of appeals, impliedly read \u00a7 437h as the district court here did, as an exclusive grant of standing to the parties specified. The <em>Buckley </em>court held that the four individual plaintiffs had standing and explicitly left to the court of appeals the question of the standing of the organizational plaintiffs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The court of appeals, however, expressed no similar reservations about the standing of the organizational plaintiffs and remanded the case to the district court for the taking of necessary evidence and certification of resulting constitutional questions, without dismissing any of the named plaintiffs. Moreover, the court of appeals granted leave to intervene to three more organizations, the Center for Public Financing of Elections, Common Cause, and the League of Women Voters, none of which even arguably fit within the groups specified in the statute. Finally, in its opinion on the merits, the court of appeals described \u00a7 437h as \u201ca broad grant of legislative standing to sue . \u201d and considered only whether that grant was so broad as to violate the Article III case or controversy requirement, without reference to the standing of the organizational plaintiffs still present in the case. 519 F.2d at 850-851.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The strongest authority for our decision is the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the standing issue in <em>Buckley. </em>After noting the presence of the organizational parties to the case, the Court turned to the issue of jurisdiction and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">It is clear that Congress, in enacting [\u00a7 437h], intended to provide judicial review to the extent permitted by Art. III. In our view, the complaint in this case demonstrates that at least some of the appellants have a sufficient \u201cpersonal stake\u201d10 in a determination of the constitutional validity of each of the challenged provisions .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">424 U.S. at 11-12, 96 S.Ct. at 631. Footnote 10 from the quoted part of the opinion stated in part: \u201cThis Court has held, for instance, that an organization \u2018may assert, on behalf of its members, a right personal to them to be protected from compelled disclosure ... of their affiliation.\u2019 <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 458, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1170, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958). . \u201d We cannot read the quoted language as other than a clear holding that Congress intended to expand traditional no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tions of standing to the limits of Article III. And footnote 10 makes it clear that organizations may have standing under \u00a7 437h if they otherwise meet the requirements for \u201cassociational standing.\u201d <em>See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission, </em>432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In sum, the decisions in <em>Buckley </em>fully support our construction of \u00a7 437h(a) and our holding that the plaintiffs in this case have standing to invoke its expedited review procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The district court, because of its jurisdictional stance, refused to certify any constitutional questions raised by the complaint. In addition, counsel for the defendants represented at argument that there are disputed fact issues in the case. For these reasons, the case will be remanded to the district court for the certification required by \u00a7 437h(a). On remand the district court should: (1) identify the constitutional and fact issues raised by the complaint; (2) take whatever evidence the court finds necessary to a decision of those issues; (3) make findings of fact; and (4) certify the assembled record and the constitutional questions arising therefrom to this court for decision pursuant to \u00a7 437h. The district court should, of course, expedite the above procedures to the greatest possible extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The order of the district court denying certification under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437h(a) is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\">. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437h provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\u00a7 437h.

The standing of the Commission to challenge the constitutional validity of the statute it was created to enforce may have been doubted on the basis of conflicting case law. Older cases held that an agency or officer has no standing in the federal courts to challenge the statute the agency or officer is bound to enforce. <em>Columbus &amp; Greenville R. Co. v.

Such a view might lead to a finding of no standing under prudential rules. <em>Warth v.

Persons with this kind of interest in the Act would include candidates and the plaintiffs in this case due to the direct regulation of their conduct by the Act. This direct action of the statute upon such persons brings them squarely within traditional notions of standing to assert the invalidity of the imposed restrictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">. It should be noted that the doubts about standing discussed here are distinguished from those expressed earlier regarding the standing of the specified plaintiffs to undertake the challenges asserted by the plaintiffs here. There it was doubted whether the specified plaintiffs could show a sufficient personal stake to have standing in the constitutional sense to attack those provisions. If not, \u00a7 437h could not be invoked by anyone to mount such an attack if the district court\u2019s narrow reading of the statute were accepted. Here we discuss doubts possibly held by Congress under prudential standing rules, as to the standing of the specified plaintiffs to seek review of any provision of the Act. It is clear from <em>Warth, supra, </em>that Congress had the power to remove any such doubts and to grant standing to the limits of Article III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b108-12\">. Only two references to \u00a7 437h in the debates over the Act have been cited by the parties or found by our research. In introducing the amendment which added \u00a7 437h, Senator Buckley said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">[I]t is a modification that I am sure will prove acceptable to the managers of the bill. It merely provides for the expeditious review of the constitutional question I have raised. I am sure we will all agree that if, in fact, there is a serious question as to the constitutionality of this legislation, it is in the interest of everyone to have the question determined by the Supreme Court at the earliest possible time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">120 Cong.Rec. 10562 (1974). And in the House, Representative Frenzel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-15\">I believe within this conference report there are at least 100 items questionable from a constitutional standpoint. Any time we pass legislation in this field we are causing constitutional doubts to be raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-16\">I do call the attention of the gentleman to the fact that any individual under this bill has a direct method to raise these questions and to have those considered as quickly as possible by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">120 Cong.Rec. 35140 (1974). Neither statement addresses the issue of who may invoke \u00a7 437h and who may not; both merely restate the purposes expressed in the statute that review be speedy and that the questions be answered by the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b109-5\">. After holding that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek review under \u00a7 437h, the district court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">It is not so clear, however, that each of the five organizational plaintiffs possesses the same requisite standing. This is so because obviously none is eligible to vote for the office of President in any election. It is unclear, in the present procedural posture of plaintiffs\u2019 case, whether any of the named organizational plaintiffs may be \u201cthe national committee of any political party\u201d within the meaning of the relevant statute. Since at least some of the plaintiffs have the requisite standing, and since the ultimate decision as to the standing of others may have to await further exploration, in the interests of time, this Court defers to the Court of Appeals on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-12\"><em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>387 F.Supp. 135, 142 n.14 (D.D.C.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b109-13\">. We are aware that two members of the D.C. Circuit appear to have since espoused a narrow construction of the standing granted by \u00a7 437h. <em>See Clark v. Valeo, </em>182 U.S.App.D.C. 21, 40, 559 F.2d 642, 661 (1977) (Leventhal, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>182 U.S.App.D.C. at 46 and 53, 559 F.2d at 667 and 674 (Robinson, J., dissenting). We regard these apparent views as inconsistent with the position taken by the whole court in <em>Buckley </em>in accepting all of the original plaintiffs and in allowing intervention by other organizations. Cf. <em>Clark, id. </em>182 U.S.App.D.C. at 32-36, 559 F.2d at 653-657 (Tamm, J., concurring) (three judges discussed the standing of the United States to invoke \u00a7 437h without reference to the list of plaintiffs in the statute and concluded that the United States lacked standing because it could not show any \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to satisfy Art. III.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\">. We have held recently that a trade association had \u201corganizational standing\u201d to challenge local ordinances authorizing inspection of meat delivery vehicles, applying the test set out in <em>Hunt, supra. Chicago-Midwest Meat Association v. City of Evanston, </em>589 F.2d 278 (7th Cir. 1978). It is clear that some of the trade associations here also satisfy the <em>Hunt </em>test. The complaint alleges that the challenged provisions of the Act violate the First Amendment rights of the organizations and their members, some of whom are individuals, by interfering with the organizations\u2019 ability to gather and expend funds to express their views on political matters. From this it appears that (1) the individual members of the organizations would have standing under \u00a7 437h and could show a personal stake in the constitutional questions raised; (2) the First Amendment questions are germane to the political purposes of the organizations here; and (3) since the complaint seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief, participation of the individual members is not required. <em>See Chicago-Midwest Meat Association, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 280-281.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b110-9\">TONE, Circuit Judge, concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">If it were not for <em>Buckley v.
