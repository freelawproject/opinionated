In their petition the appellees raise the argument that they are not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and are not liable for attorneys\u2019 fees under the Civil Rights\u2019 Attorneys\u2019 Fees Awards Act of 1976 since they have not been properly sued pursuant to any of the statutes specified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>that Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The individual appellees, the President of Jackson State . College and the President, Executive Secretary and members of the Board of Trustees of Institutions of Higher Learning of the State of Mississippi, were properly sued in their official capacities for injunctive relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>See, e. g., Thurston v. Dekle, </em>531 F.2d 1264 (CA5, 1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the suit was properly and successfully brought under \u00a7 1983, Rainey is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the 1976 Act. We did not state in our previous opinion, 551 F.2d 672 (CA5, 1977), the precise source for payment of these fees. Rainey is entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from the defendant state officials in their official capacities. <em>See Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284, 1298 (CA5, 1978) (construing <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Except to the extent herein granted, the petitions for rehearing are DENIED. No member of this panel nor judge in regular active service on the court having requested that the court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the petition for rehearing en banc of appellees is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">The appellant\u2019s petition for attorneys\u2019 fees for work done on appeal is GRANTED, and a fee of $1,500 is awarded. Appellant\u2019s petition for additional fees for pre-appeal work is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1077-17\">. In our previous opinion on the attorneys\u2019 fees aspect of this case, 551 F.2d 672 (1977), we held that because a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees was before the court and had not yet been ruled upon at the time the 1976 Attorneys\u2019 Fees Act was passed, the case was \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of that Act. Accordingly we awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under the provisions of the 1976 Act. This holding was distinguished but not questioned in <em>Henry v. Clarksdale Municipal Separate School District, </em>579 F.2d 916, 918-19 (CA5, 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1077-20\">. We need not consider the effect of <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), on the amenability to \u00a7 1983 suit of the institutional defendant Jackson State College.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
