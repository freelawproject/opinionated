Plaintiff-appellant, Flower City Painting Contractors, Inc. (\u201cFlower\u201d) is a newly formed painting contracting firm in Rochester, New York, owned and managed by black minority personnel. Defendantappellee, Gumina Construction Company (\u201cGumina\u201d) is an Ohio company with its principal place of business in Lorain, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Gumina entered into a prime contract with the FIGHT Village Housing Development Fund Company, Inc., for the construction of a garden type apartment project called \u201cFIGHT Village,\u201d on March 12, 1973. The project was federally funded and developed under the auspices of the Federal Housing Authority of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d). Pursuant to Executive Order No. 11246, which prohibits employment discrimination by Government contractors, HUD regulations and the terms of the prime contract required the prime contractor to undertake an affirmative action program that included efforts to recruit and hire minority subcontractors. HUD Contract Compliance Handbook 8000.6 at 27 (1972). Compliance was a condition of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Part of Gumina\u2019s affirmative action obligation was satisfied by its award of a subcontract for painting in the FIGHT Village to Flower on April 16, 1973. As indicated by the cost breakdown summary sheet attached to the prime contract, the total anticipated cost of painting and decorating the <em>entire </em>FIGHT project was to be $101,-000. This estimation of cost was significant, since an excess of cost in one aspect could have caused a cost overrun that would cut into the prime contractor\u2019s profits. The subcontract executed with Flower provided that Flower was to be paid $98,499.84 for its work, a sum that was roughly only $2500 less than the maximum allotted for painting and decorating the entire project.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The terms of the Gumina-Flower subcontract included the language of Flower\u2019s original bid on the subcontract which was incorporated <em>in haec verba </em>as Schedule A of the subcontract. That Schedule reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cSCHEDULE A\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">The painting of the above mentioned project in accordance with the painting specifications and plans for this project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">1. One bedroom units $*335.00 per unit $*17,420.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">2. Two bedroom units $*371.00 per unit $*28,196.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">3. Three bedroom units $*428.00 per unit $*29,960.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">4. Four bedroom units $*477.58 per unit $*22,923.84</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\">A Total of: $*98,499.84</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-15\">Please note: price given reflects no bonding requirement and a non-union job operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">The subcontract also incorporated by reference the prime contract, drawings, addenda, and specifications, as well as modifications subsequently issued. Indeed, Schedule A made specific reference to the contract specifications and plans in defining the scope of the subcontractor\u2019s work. The subcontract further provided that the subcontractor would \u201cfaithfully observe all requirements and conditions set forth by plans and specifications on file at the F.H.A. Office in Buffalo, N.Y. . . .,\u201d and that these documents were to be \u201cavailable for inspection by the Subcontractor upon his request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">On March 18, 1974, nearly one year after Flower entered into the subcontract, it asserted in a letter to Gumina that the contract required Flower to paint interior walls of the individual apartment units only and that Flower was not obligated to paint exteriors or common buildings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 25, 1974, Flower received from Gumina a copy of Article II of the subcontract with additional explanatory language typed in as a reminder of obligations which Gumina insisted that Flower had under its subcontract. This notation stated: \u201cIt is further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>understood that this contract includes all exterior work, (encompasses all work, within specs and drawings) except exterior siding. The community building is also a part of this contract.\u201d On March 29, 1974, the president of Flower submitted to Gumina an itemization of additional costs for this \u201cexterior work,\u201d claiming that it was not required to do the painting of apartment laundry rooms, storage rooms, and hallways, as well as of exterior doors, trim and certain common buildings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 4, 1974 (the letter was erroneously dated March 4), Gumina responded to Flower\u2019s demand for extra payments by reiterating that the exterior work specified by Flower as requiring additional payment, was work which had already been agreed upon. Gumina, in the same letter, though the work had not yet begun, cancelled the contract. Appellant sued Gumina for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">At trial, Gumina defended its removal of Flower on the ground that the latter had misinterpreted the contract, and that by insisting upon extra payment for the painting of exteriors Flower had refused to comply with the terms of \u2014 and had thereby repudiated \u2014 the existing subcontract. Flower maintained the converse position: that Gumina had unilaterally attempted to enlarge the scope of Flower\u2019s obligation under the contract by requiring work outside the individual \u201cunit\u201d interiors. The trial court accepted the contract interpretation offered by Gumina. It found, despite Flower\u2019s contentions that it had been hired to paint only the walls <em>in </em>the \u201cunits,\u201d that, on the contrary, neither the subcontract nor the specifications incorporated by reference excluded common hallways, storage areas, laundry rooms, or exterior surfaces of FIGHT Village. The court determined that the specifications required the painting of \u201c \u2018all surfaces except those specifically excluded.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The court held that Flower committed a breach of contract \u201cby asking for extra pay for work it was obligated to do under its contract.\u201d It found that \u201cFlower City unequivocally declared its refusal to perform according to the contract\u201d and that \u201ccancellation was the proper response by Gumina Construction.\u201d It was on that basis that the complaint was dismissed after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">On this appeal, the defendant contends that an alternative ground upon which to uphold dismissal of Flower\u2019s suit is that no subcontract was actually formed between Flower and Gumina because there was no \u201cmeeting of the minds.\u201d This issue was not expressly considered by the District Court, although the assumption that a contract existed as interpreted by Gumina is implicit in its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">If we hold Flower strictly to its obligation to recognize that the specifications were part of the subcontract, then its claim for additional payment as a condition of performance was unjustified, as Judge Burke found. This, in turn, would raise the question whether a refusal to perform part of an alleged contract, except in accordance with one\u2019s own interpretation, is a repudiation. If so, we would then have to decide whether such a repudiation by Flower was sufficiently material to be treated as a justification for unilateral rescission by Gumina. Thus, if we adopted the approach of the court below that there was a contract, even aside from the issue of what were its obligations, we would have considerable difficulty in weighing the correctness of the conclusion of law that there had been a repudiation sufficient to justify an immediate unilateral rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">We think, however, that this thorny problem need not be reached. Rather, we have concluded \u2014 using the objective criterion of judgment \u2014 that there was no meeting of the minds in the first instance and that, hence, there never was a contract enforcible by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Viewing the subcontract itself as written, both Flower\u2019s and Gumina\u2019s interpretations of the document are plausible. The description of the subject matter of the contract in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Schedule A in terms of \u201cunits\u201d and the fact that the total bid listed is the aggregate of the bids on the individual units suggest that nothing more was required to be painted than the actual units themselves. On the other hand, the incorporation of the specifications with their delineation of exterior painting chores and the use of the word \u201cproject\u201d in Schedule A indicate that the scope of the work encompassed all painting in FIGHT City.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Resolution of this ambiguity might be effected by construing the contract on the assumption that it incorporated the habitual or customary practice of the construction industry in Rochester, New York, that painting subcontracts be awarded on an entire project basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Such usage, if operative, may be proved by parol, as was done here. <em>See, e. g., Division of Triple T Service, Inc. v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>60 Misc.2d 720, 730-31, 304 N.Y.S.2d 191 (Sup.Ct.1969). But proof of the usage is not enough by itself to establish the meaning of the contract, for \u201c[a] party cannot be bound by usage unless he either knows or has reason to know of its existence and nature.\u201d Restatement (First) of Contracts \u00a7 247, comment b. <em>See Walls v. Bailey, </em>49 N.Y. 464 (1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In an ordinary situation involving the painting subcontract on a construction job in Rochester, the court could find as a fact that a painting contractor \u201cknows or has reason to know of [this usage\u2019s] existence and nature.\u201d It seems clear enough that Flower actually did <em>not </em>know the usage, as its President testified, and the court made no finding to the contrary. The question whether Flower had \u201creason to know\u201d is the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Flower was brought into the picture by the imposition on the contractor of an affirmative action program. While competence to do the job must have been the assumption of the Regulation, experience in the trade was not. Flower was a neophyte minority painting contractor. This was its first substantial subcontract on a construction job. It would be unrealistic to hold it strictly to a \u201creason to know\u201d standard of trade usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">The consequence of ruling that <em>Flower </em>cannot be held to trade usage is recognition, however, that the contract document could represent two different understandings of what the subject matter embraced. This means that <em>Gumina, </em>as well, was not bound since it takes two to make a contract. Unfortunately, there was no contract to enforce <em>in favor of Flower, </em>as there would have been no contract to enforce <em>against Flower </em>if Gumina had been the plaintiff in an action for breach. And we cannot say that either party acted so unreasonably as to justify construing the ambiguity in the contract against it. Each party, in fact, held a different and reasonable view of the undertaking, Flower on the basis of its literal reading of the word \u201cunits\u201d and Gumina because of its suppositions concerning trade practice and its awareness that Flower was to be paid virtually the entire sum allocated to painting the FIGHT City project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Though the setting is new, the problem is old. In two nineteenth century cases, <em>Raffles </em>v. <em>Wichelhaus, </em>159 Eng.Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864) (the famous <em>\u201cPeerless\u201d </em>case) and <em>Kyle v. Kavanagh, </em>103 Mass. 356 (1869), courts, when faced with an arguably material contract term that could mean or represent two different things, found that no contract existed. <em>See O. </em>Holmes, <em>The Common Law </em>309-10 (1881).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Judge Pollack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>noted in <em>Oswald </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>285 F.Supp. 488, 492 (S.D.N.Y.1968), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>417 F.2d 43 (2d Cir. 1969), the essence of the <em>Raffles </em>opinion was that \u201cneither party had reason to know of the latent ambiguity. . . .\u201d The rule of <em>Raffles </em>and <em>Kyle </em>was adopted and more fully formulated in the Restatement (First) of Contracts \u00a7 71(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">If the manifestations of intention of either party are uncertain or ambiguous, and he has no reason to know that they may bear a different meaning to the other party from that which he himself attaches to them, his manifestations are operative in the formation of a contract <em>only </em>in the event that the other party attaches to them the same meaning. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\"><em>Accord, Oswald </em>v. <em>Allen, supra; Julius Kayser &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc., </em>228 F.2d 783, 789-90 (4th Cir. 1956); <em>Hayford </em>v. <em>Century Insurance Co., </em>106 N.H. 242, 209 A.2d 716, 718 (1965); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Dutch, </em>140 Cal2d 891, 296 P.2d 34 (Cal.App.1956); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 21A (tent, draft); 3 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 599, at 593-97; 1 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 95, at 344-48 (3d ed. Jaeger); Young, <em>Equivocation in Agreements, </em>64 Colum.L.Rev. 619, 621 (1964); <em>see Dadourian Export Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>291 F.2d 178, 187 &amp; n. 4 (2d Cir. 1961) (Friendly, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We affirm the judgment of dismissal on the ground that no enforcible contract ever came into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The dissenting opinion, finding a contract as interpreted by Flower, relies upon some testimony by Ellison, president of Flower, that he was told by the superintendent for Gumina in March 1974 \u2014 almost a year after the putative \u201ccontract\u201d was signed \u2014 that there had been some \u201cchanges\u201d since the signing and that the Gumina superintendent, therefore, had to add a \u201cpiece of contract document.\u201d The dissenting opinion finds that this bit of testimony indicated that Gumina was \u201credefining the scope of the work by a \u2018further understanding\u2019 \u201d and concludes that \u201c[cjlearly, Gumina made an initial mistake and then tried to get Flower to change the contract.\u201d Dissent op. at 168. But we are not the trial court, and this conclusion rests upon an opinion as to the credibility of a witness whom Judge Burke heard, and whom we have never seen. If Judge Burke had believed this parol evidence, it would have amounted to an admission regarding the construction of the contract by Gumina. Although this testimony was admitted, Judge Burke found, nevertheless, that the \u201cpiece\u201d of document Flower received from Gumina later in March was \u201ca copy of Article II of the subcontract, with additional explanatory language as a <em>reminder of obligations Flower City had under its subcontract.\u201d </em>Finding No. 14 [emphasis added]. One may assume, therefore, that, in reaching Finding No. 14, Judge Burke rejected Ellison\u2019s testimony to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-14\">. The jurisdictional basis for consideration of this suit was not discussed below. The complaint asserted federal question jurisdiction only under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 with regard to claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the District Judge\u2019s findings make it evident that there is actual diversity of citizenship as well as the requisite jurisdictional amount.</p>\n<p id=\"AVB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The trial court did not make any specific rulings with respect to plaintiffs civil rights claims, which do not appear to have entered into the trial. On this appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial judge denied it the opportunity to present evidence on the discrimination issue. The record reveals no effort to present such a case. The contention that the trial judge was unfair is without merit. We do not consider the appropriateness of the statutory provisions the plaintiff invokes as a basis for its discrimination cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-21\">. There is some indication that this opening salvo was preceded by discussion. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b238-12\">. The extra work was estimated to cost an additional $14,545.17, about 15 percent of the subcontract price.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\">. We do note, however, that Flower\u2019s people expected to make a profit of about $60,000 on this $98,000 contract, which may be some indication that their view of the scope of the work was unrealistic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b239-10\">. There is an even earlier case in which the problem was considered at some length by Justice Story sitting as Circuit Justice. In <em>Hazard v. New England Marine Ins. Co., </em>11 Fed.Cases 934 (C.C.D.Mass.1832) (No. 6,282), the question arose as to whether the term \u201ccoppered ship\u201d in a marine insurance contract was to be understood according to the usage in the shipowner\u2019s home port of New York or according to usage in the underwriters\u2019 city of Boston: the underwriters, defending a suit on the contract, maintained that the plaintiff had not provided a coppered ship as promised, while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>plaintiff argued that the ship was coppered as he understood it. At one point in Justice Story\u2019s instructions to the jury, he charged that if the plaintiff and the underwriters had differing understandings of the term \u201ccoppered\u201d and if neither had cause to know of the other\u2019s understanding, then no contract should be deemed formed because there was mutual mistake. <em>Id. </em>at 936-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">On appeal, the judgment for the underwriters was reversed. <em>Hazard\u2019s Admin, v. Marine Insurance Co., </em>33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 557 (1834). The Supreme Court reasoned that underwriters should be presumed to be aware of the usages of their clients as a matter of <em>their </em>business. The \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d question was not extensively considered in the reported oral argument; the participants viewed the real choice to be between accepting the shipowner\u2019s or the underwriters\u2019 interpretations and enforcing the contract one way or another.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b240-13\">OAKES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AyI\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">I respectfully dissent and would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">It seems to me that we must construe the original contract against the general contractor who prepared it. To be sure, the parties based that contract on a proposal, which Flower submitted and Gumina accepted, stated precisely in the terms of the schedule attached to the contract. But Gu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>mina had indicated to Flower that the proposal was in the form necessary to win the bid; and it was important to Gumina for purposes of the affirmative action program required under HUD regulations, majority op. at 163, that Flower obtain the painting subcontract. As the majority notes, Schedule A does refer to the \u201cpainting of the above mentioned project in accordance with the painting specifications and plans for this project\u201d; but it also specifically itemizes the work and the price in terms of the one, two, three, and four bedroom units, stating a price per unit, then the total price for each size apartment, and finally a grand total for all units of all sizes which equals the contract price of $98,-499.84. To my mind this schedule means exactly that the painting envisioned under the contract included only the \u201cunits\u201d themselves and that the exterior, the community building, and the interior halls were not included. Indeed there was evidence that when Flower submitted its proposal the interior halls were going to be brick and <em>not </em>painted at all.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The contract itself, consisting of a standard American Institute of Architects (AIA) Subcontract of seven printed pages which the parties had completed in full by typewriting and duly executed along with a typewritten two-page rider and the \u201cSchedule A,\u201d refers to the scope of the work as follows in Article 2, entitled \u201cThe Work\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac1\">The Subcontractor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment and shall perform all the Work . . . described in Schedule A attached hereto and made a part hereof as if fully set forth in this space.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">The subcontractor further agrees that it will faithfully observe all requirements and conditions set forth by plans and specifications on file at the F.H.A. Office in Buffalo, N.Y. and identified as F.H.A. Project No. 014-44028-NP-R-SUP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Thus, it is Schedule A itself, duly quoted in the majority opinion at 163 and not repeated here, that sets forth the scope of the work. To be sure, in the second paragraph of Article 2, the subcontractor specifically agreed to observe \u201call requirements and conditions set forth by plans and specifications on file.\u201d But it does not seem to me that those words can be construed to cover work other than that specified in Schedule A, the incorporated description of the work under the contract. The subcontractor, Flower, promised to observe the \u201crequirements and conditions\u201d set forth in the plans and specifications, including the general conditions and standards and the modifications and supplements thereto as well as the requirements and conditions in the painting specifications as to quality and type of paint, method of application, and the like. I do not see, however, that any of these requirements and conditions adds to the <em>scope </em>of the painting work to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The majority relies on the introductory clause in Schedule A reading, \u201cThe painting of the above mentioned project in accordance with the painting specifications and plans for this project.\u201d But the particular governs the general, and immediately below the quoted caption the schedule lists the per unit figures for the different size apartments and sets out a total price for size representing the price for the total number of units of each size. Moreover, the introductory clause in Schedule A does not say <em>\u201call </em>painting in the above mentioned project\u201d; it says \u201cthe painting of the above mentioned project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The majority suggests that had Flower examined Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 5, the prime contract with the cost breakdown for each type of labor and materials, which indicates a total painting cost of $101,000, Flower would have known that Gumina would require the painting of the exterior work, interior hallways, and the community building in addition to the units themselves for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>less than $101,000 and that given Flower\u2019s contract for $98,499.84, the contractor would go over his projection for painting costs unless Flower did all the painting. I do not think, however, that we can hold the subcontractor to this kind of knowledge simply because the prime contract was on file. A contractor can over- or underestimate a particular portion of the work, and here Flower followed Gumina\u2019s own suggestions as to price, proposal format, and scope of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">If there were any doubt as to the meaning of the subcontract \u2014 and it seems to me there cannot be because of the undisputed evidence that the general contractor, Gumina, drew the contract and that Flower submitted the proposal precisely in the terms of Schedule A at Gumina\u2019s specific request \u2014 the subsequent conduct of the parties is quite compelling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gumma\u2019s field superintendent, Brian Smith, asked Flower\u2019s president and general superintendent, Michael Ellison, to bring a copy of the contract \u201cover to the job site.\u201d He then \u201cinformed [Ellison] that since we had signed the contract, there had been some changes and he needed to get [Ellison\u2019s] copy of [the] contract so that he could add a piece of contract document to [the contract].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That \u201cpiece of contract document\u201d was a new AIA subcontract page covering Articles 1-4 inclusive and redefining the scope of the work by a \u201cfurther understanding,\u201d namely that all exterior work and the community building were included (at the original price).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Smith told Ellison \u201cthat he didn\u2019t think the exteriors or the common interior hallways were included\u201d and that he thought that Ellison \u201cought to amend the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly, Gumina made an initial mistake and then tried to get Flower to change the contract. There had been a meeting of the minds on the terms of the contract as stated in Schedule A; but one party, the one in the more favorable bargaining position and the one which had drawn the contract, had made a unilateral mistake. It does not need citation of authority to suggest that this kind of mistake does not permit repudiation, rescission, or modification of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">In short, I believe that Gumina entered into and breached a valid, enforceable contract with Flower and that the case should be remanded for the ascertainment of damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">. Michael Ellison, president and general superintendent of Flower, testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">The General Contractor informed us what had to be painted on the Fight Village project, because the preliminary specs were not complete. So he told me the public hallways there were going to be brick, so it was to my understanding from the General Contractor that was not going to be painted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-5\">. The majority opinion says simply that nearly one year after Flower entered into the subcontract it asserted in a letter of March 18, 1974, that the contract required interior painting only. This recitation of the events omits the testimony referred to in text in this opinion immediately <em>infra; </em>it also omits the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">A. After we received the copy of the contract back from the General Contractor, it must have been about a month or so later we received a letter from the General Contractor asking us to post a performance and payment bond. And our contract bid proposal was stated, \u201cNo bond or union required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">Q. Did you submit a performance bond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">Q. Did you submit any other instruments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">A. Yes. What we did, we turned it over to our attorney, and he wrote the General Contractor a letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">Q. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">A. We heard nothing else from the General Contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">(Testimony of Michael Ellison.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-16\">. This was the undisputed testimony of Mr. Ellison. Gumina never called its field superintendent, Mr. Smith, to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b242-17\">. I note that even the addition to the contract does not mention the interior hallways.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b242-18\">. As Flower was subsequently to write Gumina, on April 11, 1974 (Ex. 8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-19\">In respond <em>[sic] </em>to your letter dated March 4, 1974, wherein you stated that we proposed additional cost for items already agreed upon in our formal contract, there must be a lack in communication between your field office and your home office. Mr. Bryant <em>[sic] </em>Smith advised our company to submit a price for the items that were not a part of our original contract. We have met three or four times to discuss these matters. Mr Bryant Smith gave us a set of plans, in order that we might apply cost to these additions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b242-20\">. I agree with the majority on the argument pertaining to custom in the trade. If the contract were really ambiguous such evidence might be admissible generally, but it would not be admissible against Flower in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">The trial judge made a number of findings pertaining to damages; but these do not in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>view support his conclusion, among others, that Flower \u201cfailed to establish a rational basis for its assertion of lost profit and failed to prove prospective lost profits with reasonable particularity and certainty.\u201d <em>Flower City Painting Contractors, Inc. v. Gumina Constr. Co., </em>Civ.No.74-552, at 9 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 1978). The evidence was somewhat vague and conclusory but, with all respect, not so uncertain in my view as to require dismissal of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
