WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b574-22\">Reichardt, a resident of California, sued on behalf of herself and others similarly situated alleging unlawful discrimination in the sale of disability insurance. She complained that disability policies sold by the defendant insurance companies and approved by the California State Insurance Commissioner discriminate against women who cannot obtain coverage for as long a period, must wait longer for benefits, and are charged higher premiums than are men. She alleged that these differences were actuarially not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-23\">She alleged four causes of action:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-24\">(1) that the Commissioner, by approving the forms of disability policies, has deprived her and her class of their civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-25\">(2) that the Commissioner, by the same acts, has effected a deprivation of rights in violation of California law;</p>\n<p id=\"b574-26\">(3) that the named insurers and the class they represent have conspired to deprive her and her class of civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985(3);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>(4) that the Life Insurance Company of North America (LINA) inflicted emotional distress upon her by its discriminatory policy-</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The district court granted defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion as to the \u00a7 1988 claim against the insurance companies and the emotional distress claim against LINA, but denied it as to the \u00a7 1983 claim against the insurance commissioner and the \u00a7 1985(3) claim against the insurance companies. The district court certified interlocutory appeals from its refusal to dismiss the latter two claims. We accepted jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Reichardt has not appealed the dismissal of her other claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">To state a claim under \u00a7 1983 the challenged action must have been taken \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d The district court found the Commissioner\u2019s approval of the discriminatory insurance policy forms sufficient state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The Supreme Court has declared that \u201cwhere the impetus for the discrimination is private, the State must have \u2018significantly involved itself with [the] invidious discriminations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, </em>407 U.S. 163, 173, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 1971, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972) (quoting in part <em>Reitman v. Mulkey, </em>387 U.S. 369, 380, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 18 L.Ed.2d 830 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">Accordingly, the Court has found significant involvement when a state encouraged private discrimination, <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Public Utilities Comm\u2019n v. Pollak, </em>343 U.S. 451, 72 S.Ct. 813, 96 L.Ed. 1068 (1952); commanded the discrimination, <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 267, 83 S.Ct. 1122, 10 L.Ed.2d 338 (1963); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Greenville, </em>373 U.S. 244, 83 S.Ct. 1119, 10 L.Ed.2d 323 (1963); heavily subsidized the discriminator, <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961) (symbiotic relationship); or enforced the discrimination, <em>Shelley v. Kraemer, </em>334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">Courts have refused to find state action, however, where a state merely regulates the business conduct, <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 350, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974); <em>Watkins v. Mercy Medical Center, </em>520 F.2d 894, 896 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Martin v. PNB, </em>441 F.2d 1116 (9th Cir. 1971); extends ordinary government benefits to the discriminator, <em>Moose Lodge, </em>407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627; licenses the discriminator, <em>id.; Szijarto v. Legeman, </em>466 F.2d 864 (9th Cir. 1972); or fails to disapprove the discriminatory practice, <em>Jackson, </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477; <em>Moose Lodge, </em>407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">Determining whether there has been sufficient state action to give rise to a claim under \u00a7 1983 requires a sifting of the circumstances of each case. <em>Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. at 722, 81 S.Ct. 856.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We must determine here the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>to which the state has become involved with the insurance companies\u2019 alleged discrimination as a result of its Insurance Commissioner\u2019s approval of the form of the alleged discriminatory policies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Insurers doing business in California must submit their policy forms to the Insurance Commissioner for approval. Their policies may be issued only on his approval or his inaction for 30 days.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s act of approving a form of policy does not necessarily result in discrimination. The state does not command the discrimination. <em>See Moose Lodge, </em>407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627. The record suggests that the Commissioner\u2019s approval was pro forma as in <em>Jackson, </em>419 U.S. at 357, 95 S.Ct. 449; rather than an approval after full investigation of matters as in <em>Public Utilities Comm\u2019n v. Pollak. </em>The Commissioner has placed no official imprimatur on the practice of which Reichardt complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Mere state action is insufficient to support a \u00a7 1983 cause of action. There must be a sufficient nexus between the state action and the private discrimination. Here the nexus is insufficient. The private carriers decided whether and to whom such policies would issue. We find insufficient state action to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">SECTION 1985(3) CLAIM AGAINST THE INSURANCE COMPANIES</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">In <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971), the Supreme Court enumerated the elements of a cause of action under \u00a7 1985(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aie\">a complaint must allege that the defendants did (1) \u201cconspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another\u201d (2) \u201cfor the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.\u201d It must then assert that one or more of the conspirators (3) did, or caused to be done, \u201cany act in furtherance of the object of [the] conspiracy,\u201d whereby another was (4a) \u201cinjured in his person or property\u201d or (4b) \u201cdeprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-15\"><em>Id., </em>at 102-03, 91 S.Ct. at 1798-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">We shall first determine whether the statutory elements of the \u00a7 1985(3) cause of action have been satisfied. We then discuss the propriety of the parties\u2019 arguments regarding congressional power to regulate the conduct sought to be proscribed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">(a) <em>Statutory Elements of \u00a7 1985(3).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-18\">Reichardt\u2019s complaint sets forth enough facts to support her allegation of a conspiracy, satisfying the first element sufficiently to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Similarly, the issuance of the alleged discriminatory policy is enough to satisfy the third and fourth elements. Our analysis focuses then on the second element of the \u00a7 1985(3) claim which, in turn, has two requirements: (1) violation of a protected right, and (2) an invidiously discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>natory class-based animus motivating the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">(1) <em>Violation of a protected right.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><em>Griffin </em>made it unmistakably clear that \u00a7 1985(3) was intended to reach private conspiracies: \u201cIt is thus evident that all indicators \u2014 text, companion provisions, and legislative history \u2014 point unwaveringly to \u00a7 1985(3)\u2019s coverage of private conspiracies.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Griffin, </em>403 U.S. at 101, 91 S.Ct. at 1798. Although the scope of prohibited activity has thus been expanded to include the actors here, the scope of rights protected from their private conduct by \u00a7 1985(3) is subject to much uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The <em>Griffin </em>Court concluded that \u00a7 1985(3) protects the right to be free from racial discrimination, the right of interstate travel, and the right to equal protection of the laws. The Court did not articulate what might constitute a deprivation of equal protection by private persons. <em>Griffin, </em>403 U.S. at 97, 91 S.Ct. 1790.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In <em>Lopez v. Arrowhead Ranches, </em>523 F.2d 924, 926 (9th Cir. 1975), this court explained <em>Griffin </em>as creating a cause of action for any tortious interference with a legally protected right if motivated by the requisite class-based animus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">[T]he <em>[Griffin] </em>Court, recognizing that the statutory language, taken literally, might be construed to give a claim for every conspiratorial tortious interference with a legally protected interest (the equal status being to be protected by law from <em>all intrusions on legal </em>rights), limited the statute\u2019s application to conform to the drafters\u2019 perceived intent. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">\u201cThe constitutional shoals that would lie in the path of interpreting \u00a7 1985(3) as a general federal tort law can be avoided by giving full effect to the congressional purpose \u2014 by requiring, as an element of the cause of action, the kind of invidiously discriminatory motivation stressed by the sponsors of the limiting amendment. See the remarks of Representatives Willard and Shellabarger, quoted <em>supra, </em>at 100. The language requiring intent to deprive of <em>equal </em>protection, or <em>equal </em>privileges and immunities, means that there must be some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\u2019 action. The conspiracy, in other words, must aim at a deprivation of the equal enjoyment of rights secured by the law to all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 926-27, quoting <em>Griffin, </em>403 U.S. at 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">Following <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Lopez, </em>we perceive the first requirement of this second element of \u00a7 1985(3) to require the deprivation of any legally protected right. Other courts have reached a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">The Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc, interpreted the second element to require an independent illegality<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (i. e., one independent of \u00a7 1985), accompanied by the requisite invidiously discriminatory animus. <em>McLellan v. Mississippi Power and Light Co., </em>545 F.2d 919 (5th Cir. 1977) (rehearing en banc). It based its interpretation on the <em>Griffin </em>Court\u2019s reference, 403 U.S. at 97, 91 S.Ct. 1790, to <em>United States v. Harris, </em>106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>U.S. 629, 643, 1 S.Ct. 601, 612, 27 L.Ed. 290 (1883),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">A private person cannot make constitutions or laws, nor can he with authority construe them, nor can he administer or execute them. The only way, therefore, in which one private person can deprive another of the equal protection of the laws is by the commission of some offense against the laws which protect the rights of persons, as by theft, burglary, arson, libel, assault, or murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The Seventh Circuit, in <em>Dombrowski v. Dowling, </em>459 F.2d 190 (7th Cir. 1972), concluded that \u00a7 1985(3) required deprivation of a legal right and a class-based invidiously discriminatory animus. It concluded, however, that some state involvement was requisite to finding a right under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free of private discrimination. Its approach is consistent with that utilized both by the Fifth Circuit and this court, which implicitly recognizes the remedial character of \u00a7 1985(3), and that the section itself confers no substantive rights. Finding no Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from private deprivations of equal protection, the <em>Dombrowski </em>court concluded the facts alleged there created no \u00a7 1985(3) cause of action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">The Eighth Circuit, in contrast, has concluded that \u00a7 1985 confers the substantive right to be free from private discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Action v. Gannon, </em>450 F.2d 1227, 1234-35 (8th Cir. 1971). Sitting en banc, that court confused the two-pronged analysis of <em>Griffin, </em>which first requires the identification of a right protected against private infringement and then requires the identification of a source of congressional power to prohibit such private conduct. It reasoned that \u00a7 1985(3) extended the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection by the states (including the incorporated First Amendment right to freedom of religion) to a right of equal treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment by private persons, and concluded that \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment authorized such congressional power. <em>Cf. Bellamy v. Mason\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>508 F.2d 504, 507 (4th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">California\u2019s Civil Rights Act<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> prohibits the private discrimination alleged here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Reichardt thus has a state right or entitle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ment to be free from the alleged private discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The insurance companies would have us construe \u00a7 1985(3) to be limited to deprivations of federal rights, as opposed to any legal rights or entitlements (including state conferred rights). We believe such a narrow construction is inconsistent with the drafters\u2019 purpose and irreconcilable with the interpretation since accorded \u00a7 1985 by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Violations of state conferred rights and privileges are sufficient to constitute a deprivation of \u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Brooks, </em>446 F.2d 404 (1st Cir. 1971) (zoning law infringement).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">(2) <em>Invidiously discriminatory class-based animus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Reichardt brought this action on behalf of herself and a clearly defined class: similarly situated women purchasers of disability insurance in California. Although the <em>Griffin </em>Court did not consider whether a class other than one racially-based would be sufficient under \u00a7 1985(3), we conclude that women purchasers of disability insurance are a sufficient class.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Section 1985\u2019s drafters clearly intended to protect groups other than oppressed southern blacks. The Congressional debates evinced concern for all groups subject to the organized lawlessness of the Ku Klux Klan, including all Unionists, Republicans, and certain religious groups.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Courts construing \u00a7 1985(3) have not limited its protection to racial or otherwise suspect classifications.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Means v. Wilson, </em>522 F.2d 833 (8th Cir. 1975) (political opponents are a sufficient class); <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>473 F.2d 608 (6th Cir. 1973) (supporters of a political candidate are a sufficient class); <em>Azar v. Conley, </em>456 F.2d 1382 (6th Cir. 1972) (a single family is a sufficient class). <em>See also Harrison </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>446 F.2d 404 (1st Cir. 1971). Reichardt\u2019s allegation that an invidiously discriminatory animus was the motivating force behind the disparate policy terms offered to women is thus sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">(b) <em>Congressional Power to Regulate This Private Conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">Defendant insurance companies argue that \u00a7 1985(3) as applied to the facts of this case is beyond the power of Congress. Reichardt argues that both the Commerce Clause and section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment authorize Congress to reach the alleged discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">This issue was not raised or decided below. There is no reference to it in the motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. It is not identified among the issues listed in the district court\u2019s opinion nor otherwise referred to in the opinion. It is not among the issues as to which certification was sought and granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>We decline to reverse the district judge upon a ground not submitted to him and upon which he has had no opportunity to pass. <em>Preferred Insurance Exchange v. Coshow, </em>444 F.2d 362, 365 (9th Cir. 1971). Such forbearance is particularly appropriate where the appeal is interlocutory and the issue is not among those certified by the district court. <em>Stern v. U. S. Gypsum Inc., </em>547 F.2d 1329, 1333-34 (7th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Moreover, few propositions are better established than that constitutional adjudication should be avoided wherever possible. <em>Bowen v. United States, </em>422 U.S. 916, 920, 95 S.Ct. 2569, 45 L.Ed.2d 641 (1975); <em>Ashwander v. TVA, </em>297 U.S. 288, 345-48, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">If the defendant insurance companies prevail in a trial on the merits, the constitutional issue need never be reached. If Reichardt prevails, the constitutional issue will be subject to review on appeal from the final judgment, with the advantages of a full record.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The case is remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the claim against the Insurance Commissioner under \u00a7 1983.

Is the state a joint participant in the activity or are mutual benefits conferred between the state and the private actor?

Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88 (1971)). Although we cannot dismiss this language as <em>dictum, </em>we note that subsequent decisions of this court have not followed <em>Sykes. See Briley v. State of California, </em>564 F.2d 849, 858-59 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Phillips v. International Assoc. of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, Local 118, </em>556 F.2d 939, 941 n.1 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">These later cases amply demonstrate that <em>Sykes\u2019 </em>\u201cunder color of state law and authority\u201d requirement for a \u00a7 1985 cause of action is no longer the law of this circuit, if it ever was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b577-17\">. The Fifth Circuit attempted to reconcile <em>Lopez\u2019s </em>\u201cviolation of a legal right\u201d requirement with its own requirement of an \u201cindependent illegality\u201d: \u201c[T]he legal right referred to in those instances is the right of every person not to be victimized by another\u2019s <em>illegal </em>behavior.\u201d <em>McLellan, </em>545 F.2d at 927 (emphasis in original). Regardless of the merit of this conciliation, we adhere to the reasoning and language of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\">. <em>Cf. </em>The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 17, 3 S.Ct. 18, 25, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">[C]ivil rights, such as are guaranteed by the constitution against State aggression, cannot be impaired by the wrongful acts of individuals, unsupported by state authority in the shape of laws, customs or judicial or executive proceedings. The wrongful act of an individual, unsupported by any such authority, is simply a private wrong, or a crime of that individual; an invasion of the rights of the injured party, it is true, whether they affect his person, his property or his reputation; but if not sanctioned in some way by the state, or not done under state authority, his rights remain in full force, and may presumably be vindicated by resort to the laws of the state for redress. An individual cannot deprive a man of his right to vote, to hold property, to buy and to sell, to sue in the courts or to be a witness or a juror; he may, by force or fraud, interfere with the enjoyment of the right in a particular case; he may commit an assault against the person, or commit murder, or use ruffian violence at the polls, or slander the good name of a fellow-citizen; but unless protected in these wrongful acts by some shield of state law or state authority, he cannot destroy or injure the right; he will only render himself amenable to satisfaction or punishment; and amenable therefor to the laws of the state where the wrongful acts are committed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b578-15\">. <em>See also Bellamy v.

The final version substituted the <em>equal </em>protection and <em>equal </em>privileges and immunities language which the Supreme Court has construed as a motivation element of the offense, the only element preventing the imposition, under the terms of the statute, of a general federal tort law. <em>See Griffin, </em>403 U.S. at 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\">. <em>See </em>Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at 567, 695-96 (1871) (remarks of Sen.
