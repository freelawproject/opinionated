Burgreen, the appellants; Parks L. and Barbara J. Heaton; and Billy R. and Jane E. Harris. The Burgreens resisted liability, asserting that their guaranty was void for two reasons: it was unsupported by consideration and it was obtained through fraud and duress by the First Alabama Bank of Huntsville, N. A. (Bank), which had participated with SBA in making the loan secured by the guaranty. The same allegations of fraud and duress provided the basis of the Burgreens\u2019 third-party action against the Bank for damages. The Burgreens also cross-claimed against the Harrises and Heatons for contribution. The Heatons in turn cross-claimed against the Burgreens for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">Prior to trial the district court summarily disposed of the Burgreens\u2019 defense of lack of consideration, finding it insufficient as a matter of law. The case then proceeded to trial before a jury. At the conclusion of all the evidence, the court directed verdicts in favor of the Government against each of the guarantors (except the Harrises, who settled with the Government on the eve of trial) and in favor of the Bank in the third-party action. Directed verdicts were also entered against each of the cross-claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">Only the Burgreens have appealed. They question the trial court\u2019s disposition of their lack of consideration defense; they also contend that they were entitled to go to the jury with their claims of fraud and duress in the Government\u2019s case and in the third-party action. Finally, they cite error in the trial court\u2019s calculation of the sums recited in the judgments. We find no merit in any of these contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The material facts are not in dispute. It is only the parties\u2019 characterizations of these facts in legal terms that are in controversy. On November 29, 1966, the Heatons and the Harrises obtained an SBA commitment to provide permanent financing to the Huntsville Flying Service, Inc. (the borrower) in the sum of $100,000 for the purchase of land and the construction of an airport in Huntsville, Alabama. The Heatons and the Harrises owned all the stock, 50-50, of the borrower. Mr. Heaton and Mr. Harris took the commitment to the Bank and, working with Eugene Morgan, its executive vice-president, obtained a $100,000 construction loan. To induce the Bank to make the loan, the Heatons, the Harrises, and the Bur-greens jointly and severally executed in favor of the Bank an unconditional guaranty. At the time, it was understood by the three couples that the Burgreens were to acquire a portion of the borrower\u2019s stock so that each couple would own a one-third interest in the corporation. This guaranty agreement is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The loan was closed on June 12, 1967, and was evidenced by a note and mortgage executed by the borrower.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">It soon became apparent that the borrower needed more than $100,000 to complete the airport. The Bank agreed to provide an additional $100,000, and on October 2, 1967, a note and mortgage for that amount were executed by the borrower. Thereafter, the SBA commitment was altered. In lieu of its earlier agreement to make a $100,000 loan, the SBA agreed to guarantee eighty-seven percent of a $200,000 permanent loan from the Bank to the borrower, the Bank assuming the balance of the risk. The commitment, extending for a period of six months, was dated November 24, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">On March 1, 1968, all the papers necessary to close the permanent loan were signed except the Burgreens\u2019 guaranty. After repeated requests by the Bank\u2019s vice-president, Mr. Morgan, the Burgreens finally came to the Bank on May 23, 1967, the day before expiration of the SBA commitment. Morgan told the Burgreens that the permanent loan would not be made unless they signed the guaranty. Mr. Burgreen refused and Robert Lowery, the Bank\u2019s chief executive officer, intervened. He advised Morgan that the Bank would accept a guaranty for less than the full amount of the loan. Morgan and Mr. Burgreen then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>dickered back and forth and the Burgreens finally signed a form guaranty agreement in favor of the Bank and SBA that limited the Burgreens\u2019 potential liability to 37.5% of the $200,000 loan. This guaranty is also set out in the margin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; it formed the basis of the Government\u2019s complaint in the court below. On the day this guaranty was executed, Mr. Burgreen obtained one-third of the borrower\u2019s capital stock. The consideration given by Mr. Burgreen for the stock was stated to be the Burgreens\u2019 execution of the guaranty in favor of the Bank and SBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">After these transactions were completed the Burgreens undertook active management of the borrower. On June 23, 1968, Mr. Burgreen acquired the remaining stock of the corporation from the Heatons and Harrises. The loan was kept current for over a year but eventually became delinquent. At the borrower\u2019s request the Bank, with SBA\u2019s consent, withheld legal action to collect the past due installments. To induce the Bank and SBA to withhold action, a letter, purportedly bearing the Burgreens\u2019 signatures, was given to the Bank. The letter stated that the Burgreens would remain bound by the terms of their May 23, 1968, guaranty even if the other guarantors (the Heatons and the Harrises) failed \u201cto re-guarantee the forbearance.\u201d (At trial, Mr. Burgreen denied signing the letter; Mrs. Burgreen remained silent on this point.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">On December 22, 1970, and February 3, 1971, the Bank and the Burgreens (on behalf of the borrower) executed a modification agreement extending the amortization schedule of the loan. Despite the extension, the borrower failed to keep the loan current, and on July 14, 1972, the Bank assigned the loan and guaranty agreements to the SBA. Thereafter, SBA declared the loan in default, accelerated the payments, and made demand for the balance due. On April 3, 1974, the SBA foreclosed the mortgage, and after the foreclosure sale brought this suit for deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">We first address the Burgreens\u2019 argument that the trial judge erred in summarily disposing of their defense of lack of consideration. The ruling came on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the court had before it, in addition to the pleadings, the affidavit of Robert M. Hartman, chief of the portfolio management division of the Birmingham district office of the SBA, together with attached exhibits including: the March 1, 1968, note; the Heatons\u2019, Harrises\u2019, and Burgreens\u2019 guaranty agreements; a certified statement of account; the stock transfer agreement by which Mr. Burgreen had obtained his interest in the borrower; seven separate demand letters from the SBA to the Burgreens; and the depositions of banker Morgan and the Burgreens. Nothing in the record before the district judge is in conflict with the facts as we have recited them.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The Burgreens argue that consideration for their guaranty was lacking because they signed it two and one-half months after the execution of the other documents that made up the closing of the permanent loan. This guaranty, the argument proceeds, was a new and independent contract and, to be valid, must be supported by new consideration independent from that of the original note. It is true, as the Burgreens urge, that Alabama law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is in accord with the general rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASU\">the [guaranty] of one not a party to the original transaction who, in pursuance of some subsequent arrangement, signs an instrument as surety, grantor or endorser, after the original contract has been fully executed and delivered and without agreement at the time of the execution of the original contract that additional security would be furnished, is a new and independent contract and to be binding must be supported by a new consideration, independent from that of the original contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\"><em>McMillan v. Dozier, </em>257 Ala. 435, 59 So.2d 563, 567 (1952). But the Burgreens overlook the fact that their guaranty was not given in execution of a new contract; rather, the guaranty was simply the final component in the closing of a permanent loan. There can be no doubt that the Bank required the Burgreens to execute a new guaranty agreement before it would complete closing of the permanent loan. Thus, when the Burgreens finally signed the guaranty in question on May 23, 1968, the transaction was consummated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Another factor supports the district court\u2019s finding that there was adequate consideration for the guaranty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As part of the May 23, 1968, negotiations, the Bur-greens received not only a reduction in their liability <em>(i. e., </em>as compared with their exposure of 100% on the temporary, construction-money loans) but Mr. Burgreen also acquired one-third of the borrower\u2019s stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>from the Heatons and the Harrises. The stock transfer agreement, Bank Exh. No. 3, recites that the consideration Mr. Burgreen gave for the stock was his execution of the guaranty in favor of the Bank and SBA. The stock alone is sufficient consideration to defeat the Burgreens\u2019 defense as a matter of law. In sum, the district court was correct in striking down the Burgreens\u2019 lack of consideration defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We now turn to the propriety of the district court\u2019s ruling that the Burgreens\u2019 claim of fraud and duress was insufficient to go to the jury. <em>Boeing Co. </em>v. <em>Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc). In this appeal, the Burgreens characterize fraud and duress as synonymous with \u201ceconomic compulsion.\u201d We have carefully examined the record, and agree with the trial court\u2019s view of their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The district judge found that there was \u201csimply no evidence that there was any taint of fraud or duress as the law understands the terms in connection with the execution of [the Burgreens\u2019 guaranty agreement].\u201d Record, vol. 2, at 294. As the parties suggest, we must first look to Alabama law to determine what constitutes fraud and duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">The Alabama legislature has codified the common law actions of fraud and deceit. This legislation is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Essential to a claim of fraud is a material misrepresentation of fact which has lead another to act to his detriment. We do not find in this record anything approaching a misrepresentation of fact on the part of the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">The Burgreens\u2019 argument is that Mr. Burgreen thought that the original guaranty was given only to secure Bank financing of airplanes. He admits, however, that he was never told this by the Bank. He also insists that he was initially told that he would not be involved with \u201cthe SBA loan.\u201d He readily admits, however, that he became involved with the SBA loan. He became involved because he had no other recourse; the Bank would have proceeded against him on the original guaranty to collect $200,000, the balance due on the construction loans. There was no misrepresentation of any fact by the Bank; to the contrary, the Bank was quite blunt about its position. The Bur-greens point to no specific facts the Bank may have misstated. The only misrepresentation they have cited is one of <em>law, </em>not of fact. They say that the Bank misrepresen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ted that it could succeed in obtaining a judgment against them on the original guaranty, when in fact, their argument goes, it would have failed. This argument simply will not pass muster under Alabama law. The statutes, see note 7 <em>supra, </em>require a misrepresentation of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The Burgreens\u2019 attempt to classify banker Morgan\u2019s action, in insisting on their execution of the guaranty as a condition to closing the loan, as duress by business compulsion. They assert that duress is a specie of fraud and business compulsion is a specie of duress. Although we intimate no view as to the correctness of this argument or its applicability in Alabama, we point out briefly that the hornbook references supplied by the Burgreens are inapposite to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">They cite us to 13 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1617 (3rd ed. W. Jaeger 1970) for the basic elements of business compulsion. That authority provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">1. The party alleging economic duress must show that he has been the victim of a wrongful or unlawful act or threat, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">2. Such act or threat must be one which deprives the victim of his unfettered will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 704 (footnotes omitted). The Bur-greens concede that threatening legal process (e. <em>g., </em>a suit by the Bank on the first guaranty) does not generally constitute duress; they submit, however, that such a threat would constitute duress if the claim were known by the one possessing it to be false. Thus, their argument progresses, since the Bank knew that the original guaranty could not successfully be used to collect the balance due on the $200,000 construction loan, the Bank\u2019s threat to sue constituted business coercion, business compulsion from the Burgreens\u2019 point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Given the plain language of the original guaranty, see note 2 <em>supra, </em>we have serious doubts as to whether the Burgreens could have defeated a suit by the Bank based thereon. We need not reach this question, however, for there was no evidence adduced indicating that the Bank felt that the guaranty was unenforceable. The Bank therefore could not have threatened process <em>knowing </em>the claim to be false. The treatise cited by the Burgreens further explicates the inapplicability of the developing concept of business compulsion in this case. One of the requirements of this cause of action is that \u201cthe party threatened must be compelled to make a disproportionate exchange of values or to give up something for nothing.\u201d 13 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1617, at 704 (footnotes omitted). Here the Burgreens signed the May 23, 1968, guaranty to avoid at least the possibility of being 100% liable on $200,000 in exchange for a potential liability of only 37.5% of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">The Burgreens have failed to point to any evidence in the record which would justify a jury conclusion that they were the victims of a wrongful act so as to support a claim for fraud or duress, either under the law of Alabama or as they have defined it to include business compulsion. The district judge correctly directed verdicts against them on this defense and on their third-party claim against the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">Three other claims of error are worthy of brief discussion. The first is that the court erred in calculating the Government\u2019s judgment against the Heatons. The Bur-greens may be correct, but since the Government\u2019s judgment against the Heatons is not involved in this appeal we are powerless to remedy any defect in it. In any event the Burgreens are not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">The balance due on the borrower\u2019s indebtedness after the Harrises were settled out of the case was $105,503.50. The Heatons were liable for 100% of that amount; the Burgreens for 37.5%. The court was correct in calculating the figure inserted in the judgment against the Burgreens. However, the figure in the Heatons\u2019 judgment does not represent 100% of the debt, but only 62.5%. The Government is the party injured by the calculation, not the Bur-greens; but the Government has not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>pealed its judgment against the Heatons. Hence, we have no authority to alter it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Burgreens\u2019 second point is that they were entitled to recover on their cross-claim against the Heatons. Clearly they were not. The right of contribution does not rise until the Burgreens have satisfied the judgment against them. <em>Ala.Code </em>\u00a7 8-3-9 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The third and final point raised by the Burgreens concerns the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a memorandum, dated May 24, 1968, signed by J. C. Barksdale, a regional loan officer of SBA. The memorandum merely recites a telephonic request by banker Lowery for SBA approval of the Bank\u2019s acquisition of a guaranty to secure the Bank in a greater amount than the SBA in respect to the loan in question. Assuming the admissibility of the document to prove its contents, we fail to see how it would establish any of the Burgreens\u2019 defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">For the reasons stated, the judgments appealed from are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-15\">.

In each set the date May 23 is struck through and the date March 1 substituted. The form is also altered to reflect the reduced percentage that was negotiated. The Burgreens\u2019 initials appear beside the percentage alterations, but there is no indication on the form as to when and by whom the dates were altered. There is, in any event, no contention that the guaranty does not purport to obligate the Burgreens for 37.5% of the $200,-000 loaned by the Bank to Huntsville Flying Service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-5\">. There is no choice of law clause in the guaranty agreement, but the parties agree that Alabama law controls the present controversy. Although federal law controls the rights and duties of the United States in the context of the SBA loan guaranty program, <em>United States v. Terrey, </em>554 F.2d 685, 692 (5th Cir. 1977), where, as in the case before us, the SBA agrees that state law controls, it is appropriate to look there for our decision, <em>cf. id. </em>at 592-93 (SBA contracted that Texas law would apply).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\">. In concluding that the loan was closed on May 23, 1968, we have not overlooked the Burgreens\u2019 contention that the loan papers (i. e., other than the Burgreens\u2019 guaranty) and the checks were dated March 1, 1968. An interest charge was also entered on the books from that date. Our examination of those records, in the light of the evidence that explains them, indicates, conclusively we think, that the March 1 date was used simply because the parties thought the closing would be completed on that date. The fact that the completion of the closing was postponed, without changing the dates on the papers, is of no moment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b370-12\">. The United States and the Bank also argue that the May 23 guaranty was subsequently ratified by the Burgreens for adequate consideration in the form of the forbearance agreements of December 20, 1970, and February 3, 1971. <em>See Phillips </em>v. <em>Malone, </em>223 Ala. 381, 136 So. 793, 795 (1931) (subsequent ratification supplies adequate consideration); <em>Thweatt v. McLeod, </em>56 Ala. 375, 378 (1876) (same); <em>cf. Norvell v. Gilreath, </em>189 Ala. 452, 66 So. 635, 637 (1914) (forbearance constitutes consideration). Although this argument appears to have merit, neither the modification agreements nor the Burgreens\u2019 request for extensions were before the district judge. We cannot, therefore, consider them in determining whether the lack of consideration defense was properly eliminated by summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\">.

A fraudulent or reckless representation of facts as true, which the party may not know to be false, if intended to deceive, is equivalent to a knowledge of the falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-19\">\u00a7 6-5-104. <em>Same </em>\u2014 Fraudulent <em>deceit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">(a) One who willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-21\">(b) A deceit within the meaning of this section is either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-22\">(1) The suggestion as a fact of that which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-23\">(2) The assertion as a fact of that which is not true by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-24\">(3) The suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-25\">(4) A promise made without any intention of performing it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
