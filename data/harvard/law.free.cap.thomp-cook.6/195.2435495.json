Huntington and another against William' B. Dinsmore, president, etc., of the Adams Express Company, to recover for the loss of two packages of money. The facts were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 agent at St. Louis, Missouri, in January, 1866, delivered to the agent of said express company at that place said packages, which contained about 82,500, and requested him to send them to plaintiffs at Natchez, Mississippi, where plaintiffs resided. At the time the packages were delivered, the express company\u2019s agent gave to plaintiffs\u2019 agent a receipt therefor reading as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-12\">\u201c St. Louis, <em>January </em>27, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-13\">\u25a0 \u201c Received from Lewis Nanson &amp; Co., two packages, sealed and said to contain twenty-five hundred dollars, addressed \u2014 Huntington &amp; Pitkin, Natchez, Miss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-14\">\u201c Hpon the special acceptance and agreement that this company is to forward the same to its agent nearest or most convenient to destination only, and there to deliver the same to other parties to complete the transportation \u2014 such delivery to terminate all liability of this company for such package; and also that this company are not to be liable in any manner, or to any extent, for any loss or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>detention of such package, or of its contents, or of any portion thereof, occasioned by the acts of any person or persons acting or claiming to act in any military or other capacity in hostility to the government of the United States, or occasioned by civil or military authority, or by the acts of' any armed or other mob, or riotous assemblage ; nor when occasioned by the dangers of railroad transportation, or ocean or river navigation, or by fire or steam. In no event is this company to be liable for a greater sum than that above mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">The receipt'was signed by defendant\u2019s agent. The conditions were printed in very small type.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\">The lines of the Adams Express Company did not reach to Natchez, but only as far as Cairo, Illinois, in that direction. At Cairo the packages were delivered to the Southern Express Company to convey to Natchez, and while between Cairo and Natchez, in the course of transportation, were lost by the exjxlosion of the boiler of the steamboat on which they were being carried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-7\">On the trial the plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to read from the testimony of a witness taken upon a commission, this : <em>\u201cI </em>think I paid him an extra amount of freight to insure their delivery.\u201d This, upon defendant\u2019s objection, was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-8\">Evidence was given by one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses that in .interviews with defendant\u2019s agent at St. Louis, the agent had promised that the matter would be satisfactorily arranged, and the company would refund the amount, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to submit to the jury, among other things, the question whether defendant had promised to refund the amount of loss, which request the court refused.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-9\"><em>E. Terry, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-10\"><em>Chas. M. DaCosta </em>and <em>S. A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUS\">\u2018 In the absence of fraud or imposition the receipt delivered by the agent of the defendant to the person shipping the packages must be held to be the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">We see no facts in the papers upon which this case can be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tinguished from cases lately decided by the Court of Appeals, and which must be deemed to settle the law of this State. See <em>Belger </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>51 N. Y. 166; <em>Collender </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>55 id. 200; <em>Wetzell </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>54 id. 496; <em>Magnin </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>56 id. 168; <em>Long </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>50 id. 76; <em>Root </em>v. <em>Great W. R. R. Co., </em>45 id. 524; <em>Reed v. U. S. Ex. Co., </em>48 id. 462; <em>Babcock v. L. S. &amp; M. S. Railway Co., </em>49 id. 491; <em>Breese v. U. S. Telegraph Co., </em>48 id. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We should be quite certain to come in conflict with some one or more of these'cases were we to hold that there was any thing in this case to justify the court below in holding, or the jury in finding, that the plaintiffs were not bound by the terms of the receipt. This we think is the controlling question. It is not material whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s agent paid a greater or less than usual freight for carriage; nor was it legitimate to show what defendant\u2019s agent said or promised about making the loss good after the recovery of the safe. He was not shown to be authorized to make any such promise, or to bind defendant by such declarations or admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
