Raymond against Caroline H. Hanford, to recover for work, labor and services. The complaint alleged that defendant is a married woman and the owner of certain real estate; that plaintiff, at defendant\u2019s request, performed work upon and for the benefit of said estate of the reasonable value of $710, which defendant promised and agreed to pay, and that defendant had paid $300 thereon. The answer admitted that defendant was a married woman and owned the real estate mentioned, and denied that she employed plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">Upon the .trial, plaintiff proved that he had been employed to work under two special contracts, one to work for twelve months at $55 per month, commencing April 1, 1872, which was made about the-middle of March, 1872, and another to work at $2 per day until he got a place elsewhere, commencing at the termination of the first contract, in April, 1873, and that he performed both contracts. The defendant moved for a nonsuit, upon the grounds (1) that the complaint being upon a <em>quantum meruit </em>proof of \u00e1 special contract would not sustain it; (2) that the first made contract was void under the statute of frauds; and (3) that the action being one in which equitable relief is sought by the plaintiff, the county court had no jurisdiction. The motion was denied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-7\"><em>T. G.

The plaintiff sued defendant upon a <em>quantum meruit </em>for work and labor done for her upon her premises at Tarrytown, she being a married woman. Upon the trial, it appeared that plaintiff worked by the year from the 1st of April, 1872, to the 1st of April, 1873, and after that for about a month, by the day. An executed contract may be sued upon an implied assumpsit, and the contract price will be the measure of recovery. , <em>Farron </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>17 N.
