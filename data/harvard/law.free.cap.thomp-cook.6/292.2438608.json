The grounds of liability charged are that defendant, by the non-filing of the certificate as to payment in of capital, became liable to the extent of his stock, and by the failure, under another section, as trustee, to make and publish the report required by law, he also became liable, as trustee, to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Defendant demurs on the ground that the causes of action are improperly joined.
