Schoonmaker against Francis McEally, to recover for the loss of two horses belonging to plaintiff which were fatally injured through the negligence of defendant. The defense was contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff. The facts were these.- In October, 1868, plaintiff and defendant were each boating with a team on the Delaware and Hudson canal. The plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s boats which, with their respective teams, were moving in opposite directions met. Plaintiff\u2019s boat was loaded, defendant\u2019s light. By the rules of the canal company it is th\u00f3 duty of a loaded boat to stop and allow a light boat to pass over the tow line of the loaded one. According to the testimony on the part of plaintiff, plaintiff\u2019s team had stopped and was standing near the outer edge of the tow-path, and between them and the canal there was ample room for defendant\u2019s team to pass ; but defendant\u2019s team, instead of going between plaintiff\u2019s team and the canal, passed round on the outside, in consequence of which plaintiff\u2019s team was caught by defendant\u2019s tow line and thrown into the canal, receiving injuries whereof they died. At the time of the accident neither team had drivers. This was in violation of a rule of the canal company, which required a driver to be always in charge of a team drawing a boat on the canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-10\">In the justice\u2019s court plaintiff recovered judgment from which an appeal was taken to the county court. Judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff in the county court, which, on appeal to the general term, was reversed and a new trial ordered, upon which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>judgment was rendered again in favor of plaintiff. From this judgment and the order denying a new trial, this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-5\"><em>S. L.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"As0\">The only question is whether on the evidence the court can say, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The negligence charged to him is the failure to have a driver with his team. But the want of a driver did not contribute to the accident, unless the plaintiff\u2019s team was not in the proper place and did not stop at the proper time. On these points the evidence was contradictory and therefore the case was necessarily submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">The defendant urges that if the plaintiff had had a driver for his team, the driver might have moved the team out of the way of the defendant\u2019s team, and thus the accident might have been prevented. But, if the plaintiff\u2019s team was actually in its proper place, that is, in the place where it ought to have been when the defendant\u2019s team was to pass it, he oug\u00edit not to be charged with contributory negligence on account of the possibility that if a driver had been at hand something might have been done to prevent the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs..</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
