The facts were these. In Chenango county the duties of the sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>rogate and county judge are performed by one person, who in this case was disqualified from acting by reason of interest. There is a special county judge appointed for said county, but the person appointed had never filed the bond required by law, and was in fact unable to do so. After a request to said special county judge to comply with the law as to filing a bond, and his neglect to do so, the application mentioned was made to the district attorney upon a petition, setting forth all the facts mentioned. The only question in the case was the one of jurisdiction. The respondents are Lutheria Smith and others, next of kin, heirs at law, and creditors of the deceased.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-6\"><em>George W.

We think that the intention of the legislature must have.been that there should, as far as possible, always be some person competent to act as surrogate. The words \u201c when there is no legal officer authorized to perform,\u201d etc., may, without force, be construed \u201cwhen there is no officer legally authorized to perform,\u201d etc. It is not desirable in order to defeat the administration of justice to suppose that \u201clegal\u201d'was a mistake for \u201clocal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">The order should be reversed, and the district attorney ordered to proceed in the matter with costs to the appellants, payable out of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
