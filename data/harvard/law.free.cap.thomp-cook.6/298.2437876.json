The evidence taken before the commissioners showed that while the land in question was in possession of the appellant\u2019s grantor the railroad company laid its track over it. The appellant offered to show that the company took possession of such land and laid such track without permission or consent; also the value of the improvements which the company had put upon the land, consisting of iron, ties, etc., for the purpose of having such value included in the compensation to be awarded.\" This was excluded by the commissioners on the ground that, as a matter of law, he was not entitled thereto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>Thomas Young, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfN\">Improvements made upon land by a trespasser belong to the owner of the land. 2 Kent\u2019s Com.

Van Sise sought compensation not only for the land, but for the (improvement put thereon; he offered to prove that the entry on the land was without the owner\u2019s consent, and also to prove the value of the rails, ties, etc., on the strip in question. The commissioners refused to allow proof of these facts, and Van Sise appeals from the order confirming their report.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">We are of opinion that the railroad company, if they entered without consent, were trespassers as to the then owner, and as to Van Sise, who acquired title from him, and that any fixtures they placed on the land, while their occupation thereof was that of trespassers, belong to the owner who is such at the time of the making of the valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The commissioners, therefore, erred in rejecting the testimony offered by Van Sise. In making such proof we do not understand that the value of each tie and rail is to be determined; the railway track composed of rails and ties is a fixture of the land, and its value as a fixture enhancing the value of the land for the beneficial enjoyment thereof is the measure of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The order of the special term should be reversed, and the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>sent to the commissioners to take the proofs accordingly, with $10 costs to appellant to abide event. ^</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><em>Note. Graham v. Connersville &amp; New Castle Junction Railroad Co., </em>10 Am. Rep. 56 (36 Ind. 463), was a case involving the same facts as the foregoing. The railroad company entered upon Graham\u2019s land without his consent and erected buildings. Two years thereafter the company began proceedings to appropriate such land to its use. The Supreme Court of badiana held that the owner of the land was entitled to compensation for its value with the improvements thereon at the time the proceedings to appropriate were instituted, and not that at the time the land was entered, which is in harmony with the doctrine of the foregoing c\u00e1se.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
