Bowne, substituted trustee under the will of Ann Haviland, deceased, and Phebe Jane Underhill and otlffers, legatees and devisees under said will. By the second clause of the will, the testatrix gave to her executors therein named certain real and personal property in trust, among other things, to the use of her neice \u201cPhebe Jane Underhill, wife of Edmund Underhill, during the joint lives of the said Edmund Underhill and Phebe Jane, his wife; and from and after the death of either of them, the said Edmund and Phebe Jane, then to apply the same to the use of the survivor of them, and the children of them, the said Edmund and Phebe Jane Underhill, during the life-time of such survivor, in equal proportions, and upon the decease of such survivor, then upon trust to divide the said trust estate equally among all the children of the said Phebe Jane Under-hill who may then be living and the lawful issue of any who may then be dead <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per </em>capita.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">The said Edmund Underhill died February 16, 1872, leaving Phebe, his wife, surviving, who is still alive. At the date of the will, and at the time of the death of the testatrix, the issue of Edmund and Phebe Jane Underhill were John F., E. Ferris and Mary A. Underhill; subsequently Mary A. married one Farquhar, and in 1847 died, leaving her surviving two children, Mary A. and Anna L. Farquhar. The question submitted was whether, under the second clause of the will, any part of the income is to be applied to the use of these two children, and if so, what share or proportion,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>Benj.

Underhill (Farquhar) should be adjudged to stand in the place of their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">There is no appearance of an intent to exclude any who were of the blood of the parent. After the death of Phebe J. Underhill, these children do, like their mother, share by express words. Why exclude them from their mother\u2019s share before that event happens ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The ease of <em>Prowell </em>v. <em>Rodman, </em>37 N. Y. 42, is an express authority that <em>\u201c </em>children \u201d in this case includes grandchildren. Such a construction is demanded in this case by the whole scope and plan of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The judgment upon submitted case is that Mary A. Farquhar and Anna L. Farquhar take their mother\u2019s share under the second clause of the will, and that they are included in the term \u201c children \u201d in that clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">' <em>Ordered accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
