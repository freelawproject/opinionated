Bernstein, M.D., was expelled from the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association upon a finding by the association\u2019s council that he was guilty of seven charges of violation of the Principles of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Upon appeal to the council of the California Medical Association, he was absolved of one of the charges but the decision of the local council was affirmed in all other respects. Upon appeal to the Judicial Council of the American Medical Association the action of the state council was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">He then brought this action seeking a writ of mandate to restore him to membership and monetary damages for injuries allegedly sustained. The trial court found the evidence sufficient as to three of the remaining charges (insufficient as to the other three) and that Bernstein is entitled to no relief. He has appealed. The association has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">We will consider the three remaining charges, designated by the parties as the Hill, the Muir, and the Enea cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The Hill Case</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The charge was that Dr. Bernstein had violated section 4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of article IV of chapter III of the Principles of Medical Ethics in that on July 23, 1949, he \u201crendered a report concerning one George Hill, then deceased. Said report concerning George Hill was addressed \u2018To Whom It May Concern,\u2019 and contained several statements of criticism by Dr. Bernstein of a pathological report previously made by Dr. J., M. Ellis. Specifically, Dr. Bernstein described Dr. Ellis as a pathologist \u2018who is not a certified pathologist, and who has rendered a very inexpert report\u2019 on the case. He again referred to Dr. Ellis as a \u2018rather inept and inexpert individual.\u2019 He further stated that \u2018a more experienced pathologist would have examined the heart a little more thoroughly. \u2019 Further on in the report he stated, \u2018Here, again, I must comment about the inexpertness of the pathologist, \u2019 referring again to Dr. Ellis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">It was stipulated that on October 5, 1948, Dr. Ellis performed an autopsy upon the body of George Hill and rendered to the coroner a pathological report to the effect that Hill probably died of natural causes, although recognizing the possibility of industrial injury as the cause, and later submitted the report to Hill\u2019s employer at the latter\u2019s request in regard to an industrial accident hearing concerning the death of Hill; and that on July 23, 1949, Dr. Bernstein, in response to a request by the attorney for Hill\u2019s widow, who was the applicant in the industrial accident proceeding, prepared a pathological report and delivered it to the widow\u2019s attorney, who thereupon turned it in to the Industrial Accident Commission. Both reports were introduced in evidence before the local medical council.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">. The Bernstein report was based upon a study of various papers, including \u201cthe copy of the inquest, the report of Dr. T. A. Miller, radiologist of St. Francis Hospital, the X-ray report issued by him, the report by Dr. Carl B. Eichorn, St. Francis Hospital, and report of the nurse on duty at the .Columbia Steel Mill Hospital who first attended George Hill.\u201d Dr. Bernstein expressed the opinion that \u201cGeorge' Hill\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>death was caused directly by the injury.\u201d He-set forth in considerable detail the several factors which led him to that conclusion, in the course of which he analyzed the autopsy report, indicating various features thereof which he deemed inadequate or erroneous. In the course of this analysis Dr. Bernstein made the remarks concerning Dr. Ellis and his report which are quoted in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Counsel for the accusers (1) stipulated that Dr. Ellis was not a certified pathologist, (2) stated that Ellis was amply qualified in fact as a licensed physician who had specialized in pathology for some years, and (3) contended that the question whether Ellis was a good or bad pathologist was not an issue, the question being whether Dr. Bernstein\u2019s conduct was ethical. The referee stated that \u201cthe qualifications of Dr. Ellis or the competency of the particular report that Dr. Ellis rendered is entirely immaterial in so far as the charge herein made is concerned.\u201d Apparently the council concurred in that view.-</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">It further appears that Dr. Bernstein\u2019s report was given to the attorney for the widow of Hill for use as evidence in support of her claim for benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was used for that purpose. It was brought to Dr. Ellis\u2019 attention by the attorney for the employer in the industrial accident proceeding, whereupon Dr. Ellis wrote the employer\u2019s attorney, at the latter\u2019s request, an analysis of Dr. Bernstein\u2019s report, apparently for the use of the employer in that proceeding. There is evidence that the Industrial Accident Commission made an award in the widow\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">It was Dr. Ellis who brought the Bernstein report to the attention of the medical association, nearly two years after its rendition.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">It seems- abundantly clear that Dr. Bernstein\u2019s report was requested by a litigant for use as evidence in a judicial proceeding; was prepared and delivered by the doctor, in response to that request, solely for that purpose; and was put to that very use by the litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">That makes it a \u201cprivileged publication,\u201d a publication (written or oral) \u201c. . . made ... [i]n any . . . judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>proceeding ...\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a747.) In such a case, the privilege is absolute. <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>122 Cal.App. 205, 210-211 [9 P.2d 562], hearing by Supreme Court denied,\u2014the filing, in a judicial proceeding, of a complaint containing a libelous statement. See also <em>Albertson </em>v. <em>Raboff,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Cal.) 287 P.2d 145.)  The use of this report as evidence before the Industrial Accident Commission characterizes the author of it as a witness. The testimony of a witness in a judicial proceeding is uniformly accorded the same degree of privilege as is accorded the pleadings therein. (See cases collected in 12 A.L.R. 1247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Thus, it is established in this state that statements made in an affidavit (testimony in written form) filed in a judicial proceeding enjoy this privilege. <em>(Donnell </em>v. <em>Linforth, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 25, 28-29 [52 P.2d 937]; hearing by the Supreme Court denied. See also <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Daro, </em>47 Cal.App.2d 418 [118 P.2d 37], oral testimony in a legislative proceeding, which the statute puts in the same category as a judicial'proceeding.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The policy of making such statements privileged is obvious. If parties and witnesses were subject to slander and libel actions for utterances made or filed in a judicial proceeding the administration of justice would be hampered and the judicial process throttled. The same policy should ban a medical association by-law which holds over each of the members the threat of expulsion if in his testimony (oral or written) before a court or other judicial body, he \u201cdisparages, by comment or insinuation,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> another physician. With such a threat ever facing him, he must weigh carefully and well his every utterance lest through some slip of the tongue he \u201cinsinuate\u201d something about another physician which his county medical council may, perchance, deem \u201cdisparaging\u201d and, as such, just cause for censure, suspension, or expulsion. It is inconceivable that the law could tolerate the holding of such a sword of Damocles over any medical witness in any judicial proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>We are loath to read into the Principles of Medical Ethics an intent upon the part of the American Medical Association to interfere with the judicial process. We find it unnecessary to do so. The canon here involved contains not a single word about the duty of one physician toward another when testifying as a witness in a judicial proceeding. It is a fair inference from such silence that the American Medical Association when it formulated its Principles of Medical Ethics harbored no intent to arrogate to itself the state\u2019s prerogative of defining the duties of witnesses in judicial proceedings and the prescribing of penalties for the violation of such duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Moreover, section 4 speaks of a physician who \u201csucceeds\u201d another physician \u201cin charge of a case.\u201d He is not to disparage the physician who \u201cpreceded\u201d him in charge of the case, for such conduct tends to lower the confidence of the \u201cpatient\u201d in the medical profession and reacts against the \u201cpatient,\u201d the profession and the critic. This suggests a doctor-patient relationship and one doctor succeeding another in that relationship.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is difficult to fit the actors in the present drama into such a picture. It is hard to visualize the coroner or the widow or the body of the decedent as a patient in charge, first, of Dr. Ellis and, later, of Dr. Bernstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">There is no escape from the conclusion that the evidence does not show a violation of section 4 in the Hill ease.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The Muir Case</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The charge was that Dr. Bernstein violated section I<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of Article IV of Chapter III of the Principles of Medical Ethics in that \u201con March 10, 1951, Mrs. Leo P. Muir was a patient of Dr. M. L. Lipton, and was in Pittsburg Community. Hospital for delivery of her second child.' It was decided that a Caesarean section was necessary and the patient was moved from the labor room to surgery. Just prior to this removal, Dr. Bernstein was scrubbing for a delivery and he engaged a nurse in conversation within hearing distance of Mr. and Mrs. Muir. Dr. Bernstein commented to the nurse, and the comment was h\u00e9ard by Mr. and Mrs. Muir, that this was the poorest excuse for a section that he had ever seen and that \u2018if she (Mrs. Muir) pushed one through, \u25a0 she can push another through.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The trial court found the evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that this charge constituted an intentional violation of said section 1. Our examination of the record convinces us that the court\u2019s finding is correct and cannot be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Appellant claims that the remarks which he made to the nurse'were not intended for the ears of Dr. Lipton\u2019s patient or her husband and that he was unaware that they did hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>what he said. However, as stated orally by the trial court \u201cthe councilors could have made an implied finding that what the doctor said was intended to be overheard.\u201d There was evidence that the doctor was only 12 feet distant from the patient and her husband and that the door between them was open. Although the nurse testified that this conversation was carried on in a normal tone of voice and she did not know whether anybody else heard-it, she also said she did know that they could have heard it if they had been listening and was afraid at the time that they had heard. Later, in a letter to the chairman of the Ethics Committee of the respondent association Dr. Bernstein exhibited considerable animus toward Dr. Lipton. Of this the trial court said \u201cI think the petitioner\u2019s attitude toward the doctor [Lipton] as expressed in that letter strongly corroborates the intention here, and he may have intended by the remarks for the patient to hear and to disparage Dr. Lipton.\u201d Appellant claims his letter was admitted for a limited purpose which did not embrace the use made of it by the trial court. That is not correct. After its introduction and just prior to the conclusion of the accusers\u2019 case in chief, the referee, asked by appellant\u2019s counsel for clarification as to the parts admitted, ruled that the portion thereof which dealt'with \u201ca pharmacy fabrication\u201d (not involved upon this appeal) would not be considered, but that \u201cso far as the balance of the letter, as I heard it, I think it is all material. With that admonition to the Council, I think there is adequate safeguard for the admission of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The patient testified that she was terribly disturbed by Dr. Bernstein\u2019s remarks and momentarily lost confidence in her doctor and; thought of consulting another doctor but after considering it regained her confidence in Dr. Lipton, who had already consulted two doctors before recommending a Caesarean.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">It is clear that the charge and the evidence supporting it present facts which come well within the purview of the canon in question. This canon in its application to the circumstances of the Muir ease is neither unreasonable nor against public policy and we find no basis for a reviewing court to disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling in respect to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The Enea Case</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The charge was that Dr. Bernstein violated section l<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of article IV of chapter III of the Principles of Medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Ethics in that \u201cin the latter part of March, or early April, 1950, Mrs. Sarah A. Enea was under the care of Dr. S. S. Steinbergh for treatment of a fractured hip. After surgery was scheduled for this condition, Dr. Bernstein stated to Mrs. Enea\u2019s brother that Mrs. Enea should not be operated upon for this condition. On May 12, 1950, Mrs. Enea was again operated upon for the fractured hip condition. At that time, Dr. Bernstein told Mrs. Enea\u2019s brother that they should call in a consultant and that they should have done this initially as he suggested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The second incident is supported in part by the testimony of the patient, Mrs. Enea, in the form of a written statement by her.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is not too clear whether in making this statement she was referring to the first or second incident of the charge. We were inclined to view it as a reference to the first incident, but appellant insists that she was speaking of the second incident and he has convinced us that such was the case, particularly in view of the words \u201cwho stated that I should not have beep operated upon\u201d which appear near the end of the first sentence of her statement. (That leaves the first incident of the charge unsupported by sufficient evidence but the proof concerning the second incident is sufficient, and that in turn is sufficient to affirm the trial court.) Dr. Bernstein now objects to the hearsay portion of this statement. He says that hearsay cannot serve as the sole basis for a finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">It appears to us that he is not in a position to urge this objection in view of the circumstances under which Mrs. Enea\u2019s statement went into evidence. The referee had already ruled out as hearsay a question addressed to the witness Dr. Steinbergh asking him to tell what Mrs. Enea\u2019s husband told him that Dr. Bernstein said to Mrs. Enea\u2019s brother. The accusers were now offering this statement signed by Mrs. Enea, explaining that she refused to come to the hearing and testify. His counsel then suggested that he and opposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>counsel \u201cget together during some future recess and . . . eliminate the hearsay and opinion. I would be perfectly satisfied to have the balance of the statement read in the record. I don\u2019t think the record should be cluttered up with a lot of hearsay and opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Such a conference was held. Counsel agreed upon elimination of the second paragraph of the statement and stipulated that the first paragraph go into evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To stipulate it into evidence under the circumstances described would seem in effect a stipulation that this piece of hearsay be treated as fully competent for all purposes and thus would be eligible to serve as the sole proof of what Dr. Bernstein said upon that occasion. It would seem inequitable to permit him now to object that this bit of hearsay was not buttressed by more direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In making this analysis of this evidence we are not holding that in a hearing of this nature hearsay might not furnish a sufficient basis for the finding of a material fact. The by-laws of the California Medical Association govern the conduct of such hearings and provide that they shall be conducted \u201cin such manner as to ascertain all the facts fairly to the accuser and accused, eliminating all formal or technical rules and requirements which ordinarily pertain to judicial proceedings.\u201d Such a rule well may sanction the use of relevant hearsay to support a finding, (see <em>Sada </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>11 Cal.2d 263, 268-269 [78 P.2d 1127]) a question which we need not determine in view of the circumstances under which the presently questioned hearsay was put in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Dr. Bernstein testified that one of his own patients (Frank Aiello, a brother of Mrs. Enea) came to him, told him the nail which had been inserted during the first operation had slipped and asked \u201cWhat do you think about it?\u201d and the doctor replied it would probably be a good idea to get another opinion. Asked whom he would suggest, he suggested getting a Dr. Fisher but to do so through Dr. Steinbergh. He argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>that such a response, to one of his own patients, characterizes it as a communication which is not proscribed by the canon of ethics specified in the charge. He thereby overlooks Mrs. Enea\u2019s testimony that Dr. Bernstein said that she \u201cshould not have been operated upon, for this condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The trial court considered this point and rejected it. In doing so, the court referred to the bitter feeling toward Dr. Steinbergh which-Dr. Bernstein displayed in emphatic terms in a letter which he later wrote to the Ethics Committee of the medical association in regard to this and other incidents. In this connection the court said: \u201c. . . the language he used about Dr. Steinbergh in his letter to the Ethics Committee, very frankly I just don\u2019t think the Court can feel that he acted in good faith. I think the only sustainable finding is that Dr. Bernstein intended to injure and disparage Dr. Steinbergh.\u201d However we might have interpreted the canon involved, in its application to the facts of the Enea case, had we that interpretation to make in the first instance, it. comes to us upon appeal after having been made pursuant to appellant\u2019s agreement to be bound by the interpretation made by his state council. That interpretation has in turn been confirmed by the trial court and we are unable to say that it is unreasonable or against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We conclude that there is no basis for \u00e1 reviewing court to disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that Charge 5 [the Enea case] constituted an intentional violation of Section 1, Article 4, of Chapter III of the Principles of Medical Ethics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Redetermination of Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The determination of the penalty (censure, suspension, or expulsion) for violation of the Principles of Medical Ethics is vested in .the trial council, subject to appropriate review, of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Here the trial council imposed a single penalty, that of expulsion, for all seven.violations, not a separate penalty for any one of them, nor a separate penalty for any group of them less than seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The seven violations have now been reduced .to two. We have no way of knowing whether the trial council would have meted out the same penalty if it had found these two violations only. When such a situation develops upon the review of a disciplinary order of a public administrative agency, the agency is directed to set aside the order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>redetermine the penalty. <em>(Bonham </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>45 Cal.2d 304, and cases cited on p. 306 [288 P.2d 502].) We deem that principle applicable here. (See <em>Cason </em>v. <em>Glass Bottle Blowers Assn., </em>37 Cal.2d 134, 147 [231 P.2d 6], remanding the matter of reinstatement or retrial \u201cto the union for further proceedings in accordance with the rules which we have discussed.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider appellant\u2019s claim that the penalty of expulsion was excessive, arbitrary, in abuse of discretion and based in part upon charges which the trial council found were not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Is This a Justiciable Controversy ?</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The respondent association advances the argument that \u201cmembership in a professional nonprofit association such as respondent in which the members have no severable interest in the property of the association, is not the subject of judicial intervention as there is no property right involved.\u201d  That is an inadequate and inaccurate statement of the applicable principles which have been succinctly expressed by the Supreme Court in these words: \u201cIn any proper case involving the expulsion of a member from a voluntary unincorporated association, the only function which the courts may perform is to determine whether the association has acted within its powers in good faith, in accordance with its laws and the law of the land.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Kern County Medical Assn., </em>19 Cal.2d 263, 265 [120 P.2d 874].) In making that statement the Supreme Court cited <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Magnolia Lodge, I.O.O.F., </em>110 Cal. 297 [42 P. 887], and <em>Smetherham </em>v. <em>Laundry Workers\u2019 Union, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 131 [111 P.2d 948], The very act of citing these two cases carries an implied suggestion that in relation to this subject there is no fundamental distinction between a medical association, a labor union and a fraternal or beneficial association. In each type of organization the relationship between the members and the group is determined by contract, the terms of which find expression in the constitution and by-laws. \u201cAny matter of policy involved in the adoption of the by-laws, the code of ethics, and the resolution in conformity therewith, is a question for the membership itself and is not debatable here so long as it is not shown that such policy is in violation of law.\u201d (Pp. 270-271 of 19 Cal.2d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Other forms of expressing this same principle will be found in <em>Swital </em>v. <em>Real Estate Comr., </em>116 Cal.App.2d 677, 679 [254 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>P.2d 587], concerning membership upon a realty board, and in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>International Union etc. Engineers, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 66, 68 [257 P.2d 85], relating to membership in a labor union.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">We entertain no doubt that the issues discussed herein are justiciable and that mandamus affords an appropriate proceeding for their judicial consideration and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Somewhat inconsistently with its contention that this is not a justiciable controversy respondent upon this appeal asks that in the ease in which the state council overruled the trial council and in two of the cases in which the trial court annulled the findings of the trial council, the findings of the latter should be revived, restored and given legal effect. The respondent is in no position to make any such claim. It did not appeal from the state council\u2019s decision nor did it petition the trial court nor has it appealed from the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to revise the findings of fact and conclusions of law and render judgment, all in accordance with the views herein expressed, the judgment to include a direction to the trial council to set aside its order of expulsion and to determine the penalty to be imposed in the light of the revised findings herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 16, 1956, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 11, 1956.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Section 14 of chap.
