J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-U\">This is a proceeding in habeas corpus to determine whether petitioner has been once in jeopardy on the charges for which the county seeks to place him on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">The petitioner was indicted, charged with the commission of several felonies. He pleaded not guilty. His trial commenced on October 17, 1955. On that date 12 jurors were duly and properly selected, impaneled and sworn. The trial was then continued by consent to October 18, 1955. On that day only 11 jurors appeared. The 12th juror, one Vernon Bartholomew, had been arrested on a felony charge on his way to court. The trial court suggested to counsel that the case, by stipulation, proceed to trial with 11 jurors. To this, petitioner\u2019s counsel objected, claiming that Bartholomew, in spite of his arrest, was competent to act as a juror. The trial court by consent continued the ease until October 20th. On that day, outside the presence of the other 11 jurors, the trial court interrogated Bartholomew and his counsel as to the reason why Bartholomew had not been present on October 18th. Bartholomew, directly or through his counsel, informed the court that he had been arrested on October 18th on a felony charge and was presently out on bail. Bartholomew then asked permission to make a statement. He stated that because of his arrest \u201cI do not feel in good conscience, that I can fairly and impartially discharge my duties as a juror. I believe that the events which have occurred may influence my own deliberations and may have a distracting effect upon the deliberation of my fellow jurors. I therefore respectfully request the Court to relieve me of my duties as a juror in connection with this pending case.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel resisted the dismissal of the juror, claiming that Bartholomew was fully competent, and that good cause had not been shown for his discharge. The trial court dismissed Bartholomew as a juror, then dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>the other 11 jurors, and set October 27th as the day petitioner should be tried before a new jury. In the meantime, petitioner\u2019s counsel was permitted to enter a plea of once in jeopardy. On October 27th petitioner\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that petitioner had been once in jeopardy. The motion was denied, and petitioner, who was then in jail pending trial, instituted the present proceeding to test the validity of his restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In support of the petition it is argued that after a jury has been impaneled and sworn a juror can only be discharged for \u201cgood cause,\u201d and that the circumstances here involved, as a matter of law, do not constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d  It is true, of course, that after a jury has been impaneled a juror can be dismissed only for \u201cgood cause,\u201d but it is quite clear that, under the circumstances here involved, the trial court acted well within its discretion in determining that \u201cgood cause\u201d existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Even in the absence of statute the trial court possesses the power to dismiss a juror for \u201cgood cause.\u201d The general rule is stated as follows in 38 American Law Reports 706:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">\u201c. . . the general modern rule is that the court may discharge a jury without working an acquittal on the defendant, in any case where the ends of justice, under the circumstances, would otherwise be defeated. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">\u201cThus the cases are practically unanimous in holding that it is within the power of the trial court to discharge the jury in a criminal action for any misconduct or disqualification of one or more of its members which is of such a character as to render the discharge necessary in order to prevent the frustration of the ends of justice, and that in such case, the discharge will not support a plea of former jeopardy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">This general rule is codified in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Section 1123 of the Penal Code provides, in part: \u201cIf before the jury has returned its verdict into court, a juror becomes sick or upon other good cause shown to the court is found to be unable to perform his duty, the court may order him to be discharged.\u201d If there is no alternate that may sit for him in the case of such a discharge, \u201cthe jury shall be discharged and a new jury then or afterwards impaneled, and the cause may be again tried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Section 1141 of the Penal Code provides: \u201cIn all cases where a jury is discharged or prevented from giving a verdict by reason of an accident or other cause, except where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>the defendant is discharged during the progress of the trial or after the cause is submitted to them, the cause may again be tried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Petitioner relies on the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>211 Cal. 322 [295 P. 333, 71 A.L.R. 1385]. In that case, during a murder trial, one of the jurors disclosed to the court that she knew some of the defense witnesses and was prejudiced against them. The juror was discharged and an alternate juror was substituted. On appeal, after conviction, the defendant contended that he had been deprived of a common law jury trial. At that time section 1089 of the Penal Code provided that an alternate juror could be substituted for a regular juror if \u201ca juror dies or becomes ill so as to be unable to perform his duty.\u201d There was no other statutory cause for the discharge of a juror. The Supreme Court held that while it might have been a procedural error to discharge the juror and to substitute the alternate, the error was not prejudicial. At the time the Howard case was decided section 1123 of the Penal Code provided for the discharge of a juror when \u201ca juror becomes sick, so as to be unable to perform his duty.\u201d Both sections 1089 and 1123 have now been amended to allow an alternate to be substituted or a juror dismissed if \u201ca juror becomes sick or upon other good cause shown to the court. \u201d  Thus, under existing law a juror may be discharged, without jeopardy attaching, if \u201cgood cause\u201d for the discharge exists. What constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d by necessity, rests largely in the discretion of the trial court,  Certainly, when a juror in a criminal case, after being chosen, is himself charged with a felony and expresses the wish to be relieved because he does not feel that he can fairly perform his duties, the court has discretion to determine that this is \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">There is nothing in the cases cited by petitioner contrary to these views. The eases cited are <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruef, </em>14 Cal.App. 576 [114 P. 48, 54], <em>People </em>v. <em>Young, </em>100 Cal.App. 18 [279 P. 824], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Schmitz, </em>7 Cal.App. 330 [94 P. 407, 419, 15 L.R.A.N.S. 717]. These cases dealt with the propriety of the exercising of peremptory challenges, or held that a juror could not compel his own discharge. None of the cases dealt with what constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d within the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">After the filing of this petition a supplementary petition was filed directed to the authorities in Santa Clara <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>County, it appearing that petitioner is now in custody on another charge in that county. Since the original custody was lawful, this subsequent custody is also lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The writ heretofore issued is discharged, and the supplementary petition for a writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Bray, J., and Wood (Fred B.), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 11, 1956.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
