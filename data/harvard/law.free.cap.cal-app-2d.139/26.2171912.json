The facts related by appellant in his application to the superior court and the arguments that he advances need not be stated in making disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is not appropriate or available as a remedy for correction of a judgment where the facts upon which redress is sought were known to the applicant at the time the judgment was rendered. Appellant makes no contention that any pertinent facts were unknown to him at that time and even if, as he claims, he did not understand that he could be adjudged an habitual criminal his ignorance furnishes no reason for entertaining an application for correction of the judgment through the procedure which he has adopted. As to the limitations upon the use of that procedure see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>138 Cal.App.2d 243 [291 P.2d 517].</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
