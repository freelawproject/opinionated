In determining this proposition we are controlled by the well-established rule that, \u201cIn considering the sufficiency of a complaint, the questions of proper designation of the action or the prayer for relief are not matters of serious concern. The important question is, does the complaint state any cause of action entitling plaintiff to any relief at law or in equity?\u201d <em>(Estergren </em>v. <em>Sager, </em>39 Cal.App.2d 401, 404 [103 P.2d 177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Here the pertinent allegations of the complaint which was entitled, \u201cSecond Amended Complaint in Claim and Delivery and for Damages,\u201d are that the plaintiffs are the owners and entitled to the possession of certain property in the possession of the defendant Wills as plaintiffs\u2019 bailee; that the defendant Epley, acting under the fictitious name of Retailers Credit Association, filed an action in the justice court and caused a writ of attachment to issue upon plaintiffs\u2019 property whereby the defendant Drewes, as constable, took the same into his possession. Thereafter Epley caused a writ of execution to issue and the property to be sold by Drewes to the defendant Smith. All of such acts are alleged to have been without the knowledge of plaintiffs; and it is also alleged that demand was made upon defendants for the return of the property but they refused. The prayer was for the return of the same or, in the alternative, damages for its conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">It is readily apparent from the complaint as summarized that plaintiffs charged the defendants \u201cwith exercising dominion\u201d over property inconsistent with plaintiffs\u2019 ownership. This, said the court in <em>Haigler </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>18 Cal.2d 674, 681 [117 P.2d 331], \u201csets forth a good cause of action for conversion\u201d in the absence of a special demurrer for uncertainty. This would be true as against a plaintiff causing an attachment to be levied and sale to be made under execution of personal property not owned by the person against whom the process runs <em>(Mission Fixture Co. </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>26 Cal.App. 691 [148 P. 223]) as well as against the buyer at such a sale <em>(Jackins </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>63 Cal.App. 463 [218 P. 1027]).  It should be noted that contrary to the sole argument of respondents in support of the judgment, the summary remedy for asserting third party claims \u201cis not exclusive.\u201d (19 Cal.Jur.2d, \u00a7 128, p. 524.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Van Dyke, P. J., and Sehottky, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
