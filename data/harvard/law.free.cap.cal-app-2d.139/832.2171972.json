J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axv\">This is an appeal by Rebecca Riley, as administratrix of the deceased ward\u2019s estate, from an order in the guardianship proceeding, approving account of closing expenses, discharging the guardian, Naomi Blair Ruoff, and exonerating bond; and denying objections to closing expenses, petition for surcharge and for vacation of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Alfred G. Blair died July 8, 1950, leaving the entire estate to wife Susan for life, with remainder for life, share and share alike to the respondent daughter, Naomi Blair Ruoff and to Phoebe L. Bonnen, and their survivor. On August 2, 1950, Naomi was appointed executrix of Mr. Blair\u2019s estate. On August 8, 1950, the widow, Susan, was declared incompetent and Naomi became guardian of both person and estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Although Mr. Blair\u2019s estate was sufficient to provide a widow\u2019s allowance, no application therefor was made by anyone. Naomi, as guardian, secured in Susan\u2019s guardianship proceeding, an order for the widow\u2019s maintenance, of not to exceed $500 per month for 14 months. No appeal from this order was taken. The maintenance of Susan, under this order, was accordingly paid from the guardianship estate until Susan\u2019s death on May 2, 1951, the sum of $5,216.58 being so paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Subsequent to the death of Susan, Phoebe L. Bonnen was appointed administratrix of Susan\u2019s estate, and on August 31, 1951, Naomi filed a final account as Susan\u2019s guardian, showing the above mentioned expenditure for Susan\u2019s maintenance. No objections were filed to this account and the same was duly approved and settled; no appeal was taken from the order made. Thereafter, Naomi, the retiring guardian, sought the vacation of this final settlement with leave to file a supplemental and amended report to include additional matters not relating to the widow\u2019s allowance. To certain items of this final account, Phoebe L. Bonnen, Susan\u2019s administratrix, filed written objections, but made no objection that the guardian\u2019s report did not show application in Mr. Blair\u2019s estate for a widow\u2019s allowance nor that the report wrongfully showed maintenance from the ward\u2019s estate. Subsequently thereto, Phoebe resigned as administratrix and Rebecca Riley, appellant herein, was appointed as Susan\u2019s administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">At the hearing on the objections, at which all interested parties were present in person or by counsel, the trial court determined that payment made by Naomi as the guardian, of certain notes of Alfred G. Blair, amounting to $18,453.94, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>should have been made by Naomi as executrix of Alfred\u2019s estate. Certain other minor items were found not proper credits, and an order of June 11, 1953, surcharged the guardian in the total sum of $19,794.47. Naomi was ordered to pay such sum to Rebecca Riley, appellant herein, as the administratrix of Susan\u2019s estate. It was further ordered \u201cthat except as herein otherwise adjudged, said guardian\u2019s account as supplemented, is approved and settled.\u201d It will be noted, as respondent points out, that in this proceeding, no objection was made to the guardian\u2019s payment for Susan\u2019s maintenance, and the trial court did not direct Susan\u2019s estate to sue Alfred\u2019s estate for the amount so expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">On June 24, 1954, in open court, in proceedings relating to the estate of Alfred, a settlement stipulation was entered into between Phoebe L. Bonnen, Rebecca Riley who was Susan\u2019s administratrix, and Naomi, the then executrix of Alfred\u2019s estate and Susan\u2019s guardian, whereby Alfred\u2019s estate repaid to Susan\u2019s estate the $18,453.94 erroneously paid out of Susan\u2019s estate to cover Alfred\u2019s notes. Naomi had paid to Susan\u2019s estate the minor items surcharged, retained only $500 for closing expenses in the guardianship, and resigned as Alfred\u2019s executrix. The trial court made an order pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">In arriving at this settlement stipulation, the court said, \u201cLet\u2019s not quibble about the interest,\u201d and inquired whether there were \u201cany other matters that we have not covered?\u201d Susan\u2019s administratrix, Rebecca Riley, the present appellant, raised no further question as to any claims against Naomi or the guardianship estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Naomi thereafter filed a report of the closing expenses as ordered, and petitioned for discharge. The appellant Rebecca, as Susan\u2019s administratrix, then filed objections thereto, seeking to open up the entire record, to vacate the order of June 11, 1953, and to hold Naomi liable for failure to collect interest, from Alfred\u2019s estate on the $18,453.94 paid on Alfred\u2019s notes. On March 25, 1955, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objections, approved the closing account, discharged Naomi as guardian, refused to vacate the previous order of June 11, 1953, and refused to further surcharge the guardian. The present appeal is from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">In the written objections just mentioned, appellant sets forth, \u201cThat following the death of said Susan Ann Blair and the appointment of an administratrix for her estate, an application for such family allowance was then filed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>An order was thereafter made for the payment of such family allowance from the estate of Alfred G. Blair, deceased, from which order the said Naomi Blair Ruoff and one Alfred Granville Blair, appealed. Said appeal was ultimately determined by the Supreme Court ... in which the order for family allowance was reversed on the ground that the death of Susan Ann Blair divested the probate court from making an order in her predeceased husband\u2019s estate for her allowance. In its opinion in such case (42 Cal.2d 728 [269 P.2d 612]), the Supreme Court held that <em>\u2018 </em>The guardian may be held to account in the guardianship proceedings for any alleged failure to preserve the ward\u2019s estate by failing to make a timely application for family allowance\u2019. The failure of the guardian to apply for a family allowance from her predeceased husband constituted a fraud upon the ward and upon the ward\u2019s estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that <em>\u201cA. A </em>guardian is liable for failure to take advantage of a right or source of funds as family allowance\u201d; that \u201cB. Approval of the guardian\u2019s account does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hold her liable for failure to apply for family allowance, although such failure occurred during a period covered by the account\u201d; and that \u201cC. The guardian should not be discharged and her bond should not be exonerated until she has paid the interest\u201d on the $18,453.94 hereinbefore mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The record herein discloses a long series of objections, and court proceedings of various kinds in relation to the three estates involved, namely that of Alfred G. Blair, Deceased, Susan Ann Blair, Incompetent, and Susan Ann Blair, Deceased, dating from the death of Alfred in 1950. After divers legal maneuvers, a stipulation was entered into in open court, as hereinbefore mentioned, which apparently, as respondent states, \u201cclosed all connection and responsibility of Naomi in both estates except for the item of Closing Expenses left in her hands under court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The position of the appellant is untenable. A survey of the record indicates that appellant\u2019s rights have in no manner been prejudiced at any point in the proceeding, and that the determination as it now stands, and as it stood when the settlement stipulation was entered into, affords adequate protection to all parties having an interest therein. It is fundamental that there must be an end to all litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">As stated in respondent\u2019s brief,' \u201cA person who is simul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>taneously executrix of one estate and guardian of the estate of the incompetent widow of the decedent and who acts in good faith with ordinary diligence and prudence in maintaining the ward from her own estate and not seeking widow\u2019s allowance has no liability for mistake in judgment.\u201d In the instant ease there is no showing of bad faith, carelessness or imprudence on the part of Naomi. In this situation, there is no occasion for the imposition of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The previous appeal, <em>Estate of Blair, </em>42 Cal.2d 728 [269 P.2d 612], furnishes no authority for the appellant\u2019s position. The only issue before the reviewing court in that case was whether a family allowance for maintenance of the widow could be made after the widow\u2019s death, and it was held that such allowance is entirely statutory, and Probate Code, section 680 makes no provision for such allowance after a widow\u2019s death. Whether Naomi, as Susan\u2019s guardian and Alfred\u2019s then executrix, should be held liable for failure to apply for such allowance during the widow\u2019s lifetime, was not an issue. Nor is the appellant\u2019s argument supported by the other authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">As hereinbefore noted, the trial court\u2019s order authorizing Susan\u2019s maintenance from the incompetent\u2019s estate, was not appealed from, and became final. Payments, authorized by such order, were made by Naomi as hereinbefore set forth. And, as mentioned in respondent\u2019s brief, when the court stipulation was made, the present appellant made \u201cno claim against Naomi for paying maintenance from the ward\u2019s estate and not collecting widow\u2019s allowance.\u201d The only matter then remaining undisposed of was the guardian\u2019s duty to render further account in respect to closing expenses, which account was duly filed, and approved. This closing account was obviously intended to and should have set the entire matter at rest for all time. Such, indeed, is its legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Examination of the entire record, the orders made, the stipulation entered into, and the various activities of the interested parties, indicate that there has been no miscarriage of justice, and that there is no merit in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 16, 1956, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 9, 1956.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
