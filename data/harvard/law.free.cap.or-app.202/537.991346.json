J.</author>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Plaintiffs appeal the trial court\u2019s judgment denying attorney fees in this corporate derivative suit. Defendant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> raises several cross-assignments of error, arguing, in part, that, because the merits of the underlying dispute had become moot before the trial court addressed plaintiffs\u2019 asserted entitlement to fees, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter any judgment other than a judgment of dismissal. We agree with defendant. <em>See Kay v. David Douglas Sch. Dist. No. 40, </em>303 Or 574, 738 P2d 1389 (1987), <em>cert den, </em>484 US 1032 (1988). Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss the case as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The facts that are material to our analysis and disposition are undisputed. This litigation arose from the proposed, and eventually completed, acquisition of Willamette Industries, Inc. (Willamette) by Weyerhaeuser Co. (Weyerhaeuser). Plaintiffs, Crandon Capital Partners (Crandon) and Rae Ann Brown (Brown), owned shares of Willamette.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In November 2000, Weyerhaeuser offered to purchase all of Willamette\u2019s outstanding shares for $48 per share. That $48 offer was greater than the value of the stock at that time. Willamette rejected Weyerhaeuser\u2019s offer outright. On November 14,2000, several days after Willamette\u2019s rejection, plaintiffs Crandon and Brown simultaneously filed derivative lawsuits on behalf of Willamette against the corporation and its directors. Those two suits, which were filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, were consolidated on December 20, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In their first consolidated complaint, plaintiffs alleged claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, and waste, all arising from Willamette\u2019s rejection of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s offer. Plaintiffs alleged that Willamette\u2019s directors refused to consider Weyerhaeuser\u2019s offer in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>faith and that the directors used unlawful entrenchment measures (a series of \u201cgolden parachutes\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cpoison pills\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) to deter Weyerhaeuser\u2019s potential acquisition. Plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for relief sought an injunction eliminating the alleged entrenchment measures, attorney fees, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">During the pendency of the litigation, Weyerhaeuser continued in its attempt to purchase Willamette. However, on December 10, 2001, Willamette announced that it was beginning its own negotiations with Georgia Pacific Corp. (GP) to purchase GP\u2019s building products division. Weyerhaeuser made it clear that the proposed deal with GP would render Willamette undesirable and that, if the transaction were completed, Weyerhaeuser would discontinue its efforts to acquire Willamette.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Crandon and Brown regarded the potential GP transaction as a further entrenchment measure (a \u201csuicide pill\u201d) designed to thwart Weyerhaeuser\u2019s advances. Consequently, on December 18, 2001, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which styled the proposed GP transaction as an unlawful entrenchment measure; plaintiffs again sought an injunction, attorney fees, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On January 4, 2002, Willamette stockholder WyserPratt Management Co. (Wyser-Pratt) filed a derivative complaint in Multnomah County Circuit Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Like plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint, the Wyser-Pratt complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>filed in response to the proposed GP transaction and also sought injunctive relief precluding such a transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Willamette moved to consolidate the Wyser-Pratt action with the previously filed Crandon and Brown actions. Wyser-Pratt moved for expedited discovery and a preliminary injunction to stop the GP acquisition. On January 16, 2002, the trial court heard arguments on both Willamette\u2019s motion to consolidate and Wyser-Pratt\u2019s motion for expedited discovery. Although attorneys for Crandon and Brown were present at the hearing, only attorneys for Wyser-Pratt presented argument. After ruling that the three actions would be consolidated, the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201c[I]t seems to me, from the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, [that the GP acquisition is] something that would in fact \u2014 affirmative steps, maybe not completed yet, but affirmative steps that would prevent the takeover and entrench the board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">After the court made those comments, but before the court rendered any ruling, Willamette\u2019s attorneys stipulated that Willamette would allow at least 48 hours between the time it announced an agreement with GP and the time it finalized that transaction. The 48-hour waiting period would allow plaintiffs and the court to review the final terms of any acquisition agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">On January 21, 2002, Willamette accepted Weyerhaeuser\u2019s offer and agreed to sell at a price of $55.50. Thereafter, the tender price was paid out to the shareholders. Plaintiffs never sought to restrict or enjoin the distribution of any part of those funds as a possible source of the payment of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">On March 21, 2002, two months after Willamette accepted Weyerhaeuser\u2019s offer, plaintiffs filed a motion for an award of attorney fees. The gravamen of that motion was that plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees because plaintiffs\u2019 efforts had \u201cforce [d] defendants to comply with their fiduciary obligations to the Company and its shareholders and respond to Weyerhaeuser\u2019s offers in good faith.\u201d Plaintiffs contended further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">\u201cNow, after 15 months of litigation, defendants have finally caved in, removed their improper defensive measures, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>agreed to a merger between Willamette and Weyerhaeuser, and abandoned a proposed acquisition by Willamette of the liability-ridden building products division of [GP]. By acquiescing to demands made by plaintiffs, defendants have conceded to plaintiffs\u2019 primary claims. Continued litigation of plaintiffs\u2019 claims is not necessary as plaintiffs have obtained the substantive relief they sought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The court denied that motion based on defendants\u2019 assertion that plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint did not comply with ORCP 68. However, the court, over defendants\u2019 objections, allowed plaintiffs to file a third amended complaint solely to seek fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">On December 5, 2003, after a series of motions and hearings related to plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint, the trial court held a hearing addressing issues of fee entitlement. Ultimately, after reviewing voluminous submissions on fee entitlement in corporate derivative suits, with particular emphasis on Delaware case law addressing arguably analogous circumstances, the corut determined that plaintiffs were not entitled to recover fees. That ruling rested on two principal premises: First, the primary benefit that plaintiffs had sought was enhancement of the price of Willamette shares, including through Willamette\u2019s acceptance of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s tender offer. Second, in derivative cases involving claims for attorney fees based on securing such a common pecuniary benefit, a plaintiff is required to enjoin the distribution of at least a portion of the tender price so as to segregate and maintain a fund from which fees can be paid by those who benefitted from the attorneys\u2019 efforts. That is, as an equitable matter, the benefitted shareholders of the acquired company \u2014 and not the shareholders of the acquiring company \u2014 should bear the cost of efforts that increased the buyout price. Because that prerequisite was not met here \u2014 the tender price had been fully disbursed \u2014 plaintiffs could not recover fees. The trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201c[W]hat I see in all of these [Delaware] cases is that the * * * common fund or corporate benefit exception is a[n] exception to the American rule for attorneys fees, and it is based on the notion that it would be more equitable to require those who are benefitted to pay the attorneys fees and that it enhances certain public policies in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>encouraging enforcement of shareholders\u2019 rights to do that. But the first and foremost underlying premise is those who benefitted should pay, whether it\u2019s common fund or corporate benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201cThe gravamen of the benefit in this case, even though it would be extremely difficult [to measure] is, in fact, in the increased dollar value received by the shareholders as a result of Willamette\u2019s board finally agreeing to the tender offer and, frankly, driving up Weyerhaeuser\u2019s bid. And it\u2019s for that reason that this method of having funds segregated for the tender offer for the payment of fees and expenses has been developed, because that\u2019s the benefit * * * even if you characterize it as a dismantling of these barriers and elimination of this improper entrenchment activity, the bottom line is that it only matters because the price for shareholders went up, they got more value. But they were cashed out. They didn\u2019t become shareholders in the new corporation * * *. And I conclude that * * * the plaintiffs having shown no good reason not to have sought a segregation of the funds, it would be inequitable at this point to require the successor to pay the attorney fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Crandon and Brown now appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They contend, variously, that the trial court misconstrued and misapplied the law pertaining to the recovery of attorney fees under a corporate \u201ccommon benefit\u201d theory and that the court was wrong in concluding that, in the absence of a retained monetary fund, it would be inequitable to require Weyerhaeuser, as defendants\u2019 successor, to pay plaintiffs\u2019 attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Defendant disputes those arguments and, further, raises a variety of cross-assignments of error. Two of those cross-assignments are closely related and pertain to matters that necessarily precede our consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments: (1) The trial court erred in failing to dismiss this case because the merits of the parties\u2019 underlying dispute had been mooted long before the court entered judgment denying attorney fees; and (2) even if the case was not moot, the court erred in failing to deny fees on the ground that, because plaintiffs had not \u201cprevailed\u201d in the underlying litigation, they could not recover attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The first of those cross-assignments is dispositive. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 request for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">We begin with an overview of Oregon\u2019s mootness doctrine. Under Oregon law, a case becomes moot when the interests of the parties cease to be adverse, <em>Barcik v. Kubiaczyk, </em>321 Or 174, 182, 895 P2d 765 (1995), or when \u201ca court\u2019s decision no longer will have a practical effect on or concerning the rights of the parties!.]\u201d <em>Brumnett v. PSRB, </em>315 Or 402, 406, 848 P2d 1194 (1993). \u201cMootness is a species of justiciability, and a court of law exercising the judicial power of the state has authority to decide only justiciable controversies.\u201d <em>First Commerce of America v. Nimbus Center Assoc., </em>329 Or 199, 206, 986 P2d 556 (1999). Thus, \u201c[i]n Oregon, the judicial power simply does not extend to moot or otherwise nonjusticiable matters.\u201d <em>Starrett v. City of Portland, </em>196 Or App 534, 539, 102 P3d 728 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Here, Willamette\u2019s acceptance of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s tender offer and Weyerhaeuser\u2019s consequent acquisition of Willamette rendered plaintiffs\u2019 claims in the derivative litigation nonjusticiable. There no longer was any live controversy with respect to the compelled dismantling of the alleged \u201centrenchment measures.\u201d The question reduces to whether that mooting of the \u201cmerits\u201d of the parties\u2019 dispute deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiffs\u2019 alleged entitlement to attorney fees. <em>Kay </em>is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In <em>Kay, </em>a group of high school students, and the parent of one of the students, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against inclusion of a formal prayer at David Douglas High School\u2019s 1984 graduation ceremony. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint focused solely on that ceremony without seeking \u201cmore general relief against future practices of defendants.\u201d <em>Kay, </em>303 Or at 576. At a show cause hearing, the trial court rendered \u201can oral opinion\u201d that the requested injunctive relief should be allowed and \u201cannounc[ed] that \u2018that will be the Order of this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576-77. However, the court did not contemporaneously enter a written order. The graduation ceremony then occurred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On June 28, 1984, more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>one month after the graduation ceremony, the court signed a judgment that granted the requested equitable relief. The court\u2019s order enjoined the defendants from including a formal prayer in \u201ccommencement exercises for the 1984 graduating class\u201d of the high school. <em>Id. </em>at 577. In that judgment, the court also awarded attorney fees to the plaintiffs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The defendants appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the circuit court with instructions to vacate the judgment. The court identified the threshold \u201cproblem\u201d as \u201cwhether a justiciable controversy between the parties existed at the time of the circuit court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that regard, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cA party with standing under the various applicable tests might, of course, seek relief against future repetitions of the challenged governmental act, but these plaintiffs presented no such claims to the circuit court. And a court cannot either mandate or enjoin an act after it has been completed, at least not until the cosmological theory of reversible time is better established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\"><em>Id. </em>The court then determined that the trial court\u2019s oral remarks at the show cause hearing did not constitute an \u201corder or a judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578. Accordingly, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201c[TJhere was no effective judgment until it was signed and entered according to ORCP 70 B. On the face of the pleadings and the interests asserted by these plaintiffs, there was by that date nothing for the court to decide. The circuit court should have dismissed the proceedings after the commencement exercises were over. * * * <em>As the judgment for attorney fees would fall along with the belated judgment entered by the circuit court, </em>defendants\u2019 reason for maintaining their appeal also would disappear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 579 (footnotes omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Our own decisions accord with that analysis. For example, in <em>Tanner v. OHSU, </em>157 Or App 502, 971 P2d 435 (1998), we held that an award of fees against certain defendants was jurisdictionally erroneous because the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>merits as to those defendants had become moot prior to the judgment. In <em>Tanner, </em>three employees of OHSU sought relief from the denial of health benefits to their same-sex partners. They named OHSU and a group of related state agencies as defendants. The trial court granted an injunction and attorney fees to the plaintiffs against all defendants. However, before entry of the trial court\u2019s judgment, the legislature had transformed OHSU into a public corporation that operated independently of the various state agency defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 505. After the judgment, but before the appeal, OHSU adopted new policies allowing same-sex partner benefits; however, OHSU continued to maintain on appeal that it was not legally obligated to extend benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In analyzing mootness, we distinguished between the state agency defendants and OHSU. Regarding the state agency defendants, we held that, \u201cbecause at the time of the entry of judgment the trial court had no authority to enter <em>any </em>judgment against the state defendants, the entire case against those defendants \u2014 merits and award of attorney fees \u2014 is moot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513 (emphasis in original). Conversely, with respect to OHSU, we held that the appeal was still justiciable because of that defendant\u2019s insistence that it was not legally obligated to extend benefits and the concurrent potential that, if the appeal were dismissed, OHSU would reinstate its former practices. <em>Id. </em>at 510; <em>accord Safeway, Inc. v. OPEU, </em>152 Or App 349, 355, 954 P2d 196 (1998) (appeal was justiciable because, despite the fact that the defendant had unilaterally ceased the challenged conduct, the plaintiff sought to enjoin future conduct by the defendant, the defendant continued to maintain its legal entitlement to engage in the challenged conduct, and the potential for recidivism was strong).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The present case is indistinguishable substantively from <em>Kay, </em>and closely analogous to the circumstances of the state agency defendants in <em>Tanner. </em>Here, plaintiffs\u2019 claims related to the elimination of the alleged \u201centrenchment measures\u201d so as to facilitate Weyerhaeuser\u2019s acquisition of Willamette. When that transaction was complete \u2014 as when the high school commencement occurred, or when the state agencies\u2019 authority over OHSU was statutorily eliminated\u2014 the parties\u2019 dispute ended. At that point, any decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>trial court would no longer have had \u201ca practical effect on or concerning the rights of the parties [.]\u201d <em>Brumnett, </em>315 Or at 406. Consequently the court should have dismissed the case as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Conversely, the circumstances here are distinguishable from those of the OHSU defendants in <em>Tanner </em>and the defendants in <em>Safeway. </em>In those cases, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin future conduct, the defendants maintained that they had a legal right to engage in future conduct, and the courts determined that a future dispute was likely. <em>See Tanner, </em>157 Or App at 510; <em>Safeway, </em>152 Or App at 355. None of those factors is present here. The Willamette/ Weyerhaeuser transaction is complete; plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin continuing future conduct; and no risk exists in the future for the conduct at issue. To paraphrase Justice Linde in <em>Kay, </em>unless or until time can be reversed, defendants\u2019 ability to maintain entrenchment measures to thwart Weyerhaeuser\u2019s takeover ended when Weyerhaeuser took over Willamette. In sum, this is not a case where the defendants ceased their wrongful behavior only to leave themselves \u201cfree to return to [their] old ways.\u201d <em>Gates v. McClure, </em>284 Or 685, 689, 588 P2d 32 (1978). Rather, this is a case where the parties\u2019 adverse interests simply ceased to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We thus conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 claims became moot when Weyerhaeuser acquired Willamette. Thereafter, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to render any disposition other than dismissing the case for lack of justiciability. <em>Kay, </em>303 Or at 579; <em>Tanner, </em>157 Or App at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Plaintiffs maintain, nevertheless, that they can avoid mootness by way of invoking a \u201ccatalyst theory.\u201d Under such a theory, as recognized and applied in courts in many other jurisdictions, a plaintiff may, in certain circumstances, be deemed to be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to attorney fees if, in response to the prosecution of litigation, the defendant has unilaterally altered its conduct and afforded the requested relief, precluding entry of judgment on the merits. <em>See generally Brennan v. La Tourelle Apartments, </em>184 Or App 235, 244, 56 P3d 423 (2002) (addressing generic operation of the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d). Perhaps the most familiar recognition of the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d is with respect to attorney fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>awards pursuant to 42 USC section 1988 in federal civil rights litigation under 42 USC section 1983. In that context, one federal court of appeals has summarized the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201cWhere a defendant voluntarily complies with a plaintiffs requested relief, thereby rendering the plaintiffs lawsuit moot, the plaintiff is a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 under [42 USC] section 1988 if his suit is a catalyst for the defendant\u2019s voluntary compliance and the defendant\u2019s compliance was not gratuitous, meaning the plaintiffs suit was neither \u2018frivolous, unreasonable [n]or groundless.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><em>Little Rock School Dist. v. Special School Dist. </em>1, 17 F3d 260, 262 (8th Cir 1994) (alteration in original). Thus, the \u201ccatalyst theory,\u201d as recognized in other jurisdictions, deems the plaintiff to have \u201cprevailed\u201d concurrently with the defendant\u2019s (otherwise mooting) \u201cvoluntary compliance.\u201d That characterization, in turn, obviates application of the principle that the mooting of the merits before entry of judgment deprives the court of jurisdiction to award attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Despite the prevalence of the \u201ccatalyst theory\u2019 in other jurisdictions, no reported Oregon decision has ever adopted such an approach. <em>See, e.g., Conifer Ridge Homeowners Assn. v. Hayworth, </em>176 Or App 603, 610, 32 P3d 929 (2001) (so stating). We decline plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to do so in this case for two reasons. First, adoption of a \u201ccatalyst theory\u2019 cannot be squared with <em>Kay. </em>Although nothing in <em>Kay </em>itself addresses the potential availability of a \u201ccatalyst theory\u2019 \u2014 and our own examination of the briefing there also yields no such references \u2014 recognition of a \u201ccatalyst theory\u2019 cannot be reconciled with <em>Kay\u2019s </em>analysis and disposition. Indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in <em>Kay </em>included a claim under section 1983, with a concomitant request for fees under 42 USC section 1988. <em>Kay, </em>303 Or at 576, 578 n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Second, even if Nay were, somehow, not dispositive, plaintiffs\u2019 claims here would not fall within the contours of the \u201ccatalyst theory\u2019 as it has been commonly defined and applied. In <em>Brennan, </em>a case in which we declined to apply the \u201ccatalyst theory\u2019 with respect to an entitlement to attorney fees under the fee provision of the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, ORS 90.255, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cWhile the public has an interest in compliance with civil rights laws without the need for litigation and an award of attorney fees against an offender who capitulates after the action is filed will further such an interest, that kind of public interest is lacking in a dispute over whether a landlord is in possession of a tenant\u2019s property. In the latter situation, there is no fundamental principle at stake expressed by a law in which the members of the public have a direct interest. Rather, the dispute is between private parties. Indeed, to adopt a catalyst rule under such circumstances does not motivate public compliance with some fundamental concept of civil liberty. Rather it encourages costly litigation and provides a motive to seek a court-ordered remedy as opposed to settling such disputes without the need for litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">184 Or App at 245. The same is true here.
