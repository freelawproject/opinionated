During this period he served as an officer of the Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces in China, specifically in Shanghai, and was without dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">From April 1 to September 15, 1932 he occupied private apartments rented by him, and at least partly furnished by him. September 15, 1932 to the end of that month there was made available to him bachelor officer\u2019s quarters in an officers\u2019 club which he shared with another officer. He was not, however, formally assigned Government quarters. The inadequacy of the quarters he occupied for one of his rank is not questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">Plaintiff is entitled to recover under Montague v.
