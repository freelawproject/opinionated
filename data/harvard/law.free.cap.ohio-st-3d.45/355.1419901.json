We have held that R.C. 2967.03 creates no presumption that parole will be granted when designated findings are made. <em>State, ex rel. Blake, </em>v. <em>Shoemaker </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 42, 43, 4 OBR 86, 87, 446 N.E. 2d 169, 170. Therefore, Ferguson has been deprived of no liberty interest upon which he can base a due-process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The court of appeals was also correct in dismissing Ferguson\u2019s claims that the applicable regulations were violated. Ferguson contends that the board failed to show good cause for scheduling his second hearing for 1997. But the board\u2019s answer to his ninth interrogatory explains that this decision was based on the seriousness of Ferguson\u2019s offense and the likelihood that he has committed other sexual offenses. We agree with the court of appeals that this constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d under Ohio Adm. Code 5120:1-1-10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
