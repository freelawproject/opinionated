For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction but reverse the court of appeals in part and reinstate the trial court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">In the first of four propositions of law, defendant urges that her conviction was obtained in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant alleges that the state failed to disclose a plea agreement between it and Payne whereby the state would recommend a six-month sentence in exchange for Payne\u2019s testimony against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">On appeal, defendant filed the transcript of the February 11, 1987 proceeding on David R. Payne\u2019s plea, which was considered by the appellate court in its opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plea proceeding is not part of the record in O\u2019Dell\u2019s trial, and it was error for the court of appeals to consider it. \u201cA reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not part of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and <em>then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 402, 8 O.O. 3d 405, 377 N.E. 2d 500, paragraph one of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State, ex rel. The Repository, </em>v. <em>Unger </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 418, 419, 28 OBR 472, 473, 504 N.E. 2d 37, 38, fn. 2; <em>Drakulich </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 82,17 O.O. 398, 27 N.E. 2d 932; App. R. 9(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">As the state correctly points out, it was error for the appellate court to consider the transcript in Payne\u2019s plea hearing, although the court of appeals did not base its decision upon the transcript. Payne, during his examination in O\u2019Dell\u2019s trial, revealed that he had entered a guilty plea to the theft charge, had agreed to testify in this case, had not yet been sentenced and had received no promises from the prosecutor or police regarding sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He did admit that he hoped to receive a six-month sentence. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ingly, the jury was fully apprised of Payne\u2019s position and could therefore assess his credibility. There was no prosecutorial concealment here that requires a reversal such as that which occurred in the cases of <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 150, and <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1959), 360 U.S. 264, upon which the defendant relies. Defendant\u2019s first proposition of law is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-26\">The second and third propositions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>of law of the defendant challenge the trial court\u2019s refusal to give proposed instructions on (1) an accomplice\u2019s special motive to distort testimony, and (2) constructive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The court charged the jury that \u201c* * * admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and may make his testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with great caution.\u201d This instruction is dissimilar to that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App. 3d 171, 30 OBR 312, 507 N.E. 2d 388, upon which the defendant relies. In <em>Ferguson, </em>the trial court failed to instruct that an accomplice\u2019s testimony is suspect; rather, it instructed that an accomplice\u2019s testimony is to be evaluated as any other testimony. That instruction was held to be prejudicial error. <em>Id. </em>at 173-174, 30 OBR at 315-316, 507 N.E. 2d at 390-391. In this case, the trial court\u2019s instruction concerning the testimony of an accomplice correctly stated the law and gave the sum and substance of defendant\u2019s proposed instruction. That is all that is required. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 79, 65 O.O. 2d 222, 303 N.E. 2d 865, paragraph one of syllabus. Defendant\u2019s second proposition is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to give a proposed jury instruction dealing with constructive possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Twice defendant requested the instruction and twice it was refused. However, defendant\u2019s counsel later withdrew the charge and made no objection before the jury was instructed. \u201cThe failure to object to a jury instruction constitutes a waiver of any claim of error relative thereto, unless, but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St. 3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E. 2d 1332, syllabus; Crim. R. 30(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Furthermore, during its deliberations the jury asked for clarification of certain terms. The court, with the approval of counsel, gave a supplemental charge on possession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That charge, along with the general charge defining \u201cknowingly\u201d given earlier, provided the sum and substance of the requested jury instruction. Defendant\u2019s third proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Defendant\u2019s fourth and final proposition of law raises the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>whether accomplice testimony needs corroboration to sustain a conviction. <em>In State </em>v. <em>Flonnory </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St. 2d 124, 60 O.O. 2d 95, 285 N.E. 2d 726, this court held in paragraph three of the syllabus that \u201c[a] conviction may be based upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, except where otherwise specifically provided by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Subsequent to the <em>Flonnory </em>decision, R.C. 2923.03(D) was passed. It provided in part that \u201c[n]o person shall be convicted of complicity under this section solely upon the testimony of an accomplice, unsupported by other evidence.\u201d (134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1961.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The current version of R.C. 2923. 03(D), effective September 17, 1986 and applicable to the charges in this case, deletes the above language and provides instead a legislatively mandated jury instruction<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which was given virtually verbatim by the trial judge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The effect of the statutory change is to leave the assessment of an accomplice\u2019s credibility to a jury after it has been properly instructed concerning the treatment of that testimony. There is no longer a statutory requirement of corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony in Ohio, and the law on this issue is as it was under <em>Flon-nory, supra. </em>Under the revised statutes, a trier of fact is not <em>precluded </em>from basing a criminal conviction on uncorroborated accomplice testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">In any event, that is not the situation herein. As was the situation in <em>Flonnory, </em>there <em>is </em>corroborating evidence in the record in this case. Defendant was convicted on one count of receiving stolen property, R.C. 2913.51. The elements of that crime require the state to prove that the defendant received, retained or disposed of the property of another, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the property was obtained through the commission of a theft. R.C. 2913.51 (A). Four police officers observed defendant accompany Payne to or from the stores in question and shopping with him inside. One officer saw defendant insert her hands into the shipping carton used to smuggle out stolen merchandise. Defendant and Payne then exited the store and Fulford would shortly thereafter enter the store to \u201cpurchase\u201d the carton full of stolen items. Later, both shipping cartons which had been initialed by police officers were found in defendant\u2019s residence within several hours after their removal from the store. Numerous items in unopened packages with Gold Circle and K-Mart price stickers or tags still on them were found in defendant\u2019s bedroom. Defendant had no receipts and few explanations for the sixty items from K-Mart and Gold Circle found in her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>All of the above corroborates the testimony of accomplice Payne. Defendant was not convicted solely on the basis of Payne\u2019s testimony. Defendant\u2019s fourth and last proposition of law is denied, and defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The state\u2019s single proposition of law challenges the court of appeals\u2019 determination that the trial court im-permissibly increased defendant\u2019s sentence because the trial judge concluded that defendant lied during her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The one-year determinate sentence given defendant is the median prison sentence permitted for a fourth degree felony. R.C. 2929.11(D)(2). R.C. 2929.13<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> sets forth factors a court must consider in favor of imposing a shorter or a longer sentence on a defendant convicted of a third or fourth degree felony. The statute specifically states that the factors listed \u201cdo not control the court\u2019s sentencing decision\u201d nor is the trial judge limited to consideration of the matters listed where a definite term of imprisonment is imposed. R.C. 2929. 13(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">The court of appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion and reversed defendant\u2019s sentence, stating that \u201c[fjrom the statements made by the court, it is clear the court imposed a jail sentence based <em>solely </em>on his perception that the * * * [defendant] lied during her testimony and no consideration was given to the criteria set forth in R.C. 2929.13.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">Our review of the record reflects a different conclusion. Defense counsel\u2019s request for a presentence investigation report was denied without objection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>However, defense counsel orally presented to the court factors which defendant argues would mitigate in favor of a shorter sentence or probation. The court responded that <em>\u201cone </em>of the factors that the court takes into consideration is <em>not only the history and the character of the individual and nature and circumstances of the offense, but the entire person, </em>including how they act during the trial process. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) By its own words, the court indicated that it considered other factors aside from its conclusions concerning O\u2019Dell\u2019s veracity. Neither the statute nor the procedures established by this court mandate that a trial court set forth its reasons or specific consideration of the factors listed in R.C. 2929.13. A silent record raises the presumption that the trial court correctly considered the appropriate sentencing criteria. <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St. 3d 295, 525 N.E. 2d 1361, paragraph three of the syllabus (applied to R.C. 2929.12, a statute similar to R.C. 2929.13).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The court of appeals\u2019 decision relied upon <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffers </em>(1978), 57 Ohio App. 2d 107, 11 O.O. 3d 101, 385 N.E. 2d 641, and <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Fugate </em>(Jan. 28, 1988), Franklin App. Nos. 87AP-771 and 87AP-772, unreported, both of which relied in turn on <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C.A.D.C. 1969), 419 F. 2d 264, and <em>Poteet </em>v. <em>Fauver </em>(C.A. 3, 1975), 517 F. 2d 393. These cases stand for the proposition that a sentence may never be increased because the defendant, in the opinion of the sentencing judge, lied during the trial. A rationale for these holdings is that the defendant should not be punished for the crime of perjury without having been first indicted and convicted of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The United States Supreme Court disapproved of <em>Scott </em>and <em>Poteet, supra, </em>in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grayson </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 41, and noted that it has long been proper for the sentencing court to consider evidence heard during the trial as well as the demeanor of the accused. The court further observed that the defendant\u2019s truthfulness or lack thereof while testifying on his own behalf is \u201c* * * probative of his attitudes toward society and [his] prospects for rehabilitation * * <em>Id. </em>at 50. While a defendant is guaranteed the right to a trial and should never be punished for exercising that right or for refusing to enter a plea agreement, there is no federal or state constitutional right to lie on the witness stand. A defendant\u2019s act of lying while under oath is probative of his prospects for rehabilitation. Such an act is one of the factors that a trial judge may consider when imposing sentence under R.C. 2929.13. The applicable statutes do not preclude the sentencing court from considering serious misbehavior by a defendant as observed by the sentencing court during trial. In our view, this position does not inhibit a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to testify. As stated in <em>Grayson, supra:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u201c* * * Nothing we say today requires a sentencing judge to enhance, in some wooden or reflex fashion, the sentences of all defendants whose testimony is deemed false. Rather, we are reaffirming the authority of a sentencing judge to evaluate carefully a defendant\u2019s testimony on the stand, determine \u2014 with a consciousness of the frailty of human judgment \u2014 whether that testimony contained willful and material falsehoods, and, if so, assess in light of all the other knowledge gained about the defendant the meaning of that conduct with respect to his prospects for rehabilitation and restoration to a useful place in society. Awareness of such a process realistically cannot be deemed to affect the decision of an accused but uncon-victed defendant to testify truthfully in his own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">We therefore hold, as have most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>courts subsequent to <em>Grayson, supra, </em>that when a sentencing judge is the same judge who presided over the defendant\u2019s trial, the defendant\u2019s act of lying under oath is a factor that may be considered along with other pertinent factors when imposing sentence. See Annotation (1984), 34 A.L.R. 4th 888; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App. 2d 147, 24 O.O. 3d 198, 435 N.E. 2d 426. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it considered defendant\u2019s demeanor and truthfulness as a witness in light of all the other factors present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We affirm the court of appeals with respect to defendant\u2019s conviction, but reverse with respect to defendant\u2019s sentence. The trial court\u2019s sentence is hereby reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, H.

O\u2019Dell\u2019s motion to supplement the record with the plea proceeding transcript was denied by the court of appeals as \u201cunnecessary, the record already including Vols. I and II of the transcript of proceedings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-15\"> Cross-examination of Payne by O\u2019Dell\u2019s attorney elicited the following regarding a plea agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">\u201cQ. Now, on this current case that we are talking about, you were charged with one count, two counts of theft, one count of receiving stolen property and one count of possession of criminal tools, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">\u201cQ. And the possible sentence that you could have had if you were convicted of all these charges would have been six and a half years; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b184-19\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-20\">\u201cQ. And this Wednesday you entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>into an agreement with the prosecution where they would dismiss three of these charges if you agreed to testify against Mandy; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u201cQ. Is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, with my lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u201cQ. So rather than facing six and a half years as you originally were charged, if you agreed to testify, you could be sentenced \u2014 rather than just if you got convicted of six and a half years \u2014 you would only be looking at two years if you were convicted of the charges you pled guilty to?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\u201cA. What do you mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">\u201cQ. What charge did you plead guilty to?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">\u201cA. Theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">\u201cQ. And if you were convicted of theft, the worst sentence that you would receive is two years; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">\u201cQ. Whereas upon if you were convicted of grand theft, possession of criminal tools and receiving stolen property as you were originally charged, you could have received a sentence of six and a half years; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">\u201cQ. And this grand theft charge that you pled guilty to on Wednesday, you have not been sentenced on that charge; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-19\">\u201cQ. And part of that plea agreement you were told that you would not be sentenced until after you testified; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-20\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">\u201cQ. And from that grand theft charge, you can receive a possible sentence of two years, a year, a year and a half or no sentence at all; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-22\">u* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Mathless) Is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-24\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"AZH\">\u201cQ. And isn\u2019t it true that you told me that you were told by your attorney if you testified for the state, you would receive a sentence of six months?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-29\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b185-30\">\u201cQ. Is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-31\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-32\">\u201cQ. And isn\u2019t it also true that you felt if you testified for Mandy, you would receive a sentence of two years; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-33\">\u201cA. If I what?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-34\">\u201cQ. If you testified for Mandy or for the defense, you would receive a sentence for two years?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-35\">\u201cA.

What is your understanding of the maximum sentence you could receive for what you have pled guilty to? Is that 18 months?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-38\">\u201cA. Something like that.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-39\">\u201cQ. At the time you entered your plea, had you talked to me, have you ever talked to me?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-40\">\u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-41\">\u201cQ. At the time you entered your plea, had you ever talked to any police officer about this?

Before that time, had you ever talked to any police officer about anything you had done or Mandy had done or David had done?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-44\">\u201cA.
