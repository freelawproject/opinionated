For the reasons which follow, we answer such query in the affirmative, and thus affirm the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Three events occurred in this case which must be analyzed in light of the Fourth Amendment: (1) the encounter between appellant and Officer Thomas, (2) Thomas\u2019 seizure of the brown paper bag, and (3) Thomas\u2019 search of that bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">No \u201cseizure\u201d of the person of appellant occurred in this case, prior to the discovery of the contraband and appellant\u2019s subsequent arrest. It is well established that \u201c[o]bviously, not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u2018seizures\u2019 of persons. Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a \u2018seizure\u2019 has occurred.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 19, at fn. 16. \u201cThere is nothing in the Constitution which prevents a policeman from addressing questions to anyone on the streets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34 (White, J., concurring). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 544, the court reaffirmed its position, taken in <em>Terry, supra, </em>and <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 40, and detailed the degree of restraint necessary to invoke constitutional safeguards:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">\u201cWe conclude that a person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. [Footnote omitted.] Examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure, even where the person did not attempt to leave, would be the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d <em>Menden-hall, supra, </em>at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The court made it clear that \u201c[a]s long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that person\u2019s liberty or privacy as would under the Constitution require some particularized and objective justification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is <em>not enough </em>\u201cto establish a seizure that the person asking the question was a law enforcement official,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 555, nor does it matter that the person is not expressly told by the official that he is free to decline to answer questions. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 491, a plurality of the court, seven Justices, reaffirmed these principles as to when a seizure occurs. <em>Id. </em>at 497-498, 523. See, also, <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service </em>v. <em>Delgado </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 210, 215-217.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">In <em>Mendenhall, </em>the respondent, Sylvia Mendenhall, was observed by two federal Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) agents as she arrived at the Detroit Metropolitan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Airport on a flight from Los Angeles. Mendenhall\u2019s behavior appeared to the agents to fit a \u201cdrug courier profile,\u201d so the agents approached her, identified themselves as federal agents and asked to see her identification and airline ticket, which she produced. Mendenhall answered further questions posed by the agents, and after the agents identified themselves as federal narcotic agents, Mendenhall became visibly nervous. The DEA agents returned her identification and ticket to her, and asked her to accompany them to the airport DEA office. Mendenhall complied and later consented to a search of her person and her handbag. Mendenhall removed two small packages from her undergarments, one of which contained heroin, and she was <em>then </em>arrested for possession of heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 547-549. In upholding the denial of Mendenhall\u2019s motion to suppress, Justice Stewart reviewed these facts and stated: \u201c[N]othing in the record suggests that the respondent had any objective reason to believe that she was not free to end the conversation in the concourse and proceed on her way, and for that reason we conclude that the agents\u2019 initial approach to her was not a seizure.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 555. The court also held that Mendenhall voluntarily consented to accompany the agents to the DEA office, <em>id. </em>at 558, and she freely and voluntarily consented to the search of her person, <em>id. </em>at 559-560.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Having set forth these rather simple. concepts of when a \u201cseizure\u201d within the. meaning of the Fourth Amendment occurs, a review of the facts in this case reveals that, as in <em>Mendenhall, </em>a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position would have believed he was free to leave at any time, prior to his actual arrest following the discovery of contraband. Officers Thomas and Edwards, with combined law enforcement experience of over fifteen years, observed appellant and his companion emerge from the Balducci residence and, for reasons discussed in Part II, <em>infra, </em>became suspicious of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>their behavior as they entered the YMCA parking lot. The plain-clothes officers, in their unmarked cruiser, pulled up behind the car appellant was approaching and Thomas asked appellant what was in his bag. Appellant did not answer. Thomas got out of the car and said, \u201chey, come here a minute\u201d to appellant, who looked over his shoulder and kept walking towards the car. Thomas then verbally identified himself as a police officer. The appellant turned towards Thomas, threw the brown paper bag onto the hood of the car and stepped back from the car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Only these two officers, in plain clothes, were present (Edwards had radioed their location and was approaching appellant\u2019s companion as Thomas approached appellant). Neither officer displayed his weapon, nor had Thomas physically touched appellant at that time. Thomas, who was the only person to speak, at no time used a threatening tone of voice, did not order appellant into the cruiser at any time, and never stated or indicated anything to the effect that if appellant did not come toward the officer he would be under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">Thus, none of the examples indicating a seizure enumerated in <em>Mendenhall, swpra, </em>at 554, was present in this case, nor are any other circumstances present such that \u201ca reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, appellant testified at the suppression hearing that he did not feel compelled to go towards Thomas when he identified himself as a police officer, and corroborated the facts that he had not been spoken to harshly or threatened with arrest, no weapon had been displayed to him, and he stated that the officers\u2019 cruiser was not blocking his exit from the YMCA parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-19\">. The facts presented in this case are indistinguishable from those presented in <em>Mendenhall, </em>and we decline to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>appellant\u2019s theory that any encounter between a citizen and the police, once the law enforcement officer has identified himself and asks a question of the citizen, constitutes a \u201cseizure\u201d within the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u201c* * * [Characterizing every street encounter between a citizen and the police as a \u2018seizure,\u2019 while not enhancing any interest secured by the Fourth Amendment, would impose wholly unrealistic restrictions upon a wide variety of legitimate law enforcement practices. The Court has on other occasions referred to the acknowledged need for police questioning as a tool in the effective enforcement of the criminal laws. \u2018Without such investigation, those who were innocent might be falsely accused, those who were guilty might wholly escape prosecution, and many crimes would go unsolved. In short, the security of all would be diminished. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 515.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte </em>(1973), 412 U.S. 218, at 225, quoted in <em>Mendenhall, supra, </em>at 554.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No seizure of appellant\u2019s person, within the' meaning of the Fourth Amendment, occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Of course, the Fourth Amendment protects the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, <em>and effects, </em>against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In general, a seizure of personal property, such as the bag carried by appellant here, is considered <em>per se </em>unreasonable within the Fourth Amendment unless it follows from a judicial warrant issued upon probable cause and particularly describing the item to be seized. See <em>Marron </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1927), 275 U.S. 192, 196. Absent a warrant, but where law enforcement officials have probable cause to believe that a container, such as appellant\u2019s bag, holds contraband or evidence of a crime, the item may be seized \u2014 pending issuance of a warrant to search \u2014 \u201cif the exigencies of the circumstances demand it or some other recognized exception to the warrant requirement is present.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 696, 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">In <em>Place, </em>however, the United States Supreme Court went a step further and recognized as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment the temporary, warrantless seizure of personal property (luggage, in that case) in an intermediate, Terry-type situation, <em>i.e., </em>a seizure on the basis of reasonable, articulable suspicion, premised on objective facts, that such property contains contraband or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>evidence of a crime. <em>Place, supra, </em>at 702. The court recognized that the \u201car-ticulable suspicion\u201d exception to the probable-cause requirement recognized in <em>Terry </em>and its progeny rests on the balance of \u201cthe nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703. Noting that \u201c \u2018[t]he public has a compelling interest in detecting those who would traffic in deadly drugs for personal profit,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Mendenhall, supra, </em>at 561 (Powell, J.), and that \u201cseizures of property can vary in intrusiveness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 706, the <em>Place </em>court opined that \u201csome brief detentions of personal effects may be so minimally intrusive of Fourth Amendment interests that [such] strong countervailing governmental interests will justify a seizure based only on specific articulable facts that the property contains contraband or evidence of a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">As the court explained in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 417-418:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u201cCourts have used a variety of terms to capture the elusive concept of what cause is sufficient to authorize police to stop a person. Terms like \u2018ar-ticulable reasons\u2019 and \u2018founded suspicion\u2019 are not self-defining; they fall short of providing clear guidance dis-positive of the myriad factual situations that arise. But the essence of all that has been written is that the totality of the <em>circumstances </em>\u2014 the <em>whole picture-mast </em>be taken into account. Based upon that whole picture the detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u201cThe idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion contains two elements, each of which must be present before a stop is permissible. First, <em>the assessment must be based upon all of the circumstances. </em>The analysis proceeds with various objective observations, information from police reports, if such are available, and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From these data, a trained officer draws inferences and makes <em>deductions </em>\u2014 infer<em>ences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\"><em>\u201cThe process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities. </em>Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain commonsense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same \u2014 and so are law enforcement officers. <em>Finally, the evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\u201cThe second element contained in the idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion is the concept that the process just described must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) See, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 109, 121-122.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Applying these rudiments of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence to the facts of this case, it is evident that Officer Thomas, far from having the inarticulate hunch perceived by appellant, possessed sufficient objective facts to support a particularized ar-ticulable suspicion that the bag carried by appellant contained contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">During the suppression hearing, both officers testified as to their prior law enforcement experience, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>drug arrests by Thomas and the circumstances they observed prior to seizing appellant\u2019s bag. While preparing to go on a gambling raid, they observed appellant and his companion emerge from the home of Wilma Balducci, who the officers knew to be a convicted felon (for forgery) out on probation. The officers also knew that approximately six months prior to that time the Ashland County Sheriff\u2019s Department had executed a warrant to search the Balducci residence and that drug paraphernalia had been found as a result of such search. In addition, Thomas testified that he had received recent tips from informants that Balducci had been dealing in drugs, and neighbors of Balducci had complained of heavy traffic in and out of her residence. Officer Edwards testified that he had spoken to a witness in an earlier investigation who stated Balducci had purchased property in exchange for cash and drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Coupled with these suspicions regarding the Balducci residence, the officers observed appellant carrying the closed grocery bag down at his side, keeping it level and, as testified by Edwards, appellant \u201cwas walking kind of gingerly with it.\u201d Thomas testified to several prior investigations and arrests in which the suspects carried drugs or narcotics in this fashion. Finally, as the officers approached to investigate, appellant abruptly disassociated himself from the bag as he, with a mumbled curse, threw the bag onto the hood of the car and backed away from it. Obviously, none of these observations, <em>standing alone, </em>would give rise to an articulable suspicion that the bag contained contraband. It was the culmination of all these observations which led Thomas to reasonably believe that appellant\u2019s bag contained narcotics,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and thus he was permitted, under the principles of <em>Terry </em>and its progeny, to detain the bag briefly to investigate further the circumstances that aroused his suspicion. See <em>Place, supra, </em>at 706. \u201cIndeed, <em>Terry </em>itself involved \u2018a series of acts, each of them perhaps innocent\u2019 if viewed separately, \u2018but which taken together warranted further investigation.\u2019 392 U.S., at 22 * * *.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow </em>(1989), 490 U.S. _, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 12, 109 S. Ct. 1581, 1587.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">In <em>Sokolow, </em>decided just five months ago by a compelling seven-to-two majority, the court held that DEA agents had a reasonable suspicion that Sokolow was transporting illegal drugs when they stopped him at Honolulu Airport, based on the agent\u2019s belief that Sokolow\u2019s behavior was consistent with one of the DEA\u2019s \u201cdrug courier profiles.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court noted, <em>id. </em>at_, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 11, 109 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>at 1586, that \u201c[a]ny one of these [profile] factors is not by itself proof of any illegal conduct and is quite consistent with innocent travel. But we think <em>taken together </em>they amount to reasonable suspicion.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The officers\u2019 suspicions here were clearly articulated at the suppression hearing, and were supported by objective facts. Thus, the seizure of appellant\u2019s bag was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Finally, we conclude that the search of appellant\u2019s bag contemporaneous with his arrest was justified by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence of the crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick </em>(1977), 433 U.S. 1, 14-15, the court detailed the justifications for searches \u201cincident to [an] arrest\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u201c* * * When a custodial arrest is made, there is always some danger that the person arrested may seek to use a weapon, or that evidence may be concealed or destroyed. To safeguard himself and others, <em>and to prevent the loss of evidence, </em>it has been held reasonable for the arresting officer to conduct a prompt, warrantless \u2018search of the arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u201cwithin his immediate control\u201d\u2014 construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u2019 <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California </em>[1969], 395 U.S. [752], 763 * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">\u201cSuch searches may be conducted without a warrant, and they may also be made whether or not there is probable cause to believe that the person arrested may have a weapon or is about to destroy evidence. The potential dangers lurking in all custodial arrests make warrantless searches of items within the \u2018immediate control\u2019 area reasonable without requiring the arresting officer to calculate the probability that weapons or destructible evidence may be involved. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218 (1973); <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra. </em>However, warrantless searches of luggage or other property seized at the time of an arrest cannot be justified as incident to that arrest either if the \u2018search is remote in time or place from the arrest,\u2019 <em>Preston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>376 U.S. [364], at 367, or no exigency exists. Once law enforcement officers have reduced luggage or other personal property not immediately associated with the person of the ar-restee to their <em>exclusive control, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>there is no longer any danger that the arrestee might gain access to the property to seize a weapon or destroy evidence, a search of that property is no longer an incident of the arrest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See, also, <em>Terry, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The court in <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>at 763, was straightforward:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201c* * * [I]t is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction. And the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items must, of course, be governed by a like rule. * * * There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of the arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u2018within his immediate control\u2019\u2014 construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The search here was neither remote in time nor place from appellant\u2019s arrest. Furthermore, the bag was still within appellant\u2019s easy reach. Although Thomas lawfully seized the bag, he had not \u2014 at the time appellant reached out in attempt to prevent such seizure \u2014 reduced the bag to his \u201cexclusive control.\u201d The danger of appellant obtaining the bag and destroying all or part of its contents was still present, and thus the search was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, upholding the denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Resnick, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b306-10\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b306-11\">Sweeney, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-4\"> Then Justice Rehnquist joined in this conclusion. The Chief Justice and Justices Powell and Blackmun concurred in the judgment, but felt it was not proper to reach the issue of whether the initial stop by the agents constituted a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, since neither of the lower courts had considered the question. The concurring Justices assumed, however, that the stop constituted a seizure, and concluded that it was a reasonable investigative stop not offensive to the Fourth Amendment. Justice Powell, writing for the concurring Justices, concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u201c* * * The public interest in preventing drug traffic is great, and the intrusion upon respondent\u2019s privacy was minimal. The specially trained agents acted pursuant to a well-planned, and effective, federal law enforcement program. They observed respondent engaging in conduct that they reasonably associated with criminal activity. Furthermore, the events occurred in an airport known to be frequented by drug couriers. [Footnote omitted.] In light of all of the circumstances, I would hold that the agents possessed reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity when they stopped the respondent in a public place and asked her for identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u201cThe jurisprudence of the Fourth Amendment demands consideration of the public\u2019s interest in effective law enforcement as well as each person\u2019s constitutionally secured right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>In applying a test of'reasonableness, \u2019 courts need not ignore the considerable expertise that law enforcement officials have gained from their special training and experience.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Mendenhall, supra, </em>at 565-566. See, also, Part II, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\"> Both officers testified at the suppression hearing that appellant <em>threw </em>the bag onto the hood of the car. Appellant\u2019s own testimony was contradictory. On direct examination, the appellant stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u201cQ. And then what happened next?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\u201cA.

It cannot properly be invoked to exclude the products of legitimate police investigative techniques on the ground that much conduct which is closely similar involves unwarranted intrusions upon constitutional protections. Moreover, in some contexts the rule is ineffective as a deterrent. Street encounters between citizens and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity. They range from wholly friendly exchanges of pleasantries or mutually useful information to hostile confrontations of armed men involving arrests, or injuries, or loss of life. * * * Doubtless some police \u2018field interrogation\u2019 conduct violates the Fourth Amendment.

By its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>opinion today, the majority has not only misconstrued the precedents it cites to supposedly support its untenable ruling, but it has ignored the clear language of the federal and state guarantees of freedom from unreasonable or unlawful warrantless searches and seizures as embodied in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \u201cFourth Amendment\u201d). Accordingly, I must strongly dissent from the decision rendered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The majority\u2019s tortuous path used to arrive at what appears to be a predetermined result is filled with misinterpretations of the state of the law as announced by the United States Supreme Court concerning the validity of any particular search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The majority\u2019s first point, <em>i.e., </em>that the appellant was not \u201cseized\u201d by Officer Thomas, seems to be based more on wishful thinking than on coherent constitutional analysis. The majority relies heavily on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 544, for the proposition that the instant appellant was not \u201cseized\u201d by the police. However a careful review of <em>Menden-hall </em>compels an opposite conclusion. In <em>Mendenhall, supra, </em>the Supreme Court developed what can be characterized as a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard to determine whether a seizure has taken place under a particular set of facts. The court therein held that a seizure of the person could only occur when, in view of all circumstances, a reasonable person would believe that he or she was not free to leave. <em>Id. </em>at 554. In <em>Mendenhall, </em>the facts indicate that defendant was stopped by federal agents on an airport concourse and was asked to show some identification. Eventually, defendant consented to a search which led to a discovery of narcotics on her person and she was arrested. The court in <em>Mendenhall </em>opined that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have felt free to leave under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In contrast, it is clear that under the circumstances, the appellant herein could only reasonably believe that he was not free to leave when requested to stop by the officer. After Officer Thomas requested appellant to stop, he quickly and forcibly seized the appellant\u2019s personal property (the paper grocery bag and its contents). Under such circumstances, there is no logical basis for holding that a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position was free to leave. The non-consensual seizure of appellant\u2019s property is the aspect which clearly distinguishes the instant cause from <em>Mendenhall, supra. In Mendenhall, </em>the defendant\u2019s property was not seized until after she had consented to a search; whereas, here, the appellant never had time to consent to a search or to answer any pertinent questions. While Officer Thomas did identify himself as a police officer, his hasty seizure of appellant\u2019s grocery bag was done in total disregard of appellant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment, because such a seizure of personal property by the officer effectively removed from appellant his freedom to leave, inasmuch as appellant had exerted a privacy and possessory interest in the contents of the grocery bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The majority, in a fallacious attempt to justify the officer\u2019s action, has completely misapplied the rule of law in <em>Mendenhall. </em>Of crucial relevance to the instant cause is the fact that the appellant\u2019s property was seized and searched <em>prior to his arrest. </em>In <em>Mendenhall, </em>however, there was a consent to a search which led to an arrest. To say that the appellant here was free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to leave even after the officer had seized his personal property is absurd, and <em>Mendenhall, swpra, </em>does not support such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Even if it were to be assumed that appellant was not \u201cseized\u201d for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, it is clear that he was at least unlawfully detained. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 47, the high court recognized that a police officer may briefly detain a suspect even though the officer does not have probable cause to believe that the suspect is involved in criminal activity. However, the court in <em>Brown </em>stated that the officer must at least have a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the person being detained is involved in criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 51. While the rule of law in <em>Brown </em>may be characterized as lenient, its application to the instant factual situation compels a finding that the detention of appellant was in clear violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">First of all, the officers here apparently relied on unsubstantiated reports that the house from which appellant had left was a \u201cdrug house.\u201d Second, Officer Edwards implied that since appellant was carrying the paper bag \u201cgingerly,\u201d he suspected that appellant was carrying drugs. In my view, such reasoning is not by any means an objective view of the facts. There are countless items that one may put in a grocery bag that must be carried \u201cgingerly.\u201d Hence, it seems clear that the officers had no reasonable suspicion that appellant was involved in criminal activity of a type that would justify the detention of appellant that occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the officers were justified in detaining appellant, the seizure and search of appellant\u2019s bag was clearly and unmistakably undertaken in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The majority\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d of the search and seizure has the ultimate effect of disposing of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment freedoms in their entirety. While the majority cites many cases that purportedly justify a seizure of personal property, closer scrutiny reveals that none of the cited cases even remotely justifies what was done in the case at bar. In fact, I challenge the majority to name one United States Supreme Court case that permits an officer to conduct a search of personal property without a warrant, and then arrest the person based on the fruits of the warrantless/illegal search. Of course, no holding based on facts similar to the instant cause has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court because such a holding would totally fly in the face of the precise language of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure of personal property is almost always unconstitutional unless the officer has obtained a judicial warrant to search and seize such personal property. See <em>Marron </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1927), 275 U.S. 192. In the instant cause, there is no question that the officer did not obtain such a warrant. Likewise, there is no question that appellant exerted a privacy and possessory interest in the grocery bag when the officer reached for it. Nevertheless, there are two narrowly circumscribed exceptions to the warrant requirement. One is where it is reasonable for an officer to believe that the arrestee will attempt to seize or destroy relevant evidence over which the <em>arrestee </em>may have control. <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 752. The court in <em>Chimel </em>also observed that the second exception to the warrant requirement is where the officer searches the <em>arrestee </em>in order to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tect his own life. <em>Id. </em>at 762-763. See, also, <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1. In <em>Terry, supra, </em>the court held that an officer could search an individual for weapons under certain circumstances. Obviously, <em>Terry </em>is in no way dis-positive of the instant case. Here, the officer did not make an arrest prior to the search, and there is no indication that appellant was carrying a weapon or that the officer had any suspicion whatsoever that the appellant was carrying a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Upon a review of the facts <em>sub judice, </em>it is obvious that the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Chimel </em>in order to justify the instant search is grossly misplaced and somewhat disingenuous. Unlike the instant cause, the defendant in <em>Chimel </em>was arrested <em>prior to </em>the search\u2019s taking place. In turning the <em>Chimel </em>holding on its head, the majority, in essence, places all Ohio citizens under \u201cmartial law\u201d because under the majority\u2019s decision, a police officer may search one\u2019s person or personal property with impunity prior to placing the person under arrest. Such a rule of law is repugnant to a truly free and open society, and should never be countenanced by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In any event, since the warrantless search conducted in this cause does not even come close to falling under any of the recognized exceptions to the Fourth Amendment requirements, the decision below must be reversed. The holding reached by the majority also clashes head-on with a number of other opinions by the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Recznik </em>v. <em>Lorain </em>(1968), 393 U.S. 166, the police had information that a particular apartment building was a gambling house, and the senior officer stated that he knew when he entered the apartment that he did not have enough evidence to make an arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 169. Of course, the high court held that the police did not have probable cause to conduct a search of the apartment building. Similarly, in the instant cause, Officer Thomas admitted to his partner that he did not have enough evidence to detain appellant, let alone arrest him. Thomas only became suspicious of appellant because he saw him leaving what was believed to be a \u201cdrug house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In applying <em>Recznik </em>to other aspects of the instant facts, it is apparent that the search of appellant\u2019s bag was not based upon \u201cprobable cause\u201d that a crime was being committed. Thomas knew he did not have enough evidence to arrest appellant prior to searching the bag, but used the fruits of the illegal search as a justification for the subsequent arrest. Therefore, I am perplexed as to how the majority could misread the law in order to justify what was clearly an illegal search. Undoubtedly, the majority\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>justification of the instant search is based wholly on the fact that illegal drugs were found in appellant\u2019s bag. However, it takes no citation of authority to understand that an illegal search is an illegal search regardless of whether the fruits recovered as a result are illegal drugs or everyday grocery products.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">In another respect, the majority attempts to justify the unwarranted intrusion by the officers here by manufacturing a third exception to the warrant requirement. The majority cites <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 696, <em>for </em>the proposition that the high court has created another exception to the warrant requirement. However, a careful reading of the <em>Place </em>opinion does not reveal such an expansive interpretation as proposed by the majority. In <em>Place, supra, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that personal property which is reasonably believed to hold contraband or evidence of a crime may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>be temporarily detained. <em>Id. </em>at 706. Nevertheless, the <em>Place </em>court held that <em>before the personal property can be searched or permanently seized, a warrant must be issued. Id. </em>at 701. Once again, the majority contorts a precedent in a manner that is either careless, disingenuous or flat-out incorrect. To characterize the conduct of the officer in the instant cause as one sanctioned by <em>Place, supra, </em>is at best a severe misinterpretation of that holding, because such a misinterpretation reduces the Fourth Amendment to a mere \u201cform of words.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Halczyszak </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 301, 328, 25 OBR 360, 384, 496 N.E. 2d 925, 949 (Sweeney, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Last, it must be reemphasized that an illegal search cannot be transformed into a constitutionally permitted one simply because illegal drugs are obtained as the fruits of the search. As aptly noted by Chief Justice (then Judge) Moyer in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hassey </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App. 3d 231, at 236, 9 OBR 403, at 409, 459 N.E. 2d 573, at 580:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u201cFacts acquired after a stop cannot provide justification for the stop.\u201d The \u201cend justifies the means\u201d analysis employed by the majority should not be endorsed by this court at the expense of fundamental liberties that are to be enjoyed by all the citizenry. The rights embodied in the Fourth Amendment are much too precious to be tossed aside merely to sustain the conviction rendered below. While we as a society must endeavor to deal with the scourge of illegal drugs in a quick and effective manner, we must never sanction a solution that dispenses with the constitutional guarantees and personal liberties that have made ours the most enduring government on the face of the Earth.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the court of appeals below, and thereby reaffirm the Fourth Amendment and the freedoms it is intended to protect.</p>\n<judges id=\"b310-9\">H. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b310-10\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AA3\">dissenting. We are facing a plague in our land as a result of drug abuse. The reaction of our leaders to this plague has been dramatic and in the main appropriate. However, the stability of American society rests on the fact that we are a nation of laws. The courts are sworn to defend our most fundamental laws\u2014 the state and federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The majority well nigh concedes that appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated, but shrugs this intrusion off because of the greater value of stern law enforcement with respect to the war against trafficking in dangerous drugs. Such an approach is foreign to sound constitutional jurisprudence. I would point to the true rule regarding the adherence to constitutional principles as expressed in <em>Ex parte Milligan </em>(1886), 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which was decided in the context of national peril and public unrest far greater than exists today. In refusing to ignore the force and effect of the plain English words used by our ancestors in framing the Constitution and the provisions of the Bill of Rights in particular, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">\u201c* * * Those great and good men foresaw that troublous times would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>arise, when rulers and people would become restive under restraint, and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper; and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable law. The history of the world had taught them that what was done in the past might be attempted in the future. <em>The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. </em>No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism, but the theory of necessity on which it is based is false; for the government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve its existence; as has been happily proved by the result of the great effort to throw off its just authority.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 120-121.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Likewise, the words of Judge Campbell, writing for the Supreme Court of Michigan in <em>People, ex rel. Twitchell, </em>v. <em>Blodgett </em>(1865), 13 Mich. 127, are applicable in this situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201c* * * [S]pecific provisions may, in unforeseen emergencies, turn out to have been inexpedient. This does not make these provisions any less binding. Constitutions can not be changed by events alone. They remain binding as the acts of the people in their sovereign capacity, as the framers of the Government, until they are amended or abrogated by the action prescribed by the authority which created them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The Fourth Amendment is but one of the ten amendments constituting the Bill of Rights. The securities for personal liberty embodied in the Bill of Rights \u201cwere such as wisdom and experience had demonstrated to be necessary for those accused of crime. And so strong was the sense of the country of their importance, and so jealous were - the people that these rights, highly prized, might be denied them by implication, that when the original Constitution was proposed for adoption it encountered severe opposition; and, but for the belief that it would be so amended as to embrace them, it would never have been ratified.\u201d <em>Ex parte Milligan, supra, </em>at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The Fourth Amendment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The people of Ohio, to doubly ensure their rights in this regard, adopted an almost identically worded provision in Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution. See, also, R.C. 2933.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">Into these provisions were poured the living and sometimes bitter experiences of our forefathers struggling for independence from an unyielding and unfeeling despot. They realized the inherent temptation and persistent dangers of power. The simple words of the Fourth Amendment have an everyday importance and application that is as valid today as it always has been.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">\u201c \u2018We are not dealing with formalities. The presence of a search warrant serves a high function. Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>trate between the citizen and the police. This was done not to shield criminals or to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities. It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in order to enforce the law. The right of privacy was deemed too precious to entrust to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals. . . . And so the Constitution requires a magistrate to pass on the desires of the police before they violate the privacy of the home. We cannot be true to that constitutional requirement and excuse the absence of a search warrant without a showing by those who seek exemption from the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 752, 761 (quoting <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>United States </em>[1948], 335 U.S. 451, 455-456).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u201c \u2018The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mincey </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 385, 395 (quoting <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>[1948], 333 U.S. 10, 13-14).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Finally, the Fourth Amendment applies to \u201cpeople, not places,\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 351, and absent some special exception all containers and packages in one\u2019s possession will receive full protection of the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 798, 822. So when defendant Smith walked out of a private residence, during daylight on a summer evening, carrying a paper grocery bag, he was shielded by the protections of the Fourth Amendment, and the burden is on the state to show the need to search defendant\u2019s bag without a warrant to do so. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jeffers </em>(1951), 342 U.S. 48, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The fact that defendant was merely carrying a grocery bag at his side with the top rolled down does not invalidate his privacy interest in that container. The central purpose of the Fourth Amendment forecloses distinctions between types of containers. \u201cFor just as the most frail cottage in the kingdom is absolutely entitled to the same guarantees of privacy as the most majestic mansion, so also may a traveler [or anyone else] who carries a toothbrush and a few articles of clothing in a paper bag or knotted scarf claim an equal right to conceal his possessions from official inspection as the sophisticated executive with the locked attach\u00e9 case.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, supra, </em>at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The facts in this case are that the police officers, without sufficient objective facts concerning <em>this particular defendant </em>to raise <em>any reasonable suspicion whatsoever, </em>stopped the defendant to question him. Then, with no probable cause to justify an arrest, and without the defendant\u2019s consent, the officers searched a closed container belonging to the defendant. Based upon what was found in the illegal search of the container, the officers arrested the defendant. Only at that time, according to the majority, was the defendant \u201cseized\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. This posture is, in my view, specious at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The majority at first finds no seizure under the Fourth Amendment and then finds probable cause sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>justify an arrest of the defendant without a warrant. These findings purportedly are based upon the fact that defendant \u201cthrew\u201d his closed grocery bag onto the hood of his car, and then tried to block an Ashland police officer\u2019s arm when the officer reached for the bag. In the words of Sergeant Thomas, this was what occurred after he asked Smith what was in the bag:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cQ.

The top of the four-beam scales.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-21\">The majority would characterize this encounter as a permissible police encounter in a public place rather than a justifiable Terry-type detention. One authority has suggested that a permissible encounter between the police and a member of the public becomes a seizure \u201cif the officer engages in conduct which a reasonable man would view as threatening or offensive even if performed by another private citizen.\u201d 3 LaFave, Search and Seizure (1987) 413, Section 9.2(h). I submit that a reasonable man would construe the grabbing of his possession as an offensive gesture. Therefore, the cases construing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, are applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-23\">The encounter occurred after the officers stopped to question the defendant on no more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or 'hunch\u2019 \u201d that the defendant was involved in criminal activity. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>at 27. Such hunches cannot be the basis of a stop authorized by <em>Terry. Id. </em>at 30. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow </em>(1989), 490 U.S._, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 109 S. Ct. 1581. The officers did not know the defendant or his companion who were merely exiting a private residence on a June evening when it was still light. The only \u201csuspicious\u201d behavior was the defendant\u2019s carrying of a grocery bag while exiting from a residence where the authorities suspected drugs had been sold on an undefined former date.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-26\">The mere exiting from a house where suspected drug dealing might have occurred, without more, simply cannot be sufficient justification to stop and search someone and his possessions. To hold otherwise destroys almost everyone\u2019s right to privacy in his or her person. Even if a stop and a frisk for weapons under <em>Terry, supra, </em>is justified, a search of a closed container may not be justified. One court in granting a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-27\">\u201c[A <em>Terry] </em>frisk is only justified by an <em>officer\u2019s regard for his personal safety, </em>not by his interest in discovering contraband.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1973), 362 F. Supp. 415, 423. The court went on to hold that even if a frisk had been justified with respect to an accused who had been observed in the company of a \u201cnotorious narcotics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>dealer\u201d in an area of \u201cintense narcotics activity\u201d the notoriety of the trafficker could not be imputed to the accused and the ensuing search of a brown paper bag carried by the accused exceeded the scope of a justified frisk. <em>Id. </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Most of the cases cited by the majority involving a \u201cstop for questioning\u201d concerned stops conducted by trained officers in an airport. Justice Powell in <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 491, stated in his concurring opinion that \u201c[i]n view of the extent to which air transportation is used in the drug traffic,\u201d such a stop \u201cwarrants special consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The suggestion is that law enforcement concerns are especially strong in airports, and I agree. However, <em>this </em>case involves the citizens of Ohio as they walk around their own neighborhoods. Moreover, the facts in this case do not even satisfy the rationale and requirements found in the airport search cases. In <em>Royer, supra; United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 544; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 696; and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow, supra, </em>the officials did not initiate the stop for questioning of any of the defendants on as flimsy a factual record as here. There were many more articulable facts to support each of the initial stops.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Most significant is the fact that <em>none </em>of these cases held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the circumstances providing justification for the original stop were sufficient to establish the probable cause necessary to arrest the suspects or to search luggage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The legality of the searches in <em>Royer </em>and <em>Mendenhall, supra, </em>depended upon the validity of the accused\u2019s consent since there were insufficient facts to otherwise provide probable cause to search his luggage. In <em>Royer, </em>the court held that the consent purportedly obtained was involuntary, that the search of Royer\u2019s luggage was therefore illegal, and that drugs found therein could not be used to provide the probable cause for his arrest. Conversely, in <em>Mendenhall, </em>the court held that the search was legal because the defendant had consented and that the contraband found could constitute probable cause to arrest. The facts in this case do not support any possible argument that the defendant consented to the seizure and search of his bag.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>In <em>Place </em>and <em>Sokolow, supra, </em>the probable cause to search the defendants\u2019 luggage and arrest the defendants was provided by a narcotics dog alerting to the luggage. The court in <em>Place </em>held at 707 that a dog\u2019s sniffing of luggage is <em>sui generis </em>and is not a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The court in <em>Place </em>stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u201cThe purpose for which respondent\u2019s luggage was seized, of course, was to arrange its exposure to a narcotics detection dog. Obviously, if this investigative procedure is itself a search requiring probable cause, <em>the initial seizure of respondent\u2019s luggage for the purpose of subjecting it to the sniff test </em>\u2014 no <em>matter how brief </em>\u2014 could <em>not be justified on less than probable cause. </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis added and citations omitted.) <em>Place, supra, </em>at 706. See, also, <em>Sokolow, supra, </em>at_, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 9, 109 S. Ct. at 1584.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Once the dogs alerted, the drug agents in <em>Place </em>and <em>Sokolow </em>did what they should have done \u2014 they went to a neutral, detached magistrate and obtained a warrant to search the luggage. <em>Sokolow, id.; Place, supra, </em>at 699. The court in <em>Place </em>held that \u201cthe limitations applicable to investigative detentions of the person should define the permissible scope of all investigative detention of the person\u2019s luggage on less than probable cause.\u201d <em>Place, supra, </em>at 709. Because the officials held the luggage for too long before obtaining a warrant to search, the search was illegal and Place\u2019s conviction was reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Finally, the reliance upon <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>(1968), 395 U.S. 752, is misplaced, as the circumstances presented therein are notably different from those in this case. <em>Chimel </em>addressed the scope of a warrantless search <em>incident to a lawful arrest. </em>Because the arrest in <em>Chimel </em>was pursuant to an <em>arrest warrant </em>presumedly issued by a neutral, detached magistrate and based upon probable cause, the court stated, \u201cwe proceed on the hypothesis that the California courts were correct in holding that the arrest of the petitioner was valid under the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755. Nevertheless, the search in <em>Chimel </em>was too broad and was held to violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">As the Supreme Court previously stated, \u201ca search without a warrant is, within limits, permissible if incident to a lawful arrest, if an arrest without a warrant is to support an incidental search, it must be made with probable cause.\u201d <em>Henry </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1959), 361 U.S. 98, 102. \u201cProbable cause exists if the facts and circumstances known to the officer warrant a prudent man in believing that the offense has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo repeat, an arrest is not justified by what the subsequent search discloses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 98, 111; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 10; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trenge </em>(1982), 305 Pa. Super. 386,403, 451 A. 2d 701, 710, fn. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">As stated, there were insufficient facts to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop in this case. The refusal of the defendant in this case to answer the officer\u2019s question or to surrender his bag did not provide grounds for a <em>Terry </em>detention of the defendant or a taking of his bag, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and certainly did not provide probable cause for an arrest. All the circumstances must be considered and each case is fact-specific. However, no case is cited by the majority where similarly diffuse facts with respect to the accused were held to provide probable cause for a warrantless arrest or issuance of a warrant by a neutral, detached magistrate. The case law is, I submit, contrary to the majority\u2019s position. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Graddy </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 132, 9 O.O. 3d 109, 378 N.E. 2d 723; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haynes </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 264, 54 O.O. 2d 379, 267 N.E. 2d 787; <em>State </em>v. <em>Joseph </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 95, 54 O.O. 2d 228, 267 N.E. 2d 125; <em>Henry, supra; Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1963), 371 U.S. 471; compare with <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1959), 358 U.S. 307; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gomez </em>(C.A. 5, 1985), 776 F. 2d 542; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiecking </em>(C.A. 9, 1983), 757 F. 2d 969; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Errera </em>(D.C. Md. 1985), 616 F. Supp. 1145. See, generally, Annotation (1971), 6 A.L.R. Fed. 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In <em>Royer, </em>the state argued that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant even without a valid consent to the search. The court gave short shrift to that argument and stated, \u201c[w]e cannot agree with the State, if this is its position, that every nervous young man paying cash for a ticket to New York City under an assumed name and carrying two heavy American Tourister bags may be arrested and held to answer for a serious felony charge.\u201d <em>Royer, supra, </em>at 507. Likewise, in this case, a man exiting a private residence, carrying a closed grocery bag \u201cgingerly\u201d and then placing or even throwing the bag on the hood of his car as he turns to face a police officer, has done nothing that creates probable cause to arrest him. Absent the probable cause to arrest him or a warrant based upon probable cause, the officer had no authority to open the bag, which was \u201cseized\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes as soon as the officer pushed the defendant\u2019s arm away and grabbed the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Nor is the state entitled to assert any of the other exceptions to the warrant requirement before searching defendant\u2019s bag, such as the automobile exception (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross </em>[1982], 456 U.S. 798, 809-813); the plain view exception (see <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>[1971], 403 U.S. 443); or any other exigent circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The actions of the safety forces in this case may have been well intentioned, but what this case is about is whether their actions violated appellant\u2019s constitutional rights. In the words of Justice Sutherland, dissenting in <em>Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Blaisdell </em>(1934), 290 U.S. 398, \u201c[t]he only legitimate inquiry we can make is whether it is constitutional. * * * If the provisions of the Constitution be not upheld when they pinch as well as when they comfort, they may as well be abandoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483. I am prepared to endure the \u201cpinch\u201d in this case, and thus I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-9\">H. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> In <em>Ex parte Milligan </em>(1886), 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2, the court granted a writ of habeas corpus holding that, absent martial law, a citizen of a nonrebel state was entitled to all the protections afforded by the Constitution. The petitioner had been sentenced to death for treason by a military tribunal in Indiana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> All these cases involved the use of a \u201cdrug courier profile\u201d to identify travellers who can be subjected to questioning or a <em>Terry </em>stop by drug enforcement agents. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 544, 547, the facts that supported the reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant were: \u201c(1) the respondent was arriving on a flight from Los Angeles, a city believed by the agents to be the place of origin for much of the heroin brought to Detroit; (2) the respondent was the last person to leave the plane, \u2018appeared to be very nervous,\u2019 and \u2018completely scanned the whole area where [the agents] were standing\u2019; (3) after leaving the plane the respondent proceeded past the baggage area without claiming any luggage; and (4) the respondent changed airlines for her flight out of Detroit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Royer </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 491, 493, fn. 2, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u201c* * * In Royer\u2019s case, the detectives]\u2019] attention was attracted by the following facts which were considered to be within the profile: (a) Royer was carrying American Tourister luggage, which appeared to be heavy, (b) he was young, apparently between 25-35, (c) he was casually dressed, (d) he appeared pale and nervous, looking around at other people, (e) he paid for his ticket in cash with a large number of bills, and (f) rather than completing the airline identification tag to be attached to checked baggage, which had space for a name, address, and telephone number, he wrote only a name and the destination. * * * &gt;&gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 696, these facts were thought relevant by officials, as set forth in the district court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">\u201c1. Defendant Place was departing from a \u2018source city.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">\u201c2. Defendant systematically scanned the immediate area in the lobby in which he was standing and looked very closely at each person that was seated or standing in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">\u201c3. Defendant noticed and paid close attention to Mr. McGavock when he left the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">\u201c4. Defendant stared directly at the detectives two or three times as the detectives moved around the lobby.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-18\">\u201c5. When buying his ticket and checking his baggage, the defendant turned and looked over his shoulder to scan the lobby once again.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-19\">\u201c6. Defendant paid for his ticket in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-20\">\u201c7. After leaving the ticket counter and heading toward the gate from which he was to depart, defendant stopped for no apparent reason, turned around to look at anyone who might be behind him, and headed back to the lobby from where he had just come.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-21\">\u201c8. Upon reaching the lobby, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>dant Place walked a full circle around the lobby while looking back over his shoulder continuously to see if he was being followed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1980), 498 F. Supp. 1217, 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Finally, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow </em>(1989), 490 U.S.._, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 7-8, 109 S. Ct. 1581,1583, these facts were considered relevant: \u201c(1) he paid $2,100 for two airplane tickets from a roll of $20 bills; (2) he traveled under a name that did not match the name under which his telephone number was listed; (3) his original destination was Miami, a source city for illicit drugs; (4) he stayed in Miami for only 48 hours, even though a round-trip flight from Honolulu to Miami takes 20 hours; (5) he appeared nervous during his trip; and (6) he checked none of his luggage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b315-15\"> As the plurality opinion in <em>Royer </em>stated in discussing the parameters of a permissible search of luggage:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-16\">\u201c* * * First, it is unquestioned that <em>without a warrant </em>to search Royer\u2019s luggage and <em>in the absence of probable cause and exigent circumstances, the </em>validity of the search depended on Royer\u2019s purported consent. Neither is it disputed that where the validity of a search rests on consent, the State has the burden of proving that the necessary consent was obtained and that it was freely and voluntarily given, a burden that is not satisfied by showing a mere submission to a claim of lawful authority. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">\u201cSecond, law enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment by merely approaching an individual on the street or in another public place, by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions, by putting questions to him if the person is willing to listen, or by offering in evidence in a criminal prosecution his voluntary answers to such questions. * * * Nor would the fact that the officer identifies himself as a police officer, without more, convert the encounter into a seizure requiring some level of objective justification. * * * The person approached, however, need not answer any question put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way. * * * He may not be detained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds for doing so; <em>and his refusal to listen or answer does not, without more, furnish those grounds. </em>* * * If there is no detention \u2014 no seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment \u2014 then no constitutional rights have been infringed.\u201d (Emphasis added and citations omitted.) <em>Royer, supra, </em>at 497-498.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-20\">The opinion went on to discuss the <em>Terry </em>exception, which allows the detention of a person or his possessions upon less than probable cause \u201cif there is articulable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime. * * * [A] temporary detention for <em>questioning </em>[is justified] on less than probable cause where the public interest involved is the suppression of illegal transactions in drugs or of any other serious crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 498-499.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b315-21\"> I agree with the majority\u2019s rejection of the court of appeals\u2019 view that the defendant \u201cabandoned\u201d his bag.
