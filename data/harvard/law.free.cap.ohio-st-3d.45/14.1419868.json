Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. We are asked to determine whether the commission order at bar is supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">The parties concentrate on the sufficiency of the Walker and Walsh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>reports under <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55, 11 O.O. 3d 216, 386 N.E. 2d 1109. That decision held that a non-examining physician\u2019s report that did not indicate express acceptance of the findings of examining doctors was not \u201csome evidence\u201d on which the commission could rely. Appellant challenges the continued vitality of <em>Wallace, </em>contending that the requirement of express acceptance was relaxed by the subsequent plurality decision in <em>State, ex rel. Hughes, </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 71,26 OBR 61, 498 N.E. 2d 459. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The <em>Hughes </em>plurality sustained as \u201csome evidence\u201d the reports of several non-examining physicians including one which merely indicated that all medical reports had been reviewed (without naming the doctors) and which cited numerous findings from those reports (without attributing them to any specific examiner). The <em>Hughes </em>decision stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u201c* * * [0]ur opinions should not provide the basis for usurping the role of the commission in determining disability by creating arbitrary exclusionary rules that eliminate evidence the commission might find credible because such evidence fails to include \u2018magic words\u2019 to conform with hyper-technical evidentiary rules, <em>e.g., </em>T expressly adopt the findings but not the opinion of Dr. \u201cX.\u201d \u2019 * * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 26 OBR at 64, 498 N.E. 2d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">However, even under an implicit acceptance analysis, we hold that the Walker and Walsh reports are deficient. Dr. Walker\u2019s report states in full that \u201cI see no reason related to his allowed injury why cl[aiman]t can\u2019t return to his usual &amp; customary duties.\u201d There is no indication, express or implied, that Dr. Walker even considered, let alone accepted, the findings of the examining physicians. It is thus not \u201csome evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Dr. Walsh\u2019s report also fails under <em>Hughes. </em>There is nothing in that report to indicate that all medical reports were reviewed and considered. The report actually implies the contrary. Although reports from six physicians were on file, Walsh\u2019s report only refers to \u201cthe information on file from three physicians.\u201d Apart from the <em>Hughes </em>problem, the report also fails in another respect, <em>i.e., </em>it does not address the key issue of appellee\u2019s ability to return to his former position of employment. It merely notes in a general way that appellee\u2019s medications are not incompatible \u201cwith employment,\u201d conceding that \u201c[information as to his job responsibilities is not on file for a definitive answer.\u201d Thus, on an alternative basis, Dr. Walsh\u2019s report fails to constitute \u201csome evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The removal of the Walker and Walsh reports from evidentiary consideration leaves the commission order unsupported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d as these were the sole reports upon which the commission expressly relied. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the appellate court judgment directing the commission to vacate its June 27,1986 order denying compensation. However, we reverse that portion of the judgment which orders the commission to award appellee temporary total disability compensation from September 1, 1981 through February 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Any award of temporary total disability compensation must be supported by some evidence establishing that a temporary condition precludes the return to the former position of employment. See <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630, 23 O.O. 3d 518, 433 N.E. 2d 586. Therefore, a lack of evidence supporting a denial of tern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>porary total disability benefits cannot automatically translate into some evidence supporting an award of such benefits. Recognizing that the determination of disability is a commission function, we thus remand the cause to the commission to determine whether appellee qualifies for temporary total disability compensation and to identify the evidence supporting its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b59-5\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright, H.
