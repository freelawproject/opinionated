L., p. </em>1000; <em>N. J. S. A., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 43:21-12.1, <em>et seq.), </em>chapter 162 and chapter 171 of the laws of 1943 <em>(Pamph. L., pp. </em>472, 491; <em>N. J. 8. A., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 43:21-12.3, <em>et seq.), </em>and chapter 65 of the laws of 1944 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>125; <em>N. J. 8. A., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11:5-1, 11:7-10), he is \u201centitled to be treated as an employee\u201d of the state, \u201calbeit <em>in absentia, </em>during the years 1942 to 1946,\u201d when the personnel of the State Employment Service was \u201con temporary loan\u201d to the federal government under chapter 386 of the laws of 1941, cited <em>supra, </em>and \u201ctherefore entitled to the benefits of the reclassification program\u201d adopted pursuant to chap-' ter 162 of the laws of 1943 and chapter 65 of the laws of' 1944, cited <em>supra, </em>rather than subject to the general requirement of promotion by competitive examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The cited determination of prosecutor\u2019s status was comprised in the defendant Civil Service Commission\u2019s- \u201csurvey and classification of United States Employment Service personnel transferred to the State Service,\u201d and his annual salary was therein fixed at $3,720, as of November 16th, 1946; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>and it was further therein provided that the \u201ctemporary title will be discontinued upon completion of .the current reorganization of the Employment Service Division of the U. C. C., and no examination will be held for this title,\u201d but prosecutor \u201cwill have opportunity to compete in the examinations, to be announced shortly, in the same manner and on the same basis as all other transferred U. S. E. S. personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In 1938, following a competitive examination, prosecutor was appointed to the position of \u201cSenior Employment Interviewer\u201d in the State Employment Service; and on December 29th, 1941, after qualifying in a competitive examination, he was advanced to the position of \u201cEmployment Counselor.\u201d Three days later, while he-was merely a probationer \u201cin training\u201d for his new position, the records, facilities and personnel of the State Employment Service Division were transferred to the federal government pursuant to chapter 386 of the laws of 1941, cited <em>supra. </em>On November 16th, 1946, the federal service was terminated, and the records, facilities, and personnel of the State Employment Service Division thus on temporary leave, prosecutor among them, were returned to Uie state service. <em>Vide </em>60 <em>U. S. Sbat. </em>684; 29 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 49c. Prosecutor\u2019s then title in the federal administrative bureau was \u201cSenior Occupational Analyst,\u201d and his salary was $3,840. He entered the government service as an \u201cEmployment Counselor\u201d at the same annual salary as that of a probationer of that class in the state\u2019s service at the time, $2,160. Pour or five months later, the federal bureau to which he was assigned changed his title to \u201cJunior Occupational Analyst,\u201d and his salary was increased to $2,400, and thereafter there were further increases, all without the participation or acquiescence of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">On September loth. 1947, the Civil Service Commission scheduled competitive examinations for positions in the reestablished Employment Service Division; and this action and the cited determination of his civil service status are challenged as in contravention of the statutory policy. In a word, the insistence is that prosecutor\u2019s permanent title of \u201cEmployment Counselor, Grade III\u201d is inferior in rank and grade to the position of \u201cEmployment Counselor\u201d which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>held in 1941, primarily because of a difference in <em>the </em>salary minima, although some diversity of duty is asserted, and so he has suffered a demotion, and that his enforced participation in- competitive examinations with clerical employees of the Unemployment Compensation Commission of inferior and subordinate rank, in order to retain his current status, is in disregard of the rights which he acquired under the Reclassification Act and kindred statutes cited <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The essence of the point made is that prosecutor \u201ccontinued to be a civil service employee\u201d of the state \u201cwhile on loan to the federal government;\u201d and that the civil servants of the State\u2019s Employment Service Division \u201care entitled to the benefits of the reclassification program,\u201d and he should not be obliged \u201cto compete for a title equivalent to that which he had acquired in 1941.\u201d He insists that a \u201cduties questionnaire\u201d submitted by him to the State Civil Service Commission in 1947 indicates the performance of the functions of a \u201cSenior Occupational Analyst,\u201d the position held under the federal government at the time of his return to state service, and that proper classification requires that he be given a permanent appointment as \u201cEmployment Counselor, Grade II,\u201d which he deems to be the equivalent in rank of \u201cOccupational Analyst.\u201d In fine, he asserts the right \u201cto be reclassified, without examination, under a title appropriate to duties actually performed upon his return\u201d from federal service, \u201ca benefit accorded all other employees\u201d of the state, \u201cexcept the personnel of the Employment Service Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">It is said that in this regard a distinction is to be made between the personnel of the Unemployment Compensation Commission and the staff of the Employment Service Division, and that the defendant Civil Service Commission, erroneously proceeding on the contrary hypothesis, although there was no finding that a departmental separation was not practicable, ruled that the personnel of the Unemployment Compensation Commission is \u201centitled to compete for superior titles and positions within the Employment Service Division,\u201d thus ignoring chapter 203 and chapter 308 of the laws of 1945 <em>(Pamph. L., pp. </em>698, 891; <em>N. J. S. A., </em>\u00a7 43:21-10c), providing that the State Employment Service shall be \u201ca sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>rate administrative unit with respect to personnel, budget, and duties, except in so far as the commission may find such separation to be impracticable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The judicial function is to confine the administrative agency within the limits of its statutory domain; the judicial authority may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency where there has been no deviation from its allotted sphere of action. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>238.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The Reclassification Act was not disregarded in the action thus taken by the Civil Service Commission. The reclassification authorized and approved by the legislature was not inclusive of the personnel of the Employment Service Division for the time being under the \u201cabsolute jurisdiction and control\u201d of the federal government. Chapter 386 of the laws of 1941, <em>supra, </em>provides for the transfer of absolute jurisdiction. These civil servants were not comprised within either the classification incorporated in the report to the legislature made by the legislative commission constituted by chapter 162 of Ihe laws of 1943, <em>supra, </em>or the adoptive action taken by the Civil Service Commission pursuant to the mandate of chapter 65 of the laws of 1944, <em>supra. </em>The legislative design was a \u201cstudy of the personnel employed by the various state departments, boards, commissions and agencies and their duties and compensation,\u201d with a view to the \u201cequalization of compensation for the performance of similar duties and the payment of salaries commensurate with the work performed\u201d (chapter 162 of the laws of 1943, <em>supra) </em>; and those assigned to federal service pursuant to the Act of 1941 were not deemed employees of the state or a department thereof within the sense and significance of the reclassification acts. The legislature itself directed the Civil Service Commission to \u201cadopt * * * the classification and compensation plan incorporated\u201d in the report made by the legislative commission. within ten days after its submission to the legislature; and the Commission was empowered, \u201cafter the installation of such plan\u201d by its chief examiner and secretary, \u201cto approve, modify or reject, after public hearing, such classification and compensation plans for the classified service, or a part thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>together with rules for their administration, as may be presented by the chief examiner and secretary after a thorough survey of the personnel and departmental organization included in such plans,\u201d and generally to effectuate the provisions of that subtitle as thereby amended. Chapter 65 of the laws of 1944, <em>supra. </em>Those in the stated category were compensated for their labors by the federal government; and they were not, while in federal service, also employees of the state, in the classified service, within statutory intendment. The statute presupposed unintermitted service with all essential departmental service and other records available for the exercise of the reclassification function. The workers thus assigned were not subject to state control; and promotions while under the federal assignment were made without competitive or other qualifying examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Chapter 171 of the laws of 1943, supra, does not serve prosecutor in this regard. This statute saves the \u201ccivil service, pension or other rights, including rights to promotion and to increase in remuneration\u201d of one whose services were so made available to the federal government, and such promotion or increase in remuneration as he may have received while in such federal service, provided the Civil Service Commission \u201cshall find, upon an examination and survey of the law and procedures applied and used, in determining and setting up such advance in position and remuneration, that the individual would have been entitled under state law and procedures to acquire, hold and enjoy such advance ill position and remuneration against all other individuals interested or concerned.\u201d The Civil Service Commission found, after due inquiry, that the promotions and pay increases accorded prosecutor while in federal service were not in conformance with, the standards, procedures and practices under' state law, entitling him to hold such advances against all others \u201cinterested or concerned;\u201d and this exercise of administrative discretion is not fairly classable as arbitrary or capricious, and is therefore not subject to judicial action. The promotions while in federal service were not grounded in comparative merit and fitness revealed by competitive examinations or otherwise sanctioned by state law; and under all the eircum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>stances it was within the province of the Civil Service Commission, in the execution of the statutory policy, to give to prosecutor the rank in the state classified service which he held at the time of his induction into federal service. This the Commission, did. The proofs do not sustain the contention that the position thus permanently assigned to him is inferior in rank and grade to that held by him at the time of his transfer to federal service. That, too, called for the exercise of a measure of administrative judgment. The recognition of the demand now made plainly would disregard the letter and spirit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The evident purpose of the proviso was to safeguard the state\u2019s civil service policy against external interference. The function of a proviso, generally, is either to except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify or restrain its generality, or to exclude some possible ground of its misinterpretation, as^ extending to cases not intended by the legislature to be brought within its purview. <em>New Jersey State Board of Optometrists </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co., </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>287; <em>affirmed, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>495.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">And there is no substance to the contention that promotional examinations should be confined to the personnel of the Employment Service Division itself. The statute .of 1945 merely provides for divisional administrative unity within the Unemployment Compensation agency, unless such \"separation\u201d be found impracticable; but this has no relation whatever to the administration of the civil service laws. There is no indication of a purpose thus to modify the statutory civil service policy. Such a design cannot be left to doubtful implication; it is not to be accepted unless expressed in clear and indubitable language. The Employment Service is nevertheless but a division or department of the Unemployment Compensation Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
