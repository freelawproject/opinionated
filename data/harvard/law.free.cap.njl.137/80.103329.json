They now apply for <em>certiorari </em>to remove the indictments into the Supreme Court in order to move to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">By stipulation it appears that subsequent to the present application, the petitioners entered a plea of guilty and sentence was imposed thereon, by reason of which the questions sought to be raised on the writs of <em>certiorari </em>have become academic so far as the petitioners are concerned and consequently the applications are denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
