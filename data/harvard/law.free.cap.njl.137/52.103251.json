CONSOLIDATED FILM INDUSTRIES, INC., RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b108-8\">Submitted October 31, 1947</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0d\">Decided January 29, 1948.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-10\">\u201cThe complaint herein avers that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a cylinder pressman who, while so employed, was a member of a union which acted as bargaining agent for the benefit of its members under a contract with the defendant \u2018concerning the rates of pay, hours and working conditions\u2019 of defendant\u2019s employees, which agreement was effective for four j^ears from May 1st, 1941. That \u2018On or about August 2d, 1941, while the said agreement was in full force and effect; and while plaintiff was a member in good standing of said union, he was discharged from the defendant\u2019s emplojment without just cause.\u2019 It is then alleged in paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 that \u2018On or about January 5th, 1942, pursuant to the terms of the union agreement aforesaid,\u2019 he instituted proceedings in this court \u2018to compel arbitration to determine the merits\u2019 of his \u2018discharge, and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>found unjustified, to have damages assessed incurred by reason of such discharge, and for such other relief as the court may have deemed just in the premises/ (Italics throughout this memorandum supplied.) That on July 3d, 1942, said court ordered arbitration which resulted in an award \u201cfinding * * *, that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge from defendant\u2019s employment was unjust,\u2019 and assessing \u2018damages in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, covering the period from Aiigust 2d, 1941, to August 12th, 1942/ That judgment was entered thereon, which was appealed, affirmed and paid by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-6\">\u201c\u201cIt is then alleged in paragraph 9 that \u201cAt all times during and subsequent to the arbitration proceedings aforesaid, * * * up to the date of expiration of the said union contract (May 1st, 1945), the defendant has refused to either re-employ the plaintiff or compensate him for damages or loss of wages suffered by the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the union agreement aforesaid for that period of time from August 12th, 1942, to May 1st, 1945\u2019 (the date fixed for the termination of said agreement).</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-9\">\u201c\u201cParagraph 10 concludes the complaint and states the present claim for damages as follows: \u201cAs a result of the defendant\u2019s breach of the union contraed, as aforesaid, by unjustly discharging the plaintiff from its employ, the plaintiff suffered damages and loss of wages from August 12th, 1942, to May 1st, 1945/ In other words the plaintiff is seeking in the present action to recover additional damages for the same discharge for a period beyond that for which he was compensated as a result of the prior arbitration award.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-10\">\u201c\u201cTo this complaint the defendant has filed an answer consisting of certain admissions and denials and two separate defenses, each of which is pleaded in bar of the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-11\">\u201c\u201cThe matter is now before the court on plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the main part of the answer as sham and each of the separate defenses as sham or frivolous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-12\">\u201c\u201cFor the reason which will presently appear we will refer immediately to the first separate defense which is stated\u201d as follows: \u201cDefendant alleges that by reason of the allegations contained in paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the complaint [which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>relate in full the steps taken in the prior arbitration proceedings] and the record of such proceedings, plaintiff has elected his remedy and has pursued the same to a conclusion, and is thereby barred of and from any further claim against this defendant/</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-4\">\u201cThis defense, in the final anatysis, is an attempt to set up the satisfied judgment in the prior arbitration proceedings in bar of the present action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike this pleading as legally insufficient is the equivalent of a general demurrer at common law, <em>Koewing </em>v. <em>West Orange, </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>539; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Brotherhood, </em>94 <em>Id. </em>347; <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Public Service Railway Co., </em>95 <em>Id. </em>432; <em>Shaedel </em>v. <em>Liberty Trust Co., </em>99 <em>Id. </em>380, 382; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Staiger, 1 N. J. Mis. R. </em>607; <em>Rocker </em>v. <em>Cardinal Building and Loan Association, </em>13 <em>Id. </em>397, 401; <em>affirmed, </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>134, and opens the entire record, and judgment will go against the party whose pleading is first defective in substance. <em>Brehen </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>34 <em>Id. </em>408; <em>Salt Lake City National Bank </em>v. <em>Hendrickson, </em>40 <em>Id. </em>52; <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>83 <em>Id. </em>402, 404; <em>Westfield </em>v. <em>Public Service, Railway Co., </em>84 <em>Id. </em>568, 572; 1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>668.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-6\">\u201cSo we must first direct our attention to the complaint as the initial pleading in this cause, for if it is defective in substance it must be stricken regardless of the legal sufficiency of the first separate defense in its present form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">\u201cAs already observed, it clearly appears on the face of this complaint that the plaintiff, in the pi;ior arbitration proceeding, petitioned To have damages assessed incurred by reason of\u2019 his unlawful \u2018discharge * * *,\u2019 that he was awarded damages therein \u2018covering the period from August 2d, 1941, to August 12th, 1942,\u2019 and that the judgment entered thereon has been \u2018paid and satisfied/ It also appears that he now seeks additional damages for the same discharge for the balance of the term of the union contract, <em>i. e., </em>from August 12th, 1942, to May 1st, 1945'.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">\u201cIt is settled, by the great weight of authority, that where an employee has been wrongfully discharged before the end of his term he may bring only one action for such breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the contract of employment, in which all of his damages must be included. In other words there is only one cause of action for the period subsequent to the dismissal, and all claims for compensation for the unexpired term of the employment contract must be recovered, if at all, in one suit in the form of damages for the employer\u2019s breach thereof. The doctrine of constructive service has been repudiated. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Gilbert, Lock Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>312; <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Hecksher, </em>51 <em>N. J.

S.) </em>595; <em>Waldron </em>v. <em>Hendrickson, </em>57 <em>N. Y. Sup. </em>561; <em>James </em>v. <em>Parsons, Rich &amp; Co., </em>70 <em>Kan. </em>156; 78 <em>Pac.

W. Rep. (2d) </em>883; <em>Anno., </em>6 <em>L. R. A. (N. S.) </em>119-120; 39 <em>C. J. </em>93-95, \u00a7\u00a7 101-103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">\u201cThe reason that the discharged employee can bring but one action is because the contract of employment is entire and indivisible, and the discharge is a single act constituting but one breach, hence damages for such breach can be recovered in but one action. <em>Brand </em>v. <em>Ogden-Howard Co. (Del.), </em>111 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>370, 374, 375 (see cases cited). So it follows that a judgment for a part of an entire demand is a conclusive bar to another action for damages for the rest of the demand. <em>Viall </em>v. <em>Lionel Manufacturing Co., </em>90 <em>Conn. </em>694; 98 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>329. 331.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">\u201cThe present complaint is obviously an attempt to recover additional damages for the same breach of contract for winch the plaintiff was compensated in the prior arbitral ion proceedings. His discharge gave rise to a single canse of action for the damages resulting therefrom, and all of such damages should have been included in the prior judgment. If the plaintiff is dissatisfied with the amount thereof, his recourse, if any, is in the proceeding where it was rendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">\u201cThe complaint will, therefore, he stricken as insufficient in law, which, of course, makes it unnecessary to deal with the answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>form of order may be presented in accordance with the foregoing conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-4\">For the appellant, <em>Pesin &amp; Pesin (Hiram </em>Alfenbein, of counsel).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-5\">For the respondent, Wall, Haight, <em>Carey &amp; Hartpence (Gerald F. </em>O'Mara, of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The judgment under review herein is affirmed, for the reasons expressed in the opinion filed by Judge Ackerson.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chancellor, Chief Justice, Bodine, Donges, Heher, Colie, Wachenfeld, Eastwood, Burling, Wells, Dill, Freund, McLean, Sohettino, JJ. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
