J.\u2019 \u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The amendment added to the zoning ordinance of 1939 paragraph 21 to subsection (c) entitled \u201cB Districts \u2014 Business \u2014 of section 5, entitled Ttegulations and Restrictions/ \u201d which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201c21. No premises shall be used, and no building shall be erected, altered, or remodeled which are arranged, designed or contemplated to be used for the conduct and operation of the business of selling, buying, storing or trading in secondhand or used automobiles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Thereafter, on November 3d, 1947, application was made to the borough building inspector for a permit for the construction of a \u201cbuilding and used car lot\u201d in said municipality. This was refused by the building inspector as being in violation of the borough ordinance. No further steps were taken by the prosecutor to secure said permit, and the <em>certiorari </em>allowed in this case seeks to attack only the validity of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Prosecutor attacks the validity of the ordinance upon the ground that that portion of the questioned ordinance which attempts to control the use of vacant land separate and apart from the \u201cbuildings and structures\u201d thereon is invalid \u201cas without constitutional or statutory authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">It has been repeatedly held that the power of a municipality to limit the use of lands is within the police power. In <em>Duffcon Concrete Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Cresskill, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>81, Mr. Chief Justice Case said: \u201cThe authority of government to impose limitations upon the use and employment of private property rests upon two sources, first, the police power inherent in government to promote the safet3r, health, morals and general welfare of a communit3r, and, second, the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>provisions in our constitution and the ancillary statutes and ordinances passed thereunder.\u201d <em>Cf. Midland Park Coal, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Terhune, </em>136 <em>Id. 442, </em>opinion by Mr. Justice Eastwood, where it is said: \u201cThe argument that there is no constitutional or statutory authority to regulate by zoning, the use of vacant land has been disposed of adversely to prosecutor in <em>Yoemans et al. </em>v. <em>Hillsborough Township et al., </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>599, opinion by Mr. Justice Colie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We conclude that there is ample power to regulate the use of vacant lands in accordance with relatio\u2019n to public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, or the general good and welfare of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Prosecutor urges that the provision prohibiting the use of buildings or-lands for the carrying on of the business of buying and selling used automobiles is \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and therefore void.\u201d Prosecutor also argues that it is \u201cparticularly unreasonable as to this prosecutor.\u201d Inasmuch as the writ was allowed to review the validity of the ordinance and not any action affecting prosecutor, we limit consideration to the reasonableness and validity of the ordinance and not to the failure to accord exemption therefrom to the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">It has been repeatedly held that the business of selling used cars is to be distinguished from the selling of new cars. In <em>Ring </em>v. <em>North </em>Arlington, 136 <em>N. J. L. </em>494, Mr. Justice Heher said, \u201cThere are just and reasonable distinctions between the businesses of dealing in new and second-hand motor vehicles to support the classification thus made. There is a distinct line of cleavage between the two. The used car business lends itself peculiarly to trade practices and conditions affecting the public welfare not to be found in the new car business. The classification is not vicious on its face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">In <em>Chaiet </em>v. <em>East Orange, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>375, Mr. Chief Justice Case in discussing the business of used cars concluded that \u201cthe.general confusion of such a business when not supervised and restricted serve to present a fit, almost a necessary, subject for the exercise of a degree of municipal control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">In the instant case, prosecutor presents no proof to overcome the testimony on behalf of defendant and the presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>tion, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the ordinance is reasonable and for the public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Mr. Justice Colie dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
