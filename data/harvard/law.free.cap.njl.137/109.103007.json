The state of demand charges the procurement by the defendant landlord from the Eederal Office of Price Administration of \u201ca certificate authorizing eviction\u201d of the plaintiff tenant from the demised apartment premises on a fraudulent representation that the landlord \u201crequired\u201d the \u201capartment for himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">It was alleged that \u201cpursuant to the notice served upon him to remove from the premises upon the ground\u201d that the Price Administration bureau \u201chad authorized this eviction and that\u201d the landlord \u201crequired the apartment for himself,\u201d the plaintiff tenant \u201cremoved from\u201d the apartment; that the landlord \u201cdid not require\u201d' the \u201capartment for himself, and in fact, up to the date\u201d of the commencement of the action, had \u201cnot occupied the apartment but\u201d permitted \u201cthe same to remain vacant,\u201d and the representation was false and fraudulent; and that as a result of the fraud thus practiced, the plaintiff tenant \u201cwas subjected to several court proceedings\u201d and was put to the expense of \u201cstorage, moving,\u201d and the like, and \u201cwas forced to rent an apartment in a hotel at a considerably higher rental\u201d than that paid for the premises vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The issue was tried by the judge without a jury; and there was judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">The agreed state of the ease reveals no error in matter of law. It sets forth these findings of fact: On September 37th, 1945, the Price Administration bureau issued to the defendant landlord a certificate authorizing him \u201cto proceed to evict\u201d the plaintiff tenant \u201cin accordance with the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>law * * * based upon the fact\u201d that the landlord \u201chad alleged that he needed the premises for self-occupancy.\u201d On March 29th, 1946, the plaintiff tenant \u201cwas served with a customary thirty days\u2019 notice to vacate and thereafter an action to dispossess was brought in the Orange District Court.\u201d The parties to the action \u201cappeared before\u201d the court on May 22d following, \u201cand a judgment for possession was entered by the plaintiff herein consenting to such judgment for possession and by the landlord agreeing that no warrant be issued for one month;\u201d and \u201cThereafter,\u201d the tenant \u201cthen voluntarily removed from said premises and no warrant issued.\u201d The defendant landlord \u201cpermitted the said premises to remain vacant until November 1st, 1946, when\u201d he \u201csold the building.\u201d It is further certified that a realtor, sworn as a witness at plaintiff\u2019s instance, testified that defendant \u201chad solicited his services on March 13th, 1946, and listed the property with him for sale at that time;\u201d that defendant testified that \u201cthe reason that he did not occupy the premises for himself and his family was because his wife became ill and on a physician\u2019s advice they remained in the premises which they were then occupying;\u201d and that there was a finding merely \u201cof no cause for action,\u201d without a statement of the grounds of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The specifications of error, or such of them as are legally sufficient, raise only the question of the existence of evidence to sustain the judgment; and we find it to be without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">On the record made, the judgment is sustainable as grounded in a finding that the evidence did not establish the fraud and deceit charged, and thus a finding of fact conclusive on error. <em>R. 8. </em>2:32-202. The argument, in brief, is that the evidence \u201cclearly shows that the landlord at no time intended to occupy the premises himself,\u201d and \u201cfrom the facts\u201d there can be \u201cno question but that he acted in bad faith and was guilty of fraud and deceit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">A judgment presupposes a finding of fact in favor of the successful party, even if such finding be not expressed in terms. And where the conclusion of the District Court rests upon a mixed question of law and fact, the judgment will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>be reversed if the conclusion is legally inferable from the facts proved. Unless a contrary showing be made, a fact found by the judge is presumed to rest upon competent proof, and the appellate court will assume a finding of fact that will support the judgment. <em>Pollack </em>v. <em>New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>28.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In this view it is unnecessary to consider the question of whether the subject-matter of this action constitutes a collateral attack on the judgment of dispossession in the 'tenancy proceeding as an adjudication grounded in false testimony, <em>Vide, Kantor </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>336; <em>West New York Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Town of West New York, </em>88 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>571. The agreed case does not show that this is the issue upon which the finding below turned. The gravamen of the cause of action. alleged in the state of demand is fraud in the proceeding before the Federal bureau which induced action under Federal law prerequisite to dispossession of the tenant under a state law, and not fraud or false testimony in the dispossession suit itself. As noted, judgment in the dispossession proceeding was entered by' consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
