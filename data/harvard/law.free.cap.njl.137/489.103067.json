Smith was employed by the respondent, The Duncan Company, as manager of its apart-\u2019 ment house located at 2600 Boulevard, Jersey City, and his wife, the petitioner Rebecca B. Smith was employed as assistant manager. Their duties included the purchase and ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>rangement of holiday decorations for the apartment house. Annually, since 1936, they have purchased Christmas wreaths, holly, evergreens, and other decorations at florists and greenhouses. Early in December, 1943, they visited Duby\u2019s Florist Shop at Hackensack, where they' had made previous purchases, and ordered about twelve wreaths. They were told that the wreaths could be picked up on the afternoon of December 22d, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">On the morning of December 22d, 1943, the petitioners left Jersey City to pick up the wreaths at Duby\u2019s in Hackensack. After they left Jersey City they realized that they would arrive at Hackensack .too early and thereupon, in the language of the petitioner Benjamin W. Smith, \u201cWe talked it over and decided we would go up along the highway to some greenhouses. along the highway, and we would go as far as the Goshen Greenhouse in Goshen.\u201d His wife testified to the \u2022 same effect, both stating that they had in previous years made purchases of incidental floral decorations, other than the wreaths, from the Goshen Greenhouse. While driving along the highway towards Goshen, they were in an accident which resulted in injuries to both petitioners, and in their hospitalization until February 19th, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In due course, each, of the petitioners filed a claim for compensation in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau and the claims were consolidated for hearing. At the hearing, it was stipulated that the petitioners were in the employ of the respondent company and that they, were injured as a result of an accident on December 22d, 1943. The respondent company contended, however, that the petitioners had deviated from their employment and that, as a result, the accident did not arise out of and in the course of their employment. Respondent acknowledges that to reach this result, the petitioners\u2019 testimony before the Bureau that they were on their way to the Goshen Greenhouse must be disbelieved. The respondent company relies on the following evidentiary items, introduced by it, as warranting disbelief of petitioner\u2019s testimony :</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">1. An accident report, by Mr. Cane, president of the respondent company, in which he stated that the petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201cwore on their way to Hackensack, Few Jersey, to procure some wreaths and decorations for The Duncan Apartments. The material had to be made up to order so they decided to take a ride to Goshen in the meantime, with the intention of stopping on their way back for the wreaths.\u201d Mr. Cane was not called as a witness and his report was introduced without objection. It is equivocal and may be read consistently with the petitioners\u2019 testimony that they were riding to Goshen to the Goshen Greenhouse and were planning to pick up the wreaths at Hackensack on their return.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">2. An amended complaint in a proceeding before the Hudson County Court of Common Pleas by Benjamin W. Smith, as plaintiff, against Goshen Mile Track Association, Inc., was introduced to establish an assertion by the petitioner Benjamin W. Smith inconsistent with his testimony before the Burean.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">It is admitted that the automobile involved in the accident on December 22d, 1943, was owned by the Goshen Mile Track Association, Inc., of which petitioner Benjamin W. Smith is treasurer. He testified, before the Bureau, that on the date of the accident he was not engaged in any business on behalf of the Goshen Mile Track Association, although the amended complaint against the Goshen Mile Track Association, as defendant, does contain an allegation that the automobile was being driven in the defendant\u2019s business. He testified that he did not know either that suit had been started by his counsel against the Goshen Mile Track Association or what was in the complaint. Apart from the allegation in the amended complaint, there is nothing whatever to suggest that the automobile was being driven in the business of the Goshen Mile Track Association and the other evidence of the respondent company, clearly indicates the contrary. Thus, Mr. Oane\u2019s report and a statement prepared by Orville Perrant, an investigator employed by the respondent company\u2019s insurance carrier. support the conclusion that the only business engaged in by petitioners on December 22d was for the respondent company. In the light of the foregoing circumstances, the unverified allegation in the amended complaint is not sufficient to warrant disbelief of the sworn testimony of peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tioner Benjamin. W. Smith. <em>Cf. Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed., </em>1940) (at <em>p. </em>60), \u00a7 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">3. The statement prepared by the investigator Orville Eerrant, was introduced in evidence by the respondent compare, and is relied upon by it, to establish that petitioners\u2019 trip to Goshen was \u201cfor pleasure\u201d and not in the course of its business. The statement which is signed by petitioner Benjamin W. Smith, and bears an endorsement by petitioner Rebecca B. Smith that its contents are true, was prepared while petitioners were hospitalized and while petitioner Benjamin W. Smith was lying fiat on his back \u201cin traction.\u201d Both of the petitioners continued in the hospital for almost six weeks thereafter. Mr. Eerrant testified that although his visit was primarily as a paid investigator, it was also \u201cin the nature of a social visit\u201d since he had known petitioners over a period of years, and that he interviewed Mr. Smith \u201cover a period of approximately three hours or perhaps slightly less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Examination of the statement discloses inaccuracies and items which throw doubt as to whether it was \u201can uninspired voluntary statement, free from any suggestions from questioner.\u201d See <em>DiMieri </em>v. <em>Metafield, Inc. (Supreme Court, </em>1941), 126 <em>N. J. L. </em>484, 490; <em>affirmed (Court of Errors and Appeals, </em>1942), 127 <em>Id. </em>597. Thus, it states that the petitioners arrived at Duby\u2019s Elorist Shop in Hackensack about 10:00 A. m. on the morning of December 22d, 1943. Petitioners\u2019 testimony before the Bureau directly establishes that they never arrived at Hackensack on December 22d, 1943, and no attempt was made before the Bureau to contravert this testimony. We are satisfied that the statement was in error on this point. Although it does not embody many remarks in quotations, it is significant that the investigator placed in quotes phrases designed to afford legal immunity to the respondent. Thus, Mr. Smith is quoted as saying that it was decided to take \u201ca little ride for ourselves;\u201d that the purpose of the trip to Goshen was \u201cfor pleasure and to say \u2018hello\u2019 to some friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The petitioners testified that they did not read the statement of January 11th, 1944, and that it does not truthfully set forth the happenings on the day of the accident. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Deputy Commissioner who \u201chad the advantage of personal observation of the witnesses and their demeanor and manner of testifying\u201d (see <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Atlantic Refining Co. (Supreme Court, </em>1944), 132 <em>N. J. L. </em>196; <em>affirmed (Court of Errors and Appeals, </em>1945), 133 <em>Id. </em>39), believed their testimony and found that it was not discredited by the statement obtained by the paid investigator. See <em>Knapp v. C. F. Mueller </em>&amp; <em>Co. (Supreme Court,, </em>1947), 135 <em>Id. </em>230; <em>affirmed (Court of Errors and Appeals, </em>1947), 136 <em>Id. </em>186; <em>DiMieri </em>v. <em>Metafield, Inc., supra. </em>Under these circumstances we are disinclined to disturb his factual finding. See <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Gilbert Machine Works, Inc. (Supreme Court, </em>1939), 122 <em>Id. </em>533, 538, where Mr. Justice Tieher aptly expressed the pertinent considerations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">\u201cMoreover, the credibility of the witnesses on the crucial point of inquiry was sharply in issue; and, in the appraisement of the evidence adduced before the Bureau, it is to be borne in mind that the deputy commissioner had the distinct advantage of personal observation of the witnesses. The demeanor of the witness is ofttimes a factor of major importance in determining the probative value and weight of his evidence. The tone of voice, the readiness or reluctance with which questions are answered, his reaction to surprise and unexpected inquiries, his carriage and expression, -his seeming interest or lack of it, are all circumstances of consequence known only to the judicial officer in whose presence the witness testifies; and so, there is a natural hesitation on the part of the appellate tribunal, confined as it is to the written word, to disturb factual conclusions of the judicial officer to whom the evidence has been orally presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We find that the injuries suffered by the petitioners were the result of an accident that arose out of and in the course of their employment with respondent, The Duncan Company. The amount of the award by the Bureau is not questioned. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
