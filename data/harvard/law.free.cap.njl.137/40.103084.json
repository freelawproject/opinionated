The award was for an aggravation, caused by a blow to or a strain of the groin, of a pre-existing hernia.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The claimant had, in March of 1943, undergone an operation for a loft inguinal hernia. On or about December loth, 1943, after a \"period of toil, he went to his foreman and complained, according to the latter, of having \"made a strain on his hernia condition.\u201d He was sent to the plant doctor who testified that the claimant then reported that while turning a gear he had felt a weakness in the groin. The doctor further testified that he thereupon advised the employer to change the man\u2019s work as the job on which he was then working might cause a recurrence of the earlier hernia. Later the claimant went to Dr. Ward who had performed the earlier operation and who testified that he found a recurrence of tire hernia \"in the sear of the previous operation \u2014 coming down through the external ring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">The claimant\u2019s own story of the December, 1943, incident was that while he was working at a grinder machine the rotary gear struck him above the groin, causing him to stop work immediately, call the i\u00a3boss\u201d and tell the latter that he was hurt; and that either forthwith or within a matter of minutes a lump came in his abdomen. He was taken to the first aid room and, as the plant doctor was not there, to the doctor\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">There was other supporting testimony, particularly medical proof, showing a present left inguinal hernia causally related to the injury of December 15th. We find that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>hernia following and provoked by that injury and that it came down through the scar and outer ring of the former hernia and was a recurrence thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the claimant, on or about December 15th,.1943, suffered an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment which caused an aggravation of a pre-existing hernia condition and that, under <em>Furferi </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad </em>Co., 117 <em>N. J. L. </em>508, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
