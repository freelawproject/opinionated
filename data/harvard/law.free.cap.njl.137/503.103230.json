DeMOSS AND CATHERINE E. DeMOSS, PROSECUTORS, v. BOROUGH OF WATCHUNG, A MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY AND BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT OF THE BOROUGH OF WATCHUNG, A STATUTORY BODY, DEFENDANTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b559-4\">Submitted May 4, 1948</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AT1\">Decided August 25, 1948.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b559-7\">Before Justices Bobine and Jacobs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-8\">For the prosecutors, <em>George F.

This district is the highest type of residential classification. The area requirements are 60,000 square feet together with side and rear yards and height requirements not necessary for us to consider at this time. The lot in question is a little more than two-thirds of the required area.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">The hardship shown was that the lot may not be used for residence purposes in its present size. The borough\u2019s ordinance, adopted on August 14th, 1941, provided that no dwelling should be erected on a lot of less than 60,000 square feet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>except that a lot \u201cof record\u201d as of the date of the ordinance shall be regarded as of legal size if having an area of not less than 20,000 square feet. The prosecutor\u2019s lot contains 43,691 square feet. It was conveyed by the Paulang Company to Hornbeck by deed on August 2d, 1941, but apparently the deed was inadvertently not recorded until September, 1941. The lot was purchased by the DeMosses in 1946 and they desired to sell it to one Block and applied for an exception to permit the erection of a dwelling by the prospective purchaser notwithstanding the 60,000 square foot restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Under the peculiar circumstances presented the case is one of hardship requiring the granting of the exception., If t'he exception is not granted, then no building can be erected on the lot, and it will not be usable at all except possibly for farming. It is not large enough for this. The ordinance expressly permitted the erection of dwellings on lots of 20,000 feet or more which were \u201cof record\u201d on August 14th, 1941; the DeMosses\u2019 lot was in existence on August 14th, 1941, and it is important that notwithstanding its substantial size that it not be dedicated to remain \u201ca lot\u201d in perpetuity because the deed was not recorded until after August 14th. This act must have been a mere clerical oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The decision of the Board of Adjustment, rendered December 15th, 1941', denying the application of the prosecutors to erect a dwelling upon the property in question is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
