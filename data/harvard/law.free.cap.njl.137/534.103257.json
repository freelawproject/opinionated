The defendant, May, counter-claimed alleging that the contract was performed in an unworkmanlike manner; that as a result thereof certain personal property was damaged and sought to recover damages therefor. The state of case settled by the trial judge discloses that the plaintiff proved a- balance due under the contract of $200; that the defendant, May, testified to damages as a result of leaks in the roof amounting to $317 and the trial court entered judgment on the counter-claim in that amount. From this judgment Eagle Roofing Co. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">In <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Lintz, </em>76 <em>N. J. L. </em>204, this court, following the decision of the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Feeney </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Bardsley, </em>66 <em>Id. </em>239, held in a similar situation that \u201cif there had been a substantial performance of the contract, even though there was failure in some minor particulars, the contract price might be recovered, less a fair allowance to the owner to make good the defects.\u201d In the instant ease there was evidence that the leak in the roof could have been repaired for $40.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Plaintiff in its brief contends that \u201che [defendant] should have had judgment for the contract price of $415 less any defects found in the performance of the contract, viz., deduction of $317 from $415 would have meant a balance of $98 due plaintiff; which, deducted from the $215 already received by plaintiff would result in a judgment of $117 for defendant at best.\u201d With this contention we are in agreement and since it is the only meritorious point on this appeal, judgment is entered for the defendant for $117 and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
