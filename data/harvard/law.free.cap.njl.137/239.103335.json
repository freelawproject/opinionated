Crisci </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners of Raritan, </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>103. For the purpose of this opinion we borrow from the relator\u2019s brief, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cThe only inter-relation between Relator and Defendant which has been carried down from 1868 through 1947 is that the Relator never appointed or elected a tax assessor and tax collector, and the defendant has since 1868 been assessing and collecting taxes within the Town of Raritan. The method used through all the years consisted of the Relator passing annual ordinances, setting' forth anticipated revenues and expenditures of the town, and determining the amount of money to be raised by local taxation. This amount was then certified by Relator to the Defendant, who then assesses and collects the taxes necessary, and turns over the money so collected to the Treasurer of Raritan and by him expended in accordance with the budgetary provisions. Defendant likewise collects the State and County taxes and pays over to Relator a proportion of the road tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cIn addition to assessing and collecting the taxes for Raritan as certified to it by the Town of Raritan, the Defendant also regards the taxable property of Raritan as being part of the taxable property of Bridgewater, and assesses and collects from the inhabitants of Raritan, taxes in accordance with the local Bridgewater Township rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">\u201cEor many years, the Relator anticipated in its annual budget a revenue designated Toad tax\u2019 from the Defendant and, likewise, the Defendant has been appropriating in its budget an item \u2014 cTown of Raritan \u2014 Roads.\u2019 Each year be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ginning with the year 1931 and continuing through the year 1946, the Defendant has paid oxer to the Relator as its proportion of the road tax the sum of $9,000. In the year 1947 there was again anticipated $9,000 in the Relator\u2019s budget as due from the Defendant for roads, and in the 1947 budget of the Defendant there was appropriaied an item \u2018Town of Raritan \u2014 \u25a0 Roads, $9,000.00.\u201d\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">An additional fact to be considered is that in 1946 Raritan receixed $13,450.30 from second class railroad taxes which it retained in its treasury contrary to a practice of some ten years\u2019 standing of turning such second class railroad taxes oxer to Bridgewater to be apportioned between the two municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The relator states that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 obligation * * * is predicated upon their contractual relationship, as exidenced by their respectixe budgets, and course of dealings for many .years * * In our opinion, Raritan\u2019s claim grounded as it is on an asserted contract exidenced by annual budget appropriations oxer a course of years is a far cry from being either clear or certain. <em>Uszhay </em>v. <em>Dill, </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>327.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Furthermore, Bridgewater should be afforded an opportunity to set off its claim against Raritan with reference to the second class railroad taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\"><em>Mandamus </em>is not the appropriate proceeding in which to do so. Where there is a doubtful case, the writ will not be issued. <em>O\u2019Hara </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>56 <em>N. J. L. </em>279.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
