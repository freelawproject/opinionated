The order recites that prosecutor was tried on a complaint made by his wife under <em>B. 8. </em>9 :6 \u2014 1, <em>et seq., B. 8. </em>9:18-14 and <em>B. 8. </em>44:1-1, <em>et seq., </em>charging him \u201cwith abandoning, abusing, deserting or wilfully refusing or neglecting to support his family.\u201d The complaint, however, makes no mention of <em>section </em>9 :6-l. It alleges that prosecutor \u201chas refused and failed to provide adequate support and maintenance of his family, * * * in that for the past several weeks\u201d he \u201chas failed to support his wife contrary to\u201d <em>B. S. </em>9:18-1, <em>et seq., B. 8. </em>44:1-1, <em>et seq., B. 8. </em>2:204-1, <em>et seq., </em>and <em>B. 8. 2 </em>:205-l, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">It is said that chapter 77 of the laws of 1946 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>267), amending <em>B. 8. </em>9:18-14, <em>supra, </em>was designed to confer upon the Domestic Relations Courts concurrent jurisdiction with Chancery \u201cin matters of support and maintenance of a wife,\u201d and to that extent constitutes an impairment of the exclusive jurisdiction of Chancery at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1844, and so exceeds the bounds of constitutional limitations. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">The subject-matter of the cited statute was not within the exclusive inherent jurisdiction of equity prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1844. As early as 1799, justices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>of the peace were given a summary jurisdiction in cases where a husband defaulted in the performance of the obligation to support his family. The power was amplified in 1864. <em>Rev. </em>1821, <em>p. </em>473; <em>Nixon\u2019s Elmer\u2019s Digest </em>(4th <em>ed.) </em>1007, 1008. This jurisdiction was transferred to the Domestic Relations Courts upon their creation in 1929; and it has since reposed there without question. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1929, <em>p. </em>274; <em>R. S. </em>9:18-4, <em>et seq. </em>In 1794, our Chancery for the first time was invested by the Council and General Assembly with jurisdiction over divorces and alimony and the maintenance of children as an incident thereto, subjects until then within the exclusive province of the ecclesiastical courts. <em>Paterson\u2019s Laws, </em>143; <em>Harris v. Vanderveer\u2019s Executor, </em>21 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>424, 432. And jurisdiction to award separate maintenance in eases of abandonment and refusal or neglect of support was not granted to Chancery until the year 1818. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>20; <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>64 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>736, 752. The amendment of 1946 cited <em>supra </em>empowered the Domestic Relations Courts to provide \u201cadequate\u201d support and maintenance of \u201cthe spouse, child, children or 'the entire family,\u201d and thus enlarged the pre-existing jurisdiction. <em>Vide Hiers </em>v. <em>Hiers, </em>132 <em>Id. </em>610. Alim\u00f3ny, in its origin, was the method by which the spiritual courts of England enforced the duty of support owed by the husband to the wife \u201cduring such times as they were legally separated pending the marriage relation.\u201d <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Lynde, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Only the inherent powers of our constitutional courts as they existed in their English prototypes were saved from alteration by article YI, section I and article X, section I of the Constitution of 1844. It is the essential nature or jurisdiction of the constitutional courts that was thereby rendered indestructible and unalterable in the legislative forum. The functions and powers thus safeguarded are those inherent in the constitution of the court itself. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Vanderveer\u2019s Executor, supra; Jersey City </em>v. <em>Lembeck, </em>31 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>255; <em>Traphagen </em>v. <em>Township of West Hoboken, </em>39 <em>N. J. L. </em>232; <em>Hedden </em>v. <em>Hand, </em>90 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>583; <em>State Board of Milk Control </em>v. <em>Newark Milk Co., </em>118 <em>Id. </em>504, 514. Under the Constitution of 1844, the legislature did not have the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>petency to change the nature of the constitutional courts \u201ceither by direct abridgment of [their] original power or by weakening [their] authority by lodging it eo-ordiuarily [co-ordinately] in some other tribunal;\u201d the inquiry is whether the legislative rule effected, an \u201cinherent essential change in the judicial constitution that\u201d the particular court \u201cinherited from its English protoype.\u201d <em>Flanigan </em>v. <em>Guggenheim Smelting Co., </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>647, 653, 654. It was not the intent of the cited constitutional guaranty to fix absolutely Chancery\u2019s pre-existing statutory jurisdiction over matters of support and maintenance, and thus to preclude the vesting in statutory tribunals of the jurisdiction here invoked \u2014 a jurisdiction primarily designed to protect the public from the burdens arising from the non-fulfillment of family obligations of support and maintenance. <em>Hiers </em>v. <em>Hiers, supra; Van Keegan </em>v. <em>Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of the County of Bergen, </em>132 <em>Id. </em>21. In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Vanderveer\u2019s Executor, supra </em>(at <em>p. </em>447), Mr. Justice Van Syckel said: \u201cThe Prerogative Court in this state owes the finality of its decrees, neither to its peculiar organism, nor to constitutional provision, but wholly to legislative enactment <em>(Rev. Laws </em>776) ; and there is therefore nothing in that aitribute of the court which inhibits legislative interference.\u201d But none of the statutes invoked to sustain the judgment either defines \u201cconstructive desertion\u201d or sanctions the exertion of jurisdiction by the Domestic Relations Courts on proof of a separation by the act of the spouse seeking alimony induced by the misconduct of the other spouse. Although, as we have seen, the complaint merely alleges that \u201cfor the past several weeks this defendant has failed to support his wife contrary to\u201d the cited statutes, and that \u201cthe petitioner and his family may become a charge on the City of Yewark,\u201d the judgment of conviction recites that defendant was tried on a complaint charging in the disjunctive desertion and willful refusal or neglect \u201cto support his family, in accordance with the provisions of\u201d <em>R. S. </em>9 :6~1, <em>et seq., </em>and \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>R. S. </em>9:18-14 and <em>R. S. </em>44:1 \u2014 1, <em>et seq., </em>and was found guilty of \u201cconstructive desertion\u201d of his wife. The marriage was childless.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The conviction is not sustainable under any of the statutes upon which it is rested in the judgment itself. Section 9:6 \u2014 1, <em>et seq., </em>defines and renders punishable abuse, abandonment, cruelty and neglect of a child. Section 9 :18-14, as amended, invests the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts with jurisdiction, <em>inter alia, </em>to hear and determine complaints for the violation of certain enumerated statutes and \u201cany other laws or future enactments covering similar complaints or offenses, where the gravamen of the complaint under such laws or enactments is the failure or neglect of one member of the family to satisfy or discharge his legal obligations to another of a family,\u201d and \u201cto hear and determine in a summary manner disputes and complaints involving the domestic relation and * * * order the adequate support of the spouse, child, children or the entire family and * * * to provide by appropriate order for their support and maintenance.\u201d Section 44:1-143 empowers the court to order payment of suitable support and maintenance by a husband or father who \u201cshall desert\u201d his wife or children \u201cand leave them or any of them as public charges.\u201d And section 44:1-147, although not phrased with technical nicety, classifies as a disorderly person, liable to imprisonment, a husband or father who \u201cshall willfully desert\u201d his wife or children and \u201cshall refuse or neglect\u201d to maintain a \u201cperson so deserted or neglected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Plainly, the statute has in view actual abandonment or desertion and a failure of support as jurisdictional prerequisites in a wife\u2019s action for alimony. <em>Hiers </em>v. <em>Hiers, supra; Van Keegan </em>v. <em>Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of the County of Bergen, supra; Gerish </em>v. <em>Bergen County Court of Juvenile and Domestic Relations, </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>485. The finding of \u201cconstructive desertion\u201d was not enough. We have no way of knowing what the judge had in mind as the constituent elements of desertion of this class. The wife testified : \u201cHe [her husband] forced me out. He wouldn\u2019t give me any money unless I went out.\u201d And in the course of the hearing below, she spurned her husband\u2019s plea for a resumption of cohabitation because it would make her life \u201cmiserable.\u201d Indirect desertion in the sense of a termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>cohabitation by the misbehavior of one of the spouses is not within the statutory category.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The judgment is reversed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
