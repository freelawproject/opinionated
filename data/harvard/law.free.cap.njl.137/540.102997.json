Near the body there was water on the floor and a partially filled bucket was nearby. The deputy commissioner before whom the matter was heard in the Bureau, dismissed the petition on the merits and on appeal, the Essex County Court of Common Pleas found that the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment and awarded compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The question is a close one on the facts as demonstrated by the contradictory findings of the deputy commissioner and the Court of Common Pleas, and under these circumstances we deem that there is a debatable question and that a writ of <em>certiorari </em>should be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
