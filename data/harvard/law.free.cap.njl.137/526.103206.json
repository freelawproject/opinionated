As stated in prosecutor\u2019s brief \u201cThe sole question is whether the petitioner had a fair trial before the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Prosecutor\u2019s record is meagre and fails to show any grounds for a reversal of the Commissioner\u2019s action, either upon the merits of the appeal or upon the ground that it was denied opportunity to present proof to support its appeal. Upon consideration of the record submitted we conclude that the prosecutor was afforded full and ample opportunity to present proofs and was not denied a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The application for <em>certiorari </em>is denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">This disposition of the merits of the application renders it unnecessary to deal with the motion of defendants to dismiss the matter by reason of the failure of prosecutor to furnish an adequate record of the proceedings under review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
