ANTHONY T. BOTTI, JUDGE OF THE FIRST CRIMINAL COURT OF THE CITY OF JERSEY CITY, AND CITY OF JERSEY CITY, DEFENDANTS-RESPONDENTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b493-4\">Submitted January 20, 1948</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKAb\">Decided July 23, 1948.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b493-8\">Before Justices Bodine, Heher and Wachenfeld.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-9\">For the prosecutors, <em>Carpenter, Gilmour &amp; Dwyer (James D.

If it be conceded <em>arguendo </em>that the declared emergency affected a basic interest of the community at large justifying at the time the exertion of the police power for the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>good, and that the means were reasonable and appropriate for the protection of that interest, the emergency which brought the regulation into being has long since ceased to exist and the ordinance has become <em>functus officio. </em>A regulation depending upon the existence of an emergency or other certain state of facts to uphold it loses its force and authority upon the termination of the emergent condition or a change in the basic facts, even though valid when passed. The subsistence of the exigency upon which the continuation of the law depends is always open to judicial inquiry. The operation of the regulation itself could not validly outlast the emergency. <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Township of North </em>Bergen, 113 <em>N. J. L. </em>143.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">We take judicial notice of the complete cessation of the conditions which gave rise to the emergency found by the local legislative body. We also direct attention to the President\u2019s message to the Congress on February 19th, 1947, relating to the termination of \u201cthe great majority of emergency controls over the Nation\u2019s economy\u201d during \u201cthe year and a half that have elapsed since the defeat of our last enemy in battle,\u201d recommending the repeal of certain emergency statutes, and requesting the executive departments and agencies to cease operations under powers \u201cderived from certain permanent statutes that are effective only during emergencies, to the extent that such operations are related to the 1939 and 1941 emergencies.\u201d Assuming for the purposes of discussion that the means employed bore a real and substantial relation to the declared object of the legislation, the \u201cemergency conditions arising out of the war effort\u201d no longer exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The judgment of conviction is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
