Appellee filed a bill in the Circuit Court to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien for labor and material furnished under a written contract. The contract is set forth in the bill of complaint, and provides inter alia that all payments shall be \u201cmade upon written certificates of the architect to the effect that such payments have become due and no payment shall be considered due nor shall the owner be considered to have made any default in payment until such written certificates shall have been issued by the architect and presented for payment and proper affidavits and waivers of lien furnished as provided by the mechanic\u2019s lien law of this state.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-6\" pgmap=\"571(176) 572(28)\">The cause was referred to a master, who found there was a failure on the part of the complainant to prosecute the work provided for under the contract with promptness and diligence and a failure in the performance of some of the agreements contained in the contract; that by reason of such failure on the part of complainant the owner was justified in availing himself of a provision in the contract authorizing him to terminate the-employment of the complainant and procure the work to be finished by another party; that the owner did so and paid one McIver for completing the work required by the contract the sum of $307.04; that after so paying for the completion of the work there was a balance due the complainant of $317.96; that on or about October 16,1905, the architect mailed to complainant\u2019s attorney an architect\u2019s cetrificate for said sum of $317.96, which certificate was on the 25th of October following returned by complainant\u2019s said attorney with a letter in which it was stated that the amount due complainant was \u201cnot $317.96 but $492.06,\u201d and that complainant had instructed him \u201cto begin proceedings the last of this week\u201d unless defendants should settle the claim.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\" pgmap=\"572\">After the bill was filed and at the commencement of the hearing before the master the defendants tendered payment of $317.96, the amount shown to be due under the architect\u2019s certificate, which tender did not include any interest or costs of the suit to date of tender. The master finds that complainant is entitled to a decree awarding him a lien and a personal decree for $317.96, together with interest thereon, and that defendants should be decreed to pay the costs of suit, including an attorney\u2019s fee of $125 to complainant\u2019s solicitor.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-6\" pgmap=\"572\">The decree finds the amount due complainant to be $317.96, that no tender of this sum was made to complainant before suit was brought, but such tender was made at commencement of hearing before the master, not however including interest and costs; that upon argument of exceptions to the master\u2019s report defendants tendered again to complainant in open court said sum of $317.96 in legal tender to be applied pro tanto on complainant\u2019s claim, reserving the question of interest, costs and master\u2019s fees, and that complainant declined to accept the tender so made; that there is due complainant $317.96 with interest at' 5% per annum from November 3, 1905, to date of entry of the decree, amounting to $22.15, also $125 solicitors\u2019 fees, and $54.15 paid by complainant for stenographer\u2019s fees, to be-taxed as costs, together with a master\u2019s fees of $178. It is therefore decreed that defendants pay complainant $519.26, the further sum of $178 to the master, also interest on $317.96 from date of the decree to day of payment, together with costs to be taxed.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQ7j\" pgmap=\"572\">From this decree the defendants prosecute this appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-3\" pgmap=\"573\">Adler, &amp; Lederer, for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-4\" pgmap=\"573\">William C.

The contract as above stated provides that all payments shall be made upon written certificates of the architect and that \u201cno payment shall be considered due nor shall the owner be considered to have made default in payment until such written certificate shall have been issued by the architect and presented for payment.\u201d This is, the contract of the parties. By its terms nothing was due complainant until he presented the architect\u2019s certificate to the defendants for payment. Complainant, however, refused to accept the certificate and returned it, demanding an additional sum, which the chancellor has found he was not entitled to. It is, we think, apparent that in view of the letter of complainant\u2019s counsel returning the certificate to defendants, a tender to the complainant of the amount due under the certificate would have been an act not only not required of defendants under .the terms of the contract but a useless act. In Gorham v. Farson, 119 Ill. 425-442, it is said: \u201cWhere a creditor in advance of ah offer to pay or in response to such offer informs the party under obligation to pay that he will not accept the amount actually due in discharge of the indebtedness the party under obligation' to pay is relieved of the duty of tendering the amount actually due.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b574-5\" pgmap=\"574\">The decree in this case while finding that $317.96, the amount offered complainant by the terms of the architect\u2019s certificate, was the exact sum lawfully due him, goes further and saddles the defendants with the costs of the procedure, including solicitors\u2019 and master\u2019s fees for services rendered in an attempt by complainant to recover more than was his due. This is clearly inequitable. To sustain this decree in these respects would tend to ' encourage unnecessary and illegitimate litigation prosecuted for the purpose of enforcing wrongful claims, to defend against which might subject the. defendant, as in this case, to a penalty greater than the amount of the original debt. A court of equity cannot sanction such procedure merely because a useless tender of payment of a sum already refused by the complainant, and not required by the contract of the parties, was omitted. \u201cIt will not allow the ends of justice to be perverted or defeated by the omission of an unimportant or useless act, which nothing but a mere technicality could require.\u201d Dwen v. Blake, 44 Ill. 135-141.</p> <p id=\"b574-6\" pgmap=\"574(63) 575(198)\">Defendants in their answer to the hill of complaint admitted an indebtedness of $317.96, the amount found due complainant in the architect\u2019s certificate, and offered to bring that sum into court and pay it to .complainant. Before any evidence was taken this sum was legally tendered complainant and refused, as was a subsequent tender of the same amount made in open court. It is said in behalf of the complainant that he did not say he would not accept the offer of defendants to pay the $317.96 if tendered to him in money, and that the whole controversy was caused by defendants\u2019 failure to pay something which they afterward came in and admitted was justly due. The facts do not accord with this statement. The certificate was returned to defendants with an express refusal to accept it because it did not award complainant a sum in excess of what was found to be due him. ' When demand was made for such additional amount accompanied with a threat of immediate suit if the demand was not complied with, the defendants were justified in assuming that the complainant would refuse payment of the amount since he had returned the certificate for the same sum. Later when the tender was made before the master, complainant\u2019s counsel refused to accept it because, as he stated, the certificate was for $317.96 and showed no balance due beyond that and \u201ctherefore it being a tender in full of all claims against Eiger, the tender is refused.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b575-4\" pgmap=\"575(165) 576(51)\">The answer to the bill of complaint, however, admitted the issue of the architect\u2019s certificate for $317.96 and stated that this sum the defendants were willing to pay and \u201chereby offered to bring said sum into court and to pay said sum to complainant.\u201d Having admitted this sum to be due and offered to pay the amount actually found to be all that defendants owed the complainant, there was evidently no occasion for a reference to a master to take testimony to prove what the answer had admitted to be due. The costs of the reference taken to ascertain only what the defendants had admitted to be due were made at complainant\u2019s instance and should not be charged against the defendants. Neither is the complainant entitled to solicitors\u2019 fees incurred in an unsuccessful effort to recover what he was not entitled to. The allowance is erroneous. Manowsky v. Stephan, 233 Ill. 409-412. There having been, however, no tender of costs incurred up to the time of filing such answer made by the defendants but only of the principal sum, the defendants are not exonerated from liability for actual necessary court costs subsequently incurred. Sweetland v. Tuthill, 54 Ill. 217. The commencement of the suit was a demand for payment.</p> <p id=\"b576-5\" pgmap=\"576\">For the reasons indicated the decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed and the cause remanded to that court with directions to enter a decree in favor of the complainant for $317.96 and costs of court other than master\u2019s fees, the expenses of the reference and solicitors\u2019 fees. . \"</p> <p id=\"b576-6\" pgmap=\"576\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
