With elements of mandamus, injunction and petition lor judicial review, this hybrid, even if it were powered by gas, electricity or good, old-fashioned elbow grease, could not arrive at appellants\u2019 desired destination. In addition, we conclude that O\u2019Brien\u2019s customized method of travel in this litigation \u2014 administrative mandamus \u2014 is simply a non-starter. For reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the circuit court rejecting O\u2019Brien\u2019s challenge and upholding the actions of appellee Board of License Commissioners for Washington County (\u201cthe Board\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">In October of 2006, Sharon and Michael Turner, owners of Chasers Bar and Grill, 139 North Mulberry Street in Hagers-town, sold their business to Adam and Christine O\u2019Brien. O\u2019Brien planned to operate an establishment known as De-Courcy\u2019s Pub at that address and set up a limited liability company for that purpose. However, complications soon arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Apparently, before the liquor license could be transferred, O\u2019Brien had to overcome residency issues. Under the Rules of the Board of License Commissioners for the County (\u201cthe Board\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">If an appellant does not meet the residence requirements above or is not a registered voter in Washington County because he/she is not a resident of the County, then the appellant shall appoint a person who meets these requirements as a resident agent for the license and give him/her at least a one percent (1%) interest in the entity (corporation) that owns the business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">BLC-005(c). To comply with this rule, O\u2019Brien named Sharon Turner (\u201cTurner\u201d) as \u201cresident agent\u201d with a one percent interest in DeCourcy\u2019s Pub, LLC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, Turner\u2019s name, as well as O\u2019Brien\u2019s, was included on the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In addition, landlord-tenant problems surfaced. The Turners had leased the Mulberry Street property from William Marlow until August 2009, and Marlow was not willing to substitute O\u2019Brien as a tenant. However, he appeared to be agreeable to allowing the Turners to sublease to O\u2019Brien. As a result, in December 2006, an \u201caddendum to Sales Contract\u201d was entered into between the Turners and Adam O\u2019Brien, which among other things: 1) acknowledged that Marlow would not release the Turners from the lease obligation; 2) subleased the property and set the monthly rent; 3) required O\u2019Brien to pay real estate taxes; 4) set no term for the expiration of the lease<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; 5) provided that if a default occurred because of a failure to pay rent, the Turners \u201cwould have the right to exercise immediate possession and ownership of the business .... \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Subsequently, the Board approved O\u2019Brien\u2019s application for a transfer of the license, and, evidently, renewals of the license in 2007 and 2008.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, all did not go well for DeCourcy\u2019s Pub: neighbors complained about the noise; an attempt to lay the ground for moving the business to a new location stalled; and O\u2019Brien was under financial stress. At an April 30, 2008 meeting of the Board, these problems surfaced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> O\u2019Brien said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">Well, the plan is to try to move the liquor license, once the lease has been fulfilled, to a commercial area, get it out of the residential area to try to just get the neighborhood off our back, really. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s gonna get a whole lot better. We\u2019re gonna do the best we can in the meantime to control the problems, noise being the main one. But first and foremost I have to take care of my lease and then after that, that\u2019s when I would want to come talk to you guys about any opportunity that I have to move within [the] voting district to a more commercial area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Turner stated that when she asked O\u2019Brien whether he was going to pay the rent, his response was \u201cYour rent? I don\u2019t have any money.\u201d She added that she had paid the personal property taxes for O\u2019Brien\u2019s limited liability company. Turner said that she discussed the proposed move with the owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the building who said he would not let O\u2019Brien out of the lease, \u201cbecause he\u2019s not a very good tenant and he\u2019s not maintaining the property.\u201d Also speaking at the meeting was Alan Green-wald, described in the minutes as \u201cdeveloper and owner of property on Franklin Street,\u201d where apparently O\u2019Brien sought to move. He echoed Turner\u2019s testimony about the recalcitrance of the owner of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Board Chairman Robert L. Everhart responded to the witnesses: \u201cThe problem that you\u2019re having with the landlord is not something that we have any control over or are going to be involved in, unless something changes.\u201d Later, he added: \u201c[U]ntil you all have a problem that affects your licensing, we\u2019re not gonna get involved....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On July 9, 2008, O\u2019Brien and Greenwald attended another meeting of the Board to discuss the proposed transfer to a new location. Turner was not present. After being sworn in, the witnesses described the reasons justifying a transfer and listened to advice from Chairman Everhart about how to proceed. O\u2019Brien and Greenwald indicated that they planned to create a new LLC before an application would be filed. Chairman Everhart said: \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have a problem with you putting your application in and I think, like I say, the main thing is you will have to have your LLC before you can do the advertising.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Before this new enterprise could flourish, DeCourcy\u2019s Pub floundered. The pub closed and its liquor license was taken by representatives of the Board.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On January 7, 2009, Turner appeared before the Board. She advised Board members that O\u2019Brien \u201chas not been paying the rent for the property, taxes or insurance.\u201d She said she would be meeting with her lawyer \u201cabout the possibility of getting the license back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Less than a month later, O\u2019Brien, Greenwald and Turner (represented by counsel) were back before the Board to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>determine, according to Chairman Everhart, \u201cwho has the license and what\u2019s going on.\u201d Turner stated that O\u2019Brien had not paid the rent or the taxes<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that she had changed the locks on the premises. Turner\u2019s attorney told the Board that because O\u2019Brien defaulted on the sublease, the business belonged to the Turners. <em>See </em>p. 566, 23 A.3d at 325, <em>supra. </em>O\u2019Brien responded that he had no intention of transferring the license to Turner and still wanted to move the license out of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Chairman Everhart told O\u2019Brien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">[If] you want to make an application for a transfer, we can certainly do that. It is your license. So if that\u2019s what you want to do, you can make an application to transfer it and I want to say up front that we don\u2019t guarantee transfers ... The problem you have between the two of you, we don\u2019t ... I don\u2019t see any involvement we have in that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Turner\u2019s attorney asked: \u201c[C]an the license be transferred over the objection of the resident agent?\u201d The Chairman responded: \u201cIf the license can be transferred, yes, because it is his license.\u201d Another commissioner made a motion that \u201cO\u2019Brien may apply for a transfer,\u201d but that before any approval, Turner may assert her \u201cfull legal rights.\u201d The motion was approved unanimously.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">What happened next is a little unclear. In his filings in this case, O\u2019Brien said that he delivered the transfer application to the Board on Monday, March 2, 2009 and was told by Board Administrator Deborah L. Kirk that \u201cthere would not be any transfers in the month of March and subsequently in the month of April of 2009.\u201d Kirk was alleged to have said that \u201cthere are no transfers in March as it is the renewal month, and that April will be violations hearings.\u201d The transfer application was not included in the record in the circuit court or the record in this Court. At oral argument in this Court, the Board\u2019s counsel said that the Board had no record of receiving a transfer application.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Apparently acting as if it had not received the transfer application, the Board met two more times with the parties in this controversy. On both occasions the issue described in Board minutes was \u201cLICENSE RENEWAL.\u201d At the March 18, 2009 meeting, the following exchanges occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">Chairman Everhart: The question that you came here for ... would you explain what your requesting is (sic).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">Adam Obrien: Requesting to be approved to renew the license and move forward with the transfer without Sharon Turner\u2019s signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">Chairman Everhart: Well, you can\u2019t move forward with the transfer. You can move forward with renewing your license. You\u2019ll have to renew the license before you transfer it anyhow, so it\u2019s not gonna affect you if you don\u2019t transfer. But that wouldn\u2019t affect the, you know, you, as far as you getting the license. What do you have to say about ... where do you all stand on this license? Do you have anything else you\u2019d like to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">Adam Obrien: Not at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">Chairman Everhart: Do you have anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">Sharon Turner: I\u2019m not gonna sign off on the license. I had gotten a letter from them stating that they would pay me in February 6 of 2011. Absolutely, not. I don\u2019t want this tied up for that long. I\u2019m not gonna do it and they sent me a thing of release. I\u2019m not signing anything. If he wants the license, pay me what you owe me. If he wants to go back in that building, I will hand him back the key, but why am I gonna release him or want him to get his license. He doesn\u2019t pay his rent. That\u2019s back. The taxes are not paid. I\u2019ve paid them. And I think that you guys need to step in here, either give me the opportunity to apply for this license myself, without him, because he is in default and I had the attorney here before. You guys know if I have to take this to court, I\u2019ll do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">After Michael Turner indicated that he would not reopen the property until the back rent and other payments were made, the Chairman said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Well let me ... I\u2019ll say this, actually, and we\u2019ve talked about this and we\u2019re not ... We will allow the new license to be applied for. We will not allow for her (Sharon Turner) to come off of that or will not allow it to be transferred. If it\u2019s gonna be transferred, it\u2019ll be done at a later time. But you could make your application for the license the way the license exists, as long as you meet some of the criteria that you have to meet. To even renew your license there\u2019s some issues that have to be taken care of and you\u2019ll find that out when you make your application, if you haven\u2019t already. There\u2019s things on there that has to be taken care of....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACh\">When Sharon Turner asked what would happen if O\u2019Brien did not file a renewal application by April 1st, the Chairman replied: \u201c[T]here won\u2019t be [any] license then. He won\u2019t have a license April 1st.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">One week later, the principal contestants were back before the Board. At this March 25, 2009 meeting, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">Chairman Everhart: Do they need landlord\u2019s signature to renew? That\u2019s why you\u2019re here today, correct? Is that all? Nothing about transferring?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">Adam Obrien: No. I want to request that Sharon Turner\u2019s name be taken off my liquor license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">Chairman Everhart: Okay. The way the law reads is, the fact the lease is up in August, so, consequently, you cannot take her off because, actually, if the lease was for the following year or five years and extend the lease that you have, then you would not need to have someone sign it. The fact that the lease is not for that extended period of time, the person that is on there now is the person that\u2019s gonna be there until the lease is over. And at that time you could possibly change the names and that\u2019s why that is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">Adam Obrien: Alright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">Chairman Everhart: So, I hope you understand that. But that\u2019s the reason it is the way it is. If the lease was for a year then that would be okay. You could take her off. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>But the fact it\u2019s only until August, it\u2019s not for the year, and the license [is] issued for a year and we cannot issue the license for a 4 month period of time or with someone else\u2019s signature. Any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">Alan Greenwald: I\u2019d just like to try and understand precisely where the conflict is because there ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">Chairman Everhart: Let me say this. I\u2019ll tell you where the conflict is. It is the law. The law specifically states that the lease has to be for the year and that you\u2019re gonna have the license. The lease has to be to the following April at least or any extended period after that. It could be a 5 year lease. But the fact the lease is only good until August that you all have now, the existing lease ----we can\u2019t issue a license for a year for a lease that\u2019s only good for 4 months or well actually, I hope you understand that is the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Greenwald, who now held a power of attorney in connection with DeCourcy\u2019s Pub, LLC, argued that Turner did not have a sublease because the governing document was a \u201csales agreement.\u201d <em>See </em>p. 566, 23 A.3d at 325, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Later, Chairman Everhart told O\u2019Brien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">Well, like I say, the only thing is, in all fairness, the only thing we are telling ... The fact that she will be on until August and then you can, and we are gonna allow you to renew the license, even though technically you\u2019re not gonna be using them [sic ] until you do transfer them I guess. I don\u2019t know what your intent is now, but it doesn\u2019t matter. We are gonna allow you to renew the license so that\u2019s something that\u2019s gonna be in your favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">However, the Chairman was less optimistic when Greenwald made it clear that the pub wanted to renew without Turner\u2019s signature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">Chairman Everhart: We\u2019re gonna renew the application the same as it was before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">Alan Greenwald: Okay, with? If Mrs. Turner refuses to sign it, will you renew it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Chairman Everhart: Well, I didn\u2019t know you wasn\u2019t gonna be signing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">Sharon Turner: I\u2019m not signing it until I get some money. They owe me money and I\u2019m not signing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Eventually, Chairman Everhart advised the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">We\u2019re not gonna argue what\u2019s gonna happen or not happen. We\u2019re telling you that if you want to renew that license, our advice would be for you to renew it and she\u2019s gonna have to sign for you to renew it. It will be good until August and if you decide to stay there or even if you want to transfer the license, but you won\u2019t have a license to transfer if you don\u2019t renew the license, okay? Remember that. The other thing being, if you should decide do you even want to stay there, at the end of August you would have to have the approval of the owner of the building at that time or whoever you leased it to at that time to go over the same thing that you\u2019re doing now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">O\u2019Brien and Turner were unable to agree and no renewal application was filed by April 1, 2009. On May 27, 2009, more than two months after the March 25th meeting, O\u2019Brien and DeCourcy\u2019s Pub LLC filed suit against the Board in the circuit court. The <em>pro se </em>action was labeled both a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review\u201d at the top of the page and a \u201cPetition of Writ of Administrative Mandamus\u201d at the bottom. The filing also prayed for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> O\u2019Brien contended that the Board violated \u201c[a]dministrative [d]uties required by law,\u201d that its decision \u201cnot to act in a timely manner\u201d to transfer the license was arbitrary, capricious, \u201ca prejudicial abuse of authority\u201d and an \u201cunconstitutional deprivation of property.\u201d He also asserted that the Board \u201cmisapplied the law and its own regulations,\u201d because the licensee was \u201centitled to a fair transfer and renewal hearing\u201d before the license was \u201cdissolved.\u201d O\u2019Brien prayed for an \u201cinjunction ordering the immediate [t]ransfer and [r]enewal\u201d of the license and an \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>junction ordering the immediate removal\u201d of Turner\u2019s name off the license. O\u2019Brien also requested the Board to continue to \u201chold\u201d the license until the conclusion of this litigation and the Board agreed, even though a motion to stay its decision had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The parties skirmished over the inclusion in the record of a transcript of the July 9, 2008 Board meeting, whose minutes were not provided to O\u2019Brien until after the conclusion of the circuit court proceedings, but were included in the record on appeal without objection by the Board.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The circuit court initially declined to grant the Board\u2019s motion to \u201cdeny\u201d the petition for administrative mandamus. O\u2019Brien moved for summary judgement and the Board orally moved to dismiss at a September 25, 2009 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">On October 13, 2009, the circuit court denied the petition for administrative mandamus. In its opinion, the court described the Board\u2019s March 25, 2009 meeting as \u201cadvisory in nature\u201d and concluded that the Board \u201cnever issued a final order denying renewal of the license.\u201d It said that the petition for administrative mandamus was \u201cpremature in that the issues involved have never been resolved.\u201d The court said: \u201cThis Court can neither order the Board to make Ms. Turner sign off on the renewal application nor order Ms. Turner to sign off. It is not the proper forum.\u201d In addition, the court said that the action was untimely under the Maryland Rules because it was not filed within 30 days of the Board\u2019s March 25, 2009 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Finally, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">[T]he license in question lapsed on or about March 30, 2009, without any formal action taken by the Board. Without the Petitioner \u2014 Turner issue resolved, the license\u2019s status became jeopardized and lapsed. State law requires that a renewal application be accompanied by a statement signed by the owner of the premises consenting to renewal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>license. See Art. 2B, \u00a7 10-301(ii)(2) of the Alcoholic Beverages Section of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Further, State law requires a minimum one-year lease for renewal. See Art. 2B, \u00a7 10 \u2014 301(h)(3) of the Alcoholic Beverages Section of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Without the resolution of the condition precedent, i.e. the lease issue, the Board\u2019s hands were tied. The issue for all intents and purposes is moot. It is important to note that Petitioner addressed both the renewal and transfer of the license in his Petition and at the hearing; however it is clear under the law that the transfer of a license cannot occur until the renewal of the license occurs, and therefore we must only address the renewal of the license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Subsequently, O\u2019Brien filed a motion to alter or amend, which was denied. This appeal followed, in which O\u2019Brien is represented by counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">I. Did the trial court err in dismissing the petitioners\u2019 petition for administrative mandamus and in not compelling the respondent to comply with and adhere to its own rules and regulations regarding the petitioners\u2019 application for transfer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">II. Did the trial court err in denying and dismissing the petitioners\u2019 petition for administrative mandamus without the benefit of a complete and accurate record of the proceedings below when the respondent failed and refused to timely process the petitioners\u2019 timely filed application for transfer so as to deny the petitioners\u2019 due process of law with regards to their liquor license transfer rights rendering these actions arbitrary and capricious?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>III. Did the trial court err in docketing this action as an administrative appeal rather than as an administrative mandamus action?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The Board has also filed in this Court a motion to dismiss O\u2019Brien\u2019s appeal, thus raising these questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">I. Is this appeal allowed by the Maryland Rules and State law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">II. Should this appeal be dismissed for failure to comply with procedural requirements of the Maryland Rules?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">III. Should this appeal be dismissed as moot?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">I. Motion to Dismiss Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">The Board has launched a multi-pronged attack on O\u2019Brien\u2019s right to pursue this appeal. It contends that: 1) O\u2019Brien cannot prove that the Board inflicted injury to his legally protected rights, acted arbitrarily and capriciously or without substantive evidence; 2) there is no final order of the Board from which judicial review could have been sought; 3) O\u2019Brien seeks review of issues not presented at the administrative level; 4) mandamus is not an available remedy; 5) the contents of the record and record extract do not comply with the requirements of the Maryland Rules; and 6) the case has become moot because the license has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">In our view, a number of these contentions spill over into the merits of the case; others may be grounds to affirm, but not to dismiss the appeal; and the procedural objections are insufficient grounds for dismissal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The mootness issue\u2014 turning on whether the license has expired \u2014 is also colored by the merits of the appeal and is undercut to some degree by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the Board\u2019s acquiescence in putting the license \u201con hold\u201d until the conclusion of this litigation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For these reasons, we deny the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">II. Denial of Writ of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">To sort out the issues on this appeal, we need to narrow our focus on the precise nature of O\u2019Brien\u2019s hybrid claims and the statutory provisions and Board rules that affect the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">A. What is the nature of O\u2019Brien\u2019s claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">At the outset, it is important to note the key difference between: (1) an action or complaint for administrative mandamus and a petition for judicial review of agency action; and (2) administrative mandamus and traditional mandamus. A petition for judicial review under Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules is authorized when judicial review of an \u201corder or action\u201d of an agency is authorized by statute. Md. Rule 7-201(a). On the other hand, an administrative mandamus action is authorized to review a \u201cquasi-judicial order or action\u201d of an agency when review \u201cis not expressly authorized by law.\u201d Md. Rule 7-401(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The procedure for an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>for administrative mandamus mirrors those governing a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">A traditional mandamus action is of common law origin, but has been regulated in significant respects by the General Assembly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Among its many functions are compelling the performance of a ministerial duty by a public officer, <em>see Talbot County v. Miles Point Prop., LLC, et al., </em>415 Md. 372, 396-97, 2 A.3d 344 (2010), and enforcing the regulations of an administrative agency. <em>See </em>52 Am.Jur.2d <em>Mandamus, </em>\u00a7 124. In this sense, traditional mandamus has much in common with a mandatory injunction, which O\u2019Brien\u2019s petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>also expressly sought.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The distinctions between these causes of action are particularly relevant in a hybrid action such as this one. For example, if all or a portion of O\u2019Brien\u2019s case was a petition for judicial review or an action for administrative mandamus, a litigant would generally be required to go to court within 30 days of the agency order or action. Md. Rule 7-203(a) and Md. Rule 7-402(a). This clearly did not occur here. On the other hand, it is unlikely an action for traditional mandamus or mandatory injunction would have had to meet such a severe limitations period.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, in a proper case, traditional mandamus may be invoked to compel a board to consider a license application, although it ordinarily may not be used to require the granting of the license.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is also possible for traditional mandamus to be a remedy even when the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>action is not quasi-judicial; but this is not the case under the administrative mandamus rules. <em>Talbot County, </em>415 Md. at 394-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">With this background in mind, we will attempt to parse O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint and to place each component in the appropriate category. The \u201crefusal\u201d of the Board to approve the transfer of a license is judicially reviewable <em>by statute, viz., </em>\u00a7 16-101(a) of Article 2B.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Baltimore County Licensed Bev. Ass\u2019n. v. Kwon, </em>135 Md.App. 178, 185, 761 A.2d 1027 (2000). Thus, to the extent O\u2019Brien seeks to contest the Board\u2019s refusal to approve the transfer of his license, this contention is governed by the rules governing a petition for judicial review, including their timeliness requirements.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because a statute authorizes judicial review, administrative mandamus is not available on this issue.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">O\u2019Brien\u2019s contention that the Board erred in not <em>considering </em>his transfer application stands on a different footing. If the Board had no discretion to decline to address the issue, O\u2019Brien might have been entitled to traditional mandamus relief. This would also be true of the contention that the Board failed to \u201ctimely\u201d consider the transfer request, if the Board was mandated by law or rule to consider the matter within a certain time frame.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>B. Statutory Provisions and Board Rules</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Turning to the only claims of O\u2019Brien that are not time-barred, we note their viability turns on a proper reading of Board rules and the statutory provisions underlying them. In essence, would the rules and statutory provisions have required the Board to consider and rule on O\u2019Brien\u2019s transfer application before his license expired?</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Under \u00a7 10-206(a) of Article 2B, O\u2019Brien\u2019s license was set to expire on April 30, 2009. To obtain a transfer, he had to meet the same requirements for the granting of a new license. Art. 2B, \u00a7 10-503(a)(2)(iv). Under Board rules, all applicants for a license (including transfer applicants) have to appear in person before the Board (which met on Wednesdays) at the time the application is made. BLC-005. A notice of the application was required to be published two times in two successive weeks and a hearing \u2014 which the Board referred to as the final hearing \u2014 had to occur \u201cnot less than seven nor more than 30 days after the last publication.\u201d Art. 2B, \u00a7 10-202(a). State law sets no deadline for Board action on the transfer application.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Of particular relevance to this case are Board Rules BLC-007 (Transfer Application) and BLC-006 (Renewal Application). BLC-007(a) states: \u201cDue to the renewal process each year, no application for transfer will be accepted after the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Thursday in March to become effective prior to May 1st.\u201d Subsection (d) goes on to provide: \u201cAll obligations of the transfer (for licenses) contracted in connection with the business must be fully paid, or some arrangements concerning such debts and obligations, satisfied with his creditors, have been made.\u201d BLC-006 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">(a) Application for renewal of alcoholic beverages license must be filed with the Board of License Commissioners for Washington County at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of present license. Application filed April 2nd through April 11th shall be subject to a penalty of $100. Application filed on April 12th or thereafter shall be subject to a penalty of $400. [Article 2B, Section 10-301(o) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">(b) <em>No revision in licensees, classification, location, etc may be processed on a renewal application. All such revisions or application for transfer must be finalized by April 1st or after May 1st renewal has been issuefd]. </em>However, if the Board finds that the license holder is not qualified to obtain renewal of the existing class or type of license, they shall issue to him, by way of renewal, the class or type of license for which they find him qualified. If an expiring license is subject to any order of restriction or suspension, the new license shall be issued subject to said order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">(c) All State (Retail Sales, Employee Withholding, Amusement, and Admission) Municipal and County taxes must be paid before renewal license is issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">C. Was O\u2019Brien entitled to Traditional Mandamus Relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">O\u2019Brien\u2019s mandamus claim rises and falls on the basis of these rules of the Board. He asserts that he delivered the transfer application to the Board on Monday, March 2, 2009\u2014 three days before the first Thursday in March, the deadline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>established by BLC-007(a).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> He appears to argue that once that process has been triggered, if the two week period for publication of the notice of application is added to the 7-30 day period that precedes the public hearing, there would have still been time for the transfer to be approved before the April 30, 2009 date for the expiration of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">There are three major problems with this hypothetical. First, under BLC-005, O\u2019Brien was required to have an in-person presentation hearing on a Wednesday when the Board sat. Because there is no evidence this occurred, the process was never appropriately triggered.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Second, BLC-006 requires an application for transfer to a new location to be \u201cfinalized by April 1st or after [the] May 1st renewal has been issue[d].\u201d There was no likelihood that the transfer application could be finalized in that brief window.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> More importantly, there was no clear legal duty for the Board to finalize the transfer by April 1, 2009, because it had the discretion to set the final hearing up to 30 days after the last publication of the notice of application. Also, O\u2019Brien could not have taken advantage of the May 1st date specified in BLC-008, because that date is keyed to renewing the license \u2014 an action O\u2019Brien failed to take.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Third, the Board was not under a clear legal duty to consider or approve the transfer where O\u2019Brien had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>not satisfied Ms debts and obligations with Ms creditors as required by BLC-007(d). As far as this record is concerned, the evidence shows that the licensee had not satisfied his monetary obligations to Turner. In addition, the Board would have had to address the issue of whether the Turners now owned the license as a result of O\u2019Brien\u2019s defaults. <em>See </em>pp. 566, 23 A.3d at 325 and 568-69, 23 A.3d at 326-27, <em>supra. </em>In short, the swift transfer of the license was not guaranteed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that O\u2019Brien has not shown that he was entitled to a mandamus to require the Board to consider his transfer application prior to its expiration on April 30, 2009.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">III. Remaining Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">O\u2019Brien raises two additional questions which, in our view, have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>A. Defects in Administrative Record</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Appellants\u2019 primary complaint is that the transcript of the July 9, 2008 meeting of the Board was not available to or considered by the circuit court. Those minutes have been included in the record of the appeal. We have examined them and do not see how they would have changed the result in the circuit court. While Board members at the July 9, 2008 meeting seemed agreeable to O\u2019Brien\u2019s <em>filing </em>of a transfer application, nothing indicates that this is tantamount to <em>approval </em>of the application. In our view, the record was sufficiently complete for the circuit court and this Court to decide all the issues O\u2019Brien has presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">B. Docketing as a Petition for Judicial Review</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">O\u2019Brien also argues that the Clerk of Court erred in docketing this action as a petition for judicial review rather than an action for administrative mandamus. If the filing was erroneously docketed, O\u2019Brien shares the blame because he captioned his complaint as a Petition for Judicial Review. <em>See </em>pp. 573-74, , 23 A.3d at 329-30, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, because the procedure for handling such a petition and an action for administrative mandamus are virtually identical, we fail to see how O\u2019Brien has been harmed. Finally, his filing, whether treated as either of these causes of action, was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">For all of these reasons, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID THREE-FOURTHS BY APPELLANTS AND ONE-FOURTH BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">.

Prior to briefing and argument in this Court, appellants sought a writ of certiorari in the Court of Appeals, which was denied. <em>Decour-cy\u2019s Pub </em>v. <em>License Comm\u2019rs., </em>411 Md. 741, 985 A.2d 539 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b598-12\">. The Board argues that a certified copy of the docket entries is not found in the record in violation of Md. Rule 8-413(a). The record shows that this is simply incorrect. Although O\u2019Brien did not include a copy of the docket entries in his record extract, or a table of contents or filing dates of exhibits, these deficiencies are not of sufficient magnitude to prevent us from reaching the issues O'Brien has raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">. One possible ground for a finding of mootness might have been premised on \u00a7 10~504(a) of Article 2B, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">Except in Baltimore County, on the tenth day after the holder of any license issued under this article has vacated, or been evicted from the premises for which the license was issued, the license shall expire unless an application for approval of a transfer to another location or assignment to another person pursuant to \u00a7 10-504 of this article or an application pursuant to \u00a7 10-506 of this article has been approved or is then pending. However, the State Comptroller or local licensing board, as the case may be, may postpone the expiration for an additional period not exceeding 20 days in any case to avoid undue hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">It appears from the record, that at least by January 2009, O\u2019Brien had vacated or was evicted from the premises for which the license was issued, that no application for transfer was then pending and that the Board had not postponed expiration for undue hardship. However, because no party has argued or briefed the application of \u00a7 10-504(a), we will not <em>sua sponte </em>address mootness on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b599-12\">. Although the term, \u201cadministrative mandamus\u201d is relatively new in Maryland law, the Court of Appeals in <em>Talbot County v. Miles Point </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>Prop., LLC, </em>415 Md. 372, 394, 2 A.3d 344 (2010), indicated that the roots of the remedy go back to <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 379, 45 A.2d 73 (1945) (State courts have the inherent power to review arbitrary, illegal or capricious agency actions.) A call for reform in this area arose shortly after the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Board of License Comm'rs. v. Corridor Wine, </em>361 Md. 403, 761 A.2d 916 (2000), which wrestled with the question of which, if any, non-statutory mechanism for judicial review was available to challenge an interlocutory action of a liquor board. <em>See </em>Opinion: Mandamus and Certiorari: We need new rules, <em>Maryland Daily Record, </em>(Jan. 10, 2001) at 1C. This was followed by a recommendation by lawyer, legal writer and <em>Daily Record </em>Editorial Board member, Jack L.B. Gohn for wide-ranging reforms of the mandamus and certiorari rules. The proposal had a long gestation period in the Specific Remedies Subcommittee of the Rules Committee, where the original proposal was scaled back. In April of 2003, draft rules were submitted to the full Committee, which remanded them back to the subcommittee for more work. Finally, the present rules were approved by the Court of Appeals on November 8, 2005, to take effect January 1, 2006. Files of the Rules Committee indicate that the term \"administrative mandamus\u201d was taken from California law, without any intent to incorporate that state\u2019s elaborate caselaw on its version of this remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b600-6\">. The first mention of mandamus in a reported Maryland case was in 1709 in a decision of the Provincial Court. <em>Bordley v. Lloyd, </em>1 H. &amp; McH. 27 (1709). The common law remedy was also shaped by legislation. <em>See 9 </em>Anne C. 20 (1711); Chapter 90, <em>Laws of 1806; </em>Chapter 78, <em>Laws of1828; </em>Chapter 285, <em>Laws of 1858. </em>At one time, a whole article of the Maryland Code was devoted to mandamus \u2014 Article 60. In 1962, most of these provisions were repealed with the intention that mandamus would be governed by the Maryland Rules of Procedure. <em>See </em>chapter 36, <em>Laws of 1962. </em>The present provisions on mandamus are found in Maryland Rule 15-701. The remaining and often overlooked statutory provisions are found in Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 3-8B-01 and \u00a7 3-8B-02.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\">. In 1994, a proposal came before the Rules Committee to abolish mandamus and replace it with a petition for injunction. The suggested change was based in part on the 1937 action of the U.S. Supreme Court, which sought in Federal Rule 81(b) to abolish mandamus \u2014 a decision reversed in part by Congress\u2019s enactment in 1962 of the Federal Mandamus and Venue Act, 28 USC \u00a7 1361. After opposition to the 1994 recommendation by the Administrative Law Section of the Maryland State Bar Association, the proposed Maryland rule change was shelved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\">. Although it is unclear whether a general statute of limitations is applicable to a traditional mandamus action, <em>see George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. Allegany County Comm\u2019rs., </em>59 Md. 255, 262 (1883), laches clearly may be raised as a defense. <em>See e.g., Ipes v. Board of Fire Comm\u2019rs., </em>224 Md. 180, 167 A.2d 337 (1961). Laches may also be raised in an injunction action. <em>See Schaeffer v. Anne Arundel County, </em>338 Md. 75, 81-83, 656 A.2d 751 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">.

Section 16-101 (a) states: \"The decision of a local licensing board, in approving, suspending, revoking and restricting or refusing to approve, suspend, revoke or restore a license, or a licensee, shall be subject to appeal in the manner provided in this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\">. This also would have been true of the Board\u2019s \"refusal\u201d to issue a renewal license. This was an issue presented before the Board and in the circuit court, but not in this Court. In any event, for reasons stated at n. 26, <em>infra, </em>the Board did not err in not renewing O'Brien\u2019s license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\">. Because we conclude that administrative mandamus is not an available remedy here, we need not reach the troublesome issue of whether the action of the Board with respect to O\u2019Brien\u2019s licensing request was \"quasi-judicial.\u201d Although witnesses were sworn in at board meetings, the one held on March 25, 2009 appeared at times to be an informational meeting, rather than an adversary hearing with examination/cross-examination and the building of a record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b602-9\">. The last component of O\u2019Brien\u2019s petition in the circuit court was a request for a mandatory injunction. The apparent rejection of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>claim by the court is not challenged in appellants\u2019 brief. Thus, the issue is not before us. Even if it were, aside from a failure to demonstrate the elements of an injunction, O\u2019Brien would have faced formidable hurdles in obtaining an injunction. An injunction ordering transfer of the license would be duplicative or precluded by the remedy set forth in \u00a7 16-101(a) of Article 2B. <em>See McCully v. Radack, </em>27 Md.App. 350, 361, 340 A.2d 374 (1975); and <em>Buch, supra, </em>190 Md. at 402, 58 A.2d 672.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">. The Board\u2019s website, of which we take judicial notice, is more explicit about timeframes.

The only evidence in the record that O'Brien delivered the application was a statement to that effect in his verified complaint. The Board offered no evidence to counter this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\">. It is true that on July <em>9, 2008, </em>O'Brien and Greenwald discussed the proposed transfer with the Board, which appeared to be agreeable to the filing of the application. However, no application was filed at that time and a new LLC that would have been on the license had not been formed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\">. Perhaps, one of the reasons O\u2019Brien filed his application on a Monday, instead of a Wednesday, is because the later filing would have not have resulted in a 30-day window.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">. Although he challenged the failure to renew in the circuit court, O\u2019Brien has not made that contention here. Even if the issue were preserved, we see no error in the Board's insistence that Sharon Turner or William Martin as owners of the premises, sign on the renewal in accordance with \u00a7 10 \u2014 301 (a)(ii)3 of Art. 2B. This paragraph states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>In the case of retail dealers applying for renewal, the statement of consent by the owner of the premises may not be required if the owner has previously signed such a statement in connection with an original application or previous renewal application giving consent for the term of the owner's lease with the applicant <em>if the lease or</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"a-n-dedup-0\"><em>renewal does not expire during the term of the renewal license. </em>(Emphasis added). Because the lease/sublease agreement was set to expire in August of 2009 during the term of the renewal license, such consent was required here. O'Brien's belated attack on the validity of the sublease gets him nowhere. If the sublease were not valid, he would not have been entitled to a license in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. O'Brien, who had six meetings with the Board, does not advance his cause by packaging his claim as a due process violation. Under Maryland law, he had no vested property right in his license. Art. 2B, \u00a7 10-5 01 (a) (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided under this section, licenses issued under provisions of this article shall not be regarded as property or as conferring any property rights. All such licenses shall be subject to ... all rules and regulations that may be adopted as herein provided.\u201d) <em>See also Dodds v. Shamer, </em>339 Md. 540, 547, 663 A.2d 1318 (1995) (\"[A] liquor licensee possesses no constitutionally protected property right that would restrict the State or the State authorized licensing authority from exercising its plenary power over the licensee.\u201d) State law authorizes Board rules to restrict the grant or denial of an application. Even if O\u2019Brien had a property right in the license flowing from State law, <em>see Orgain v. City of Salisbury, </em>521 F.Supp.2d 465, 478, n. 39 (D.Md.2007), he was not free to ignore Board rules in asserting or maintaining that right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
