The agreement provided for a monetary purge which, if timely paid before the sentence commenced, would have discharged the contempt. Ms. Bradford was not represented by counsel at the time she signed the agreement. The Department then submitted the DSA to the circuit court, which, without holding a hearing, entered an order holding her in contempt and imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Appellant raises four issues which we have reordered, consolidated, and reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">I. Did the circuit court err in entering the order holding appellant in contempt and imposing a jail sentence without first determining whether appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">II. Was the parties\u2019 delayed sentencing agreement unenforceable as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">III. Did the lower court err in sentencing Ms. Bradford to thirty days incarceration, subject to a $250 purge, absent a finding, or evidence to support a finding, that she had the present ability to pay that purge?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">We conclude that the appeal is moot but that it is appropriate for us to consider appellant\u2019s arguments nonetheless. The circuit court erred in holding appellant in contempt and imposing a sentence of incarceration without first ascertaining that appellant had validly waived her right to counsel. In addition, the delayed sentencing agreement was unenforceable because it called for the imposition of an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">On September 26, 2006, Ms. Bradford was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $223.00 per month for two of her children, D.W. and C.W. Ms. Bradford was unable or unwilling to pay the required child support and was the subject of repeated enforcement proceedings. On June 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>2009, the Department filed the petition for contempt that eventually gave rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The petition alleged that Ms. Bradford was $2,870.59 in arrears as of May 26, 2009 and, among other relief, requested that the court \u201cfind Defendant in contempt,;] ... order the Defendant incarcerated for her willful contempt,;] ... [and] impose sanctions as [sic] the Defendant to satisfy said obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The petition was served on Ms. Bradford, together with a writ of summons requiring her to appear at a \u201cconciliation conference\u201d with the Department. The summons stated that, if the case was not resolved \u201cby entry of a Consent Order at the CONCILIATION CONFERENCE,\u201d she was required to appear before the circuit court for a hearing on the Department\u2019s petition. The summons also stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">You are entitled to be represented by an attorney at both the Conciliation Conference and before the Court. No attorney will be appointed to represent you. Failure to arrange for an attorney may be viewed as your waiver of the' right to counsel. If you are charged as being in Contempt of Court, you may be incarcerated, fined or both if it is determined at a hearing that you are indeed in Contempt. The Office of the Public Defender can provide you representation only in cases where you are alleged to be in Contempt of Court and you are financially unable to afford the services of a private attorney. If you wish to employ the services of the public defender. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Ms. Bradford had her conciliation conference with the Department on July 24, 2009. During the conference, and without the assistance of counsel, she signed the DSA at issue in this appeal. This document consists of a preprinted form with 21 numbered paragraphs containing blank spaces that were filled in either by Ms. Bradford or a representative of the Department. At the end of each paragraph was a space for Ms. Bradford to write either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in order to indicate her assent to statements contained in the paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Under the terms of the DSA, Ms. Bradford: (i) admitted that she was in contempt of court for failure to pay child support; (ii) waived her right for a hearing before a judge or master; (iii) waived her right to \u201ccall and confront witnesses, raise defenses [she] may have or object to defects in the State\u2019s case\u201d; (iii) acknowledged that she was entitled to be represented by an attorney and waived that right; and (iv) waived her right of appeal except to the \u201cissues of jurisdiction and whether this agreement was voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In addition, the DSA provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">15. Other than the conditions listed in paragraph 20 below has anyone made any promises or inducement for you to admit you are in Contempt for failing to pay child support?

Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">/s/ JB Initials</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">21. Do you understand that pursuant to the case of <em>Arrington v. Dept. of Human Resources, </em>402 Md. 79 [935 A.2d 432] (2008[2007]) you may have the right to assert at sentencing that you do not have the present ability to pay at that time. By entering into this agreement you are waiving that right and are asserting that you will have the present ability to pay on the date of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">Do you understand? Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">/s/ JB Initials</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">I further certify that I have the present ability to pay the purge provisions recited herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">7/24/09 /s/ Joanie Bradford</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">DATE DEFENDANT</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">(Underlining and strikeouts in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">On July 27, 2009, the circuit court entered an order that stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-15\">Upon consideration of the Delayed Sentencing Agreement entered into by the Defendant Joanie Bradford, it is this 27th day of July, 2009 hereby:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-16\">Ordered, that the Defendant Joanie Bradford be and hereby is adjudicated in willful contempt of this Court\u2019s Order of 9/26/06 by failing to pay support in accordance with its terms, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-17\">Ordered, that the Defendant is hereby sentenced to 60 days in the Washington County Detention Center, imposition of said sentence is delayed to Friday, October 23, 2009 at 8:30 AM. The defendant is hereby ordered to appear on that date and time and it is further:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-18\">Ordered, that the Defendant may purge [her]self of [her] contempt and thereby avoid incarceration on that date by [satisfying the purge provisions contained in Paragraph 20 of the DSA].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The docket entries in this case state that Ms. Bradford was \u201cfound in contempt\u201d on the date the circuit court signed the order. The docket entries do not indicate that Ms. Bradford was present or that the court held a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Ms. Bradford did not satisfy the purge provisions set forth in the DSA by the appointed date of October 23, 2009. On that day, she appeared without counsel before the circuit court. The court advised her of her right to counsel, which Ms. Bradford waived. She was sentenced to 60 days incarceration in the Washington County Detention Center, all of which was suspended. In addition, she was ordered to continue to pay $223 per month and her arrearage was determined to be $3,931.21. The court ordered that Ms. Bradford pay an additional $55.74 per month to reduce the amount of the arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Over the ensuing months, Ms. Bradford\u2019s performance of her obligations to pay child support was sporadic and at no time did she make the full payments called for in either the DSA or the court order of October 23, 2009. For reasons not relevant to the issues before us, the contempt proceeding against her was continued on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Finally, on March 12, 2010, the circuit court conducted a hearing which led to the entry of the order giving rise' to this appeal. By this time, Ms. Bradford was represented by counsel. At the hearing, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">[THE DEPARTMENT]: Next case, Your Honor, is State vs. Joanie Bradford. Civil 25059. Here for sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">THE COURT: Yes, Mr. Reed [Ms. Bradford\u2019s counsel],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, this is Ms. Bradford. I think she\u2019s already previously been found in contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">[THE DEPARTMENT]: That\u2019s correct. We are here for disposition .... she\u2019s here for sentencing on 60 days. Suggest that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>THE COURT: Okay. Just a second. All right, we\u2019re here on a DSA, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">[THE DEPARTMENT]: That\u2019s right. Sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">THE COURT: Sixty day sentence entered into on July 27th, 2009, and the amounts speak for themselves. What are the amounts now before I go through the litany?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">DSS WORKER: The arrears are $4307.91____The dunning is $656.40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">THE COURT: Six fifty six forty. And there have been any payments since July 27th, 2009?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">DSS WORKER: Yes, there have. The first payment was received in October for $9.23. In November, we received $18.46. In December, we received $113.94. January 2010, we received $125.32. . In February, we received $73.56. And today she paid $40.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">THE COURT: All right. Let the record reflect that the Delayed Sentencing Agreement ... [provided that] if she was out of compliance, a sixty day sentence would be executed on October 23rd, 2009. We have an Order of Court on October 23rd, 2009, ... that the sentence of sixty days was delayed to this date,, and it is suspended, and that, basically, the Defendant shall pay child support as previously ordered, and the arrears were established and earnings withholding orders____And so she\u2019s staring at sixty days. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">First, looking to the DSA, the circuit court determined that Ms. Bradford had consented to a sentence of sixty days incarceration subject to a $656.40 purge. During the hearing, Ms. Bradford was examined by her attorney, counsel for the Department and the court regarding her execution of the DSA. This testimony indicated that appellant had not completed tenth grade; could read and write \u201ca little\u201d; and had signed DSAs on two prior occasions. On each of these occasions, appellant had been represented by counsel; however, she testified that she had not discussed the contents of the DSAs with counsel before signing them. None of the questions propounded to her by either counsel or the court touched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>upon why she was not represented by counsel at the conciliation conference at which the DSA at issue in this appeal was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Ms. Bradford also testified that her previous child support payments had been made through a wage lien but that now, despite efforts to find employment, she was not currently working. She presented the court with what purported to be a log showing her efforts to find employment. Ms. Bradford stated that she was having trouble making ends meet and that she was trying to raise two children who currently lived with her. She testified that she had no money on her person or in any bank account in her name on that day, that she had nothing she could sell and that no one was holding any money or substantial asset of hers which she could use to pay her child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In closing, the Department argued that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">[Ms. Bradford] signed the agreement knowingly and stating, as part of the agreement, that she had the present ability to pay at that time. Now we\u2019re all going to play the <em>Arrington[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>card here and say, well, she doesn\u2019t have the present ability to pay at this time. But she is, evidently, making money, and she\u2019s making nominal payments. She\u2019s choosing that she gives forty dollars as opposed to what is required under the terms and conditions of the agreement. Of the one thousand three hundred ninety three dollars and seventy cents due and owing under [the DSA] ..., she\u2019s made seven hundred thirty seven dollars and thirty cents, leaving her compliance amount at six hundred fifty six dollars and forty cents. I think under the terms and conditions, she\u2019s shown an ability to continue to earn and make those payments. She\u2019s allocated them in that fashion. And she\u2019s chosen to support the children she has as opposed to this obligation. I think she has the ability to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Counsel for Ms. Bradford asserted that, under <em>Arrington, </em>the court could not infer her ability to pay and the court could not order a purge that she could not pay. He continued: And I think the language in <em>Arrington </em>is clear. It\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">unambiguous----[i]t\u2019s not proper in a civil proceeding to incarcerate somebody when they don\u2019t have the present ability as they sit there in court to meet the purge. It\u2019s just not. And whether or not, maybe it is a red herring to talk about whether she signed these agreements in the past or not. I think <em>Arrington, </em>when it came out, kind of made it clear to everybody, ... whether or not those agreements are proper at all, agreeing to future incarceration ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">At this point, counsel for the Department interrupted and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">[THE DEPARTMENT]: Objection, Your Honor. We\u2019re not here on a programmatic issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, you\u2019re asking for incarceration. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">[THE DEPARTMENT]: In this case. Not whether agreements generally are appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper at all, and <em>Arrington </em>addresses that head on____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-12\">THE COURT: Well, you know, [Defense Counsel], your office has come in here and argued this before with great eloquence. And I\u2019ve had people in your office, maybe even yourself, indicate that this issue is on appeal. And I haven\u2019t seen any decision. I mean, I\u2019ve read <em>Arrington, </em>but I thought that these so-called delayed sentencing agreements were a target for appeal. We were going to finally get a clarification on that. And I don\u2019t see any case concerning the delayed sentencing agreements as used by Washington County. I see what <em>Arrington </em>says, but it focuses on the present ability to pay. But I don\u2019t see, I mean, where is this struck down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, ... I know Your Honor\u2019s aware that we\u2019ve appealed decisions to incarcer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ate people under these things before and that people have been released as a result of those appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">THE COURT: Well, not as a result of, they\u2019ve been released, I think, pending the appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Oh, no. The Attorney General\u2019s Office consented to the dismissal of the case and release. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">THE COURT: Right. In other words, the appeal was not heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">THE COURT: All right. What do you want to say [Defense Counsel]? Go ahead. Put it on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Ms. Bradford\u2019s counsel proceeded to argue that the substantive terms of the DSA signed by Ms. Bradford were inconsistent with the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis in <em>Arrington. </em>He also argued that there was no evidence to support a finding that Ms. Bradford had any present ability to pay her purge. In rebuttal, the State did not address whether DSAs were consistent with <em>Arrington </em>but only argued that there was sufficient evidence for the court to reasonably infer that Ms. Bradford had the ability to pay the purge amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court addressed Ms. Bradford stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">[T]his is all fine legal argument, and I understand it.... I think you had the ability to pay to be more substantially compliant than you were. And, therefore, I\u2019m going to impose [incarceration], I\u2019m not going to give you sixty, I\u2019m going to give you thirty days. And what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to reduce the dunning or the purge to two hundred and fifty dollars. And I think that\u2019s reasonable. You may be receiving food stamps. You may be on medical assistance. That\u2019s a benefit. All right. And just to say, just because I\u2019m on food stamps, and I\u2019m getting medical assistance, that pro forma, makes me a non-resource. Well that isn\u2019t the case. So I feel that two hundred and fifty dollars is reasonable and she can pay it. She\u2019ll be in jail pending.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The circuit court entered an order imposing a sentence of thirty days confinement in the Washington County Detention Center to begin immediately, subject to the $250 purge. At the time, the circuit court found Ms. Bradford\u2019s child support payments to be in arrears of $4,307.91. Ms. Bradford\u2019s purge amount was subsequently paid by her husband and she was released from jail on March 15, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The State argues that the appeal should be dismissed on the grounds that it is moot. The State correctly asserts that Ms. Bradford did not appeal the July 21, 2009 order of the circuit court holding her in contempt and that her appeal of the March 12, 2010 order was mooted when the purge was paid and she was released from confinement. In support, the State cites <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 90, 935 A.2d 432; and <em>Chase v. Chase, </em>287 Md. 472, 473, 413 A.2d 208 (1980), both of which hold that, as a general proposition, an appeal of an order of contempt is moot if the contempt is purged.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Ms. Bradford concedes that her appeal is moot. Nonetheless, she suggests that this Court should address the issues raised in her appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">A case is moot when there is \u201cno longer an existing controversy when the case comes before the Court or when there is no longer an effective remedy the Court could grant.\u201d <em>Suter v. Stuckey, </em>402 Md. 211, 219-20, 935 A.2d 731 (2007) (citing, among other cases, <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Roth, </em>398 Md. 137, 143, 919 A.2d 1217 (2007)). Courts do not entertain moot controversies. <em>Suter, </em>402 Md. at 219, 935 A.2d 731. However, as Judge Zarnoch recently explained in <em>Sanchez v. Potomac Abatement, Inc., </em>198 Md.App. 436, 18 A.3d 100 (2011), there are circumstances in which appellate courts will address the merits of a moot case. The first is where the controversy, even though moot at the time of judicial review, \u201cis capable of repetition but evading review.\u201d 198 Md.App. at 443, 18 A.3d 100. The second exception \u201callows us to express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>our views on the merits of a moot case to prevent harm to the public interest.\" <em>Id. </em>at 443, 18 A.3d 100 (footnote omitted). The Court of Appeals applied the latter exception to reach the merits in <em>Arrington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The issue in that case was whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore City had the authority to confine \u201cfathers found in contempt for failure to comply with child support orders ... until such time as they obtain employment through a work release program or satisfy other conditions they are unable to meet in time to avoid the incarceration.\u201d 402 Md. at 91, 935 A.2d 432. Noting that such a practice could affect hundreds of fathers subject to child support orders in the City, the Court of Appeals concluded that appellate review was warranted because it was \u201curgent and imperative that the issue be resolved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 935 A.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Similar considerations are present in this case. While the number of affected persons may not be as large as in <em>Arring-ton, </em>DSAs are widely used in Washington County. <em>See </em>Assessment p. 27. Ms. Bradford also points to the fact that, when defendants in past proceedings involving DSAs appealed orders imposing jail sentences, the State agreed to release the defendant from confinement if the appeal was dismissed. The State does not contest this assertion. This practice, whatever its basis, makes it unlikely that questions as to the validity of DSAs will receive appellate review. As the circuit court\u2019s comments in Ms. Bradford\u2019s hearing make clear, there is a need for guidance from an appellate court on this issue. Under such circumstances, appellate review is warranted. <em>See, e.g., Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 92, 935 A.2d 432; <em>Suter, </em>402 Md. at 220-21, 935 A.2d 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Counsel for the State informed this Court in oral argument that the \u201cpractice in Washington County of filing delayed sentencing agreements has been terminated, ... it\u2019s just too problematic.... The Department has issued instructions to the local office in Washington County and they have indicated that they will comply.\u201d In response, however, Ms. Bradford\u2019s counsel represented to us that there are other child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>enforcement proceedings pending in Washington County that involve DSAs. The State did not question the accuracy of this contention. Thus, the State\u2019s prospective disavowal of DSAs does not entirely obviate the desirability of addressing the arguments raised by appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will address the merits of appellant\u2019s contentions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">At one time, the law of contempt in the context of support enforcement proceedings was an area with more than its fair share of \u201chaze and rubble.\u201d <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 92, 935 A.2d 432. Many of the uncertainties on this subject were clarified through the adoption of the current versions of Maryland Rules 15-201 through 15-208, which pertain to contempt proceedings. These rules have been explained, interpreted and applied in a series of decisions by the Court of Appeals, including <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 92-106, 935 A.2d 432; <em>Bryant v. Soc. Servs., </em>387 Md. 30, 46-50, 874 A.2d 457 (2005); and <em>Jones v. State, </em>351 Md. 264, 277-82, 718 A.2d 222 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(1998). Our task in this case is to apply this now well-developed body of law to the DSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">As Judge Wilner noted for the Court in <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 92, 935 A.2d 432, the universe of contempt proceedings is divided into four quadrants: direct and constructive contempt; and criminal and civil contempt. <em>See also Ashford v. State, </em>358 Md. 552, 563, 750 A.2d 35 (2000). Direct contempt is \u201ca contempt committed in the presence of the judge presiding in court or so near to the judge as to interrupt the court\u2019s proceedings.\u201d Rule 15-202(b). All other forms of contempt are constructive. Maryland Rule 15-202(a). An obligor\u2019s failure to pay court-ordered support payments can constitute constructive contempt. <em>Ashford, </em>358 Md. at 567, 750 A.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The precise delineation between criminal and civil contempt has been hard to draw at times. <em>See, e.g., State v. Roll and Scholl, </em>267 Md. 714, 728, 298 A.2d 867 (1973); <em>Winter v. Crowley, </em>245 Md. 313, 316-18, 226 A.2d 304 (1967). These difficulties do not concern us as there is no question that a failure to pay child support exposes the obligor to civil contempt and, under appropriate circumstances, criminal contempt proceedings. <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 98, 935 A.2d 432; <em>see also Dorsey and Craft v. State, </em>356 Md. 324, 350, 739 A.2d 41 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">There is a conceptual difference between civil and criminal constructive contempt proceedings. As the <em>Arrington </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">[A] civil contempt proceeding is intended to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to an action and to compel obedience to orders and judgments entered primarily for their benefit. Such a proceeding ... is remedial, rather than punitive, in nature, intended to coerce future compliance, and, accordingly, a penalty in a civil contempt must provide for purging. Conversely, the penalty in a criminal contempt proceeding is to punish for past misconduct, which may no longer be capable of remedy. That kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>of penalty is thus punitive in nature and does not require a purging provision but must be determinate.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"alf-dedup-0\">402 Md. at 93, 935 A.2d 432 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">There are distinct procedures for each action. If the State wishes to pursue criminal contempt proceedings because a party failed to abide by a support order, it must do so in a proceeding separate from the civil support proceeding. Rule 15-205(a). A defendant in a criminal contempt proceeding is entitled to \u201call common law, statutory, and constitutional safeguards for the criminally accused.\u201d <em>Ashford, </em>358 Md. at 570, 750 A.2d 35. This includes the obligation of the State to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, including (in a criminal contempt proceeding for failure to pay support) that the defendant\u2019s failure to pay was willful. <em>Id. </em>at 571-73, 750 A.2d 35. Any sentence imposed by the court must be determinate. Rule 15-207(d)(2). While the sentencing court may \u201cspecify any condition under which the sanction may be suspended, modified, revoked, or terminated,\u201d Rule 15-207(d)(2), a purging provision is not required in a sentence for criminal contempt. <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 93, 935 A.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">A party to a civil action may initiate a civil contempt proceeding to secure compliance with a court order. Rule 15-206. If the moving party seeks incarceration as a possible means of compelling compliance, the petition for contempt must so state. Rule 15-206(c)(l). In such a case, the defendant is entitled to counsel and must be properly informed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>his or her right to counsel. Rule 15 \u2014 206(c)(2); <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 98-106, 935 A.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In a civil contempt proceeding for failure to pay child support, the moving party must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the \u201calleged contemnor has not paid the amount owed....\u201d Rule 15-207(e)(2). Once this threshold has been met, the obligation shifts to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that one or more of the defenses set out in Rule 15 \u2014 207(e)(3) are present.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the court finds that the moving party has met its burden of proof and none of the defenses apply, it shall enter an order pursuant to Rule 15-207(e)(4), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">(4) Order. Upon a finding of constructive civil contempt for failure to pay spousal or child support, the court shall issue a written order that specifies (A) the amount of the arrear-age for which enforcement by contempt is not barred by limitations, (B) any sanction imposed for the contempt, and (C) how the contempt may be purged. If the contemnor does not have the present ability to purge the contempt, the order may include directions that the contemnor make specified payments on the arrearage at future times and perform specified acts to enable the contemnor to comply with the direction to make payments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The authority granted to a court to fashion both a sanction and a purge under Rule 15 \u2014 207(e)(4) is constrained because a defendant in a civil contempt proceeding \u201cmust have the ability to avoid both the commencement and the continuation of incarceration.\u201d <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 101, 935 A.2d 432 (citing <em>Jones, </em>351 Md. at 282, 718 A.2d 222). Any purge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>must be within the present ability of the defendant to perform at the time of sentencing. <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 101, 935 A.2d 432; <em>Bryant, </em>387 Md. at 48, 874 A.2d 457; <em>Jones, </em>351 Md. at 275, 718 A.2d 222. The reason for the rule lies in the coercive, as opposed to punitive, nature of sanctions in a civil contempt proceeding. <em>Jones, </em>351 Md. at 281, 718 A.2d 222 (\u201cIf a defendant is unable to pay a purge provision, no amount of time in prison will induce compliance.\u201d). Therefore, if the sanction is incarceration and the purge is the payment of money,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">the question will be whether the defendant is then, <em>on that day, </em>able to make that payment. The court may not order an incarceration to commence in the future, because the finding of ability to purge must be contemporaneous with when the incarceration is to commence and must remain in existence throughout the period of incarceration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 101, 935 A.2d 432 (citing <em>Jones, </em>351 Md. at 282, 718 A.2d 222) (italicized emphasis in original, underlined emphasis added); <em>see also Wilson, </em>364 Md. at 601-02, 774 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Because of the procedural and substantive law differences between civil and criminal contempt proceedings, it is \u201ccritical to keep in mind, as a most fundamental principle, that <em>it is impermissible in a civil contempt action \u2018to apply sanctions that are available only in a criminal contempt case.\u2019 \u201d Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 101, 935 A.2d 432 (quoting <em>Bryant, </em>387 Md. at 50, 874 A.2d 457) (Emphasis added in <em>Arrington.). </em>We now return to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Appellant challenges the DSA, and the court orders emanating from it, on two grounds. The first is that she signed the DSA, which in turn was the basis of the contempt order entered against her, without counsel and without effectively waiving her right to an attorney. Second, she asserts that the operative terms of the DSA were so far at variance with Maryland\u2019s law of civil contempt that we should conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>it was void and unenforceable. We will address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\n<em>A. The Right to Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in relying upon the DSA as a basis for entering the July 27, 2009 order finding her in contempt and imposing a sixty day jail sentence because appellant was not represented by counsel at the time the DSA was executed, and had not effectively waived the right to counsel pursuant to Rule lo-206(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Without otherwise addressing the issue, the State notes that this argument was not presented to the circuit court and is not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Under most circumstances, the scope of our review is limited to issues \u201craised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d Rule 8-131(a). Appellate courts, however, have the</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>discretion to consider an issue not raised in the court below. <em>Governor v. Washington Post, </em>360 Md. 520, 532 n. 5, 759 A.2d 249 (2000); <em>Gindes v. Khan, </em>346 Md. 143, 151, 695 A.2d 163 (1997). The nature of this review, and the circumstances under which it can appropriately be exercised, was examined by Judge Moylan in <em>Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 507-24, 837 A.2d 248 (2003). Review of an unpreserved issue may be appropriate when we are confronted by an issue that is likely to recur and for which appellate guidance would be desirable. <em>Burden v. Burden, </em>179 Md.App. 348, 355, 945 A.2d 656 (2008); <em>Morris, </em>153 Md.App. at 518-20, 837 A.2d 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">This is such a case. There are other support enforcement cases pending in Washington County involving DSAs. It is probable that at least some of these were executed by defendants under facts similar to those in this case. The comments of the circuit court at Ms. Bradford\u2019s hearing certainly suggest that there is a need for guidance. We will exercise our discretion and address Ms. Bradford\u2019s contention. We conclude that the circuit court failed to comply with Rule 15-206(e) and that this failure rendered its entry of the order holding appellant in contempt erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Because the Department\u2019s petition to hold Ms. Bradford in contempt sought her incarceration, she was entitled to representation by counsel. <em>Zetty v. Piatt, </em>365 Md. 141, 159, 776 A.2d 631 (2001); <em>Jones, </em>351 Md. at 273-74, 718 A.2d 222; <em>Redmond v. Redmond, </em>123 Md.App. 405, 415, 718 A.2d 668 (1998); <em>Fields v. Fields, </em>74 Md.App. 628, 633-34, 539 A.2d 708 (1988). Concomitant with a defendant\u2019s right to counsel is the court\u2019s obligation to advise a defendant of that right and to assure itself that, if the right is waived, it is done so knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Zetty, </em>365 Md. at 159, 776 A.2d 631; <em>Fields, </em>74 Md.App. at 633-34, 539 A.2d 708. Maryland Rule 15-206(e) implements this policy. <em>Redmond, </em>123 Md.App. at 416, 718 A.2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In the DSA, Ms. Bradford admitted that she was in contempt of court, agreed that she had the present ability to pay her child support obligation and address her arrearage, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>consented to a sixty day jail sentence if she failed to do so. While the DSA recited that Ms. Bradford waived her right to an attorney at the conciliation conference, there was nothing in the DSA that suggests that her waiver was knowing or voluntary. On July 27, 2009, based solely upon the DSA, the court held Ms. Bradford in contempt and imposed a sentence, without first providing the advisement required under Rule 15-206(e). Indeed, because the court did not hold a hearing, it made no inquiry whatsoever into whether appellant\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">If, instead of signing the DSA, Ms. Bradford had appeared in court and consented to the July 27, 2009 order, Rule 15-206(e)(2) would have required the court to assure itself that she received a notice pursuant to Rule 15-206(c)(2)(C),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>she had not, to advise her of the notice\u2019s contents. If, in this hypothetical court proceeding, Ms. Bradford had indicated a desire to waive counsel, the circuit court would have been required to \u201cdetermine, after an examination of the alleged contemnor on the record, that the waiver is knowing and voluntary.\u201d Rule 15-206(e)(2)(B). The circuit court\u2019s failure to do so would have mandated vacating the order. <em>Redmond, </em>123 Md.App. at 417, 718 A.2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Returning to the case before us, there was no court appearance when the order was signed; instead, Ms. Bradford signed the DSA at the conciliation conference. Rule 15-206(e)(l) states \u201c[t]his section applies if incarceration is sought and <em>applies only to court hearings before a judge.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Ms. Bradford acknowledges that she did not sign the DSA in a court proceeding before a judge but suggests that this should not be held against her because the DSA process was designed by the Department to avoid a court proceeding. There is merit to her argument but there is another reason why, despite the language in subsection (1), Rule 15-206(e) should apply to this case. A very brief review of some of the history of the rule is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Before 2000, Rule 15-206(e)(l) stated that the rule applied to any constructive civil contempt proceeding \u201cif incarceration to compel compliance is sought.\u201d At that time, pursuant to what was then Rule 9-207(g), civil contempt petitions in support enforcement matters, including those seeking incarceration, were routinely referred to masters. By its terms, Rule 15-206(e) applied to such proceedings. The Public De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>fender, however, refused to provide representation to indigent persons in master\u2019s proceedings. <em>Thrower v. Support Enforcement, </em>358 Md. 146, 149 n. 2, 747 A.2d 634 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In 2000, the Rules Committee proposed changes to Rule 15-206(e)(1) together with amendments to what was then Rule 9-207(g) (now Rule 9-208(d)). The Reporter\u2019s Note to the proposed amendment to Rule 15-206(e) stated that \u201cthe two rule changes ensure that when incarceration of the alleged contemnor is a possibility, the matter will be heard by a judge rather than by a master.\u201d 27 Md. Reg. 26 (January 14, 2000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Thrower, </em>358 Md. at 149 n. 2, 747 A.2d 634, the Court of Appeals discussed the amendments to the two rules, which were pending before the Court when the case was decided. The <em>Thrower </em>Court identified two reasons for the rule changes. First, the amendments would eliminate administrative problems caused by the Public Defender\u2019s refusal to provide representation to indigent respondents in proceedings before masters. <em>Id. </em>The second, and more fundamental reason for the rule changes was that \u201cas a <em>matter of sound judicial policy, incarceration should be ordered only by a judge on a record developed before the judge.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">An intended effect of the 2000 amendments was to make civil contempt proceedings involving possible incarceration the exclusive province of judges. There is nothing in the rule, or its history, that suggests that a determination as to whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was knowing and voluntary could be made by a support enforcement worker or anyone other than a judge. For a court to find appellant in contempt and impose a sentence of incarceration based solely upon the DSA, without an independent inquiry by the court as to whether appellant voluntarily and knowingly waived her right to counsel, would stand the purpose of Rule 15-206(e) on its head. The circuit court erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\n<em>(2) Illegal Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Ms. Bradford also contends that the DSA is void and unenforceable because it provided for the imposition of an illegal sentence. The State does not address appellant\u2019s arguments on this score; rather it contents itself with the assertion that the circuit court\u2019s findings at the hearing resulting in Ms. Bradford\u2019s incarceration were not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Once again, we agree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">When the circuit court found Ms. Bradford in contempt on July 27, 2009, it sentenced her to a jail sentence of sixty days, to begin on October 23, 2009. While the order provided that Ms. Bradford could avoid incarceration by addressing her support arrearages prior to the latter date, it did not provide a purging mechanism after incarceration was to begin. It was a determinate sentence without a post-confinement purge provision, a sentence reserved for criminal contempt proceedings. Thus, the July 27, 2009 order effectively imposed a criminal sanction, and, to boot, imposed it to begin in the future. Such a sentence is illegal in a civil contempt proceeding and is manifestly irreconcilable with the Court of Appeals\u2019 clear teaching in <em>Arrington, </em>402 Md. at 101, 935 A.2d 432. Even though Ms. Bradford signed the DSA (albeit without counsel), a defendant cannot consent to an illegal sentence. <em>Bryant, </em>387 Md. at 42, 874 A.2d 457; <em>Holmes v. State, </em>362 Md. 190, 195-96, 763 A.2d 737 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In addition, when the circuit court held appellant in contempt on July 27, 2009, it did not inquire whether she had the present ability to satisfy the purge it imposed at that time, because it did not hold a hearing. We place no significance whatsoever in the DSA\u2019s recitation that appellant had the present ability to satisfy the purge. She was not represented by counsel when she signed the DSA, and nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>record suggests that she had such an ability at any point in this proceeding.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In <em>Human Relations v. Dept. of Parks, </em>166 Md.App. 33, 47, 887 A.2d 64 (2005), this Court considered an analogous situation involving a consent judgment entered on the basis of a settlement agreement that was <em>ultra vires </em>as to one of the parties, and held that the judgment was void and unenforceable. The DSA itself called for the imposition of an illegal sentence and was unenforceable for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">As the initial order holding appellant in contempt of court was entered in error, it is not necessary for us to consider whether the circuit court erred in the March 12, 2010 hearing. The State argues that, because the circuit court modified the sentence imposed by its earlier order and reduced the purge amount, any previous infirmity was cured. We cannot agree with this proposition because, at that hearing, the circuit court did not address the underlying issue of whether Ms. Bradford was in contempt in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In conclusion, errors by the circuit court, and defects in the DSA itself, would have justified reversing the orders holding appellant in contempt and sentencing her to incarceration had this appeal not been moot. However, the fact remains that Ms. Bradford\u2019s husband paid the modified purge amount imposed by the circuit court at the conclusion of the March 12, 2010 hearing. Thus, her appeal is moot and our mandate must reflect this reality. <em>Cottman v. State, </em>395 Md. 729, 748, 912 A.2d 620 (2006); <em>Sanchez, </em>198 Md.App. at 444 n. 5, 18 A.3d 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.
