Gore refused to pay U.K. Construction the final installment payment, alleging that several items on the punch list still needed attention. In late 2008, after court-ordered arbitration, the arbitrator found in favor of U.K. Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">On September 1, 2009, Gore filed a petition to compel arbitration in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, again alleging defective work by U.K. Construction. U.K. Construction maintained that the issues had already been addressed in the prior arbitration, that the arbitration award constituted a final judgment, and that it was contrary to the principles of res judicata to re-litigate matters already covered. The court issued an order on November 25, 2009, denying Gore\u2019s petition and granting U.K. Construction\u2019s motion for sanctions. On December 4, 2009, Gore filed a motion for reconsideration. The court scheduled a motions hearing and subsequently reversed the November 25th ruling, instead granting Gore\u2019s petition to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">U.K. Construction noted a timely appeal to this Court, asking us to determine whether the circuit court erred in granting Gore\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we reverse the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">On August 10, 2007, the parties entered into a contract for the renovation of a property owned by Gore at 2200 Brookfield Road, Baltimore, Maryland. U.K. Construction is a general contractor licensed in the State of Maryland to perform home improvement work. Gore obtained a renovation loan in connection with the Contract from SunTrust Bank, after Sun-Trust Bank had approved U.K. Construction as the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The Contract stipulated that U.K. Construction was to be paid a total sum of $202,800.00 in installment payments according to a draw schedule. There were five scheduled draws. The Contract provided for certain guarantees of materials and workmanship, including that provided by subcontractors, and included a warranty for one year from the date of final acceptance of the work. The job proceeded without incident and four of the five scheduled draws were submitted and paid. Gore refused to pay the final installment totaling $40,720.00, claiming that several punch list items were deficient. Before U.K. Construction was given the opportunity to take action on the items, Gore locked them out and hired other contractors. Gore then obtained a certificate of occupancy from the city of Baltimore to certify that the work had been completed, refinanced the property with another mortgage lender, and paid off SunTrust Bank. Gore never paid U.K. Construction the final installment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Paragraph 12 of the Contract required that any and all disputes be settled via binding arbitration and stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>decision of the arbitrator would be final and binding on the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 27, 2008, U.K. Construction filed a petition to compel arbitration and to appoint an arbitrator, in the circuit court. The court granted U.K. Construction\u2019s request, and on August 18, 2008, it ordered that Robert L. Ferguson, Jr. Esq. be \u201cappointed to adjudicate the substantive issues\u201d in this matter (\u201cprior arbitration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">On October 22, 2008, the parties attended the arbitration hearing, which lasted approximately eight hours.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After hearing all the evidence and arguments from both attorneys, Ferguson ruled in favor of U.K. Construction and issued a detailed opinion, dated November 25, 2008, and a supplemental opinion dated December 12, 2008. The arbitrator considered all outstanding rights and obligations under the Contract and found in favor of U.K. Construction, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">I regard [Gore\u2019s] conduct, changing the lock, not cooperating with Plaintiff for a final inspection of the Property by the City, obtaining an occupancy permit on her own and obtaining a mortgage loan to pay off the construction loan without paying Plaintiff, as a repudiation of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ast\">The arbitrator also found that despite Gore having introduced evidence that she incurred expenses in excess of $85,000 while trying to fix U.K. Construction\u2019s work,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> those repairs \u201cshould have been pursued as warranty work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Following the arbitration award, Gore did not exercise her right to vacate or modify the award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 29, 2008, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>after Gore failed to make any payments under the award, U.K. Construction filed a petition to confirm arbitration award as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>judgment with the circuit court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 2, 2009, the court dismissed the petition with prejudice. Gore subsequently entered into a promissory note with U.K. Construction to pay off all monies due under the arbitration award via installment payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On February 13, 2009, approximately two months after receiving an unfavorable result in the prior arbitration, Gore filed a complaint against U.K. Construction with the Maryland Home Improvement Commission (\u201cMHIC\u201d), alleging the same defective workmanship that had been heard during the arbitration. U.K. Construction informed MHIC that the matter had already been adjudicated via arbitration. MHIC took no action.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">On September 1, 2009, Gore filed a petition to compel arbitration in the circuit court, alleging that \u201cmuch of the work performed by [U.K. Construction] on the property was done in an unworkmanlike manner and is in breach of the express and implied warranties of the [Contract]\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>. On September 24, 2009, U.K. Construction filed a response in opposition to appellee\u2019s petition to compel arbitration, arguing that the issues raised in Gore\u2019s petition had already been addressed in the prior arbitration and it was therefore contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>principle of res judicata to re-litigate those issues. As such, U.K. Construction concluded that \u201cMs. Gore\u2019s Petition to Compel Arbitration is [merely] an attempt to claw back some of the money she was ordered to pay [U.K. Construction] at the earlier arbitration hearing. Ms. Gore\u2019s actions are in bad faith, a waste of this court\u2019s time and resources, as well as incurring unnecessary legal fees to [U.K. Construction].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">On September 24, 2009, U.K. Construction also filed a motion for sanctions, reiterating its position that Gore\u2019s petition was filed \u201cin bad faith and without substantial justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On November 25, 2009, the court denied Gore\u2019s petition and granted U.K. Construction\u2019s motion for sanctions. On December 4, 2009, Gore filed a motion for reconsideration and requested a hearing. After hearing argument on January 19, 2010, the court vacated its November 25th order, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABl\">Well, it appears to this Court that it\u2019s unfair to the petitioner in this case to have paid on something that she\u2019s not satisfied with. It appears to this Court that the petitioner has a claim for breach of warranty whether it gets interposed or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Without acknowledging the prior arbitration, the court then stated that \u201c[t]he petition to compel arbitration is granted in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">An order granting an application to compel arbitration is a final appealable order. <em>See Freedman v. Comcast Corp., </em>190 Md.App. 179, 190-91, 988 A.2d 68 (holding that an order compelling arbitration was a final appealable judgment), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 Md. 39, 997 A.2d 790 (2010); <em>Rourke v. Amchem Prods., Inc., </em>153 Md.App. 91, 107, 835 A.2d 193 (2003) (stating that a circuit court\u2019s order to compel arbitration, per an arbitration clause in a written agreement, is a final appealable judgment), <em>aff'd, </em>384 Md. 329, 863 A.2d 926 (2004) . Thus, in the instant case, the circuit court\u2019s January 19, 2010 order, entered on January 27, 2010, was a final order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>governed by Md.Code (1973, 2006 RepLVol.) Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 12-301, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">... a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court, the right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">As a general rule, a circuit court\u2019s decision as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration is a matter of contract interpretation and is reviewed <em>de novo. Walther v. Sovereign Bank, </em>386 Md. 412, 422, 872 A.2d 735 (2005) (citing <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank F.S.B., </em>363 Md. 232, 250, 768 A.2d 620 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">I. Res Judicata is applicable where the arbitration has the elements of an adjudicatory procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\u201cRes judicata, or the doctrine of claim preclusion, \u2018bars the relitigation of a claim if there is a final judgment in a previous litigation where the parties, the subject matter and causes of action are identical or substantially identical as to issues actually litigated and as to those which could have or should have been raised in the previous litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monarc Constr., Inc. v. Aris Corp., </em>188 Md.App. 377, 388, 981 A.2d 822 (2009) (quoting <em>R &amp; D 2001, LLC v. Rice, </em>402 Md. 648, 663, 938 A.2d 839 (2008)) (emphasis omitted). To invoke the doctrine, three elements must be present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">(a) the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier litigation; (2) the claim presented in the current action is identical to that determined or that which could have been raised and determined in the prior litigation; and (3) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-11\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>R &amp; D 2001, LLC, supra, </em>402 Md. at 663, 938 A.2d 839).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>As a preliminary matter, res judicata is applicable to the instant case even though the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d at issue is an arbitral award and not a judicial decision. Although the appellate courts of this State have addressed this issue fugaciously, they have not done so squarely. Indeed, prior Maryland case law forecasts the ruling we make in this case by stating that, under certain conditions, a \u201cfinal award of arbitration should be given the same res judicata effect as a judgment of a court.\u201d <em>Ewing v. Koppers Co., </em>312 Md. 45, 57, 537 A.2d 1173 (1988). <em>See also Batson v. Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 602 A.2d 1191 (1992)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. Other jurisdictions have adopted this position. <em>See Ernst &amp; Young, LLP v. Tucker ex rel. Health-South Corp., </em>940 So.2d 269, 286 (2006) (stating that \u201cthe doctrine of [res judicata] applies to arbitration proceedings that follow rulings in judicial proceedings\u201d); <em>Camargo v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., </em>86 Cal.App.4th 995, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 841 (2001) (stating that \u201c[res judicata] is appropriately applied to arbitration as a matter of policy where the arbitration had the elements of an adjudicatory procedure\u201d); <em>Epoxy Sys. Inc. v. Kjellstrom </em>&amp; <em>Lee, Inc., </em>29 Va. Cir. 263, 264 (Va.Cir.Ct.1992) (deciding that \u201cres judicata applies to arbitration awards\u201d); <em>James L. Saphier Agency, Inc. v. Green, </em>190 F.Supp. 713, 719 (S.D.N.Y.1961) (Once a final and binding award has been made, all issues settled by that award are no longer subject to further litigation or arbitration.), <em>aff'd, </em>293 F.2d 769 (2nd Cir.1961). <em>But see LaSalla v. Doctor\u2019s </em>Assoc., <em>Inc., </em>278 Conn. 578, 898 A.2d 803, 815 (2006) (holding that arbitrators need not give res judicata effect to a prior arbitration award unless the parties agree otherwise). <em>See generally </em>G. Richard Shell, <em>Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel Effect of Commercial Arbitration, </em>35 UCLA L.Rev. 623 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Specifically, the Court in <em>Ewing, supra, </em>312 Md. at 57, 537 A.2d 1173, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The general rule suggested by \u00a7\u00a7 83 and 84 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments (1982)[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] is that a valid and final award of arbitration should be given the same res judicata effect as a judgment of a court if the procedure leading to the arbitration award embraced elements of adjudicatory procedure consistent with established principles of due process, and if according preclusive effect would not be incompatible with a legal policy or contractual requirement that the second tribunal be free to make an independent determination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">When arbitration affords opportunity for presentation of evidence and arguments substantially similar in form and scope to judicial proceedings, the award should have the same effect on issues necessarily determined as a judgment has.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">(Quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments, \u00a7 84, cmt. c). Whereas here, neither party contests that it was \u201cafford[ed][an] opportunity for presentation of evidence and arguments substantially similar ... to judicial proceedings,\u201d we conclude that, as a threshold matter, the doctrine of res judicata is applicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">II. Applying Res Judicata to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Whether an arbitral award should be given preclusive effect under res judicata is determined by applying the following factors, otherwise known as the \u201cExxon test:\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>(1) whether the [arbitrator] was acting in a judicial capacity; (2) whether the issue presented to the district court was actually litigated before the [arbitrator]; and (3) whether its resolution was necessary to the [arbitrator\u2019s] decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><em>Batson, supra, </em>325 Md. at 701, 602 A.2d 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In applying general principles of res judicata, U.K. Construction argues that Gore\u2019s petition is barred by res judicata because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">[i]n this case a successful prosecution of the second action, namely the Appellee\u2019s claim for breach of contract, would impair the rights of the Appellant established in the Prior Case, because in the prior case, the Arbitrator necessarily found that the appellant had the right to rescind the contract following material breach by the appellee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">. Gore responds by arguing that U.K. Construction has already \u201cobtained a favorable award and [she] made full restitution to [U.K. Construction]\u201d and therefore \u201cany award in [her] favor for breach of warranty in a subsequent arbitration proceeding would not, and in fact could not, nullify the prior award as [U.K. Construction] had been fully paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In ascertaining whether the resolution of an issue actually litigated was \u201cnecessary for the arbitrator\u2019s decision,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the third factor of the \u201cExxon test,\u201d the Court of Appeals has explained that \u201ca factual issue is necessary to the determination only if its resolution is required to support to judgment entered in the prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Batson, supra, </em>325 Md. at 707-08, 602 A.2d 1191 (citation omitted). In our analysis, one of the \u201cfactual issue[s]\u201d upon which Gore\u2019s petition hinges\u2014 whether she prevented U.K. Construction from making the repairs \u2014 was resolved at the \u201cprior proceeding,\u201d and that resolution was \u201crequired to support the judgement entered at the prior proceeding.\u201d We therefore agree with appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>contention that Gore\u2019s petition is barred under res judicata. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">At the arbitration hearing, Arbitrator Ferguson gave the following explanation as to why he found that it was Gore who breached the contract and not U.K. Construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">Mr. Okoro\u2019s expression that he did not want to discuss it any more was not in and of itself sufficient to constitute a repudiation of the contract, particularly in light of his outstanding offer to address many of the items on the punch list, and his indication that he was intending to continue working on her zoning appeal. <em>I regard [Gore\u2019s] conduct, changing the lock, not cooperating with Plaintiff for a final inspection of the Property by the City, obtaining an occupancy permit on her own and obtaining a mortgage loan to pay off the construction loan </em>without paying Plaintiff, <em>as a repudiation of the contract.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The factual finding that Gore \u201cchang[ed] the lock[s]\u201d and hired a different construction company to finish the work is dispositive of Gore\u2019s present petition alleging that \u201cmuch of the work performed by [U.K. Construction] on the Property ... is in breach of the express and implied warranties of the agreement.\u201d It is pellucid that a plaintiff may not assert a claim for breach of warranty against a defendant whom he has denied the opportunity to correct the defect.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Tamara Mcnulty, Maryland Construction Law 180 (2007) (\u201cWhere a contractor performs defective work the owner is entitled to the reasonable costs to correct the defective work. The owner, however, under the terms of most construction contracts must give the contractor notice of the incomplete or defective work and opportunity to cure before it will be entitled to complete or correct the work itself.\u201d); Troy Michael Miller, Construction Checklists 92 (2008) (\u201cThe right to cure is a fundamental contractor right.\u201d). <em>See also Murphy v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>24th St. Cadillac Corp., </em>121 Md.App. 454, 460, 710 A.2d 332 (1998) (\u201cIf any warranty established pursuant to those Title 2 provisions (i.e. the implied warranty of merchantability, express warranties, an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose) are violated, ... the lessee [must] give notice of the defect to the lessor, factory branch, authorized dealer, or manufacturer by certified mail, return receipt requested, and to allow the lessor, factory branch, authorized dealer, or manufacturer an opportunity to fix the defect.\u201d)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; <em>Quillen v. Kelley, </em>216 Md. 396, 401-02, 140 A.2d 517 (1958) (\u201c[W]here the vendee fails to fulfill the contract without lawful excuse, he cannot recover the payment if the vendor be ready and willing to perform his part of the contract\u201d); <em>Evergreen Amusement Corp. v. Milstead, </em>206 Md. 610, 621-622, 112 A.2d 901 (1955). <em>See also Schneider v. Saul, </em>224 Md. 454, 168 A.2d 375 (1961); <em>American Towing &amp; Lightering Co. v. Baker-Whiteley Coal Co., </em>111 Md. 504, 523, 75 A. 341 (1909) (stating the \u201csettled doctrine that [a plaintiff] cannot ... recover ... unless it shows that it has performed its part of the contract\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>is certainly so where, as here, the defendant expresses a willingness to make the repairs and, nonetheless, the plaintiff elects to make the repairs herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Arbitrator Ferguson, in his decision, gave the following explanation as to why Gore\u2019s \u201cchanging the locks and completing the work herself\u2019 would be relevant to Gore\u2019s breach of warranty claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">For the most part, the punch list provided by [Gore] described items which constitute alleged deficiencies in the work.... These would ordinarily be taken care of under the warranty by [U.K. Construction] having its subcontractors correct the work or making its own repairs. Plaintiff was entitled to the opportunity to fulfill its warranty obligations .... [Gore]\u2019s costs to repair or replace <em>should have been pursued as warranty work first giving [U.K. Construction] the opportunity to make corrections found to be necessary using [its] contractors.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">(Emphasis added). By denying U.K. Construction the \u201copportunity to make corrections,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Gore relieved U.K. Construction from its obligation to do so, and fatally impaired her breach of warranty claim with respect to the defects at issue. Gore cannot now unring that bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">In light of the foregoing, the \u201cfactual issue\u201d underpinning Gore\u2019s present petition-whether she denied UK Construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the ability to make the repairs-was resolved at the \u201cprior proceeding\u201d (in U.K. Construction\u2019s favor) and such resolution was \u201cnecessary\u201d for the arbitral decision reached in that proceeding. Accordingly, relitigating the issue is barred under the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Furthermore, Gore\u2019s argument \u2014 that \u201cany award in [her] favor for breach of warranty in a subsequent arbitration proceeding ... could not nullify the prior award as [U.K. Construction] had been fully paid\u201d \u2014 is without merit. By claiming that U.K. Construction breached the warranty provisions in the contract, Gore implicitly seeks to, as U.K. Construction puts it, \u201cclaw back some of the money she was ordered to pay U.K. Construction at the earlier arbitration hearing.\u201d Gore cannot avoid the res judicata effect \u201cby carefully drafting a complaint to avoid explicitly asking this Court to void or nullify the prior judgment.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. Citicorp Credit Servs., Inc., </em>665 F.Supp.2d 518, 526 (2009). For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant Gore\u2019s petition and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY IS REVERSED.
