Did the trial court improperly instruct on transferred intent and kill zone, two theories inapplicable to the first and second degree murder charges in this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On the evening of July 15, 2007, Maurice White and Wayne White were shot and killed in a field near Wayne\u2019s apartment building on Radecke Avenue in Baltimore, Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Witnesses testified that appellant shot Maurice in the head, and he then began shooting at the car that Wayne\u2019s girlfriend, Taj ah Flemming, was driving with their eight-month-old son in the backseat.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sean White, who had been standing near the driver\u2019s side door of his car, which was parked near Ms. Flemming\u2019s car, jumped into Ms. Flemming\u2019s passenger seat. As appellant continued shooting at Ms. Flemming\u2019s car, Wayne began running toward the car, shouting for appellant to stop shooting because Wayne\u2019s son was in the car. Appellant shot Wayne in the leg, and another shooter, later identified as Charlie Stevenson, came from the back of a building and shot Wayne several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On August 6, 2007, appellant was indicted, in seven separate indictments, on charges of first and second degree murder of Wayne and Maurice, attempted first and second degree murder, as well as first degree assault, of Taj ah Flemming, Sean White, and Khalee White, and related charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">A. Motions Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">On June 29, 2009, the circuit court held a pre-trial motions hearing. The State made a motion in limine to bar appellant from questioning any of its witnesses regarding any prior arrests. Counsel for appellant objected, noting that one of the State\u2019s witnesses, Sean, had an agreement with a judge about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>a pending charge, and arguing that there was \u201csome question about ... that agreement and his testimony.\u201d The court inquired of the State whether the witness was testifying in the matter pursuant to a deal, and the State responded that there was no deal. The prosecutor explained that Sean had requested release from jail pending a violation of probation (\u201cVOP\u201d) hearing because his brother had been murdered and the witness was scared in jail. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the witness had received favorable treatment when he was released pending the VOP hearing, noting that most individuals are incarcerated pending such hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The court stated that there was no evidence of any quid-pro-quo between the witness and the VOP judge, and it appeared that the witness was released because it would be safer for him to be at home because of his involvement in appellant\u2019s trial. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the VOP judge was waiting to hold the witness\u2019 hearing until after Sean testified at appellant\u2019s trial, noting that he had agreed to testify, whereas many victims will not testify. The court ultimately stated that it did not believe that the VOP proceedings were impeachable evidence, but it agreed that appellant\u2019s counsel could raise the issue again at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Before trial commenced on July 27, 2009, the parties revisited the issue of Sean\u2019s expectation of leniency in his VOP hearing. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the issue was whether Sean expected to receive a benefit from the judge in exchange for his testimony in appellant\u2019s case. Although counsel acknowledged that the State had not offered Sean a deal in exchange for his testimony, counsel argued that the VOP judge had indicated to Sean that he would receive a benefit for testifying in appellant\u2019s ease. Counsel noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Sean\u2019s violation of probation hearing had been postponed for two years, suggesting that a postponement was granted after Sean\u2019s involvement in appellant\u2019s case was brought to the attention of the VOP judge. Counsel maintained that \u201c[t]he case kept getting postponed because they wanted to ... hear what happened to the murder trial,\u201d and that Sean received \u201chome detention at the prompting of\u2019 the VOP judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The prosecutor responded that the VOP judge was aware of Sean\u2019s criminal record, which included only a probation before judgment on an attempted distribution charge, a possession of a handgun by a minor charge, and the resulting charge of violation of probation due to Sean\u2019s failure to obey all laws and by possessing the handgun. She stated that Sean was arrested for possessing a handgun after the murder, and he said that he had the gun because he was afraid. The prosecutor also noted that Sean had given statements to the police identifying appellant before his VOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The court then stated that the VOP judge\u2019s \u201cintentions ... could be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which are fully consistent with her empathy towards an individual who had never been convicted of an offense, except\u201d being in possession of a firearm as a minor. Appellant\u2019s counsel provided the court with additional cases to review, and the court reserved on the issue pending its review of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">B. Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The State called Erika Palmer as its first witness. Ms. Palmer stated that she was at a tattoo party on Radecke Avenue on the evening of July 15, 2007, when she heard some arguing outside. She went to the window to see what was happening. An argument was taking place in the parking lot, which was lit with street lights. Ms. Palmer saw people arguing and then shooting firearms. She did not remember how many people were shooting, but she stated that one of the individuals was shot in the head, and the shooter was short, with brown skin and dreads or plaits in his hair. After she witnessed the shooting, Ms. Palmer ducked below the window because she did not want to see what was happening. Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Palmer then went home, but she eventually contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Ms. Palmer identified appellant as the shooter in a photo array.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She initially wrote that the photo of appellant \u201clooks like\u201d the shooter. The police told her, however, that she could only indicate whether the individual pictured was or was not the shooter, whereupon she wrote that appellant \u201cis the shooter.\u201d At trial, she was uncertain if the shooter was in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Ms. Palmer stated that she observed the shooting from a second floor apartment. She was unable to estimate how far she was from the shooting, and she stated that the events occurred quickly. Ms. Palmer did not give the police any information regarding facial hair, clothing, tattoos, eye color, facial features, or hair color; she stated that it was too dark outside to observe details such as eye color. With respect to the gun, she was able to see only that the gun was big.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Tajah Flemming, the mother of Wayne\u2019s son, Khalee White, born November 15, 2006, testified next. On July 15, 2007, she went to Wayne\u2019s apartment on Radecke Avenue to pick him up and take him to her grandmother\u2019s birthday party. The couple and their son, who was eight months old at the time, left the party at approximately 9:30 p.m. and returned to Wayne\u2019s apartment. When they arrived, they noticed that the mother of Wayne\u2019s other children had written on the outside of his door. After Wayne called this woman, he and Ms. Flemming left his apartment and argued. Ms. Flemming and Khalee got in her car, and Wayne went back into the house to call Sean and Maurice to pick him up. Wayne then exited the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">At that point, appellant approached Ms. Flemming\u2019s car and told her that she and Wayne needed to take their argument in the house \u201cbecause that\u2019s where he sold his stuff.\u201d Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Flemming stated that her boyfriend was drunk, and appellant should not \u201cpay him no mind.\u201d Appellant then left, and Ms. Flemming pulled out of the parking lot onto Radecke Road. Wayne was standing near a bench with some girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">As Ms. Flemming was driving down Radecke Road, she saw Maurice and Sean driving toward the apartment complex. She made a U-turn so she could follow them. By the time Ms. Flemming returned to the apartment parking lot, Wayne and Maurice were talking to two other guys in the field; Sean was in his car. A couple of girls ran up to Ms. Flemming\u2019s car and told her that she needed to leave, at which point she saw appellant with a rifle. Appellant then shot Maurice in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Appellant began shooting at Ms. Flemming\u2019s car, and Wayne ran toward the car, shouting: \u201cMy son is in there.\u201d Appellant then shot Wayne in the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Meanwhile, Sean jumped into the passenger seat of Ms. Flemming\u2019s car. Ms. Flemming ducked down, put the car in reverse, and drove back toward Wayne to try to pick him up. Wayne never made it to the car because Mr. Stevenson came from behind a building and shot Wayne in the other leg, and then continued shooting him. Appellant resumed shooting at Ms. Flemming\u2019s car. She drove in reverse for two blocks, observing in her rearview mirror that Mr. Stevenson was chasing her car and firing his gun. She drove to Todd Avenue, where her car stopped operating. Sean jumped out of the car, and a woman invited Ms. Flemming and her son into her home to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Ms. Flemming went to the police station to speak with homicide detectives, and she identified appellant in a photo array as the person who shot Maurice and Wayne. She had seen appellant before the night of the shooting; he lived in Wayne\u2019s apartment complex during the year prior to the shooting, and she saw him six or seven times each week. Ms. Flemming identified Mr. Stevenson in a photo array as the other shooter. She told the police that he used a silver handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Ms. Flemming had seen appellant and Mr. Stevenson together \u201call the time\u201d; \u201c[tjhey used to hang in the parking lot together.\u201d Ms. Flemming\u2019s 911 call was played for the jury and admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Defense counsel questioned Ms. Flemming regarding inconsistencies in her initial statements to the police and her testimony at trial. According to the police report, Ms. Flem-ming told the police that she was in the building when she heard arguing outside, and as she exited the building, she saw two black males arguing with Wayne and Maurice. Ms. Flemming denied that the events occurred as the police reports described. She acknowledged that she did not identify appellant by name when she identified him as the shooter to the police because she did not know his name until she read it in the paper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Helen Washington, a Criminal Lab Technician for the Baltimore City Police Department, testified regarding the discovery and collection of evidence related to the incident and the chain of custody. Ms. Washington also identified photographs of the crime scene that were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">James Locke, an Assistant Medical Examiner for the City of Baltimore, testified as an expert in the field of forensic pathology. On July 16, 2007, Dr. Locke performed the autopsies of Maurice and Wayne. The cause of Maurice\u2019s death was a close range gunshot wound to the head,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the cause of Wayne\u2019s death was multiple gunshot wounds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Sean testified that he and his brother, Maurice, received a call from their best friend, Wayne, the evening of July 15, 2007. They drove to Wayne\u2019s apartment complex and approached Wayne, who was sitting outside on a bench. As Sean, Maurice, and Wayne were getting ready to leave, Sean saw appellant and three other people \u201ccome from behind the basketball court.\u201d Appellant, who was carrying a long, black, \u201carmy type\u201d gun, approached them and told them to leave. Maurice and Wayne tried to \u201ctalk it out\u201d with appellant. Maurice then turned to walk away, and appellant \u201cstarted running towards [Maurice] ... shooting.\u201d Sean, who was standing at the driver\u2019s side door of his car, shouted to his brother to \u201cwatch out,\u201d and when Maurice turned around to see what was happening, appellant shot him. Sean then jumped into the passenger seat of Ms. Flemming\u2019s car, which was parked behind his car. Meanwhile, Wayne ducked behind Sean\u2019s car to avoid being shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">After Sean got into Ms. Flemming\u2019s car, she put the car in reverse, and she began backing out of the parking lot. The only people in the car were Sean, Ms. Flemming, and Khalee. As the car backed up, Sean heard gunshots continue from the direction where appellant was standing, and he heard bullets hit Ms. Flemming\u2019s car. Wayne stood up and began to run toward the car, screaming: \u201cMy son is in the car. Please stop shooting.\u201d Wayne was shot in the leg, but he continued to move toward the car, until he collapsed. Another individual ran to the scene, \u201cstood over top of Wayne[,] and start[ed] shooting him\u201d with a handgun. Neither Sean, Maurice, nor Wayne were armed, and none of them attempted to start a fight with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Sean went to the police station on July 16, 2007, to talk to the police. On July 24, 2004, he identified appellant as the individual who shot Maurice. Sean had seen appellant several times at Wayne\u2019s apartment complex prior to the incident. On cross-examination, Sean acknowledged that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>some inconsistencies between the police report summarizing his statement and his trial testimony regarding details of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The court then recessed for the day, and appellant\u2019s counsel revisited her motion to cross-examine Sean regarding any expectation of leniency. The court stated that it had reviewed the cases appellant\u2019s counsel had submitted, but there was no evidence of a quid-pro-quo agreement between Sean and the VOP judge regarding his testimony at appellant\u2019s trial and his VOP sentence. The court further noted that Sean had given a statement to the police regarding appellant\u2019s case before he appeared in front of the VOP judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel responded that the question was not whether the State had struck a bargain with Sean, but whether Sean subjectively believed that he would receive a benefit related to his sentence after testifying on the State\u2019s behalf at appellant\u2019s trial. The court dismissed defense counsel\u2019s argument regarding a witness\u2019 subjective belief that a bargain exists because \u201cyou can have somebody believing anything they want.\u201d The court denied defense counsel\u2019s request to cross-examine Sean regarding his expectation of leniency, with leave \u201cto renew.\u201d When trial reconvened on July 30, 2009, as discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>the trial court further explained its ruling regarding defense counsel\u2019s request to cross-examine Sean regarding his expectation of leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">After the court addressed other matters related to the trial, defense counsel resumed cross-examination of Sean. Sean acknowledged inconsistencies in his testimony at the suppression hearing and in one of his initial statements to the police regarding his description of appellant\u2019s clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Lisette Rivera, a Crime Lab Mobile Unit technician with the Baltimore City Police Department, testified that she processed a vehicle connected with the shooting.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She recovered a</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>metal fragment from the \u201cfront driver\u2019s side tire that was flat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Detective Frederick Daum was the primary detective assigned to the case. He attended the autopsies at the Medical Examiner\u2019s office. A .45 caliber bullet was recovered from Wayne, which Detective Daum collected as evidence. At the crime scene, Detective Daum found three .45 caliber shell casings at the entrance of the parking lot to the apartment complex. The Crime Lab photographed the casings and collected them as evidence. Detective Daum collected DNA from appellant, and he requested that DNA and fingerprint analyses be performed on evidence collected at the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Jocelyn Carlson, a DNA analyst for the Baltimore City Police Department, was accepted as an expert in DNA identification, analysis, and evaluation. She testified that Maurice\u2019s DNA was recovered from the scene, and appellant\u2019s DNA was found on a t-shirt and a baseball hat found at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Christopher Faber, a technician with the Baltimore City Firearms Examination Unit, was accepted as an expert in the field of firearms operability and identification. He examined 22 fired cartridge cases in relation to appellant\u2019s case. Five of the cartridges were .45 auto caliber, and they were fired by the same firearm. The remaining 17 cartridges were fired from a second firearm. Thus, Mr. Faber concluded that two firearms were used in the shooting. Mr. Faber was unable to determine whether the .45 caliber bullet recovered by the medical examiner from Wayne was fired from the same firearm as the cartridge casings because he did not have the original firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">At the conclusion of the evidence, counsel for appellant made a motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts. As relevant to this appeal, counsel argued that the State had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>failed to prove that appellant conspired to kill Wayne and Maurice. Counsel asserted that, even if the jury credited Ms. Flemming\u2019s and Sean\u2019s testimony, \u201cyou do not have any working together at all between [Mr.] Stevenson and [appellant].\u201d She argued that Mr. Stevenson and appellant were not in each other\u2019s presence, and they were not together. The court denied the motion, explaining: \u201cEven the method and manner in which they approached and acted together, I believe a [j]ury could infer that there was an agreement to act with respect to the two conspiracy charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The trial court then instructed the jury, and the parties gave their closing arguments. On August 7, 2009, after six days of deliberations, the jury returned its verdict. As indicated, it found appellant guilty of the following charges: (1) two counts of second degree murder; (2) three counts of first degree assault; (3) one count of use of a handgun in a felony or crime of violence; (4) five counts of openly carrying a dangerous weapon; and (5) two counts of conspiracy to commit first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Cross-Examination of State\u2019s Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that \u201cthe trial court erred in precluding cross-examination into Sean White\u2019s expectation of leniency regarding his violation of probation.\u201d He asserts that Sean had received \u201cpreferential treatment by being released pending a violation of probation hearing,\u201d and he had \u201can expectation of leniency\u201d regarding his ultimate sentence as a result of his cooperation in the State\u2019s case. Appellant maintains that \u201c[t]here was sufficient circumstantial evidence of Sean\u2019s expectation of leniency regarding his violation of probation that the jury should have been allowed to make a credibility determination regarding Sean\u2019s motives\u201d for testifying on behalf of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The State argues that the trial court properly limited cross-examination of Sean regarding any expectation of leniency. In support, the State asserts that the judge presiding over Sean\u2019s VOP matter \u201cdid not extend any benefit or consideration to [Sean] in exchange for his testimony in favor of the State.\u201d In any event, the State argues, even if the court erred in limiting cross-examination, any error was harmless and does not require reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">A. Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">As indicated, <em>supra, </em>appellant\u2019s trial counsel sought to cross-examine Sean about his expectation of leniency regarding a violation of probation charge. The charges involved his possession of a handgun as a minor, which violated the condition of his probation on an attempted distribution charge that he obey all laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">On November 6, 2008, in support of his request to be released pending the hearing on the VOP charge, Sean\u2019s counsel stated that Sean was a witness for the State in its case against appellant. The State deferred to the Pre-Trial Services caseworker, who did not oppose Sean\u2019s release, provided a curfew of 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. be imposed and that Sean attend school or a job during the daytime hours. The State then requested that, if Sean was released, he be placed under house arrest unless he could prove that he was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The judge who presided over the bail review matter, and who would eventually preside over the VOP hearing (the \u201cVOP judge\u201d), then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Well, you have a Violation of Probation date of December 8. The last time the case was here for a violation hearing on October 20, the Defense requested this postponement for the Defendant to complete cooperation in this other criminal matter and the date of December 8 was selected for the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">After further discussion, the VOP judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">[Sean has] been at the Baltimore City Detention Center in protective custody and obviously has been safe in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>environment. And you\u2019re asking him now to be released into the community at a time when it\u2019s anticipated that he\u2019s going to give testimony as a witness in a double homicide case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">All right. After hearing from all of the parties involved, knowing that the Pre-Trial Service Division has no opposition to [Sean\u2019s] request for home detention provided that there\u2019s a curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., that the Defendant is either in school or in jail, and that the State has no opposition to this request either, the Court is going to grant [Sean\u2019s] request for bail review. I\u2019ll make this comment, that all of the parties have noted that [Sean] is a witness in a criminal homicide prosecution. And we are all aware of the dangers occasioned by that type of participation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">[Sean] has been in protective custody at the Baltimore City Detention Center. Normally where witnesses are concerned, the State doesn\u2019t incarcerate them. So I don\u2019t think [Sean] should be held against his wishes for his own safety. But the State has told me that the family has refused to [relocate from this [ ] address. [Sean\u2019s counsel] has told me that they\u2019ve considered this situation and nonetheless want the request for bail granted with [Sean] to be released into the community under the circumstances that he is expected to testify as a primary witness for the State in a double homicide case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">All right. So those are not facts that the Court would hold against [Sean], because that doesn\u2019t provide a basis to incarcerate someone, for their own protection. But these are certainly serious, serious circumstances. All right.... [Sean] ... received Probation Before Judgment ... on August 20, 2007 after attempted distribution was the offense that [the court] struck the guilty finding for. The facts of that case were that [Sean] did distribute a controlled dangerous substance to a woman on the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Since he\u2019s been on probation he was charged with another drug felony, that case was dismissed. He\u2019s now charged with a firearms offense and has pled guilty to that; and received the six month sentence. A defendant who is under a sentence of Probation Before Judgment, even for what we classify [a]s a misdemeanor offense, but it\u2019s drug dealing nonetheless, and then becomes convicted of a firearm offense, stands a very good likelihood of receiving a substantial sentence of incarceration on Violation of Probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">I\u2019ve been advised about the extenuating circumstances here, [Sean] suffering the loss of his brother and a friend. And his participation with the State as a witness for continuing his Violation of Probation case to see the outcome of that. And it\u2019s the intent of the parties to bring that to my attention at the time of his sentencing. Taking all of these matters into consideration and the no opposition of PreTrial and the State, the Court grants the Defense\u2019s request for bail reduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The court released Sean on the condition that he participate in a home detention program, abide by the 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. curfew, and enroll in school or find employment. Sean was also ordered to participate in telephonic supervision by PreTrial Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">At trial in this case, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that Sean\u2019s testimony on behalf of the State was motivated by his expectation of leniency with respect to sentencing on his VOP charge. Counsel maintained that Sean\u2019s expectation that the VOP judge would impose a more lenient sentence was bolstered by the fact that she reduced his bail pending the VOP hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In addressing the issue, the trial court noted: (1) that Sean had made a statement to the police prior to his appearance before the VOP judge; and (2) that it was the VOP judge \u201cwho said[ ] we\u2019ll see how it goes after you\u2019ve testified,\u201d and \u201cwho postponed this case on her own, sua sponte, without any discussion between the State acknowledging that we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>with you; we encourage you to give it up. So there\u2019s a big difference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, the only thing I would say to that, is that the \u2014 one of the postponements; the initial postponement, was due at the request of the defense counsel, who was acting on behalf of his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">In addition to that, Your Honor, the case, I believe is Watson; indicated that it is not that the State struck a bargain, but whether or not the person who gave the statement believes that a benefit will derive from whatever happened; the postponement, or the letting out on bail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">It\u2019s the perspective of the defendant, not that, in fact, that a bargain exists between the defendant and the State. And I believe that was exactly the words out of [the VOP Judge]. But I can\u2019t tell you right off the top of my head, because I don\u2019t have the case with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t know how it could be someone who was promised a benefit. Only the State could do that. The Judge who has nothing to do with this case, who wasn\u2019t asked to intercede by the State; but by the defendant\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And the case law says; it\u2019s from his perspective that we look ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">THE COURT: Look. I don\u2019t think so. Because you can have somebody believing anything they want. You\u2019re free, however, to bring case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">And at this point, I am denying your motion with leave for you to renew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">The following day, the parties revisited the issue, and the court clarified its ruling. The court stated that there was an agreement between Sean and the VOP judge, but the judge did not tell Sean \u201cdirectly or indirectly that he had to testify one way or another. That is for the State or for the defense.\u201d The court emphasized that the VOP judge did not say \u201c \u2018testify truthfully\u2019 \u201d or \u201cin a manner consistent with the conviction of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Later that day, after cross-examination of Sean had concluded, and after lunch, the prosecutor informed the trial judge that Sean\u2019s violation hearing had been held. At the hearing, the VOP judge inquired whether Sean had testified \u201cconsistently.\u201d The trial judge reiterated there was no deal that Sean testify \u201cone way or the other[,] [o]nly that he testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">B. Scope of Cross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u201cThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee a criminal defendant the right to confront the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Martinez v. State, </em>416 Md. 418, 428, 7 A.3d 56 (2010). A criminal defendant has the right to cross-examine a witness regarding \u201cpossible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness.\u201d <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). <em>Accord Martinez, </em>416 Md. at 428, 7 A.3d 56; <em>Marshall v. State, </em>346 Md. 186, 192, 695 A.2d 184 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The right to cross-examine a witness, however, is not unlimited. Martinez, 416 Md. at 428, 7 A.3d 56. \u201cA trial court may impose reasonable limits on cross-examination when necessary for witness safety or to prevent harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, and inquiry that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The scope of cross-examination is a matter left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Smith v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 494, 544, 10 A.3d 798 (2010). In exercising that discretion, a court must balance \u201c \u2018the probative value of an inquiry against the unfair prejudice that might inure to the witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pantazes v. State, </em>376 Md. 661, 681, 831 A.2d 432 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">When the cross-examination involves the potential bias or prejudice of a witness, a defendant must be accorded \u201c \u2018wide latitude\u2019 \u201d in cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 10 A.3d 798 (quoting <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 307-08, 577 A.2d 356 (1990)). As the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Only when defense counsel has been \u201cpermitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness[,]\u201d is the right of confrontation satisfied. <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 318 [94 S.Ct. 1105]. Consequently, a trial court may exercise its discretion to limit cross-examination only after the defendant has been afforded the \u201c \u2018constitutionally required threshold level of inquiry.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><em>Martinez, </em>416 Md. at 428, 7 A.3d 56 (quoting <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 307, 577 A.2d 356). When the trier of fact is a jury, questions concerning bias or motive of a witness should be prohibited \u201c \u2018only if (1) there is no factual foundation for such an inquiry in the presence of the jury, or (2) the probative value of such an inquiry is substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice or confusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Calloway v. State, </em>414 Md. 616, 638, 996 A.2d 869 (2010) (quoting <em>Leeks v. State, </em>110 Md.App. 543, 557-58, 678 A.2d 80 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In the present case, the trial court appeared to preclude the cross-examination based on the first prong. Its comments indicated that, in the absence of a specific deal in exchange for specific testimony, there was no factual foundation showing bias. This ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">A defendant seeking to explore a witness\u2019s bias by cross-examining him or her regarding an expectation of leniency is not required to present evidence of an agreement between the witness and the State or the court. <em>Brown v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 414, 420, 538 A.2d 317 (1988). <em>Accord Calloway, </em>414 Md. at 637, 996 A.2d 869. Rather, the \u201c \u2018the crux of the inquiry ... is the witness\u2019s state of mind. What is essential to the preservation of the right to cross-examine is that the interrogator be permitted to probe into whether the witness is acting under a hope or belief of leniency or reward.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, </em>74 Md.App. at 421, 538 A.2d 317 (quoting <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 349, 359, 437 A.2d 901 (1981)). <em>Accord Calloway, </em>414 Md. at 637, 996 A.2d 869. The critical issue is \u201c \u201cwhat the <em>witness </em>understands he or she will receive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>for it is this understanding which is of probative value on the issue of bias.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown,, </em>74 Md.App. at 421, 538 A.2d 317 (quoting <em>Hoover v. State of Maryland, </em>714 F.2d 301, 305 (4th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In <em>Calloway, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in prohibiting cross-examination of a State\u2019s witness regarding whether he hoped that, in exchange for his testimony, he would receive a benefit. 414 Md. at 619-20, 996 A.2d 869. The Court held that the determination whether the witness was testifying at trial \u201cin the hope of avoiding a violation of probation charge[ ] should have been decided by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 996 A.2d 869. It explained that the issue was whether the witness had a hope of a benefit, not whether the State had offered to make a deal or bargain with the witness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In the present case, the defense similarly sought to question Sean regarding whether he had any hope that he would receive leniency in his VOP hearing as a result of his testimony in appellant\u2019s case. Given that Sean\u2019s VOP hearing had been postponed for him to \u201ccomplete cooperation\u201d in appellant\u2019s case, and that the VOP judge had granted bail pending the hearing and stated that the parties would bring to her attention at the sentencing hearing his participation as a witness in appellant\u2019s case, there was a sufficient factual foundation to support the requested cross-examination. The trial court erred in finding otherwise and in restricting cross-examination of Sean regarding any expectation of leniency in return for his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">C. Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Although we hold that the trial court erred in restricting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination, that is not the end of the inquiry. <em>See Moore v. State, </em>412 Md. 635, 666, 989 A.2d 1150 (2010) (\u201cnot every error committed during a trial is reversible error\u201d). As the State notes, error that is harmless does not require reversal of a defendant\u2019s convictions. The State argues that, any error in restricting cross-examination here was harmless, stating that, \u201ceven if [Sean\u2019s] testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>not considered because [appellant] was not permitted to expose Sean\u2019s alleged bias in testifying,\u201d there was \u201cother equally damning evidence\u201d against appellant that established appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Court of Appeals has set forth the standard for assessing harmless error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6LI\"><em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). <em>Accord Morris v. State, </em>418 Md. 194, 221-22, 13 A.3d 1206 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">In determining whether an erroneous restriction on cross-examination is harmless error, our analysis is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">Whether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\"><em>Owens v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 91, 111, 867 A.2d 334 (2005) (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Applying these factors, we hold that the error here was harmless. The State\u2019s case against appellant was strong, and Sean\u2019s identification of appellant, albeit important, was cumulative to the testimony of other witnesses identifying appellant as the shooter. Appellant was given ample opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>nity to cross-examine Sean, other than regarding the VOP proceedings, and the impact of that cross-examination would have been minimal under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Even without Sean\u2019s testimony, there was strong evidence against appellant. Ms. Flemming testified that she observed appellant shoot Maurice in the head, shoot at her car, and shoot Wayne in the leg. She testified that Mr. Stevenson and appellant shot and killed Wayne as he tried to run to her car. Other than some inconsistencies as to the details of the shooting, an undoubtedly stressful event, Ms. Flemming\u2019s identification of appellant was unimpeached. No motive was suggested for Ms. Flemming to falsely identify appellant, and her identification of appellant as the shooter was unequivocal. And Ms. Flemming\u2019s observations of appellant were not limited to the night of the shooting; she previously had seen appellant on multiple occasions. Ms. Flemming testified that appellant lived in the same apartment complex as her boyfriend, she saw appellant probably six or seven times per week, and she saw appellant and Mr. Stevenson together \u201call the time.\u201d Her trial testimony identifying appellant as the shooter was consistent with her pre-trial identification of appellant in a photo array shortly after the shooting. Ms. Flemming\u2019s identification of appellant was very strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Another witness corroborated Ms. Flemming\u2019s identification of appellant as the shooter. Ms. Palmer, who observed the shooting from the window of an apartment, identified appellant in a photo array as the shooter. To be sure, this identification was not as strong because Ms. Palmer could not identify appellant as the shooter at trial, and she testified that she initially stated during the photo array identification that appellant \u201clooked like\u201d the shooter, writing that appellant \u201cis the shooter\u201d only after the police told her she could only indicate whether the individual pictured was or was not the shooter. Her testimony, however, did corroborate the very strong identification by Ms. Flemming.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>With respect to the cross-examination permitted, defense counsel was given ample opportunity to question Sean, other than the prohibited questioning at issue here. And the impeachment potential of the restricted evidence, under the facts of this case, was not substantial. Sean had positively identified appellant two times as the shooter shortly after the murder, prior to any VOP proceedings. Questioning about any expectation of leniency regarding Sean\u2019s VOP charge would not have detracted from his earlier identifications of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Even if the requested cross-examination would have convinced the jury to disregard Sean\u2019s testimony, as indicated, there were two other witnesses identifying appellant as the shooter. Sean\u2019s testimony was a cumulative third identification. <em>See Owens, </em>161 Md.App. at 112, 867 A.2d 334 (restriction in cross-examination of witness who provided a \u201ccumulative fourth identification\u201d was harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">At oral argument, counsel for appellant argued that, despite the strong evidence against appellant, and the limited impeachment value of the excluded evidence, the error was not harmless. In support, counsel pointed to the length of deliberations and that the jurors had indicated on the second day of deliberations that they could not reach a verdict. Neither appellant nor the State cited any cases addressing whether lengthy deliberations or a note such as that sent by the jury here were relevant to a finding of harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Addressing first the length of deliberations, courts have disagreed on whether that fact has any bearing in a harmless error analysis, in particular with respect to an analysis of the strength of the State\u2019s case. <em>Compare United States v. Williams, </em>212 F.3d 1305, 1311 n. 10 (D.C.Cir.) (courts should \u201chesitate to connect the length of deliberations with the strength of the government\u2019s case\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1056, 121 S.Ct. 666, 148 L.Ed.2d 568 (2000), <em>with United States v. Velarde-Gomez, </em>269 F.3d 1023, 1036 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (\u201cLonger jury deliberations \u201cweigh against a finding of harmless error\u2019 because lengthy deliberations suggest a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>difficult case.\u201d); <em>United States v. Varoudakis, </em>233 F.3d 113, 126 (1st Cir.2000) (same). Even the courts that have looked to the length of deliberations, however, have noted that a lengthy deliberation may result, \u201cnot because of indecision, but [from] \u2018a diligent and conscientious attempt to evaluate the evidence, and to verify the testimony of different witnesses and to come to a careful and reasoned decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Varoudakis, </em>233 F.3d at 126-27 (quoting <em>Clark v. Moran, </em>942 F.2d 24, 32-33 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In the present case, the jury deliberated for a period of time approximating five days.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although this is a lengthy period of time, it was in the context of a trial that spanned four days and involved 33 different counts, involving different legal theories. During the deliberation period, the jury sent out multiple notes, asking for definitions of the different offenses, clarification regarding the elements of a crime, and information about specific evidence that was introduced. Under these circumstances, the length of deliberations reflects a conscientious attempt to reach a reasonable decision, and it does not weigh against a finding of harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Nor do we find that the two jury notes indicating difficulty reaching a unanimous verdict weigh against a finding of harmless error. Both notes were written on the second day of deliberations, the first after less than six hours of deliberation. And, as indicated, the subsequent deliberations, including the notes requesting more guidance regarding the nature of the crimes charged, show a diligent attempt to reach a careful decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Given the strong evidence against appellant, and the limited impact that the cross-examination likely would have had, we hold that the court\u2019s restriction of cross-examination, although error, was harmless. Appellant is not entitled to a new trial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">AZZera-type Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that \u201cthe trial court coerced a jury verdict by propounding repeated improper Allen-type charges even after the jury had revealed its numerical division.\u201d He asserts that, after receiving several notes from the jury over its six days of deliberations, indicating that the jury was struggling to reach a unanimous verdict, the court issued \u201cindubitably coercive\u201d instructions to the jurors. In particular, he argues that the court failed to instruct the jury \u201cthat the verdict must be considered judgment of each juror,\u201d and that they must \u201cdeliberate with a view toward reaching an agreement without doing violence to individual judgment,\u201d or \u201csurrendering] their honest beliefs.\u201d The court\u2019s instructions, he asserts, \u201csen[t] a clear indication to the holdout juror that it was time to change his or her vote,\u201d which he asserts \u201chad the intended effect.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The State argues that appellant did not properly preserve this claim because he did not raise timely objections to the jury instructions to which he objects on appeal. The State further contends that, even if preserved, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury to continue deliberations were proper, noting that the trial lasted four days and \u201c[t]here were 32 charges against Dionas in connection with crimes of violence against five victims.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because the jury was required to assess the evidence to determine if the State had met its burden for each of the 33 charges, the State contends that the trial court properly instructed the jury to continue deliberations. The State additionally argues that the court\u2019s instructions to the jury to continue to deliberate were not coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>A. Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The jury retired for deliberations on July 31, 2009, at 12:50 p.m. They deliberated until 4:59 p.m., when they indicated they had a question for the court. At 5:17 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom and the court released them, advising that it would answer the question when they returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">On Monday, August 3, 2009, the second day of deliberations, the court answered the jury\u2019s question regarding the definition of first and second degree murder, and it clarified which exhibits were in evidence for consideration. The jury retired to deliberate at 10:05 a.m. At 11:37 a.m., the jury sent a note indicating that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on any charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Is there anyone among you who is a history buff? Who said we have not yet begun to fight? John Paul Jones. But I think MacArthur said it too, I think you\u2019re right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">In the same token, you have not yet begun to deliberate. Your verdict must be the considered judgment of each of you. Before I read you this, let me tell you this also. It is not uncommon for a group of 12 people, most of which have never served as a juror before, to believe early on in deliberations that a unanimous verdict can\u2019t be reached. In fact, it is more often than not the case. So you are no different than thousands of juries that have appeared in this courtroom in the past where the majority of the jurors have never served before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">So having said that, your verdict must be the considered judgment of each of you. In order to reach a verdict, all of you must agree. Your verdict must be unanimous. You must consult with one another and deliberate with a view towards reaching an agreement if you can do so without violence to your own individual judgment. Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but do so only after an impartial consideration of all of the evidence with your fellow jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>During deliberations, do not hesitate to re-examine your own views. You should change your opinion if you are wrong, but do not surrender your honest belief as to the weight or effect of the evidence only because of the opinion of your fellow jurors or for the mere purpose of reaching a verdict. Having said that, you\u2019re released back into deliberations. Thank you ever so much.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">No objection was made to this instruction, and the jury resumed deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">At 4:01 p.m. that afternoon, the court received another note, stating: \u201cWe the jury have deliberated the verdict to the best of our knowledge and can only agree on two counts.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court stated that it did not think the jury had deliberated long enough, but it heard argument from counsel. The State argued that the jury had deliberated barely a full day, and it did not want to \u201cgive it up this fast.\u201d Defense counsel noted that the jury had advised the court twice, even after being given an Allen-type charge, that the best they could do was reach an agreement on two counts. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">Okay. I\u2019m not cutting them loose, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough time. I don\u2019t think they believed me when I said you\u2019ve not just begun to deliberate. Evidence was clear in my eyes, one way or another. Either you believed what you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>heard or you didn\u2019t believe what you heard and saw. Bring them out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">Unless you want me to re-instruct them with the <em>Allen, </em>but I don\u2019t think I have to. I will if you want me to though .... here\u2019s the note. I would have pushed it further if I could have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The court then addressed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">Members of the jury, I\u2019ve received a note; we the jury have deliberated the verdict to the best of our knowledge and can only agree on two counts. You gave me the count number and the verdict. My instruction to you is I wasn\u2019t kidding when I said you were just beginning to deliberate. I don\u2019t have a humorous bone in my body. When I told you you\u2019ve been in trial for a solid week and only been in deliberations for a day and a few hours, that\u2019s not nearly enough. You\u2019re released back into deliberations. If you don\u2019t reach a verdict by a little before 5:00 [p.m.], I\u2019ll release you for continued deliberations tomorrow. Thank you ever so much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The jury was then released to resume deliberations at 4:05 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The court then advised defense counsel that she could make her objections again for the record. Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">Your Honor, I just wanted to point out that I think this is a[ ] little different than the case that you had last week in that we\u2019ve now had two notes where the jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">I mean in terms of you holding them or not holding them, it\u2019s just a gauge for me to see that last week you had a case that you held on for five days. In this particular situation, we\u2019ve had two notes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">And, ma\u2019am, I\u2019m going to hold, in all sincerity and all frankness, I can\u2019t say it any other way. I\u2019m going to hold them for five days. I believe it\u2019s appropriate to hold a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>for at least the length of the trial to give them the opportunity to arrive at a unanimous verdict. Their findings along the way are insignificant to me and that\u2019s why I really don\u2019t share them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Defense counsel then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">I understand that Your Honor. And I was just placing on the record that I think, as you\u2019ve pointed out in this particular case, you could have a situation where you have six believing one side and six believing the other side. I mean, you said it yourself. You either believe he was there or he wasn\u2019t. So I think that this particular case is indicative of we have that situation where some literally believe he wasn\u2019t there and some believe he was there. And I\u2019m just placing this on the record. I mean certainly a five day trial, I understand Your Honor where you\u2019re coming from. I just think that given the two notes, that to keep hammering and sending them back (inaudible). So, but thank you for letting me put it on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">At 5:00 p.m., the court received another note from the jury, seeking further instruction regarding the definition of a conspiracy and what constitutes aiding and abetting. The court answered the question. The court asked the jury if they wanted to continue deliberating or return the next day. The jurors wanted to come back the next day, and the court excused them at 5:13 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">On August 4, 2009, the jury deliberated all day, with no further questions. On August 5, 2009, the fourth day of deliberations, the jury asked a question regarding the charge of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. The court answered the question, and the jury deliberated until 5:04 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">On August 6, 2009, jury deliberations continued for a fifth day. At 10:28 a.m., the trial court discussed with counsel a jury note that inquired: \u201cWhat are the consequences when some jurors are not cooperating with deliberations, blatantly disregarding the law of the land, and the evidence presented in this case?\u201d Defense counsel asserted that the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>hung, stating that this was the third note saying they could not reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">I have a question [from the jury]; what are the consequences when some jurors are not cooperating with deliberations, blatantly disregarding the law of the land, and the evidence presented in this case. The answer is simple. Each of you took two oaths.... I take oaths very seriously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">You also took an oath when you were seated. Remember when I said: swear in the jury? You took an oath at that time to deliberate fairly and impartially on the evidence presented during the course of this trial and arrive at a verdict based on that evidence that\u2019s fair and impartial to both sides, free of any sympathy, bias, and prejudice. Also, I instructed you that each of you are absolute judges of the facts. Facts are as you find them to be. But you must also apply the law as I explained it to you, you\u2019ve got no discretion. I told you that during the voir dire process and there was a question asked with regard is there anyone who is unable or unwilling to apply the law as I explain it to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">In instructions, preliminary instructions and instructions at the end, I instructed you that you must apply the law as I explain it to you and that you have no discretion in this case whatsoever. And you took an oath to do just that. I am now again ordering you to go back into deliberations and deliberate on the evidence presented in this case. You can\u2019t guess what the evidence should have been. You can\u2019t guess what an answer to a question that was objected to would have been. You must base your decision on the evidence presented during the course of this trial along with all reasonable and logical inferences that flow therefrom. Free of any prejudice, bias, or sympathy one way or the other. The verdict must be fair and impartial and fair to both sides. Everybody understand that? If not, raise your hand and I\u2019ll go over it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">But you do not have the right to go back there and make up evidence. In the same token, you can\u2019t guess that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Defendant is guilty; he looks guilty, he didn\u2019t smile enough, he\u2019s too handsome to be guilty, none of that works. I instructed you that the burden of proof lies solely on the shoulders of the State. In order to convict the Defendant, based on the evidence, you must be satisfied that this Defendant committed one or more of the charges submitted to you beyond a reasonable doubt as I instructed you. Now, does anybody have any questions about this question? If so, now is the time to say it. I really do take your oath seriously. All right, you\u2019re released back into deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Defense counsel\u2019s only objection to this instruction was that the trial court stated that appellant \u201clooks guilty.\u201d In response to counsel\u2019s objection, the court issued a curative instruction clarifying that the court was not stating its opinion regarding appellant\u2019s guilt, but that its statement related to appellant was an \u201cexample[ ] of what you can\u2019t guess.\u201d The court instructed the jury to base its verdict on the evidence presented at trial, and it admonished the jury that it could not consider appellant\u2019s decision not to testify or draw any inference from appellant\u2019s appearance. The court inquired of defense counsel whether its curative instruction alleviated counsel\u2019s concerns, and counsel stated: \u201cThat\u2019s great[,] Your Honor, thank you very much.\u201d The jury resumed deliberations at 10:45 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">At 11:36 a.m. that day, the court informed the parties that it had received a note from a juror, which stated: \u201cI did not talk to <em>no one, </em>about this case. I am being pick[ed] out. Some one [sic] that I do not know ask[ed] me if we came to a verdict. My verdict did not match there [sic] verdict it made the count 11 to 1, on more th[a]n one count[.]\u201d The court sought clarification regarding the note from the jury, and the jury sent a note indicating that, \u201csome member[s] of the jury were concerned because they ... saw juror number 9 confronted by someone in the gallery [ ] who asked if a jury had a verdict. Juror number 9 wrote the previous note to clarify what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The court discussed with counsel the appropriate response,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and it ultimately advised the jury that juror number 9 did the right thing by notifying the court of the communication. It also advised the jury that the person who inquired whether the jury reached a verdict could have been anyone from the public, and to notify the court if they saw the person again or felt threatened in any way. Finally, the court instructed the jury not to consider the communication in any way during deliberations. The jury resumed deliberations at 12:02 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Defense counsel then requested a mistrial, arguing that juror number 9\u2019s letter indicated that he or she was being pressured by the other jurors. The court denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Okay. And what I\u2019ve done \u2014 I\u2019ve instructed them that, previously, with regard to the <em>[Allen </em>] charge, and now I\u2019ve instructed them with regard to this note, that they are not to take that contact and utilize it during deliberations, and it was the contact that was causing juror number 9 concern, and was causing other jurors concern. And I told them that they shouldn\u2019t in any way hold that against your client or against the State, and not even discuss it during deliberations. And I told them; nobody raised their hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">So, at this time I don\u2019t find manifest necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">At 5:09 p.m., the court informed counsel of another juror note. Juror number 12 had advised that his or her mother had passed away and asked to be released to assist in making preparations for the funeral.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court, prior to informing counsel of the note, responded to the juror as follows: \u201cYou will not be released. Continue to deliberate but if you must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>leave earlier on any day, I will release the entire jury including you to return on the next day.\u201d When the court advised counsel of this response, no objection was noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The court then stated to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">Now what I want to do, with your permission, I want to send [the jury] a note, especially in light of the fact that we\u2019ve got a juror who\u2019s [sic], I believe, mother passed. I don\u2019t think he is necessary. But my note \u2014 in other words, for the preparations. They can make preparations without him. But at any age, a mother or father passing is significant. I\u2019d like to ask then the jury as a whole if they believe that with continued deliberations they will be able to reach a unanimous verdict. If it\u2019s no, I\u2019m just going to cut them loose. Especially in light of the death. Because I told them in the note, it was pretty harsh, did you read my note? I said: you will not be released, continue to deliberate. But if you must leave earlier on any day, I will release the entire jury, including you, to return on the next day. Now, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t like that or she didn\u2019t like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Defense counsel suggested that the court ask whether additional deliberations would result in a unanimous verdict, which the court did. The jury responded: \u201cSo far in our deliberations, some days we have gotten closer to a unanimous verdict and some days we have gotten further away. It is difficult to determine whether more time to deliberate will result in a unanimous verdict.\u201d The court explained to counsel that it would bring the jury back one more day, but \u201cafter tomorrow, that\u2019s it.\u201d Defense counsel agreed, albeit expressing frustration with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The following day, August 7, 2009, the sixth day of deliberations, the jury reached a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">B. Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">We will address first the State\u2019s argument that appellant\u2019s contention regarding the court\u2019s Allen-type charges is unpre-served. To preserve a challenge to a jury instruction, a defendant must object at the time the instruction is given. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-325(e) (\u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d); <em>Alston v. State, </em>414 Md. 92, 110-11, 994 A.2d 896 (2010) (failing to raise a timely objection to a jury instruction constitutes waiver). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The purpose of this preservation rule is \u201c \u2018to ensure fairness for all parties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 103, 976 A.2d 1072 (2009) (quoting <em>State v.

The Rule is also designed to prevent lawyers from \u201csandbagging\u201d the judge and, in essence, obtaining a second \u201cbite of the apple\u201d after appellate review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\"><em>Sydnor v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 173, 183, 754 A.2d 1064 (2000), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>365 Md. 205, 776 A.2d 669 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1090, 122 S.Ct. 834, 151 L.Ed.2d 714 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Appellant\u2019s argument on appeal, that the court coerced a jury verdict because it issued \u201cindubitably coercive\u201d instructions to the jurors, which failed to instruct the jury \u201cthat the verdict must be considered judgment of each juror,\u201d and that they must \u201cdeliberate with a view toward reaching an agreement without doing violence to individual judgment,\u201d or \u201csurrendering] their honest beliefs,\u201d is not preserved for appeal. As indicated, many of the court\u2019s responses to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>jury notes were made without objection, and even when there was an objection, it was on a ground other than that raised on appeal. As such, appellant\u2019s contention that the instructions given by the court were coercive is not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\"><em>Voir Dire </em>of Juror</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Appellant\u2019s third contention involves the note that juror number 9 sent on the fifth day of deliberations. As indicated, this note stated: \u201cI did not talk to <em>no one, </em>about this case. I am being pick[ed] out. Some one [sic] that I do not know ask[ed] me if we came to a verdict. My verdict did not match there [sic] verdict it made the count 11 to 1, on more th[a]n one count[.]\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court asked for clarification regarding the circumstances leading to the note, and the jury responded: \u201cSome members of the jury were concerned because they saw Juror # 9 confronted by someone in the gallery (who asked if the jury had a verdict). Juror # 9 wrote the previous note to clarify what happened.\u201d After consulting with counsel, the court instructed the jurors that the communication by the third party to the juror should not be considered, and that the juror did the right thing by not responding. Appellant then requested a mistrial, \u201cjust for purposes of appellate review,\u201d based on the juror\u2019s indication that the other jurors were placing \u201cinfluence\u201d on him. The court found no manifest necessity to justify a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">On appeal, appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court erred in failing to <em>voir dire </em>the juror who indicated he had been approached by someone about the jury\u2019s verdict and felt pressured by the jury.\u201d He argues that a trial court is obligated to \u201ctake some action to determine whether or not an impaneled juror can render a fair and impartial verdict[ ] once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the juror\u2019s impartiality has been called into question,\u201d but the trial court here \u201cmade no attempt to determine whether juror number 9, who indicated he was feeling pressure from the other jurors, had been impermissibly influenced by his or her interaction with the person who asked whether the jury had reached a verdict.\u201d Appellant asserts that, although the trial court \u201caddressed the jury as a whole,\u201d it \u201cnever individually voir dired juror # 9,\u201d and \u201c[t]he failure to do so denied [a]ppellant his right to a fair and impartial jury,\u201d which requires reversal of his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The State argues that appellant\u2019s contention is not preserved for review because he failed to request that the trial court <em>voir dire </em>juror number 9. In any event, it contends that the action that the trial court took, denying appellant\u2019s request for a mistrial and giving a curative instruction, \u201cwas appropriate given the circumstances and especially given that [appellant] did not ask the trial court to voir dire Juror No. 9.\u201d The State argues that, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, \u201ca fair reading\u201d of the note from juror number 9 \u201cdid not indicate that he was being pressured by the jury\u201d; it merely informed the court that someone had approached the juror, and he or she had not violated the court\u2019s instructions by speaking with a third party. Even if the note communicated that the juror felt pressured, the State argues, it would have been improper for the court to question the juror because \u201csuch inquiry would certainly have involved inquiry into the juror\u2019s mental processes and statements during deliberations.\u201d The State argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in its response to the jury note.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights, a criminal defendant has the right to trial by \u201can impartial jury.\u201d <em>Dillard v.

State, </em>152 Md.App. 362, 375, 831 A.2d 1134, <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 619, 837 A.2d 929 (2003). <em>Accord Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 340, 825 A.2d 1008; <em>Eades v.

We give deference, however, to the decision of the trial judge, who \u201cis in the best position to evaluate whether a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury has been compromised.\u201d <em>Summers, </em>152 Md.App. at 375, 831 A.2d 1134. <em>Accord Dillard, </em>415 Md. at 454, 3 A.3d 403 (appellate courts review denial of a motion for a mistrial pursuant to an abuse of discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Here, as the State notes, appellant never argued below, as he does on appeal, that it was necessary to <em>voir dire </em>juror number 9 to determine if he or she had been \u201cimpermissibly influenced\u201d by a question from an unknown person regarding whether the jury had reached a verdict. Rather, the basis for the requested mistrial was that the juror indicated in his or her note that the other jurors were placing influence on the juror. Because no argument was made below that a <em>voir dire </em>of the individual juror was necessary to determine whether there was prejudice from the contact with the unknown person, that argument is not preserved for review. <em>See Stone v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 428, 452, 941 A.2d 1238 (2008) (\u201cordinarily we will not consider an issue on appeal unless it \u2018plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court ...\u2019\u201d) (quoting Md. Rule 8-131(a)). <em>See also Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 541, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999) (\u201cIt is well-settled that when specific grounds are given at trial for an objection, the party objecting will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>held to those grounds and ordinarily waives any grounds not specified that are later raised on appeal.\u201d). <em>Accord Allen v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 625, 637, 995 A.2d 1013, <em>cert. granted on other grounds, </em>415 Md. 607, 4 A.3d 512 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In any event, even if the contention was preserved for review, we would find it to be without merit. To be sure, the Court of Appeals has held that, in certain situations involving outside contact with a juror, the court must conduct a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the juror to resolve whether there was actual prejudice before denying a motion for a mistrial. <em>Dillard, </em>415 Md. at 460-62, 3 A.3d 403. In <em>Dillard, </em>after the testimony of Detective Smith, the State\u2019s primary witness in the drug charges against Dillard, two jurors walked by the detective, patted him on the back, and said: \u201cGood job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 3 A.3d 403. The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">Without a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors to determine the intent or sub-text of their comments and whether they had discussed the issue of Dillard\u2019s guilt or innocence, the trial judge did not have sufficient information to determine whether [the contact was sufficiently egregious that] the presumption of prejudice attached to the contact or to rule on Dillard\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Thus, the trial judge\u2019s failure to clarify the factual scenario raised by the contact between the jurors and Detective Smith constituted an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 457, 3 A.3d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Direct questioning of a juror, however, is not always required. Situations requiring the court to conduct a <em>voir dire </em>examination of a jury panel prior to denying a motion for a mistrial include: (1) cases involving egregious juror and witness misconduct, which results in a presumption of prejudice; and (2) cases where the judge \u201clacked sufficient information to determine whether the incident was prejudicial.\u201d Id.<footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Neither of these situations is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Here, there was not egregious conduct by a juror. The juror did not initiate the contact, he did not respond to the question, and the juror promptly reported the contact to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Moreover, because the two jury notes clearly conveyed the nature of the contact, there was no need for further inquiry to resolve whether there was prejudice due to the contact. The notes made clear that the substance of the contact was innocuous; there was a mere inquiry into whether the jury had reached a verdict. <em>See Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 321, 825 A.2d 1008 (\u201cnot all incidental contacts between jurors and witnesses are inherently prejudicial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">We hold that, in cases involving juror contact with a third party, where the record is clear regarding what occurred and the contact is brief and incidental, a <em>voir dire </em>of the particular juror is not mandatory prior to denying a motion for a mistrial. Under the facts of this case, particularly where defense counsel never requested that the court <em>voir dire </em>the individual juror to obtain further information, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial without first questioning the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Appellant next contends that his separate sentences for murder and conspiracy to commit murder were illegal. Although he acknowledges that \u201cconvictions for a completed offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense do not merge under the required evidence test or the rule of lenity,\u201d he argues that merger is required here as \u201ca matter of fundamental fairness.\u201d He asserts that \u201cfundamental fairness requires the merger of sentences for a completed offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense where there is no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>that the conspiracy embraced criminal objectives other than the substantive offense for which the defendant was convicted.\u201d In this case, he argues, \u201cthere was no evidence of any discussions between [a]ppellant and Charlie Stevenson prior to the shootings,\u201d and \u201cthe conspiracy was not shown to have objectives other than the completed offense of which [appellant was convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The State contends that appellant was properly sentenced.

The merger doctrine, which is derived from both federal and Maryland common law double jeopardy principles, \u201cprovides the criminally accused with protection from, <em>inter alia, multiple punishment stemming from the same offense.\u201d Purnell v.

On the other hand, \u201cif each offense contains an element which the other does not, there is no merger under the required evidence test even though both offenses are based upon the same act or acts.\u201d <em>Id.

The Court of Appeals has explained why convictions for a substantive offense and conspiracy to commit that offense are treated as separate crimes justifying separate sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">Not only is the offense of conspiracy complete when the unlawful agreement is reached, but a conspiracy to commit a crime is entirely separate from the substantive crime.

Thus it is apparent that the conspiracy to murder is a separate and distinct crime from the substantive crime itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Alston, </em>414 Md. at 114, 994 A.2d 896. <em>Accord Wooten-Bey v.

Specifically, he argues that there was no evidence of an express agreement, and the fact that the two shooters did not begin shooting at the same time or in the same place \u201crenders any \u2018concert of action\u2019 theory untenable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The State disagrees, arguing that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s convictions for conspiracy. It points to evidence showing that appellant was accompanied by other men prior to the shooting, and that both appellant and Mr. Stevenson shot at Wayne and Ms. Flemming\u2019s car. It argues that these facts, and \u201cinferences that can reasonably be drawn from the facts,\u201d were sufficient to show that appellant and Mr. Stevenson \u201cacted in concert to shoot and kill Maurice and Wayne White.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by determining \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v.

The essence of a criminal conspiracy is an unlawful agreement. The agreement need not be formal or spoken, provided there is a meeting of the minds reflecting a unity of purpose and design. In Maryland, the crime is complete when the unlawful agreement is reached, and no overt act in furtherance of the agreement need be shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>Mitchell v. State, </em>363 Md. 130, 145, 767 A.2d 844 (2001) (quoting <em>Townes v. State, </em>314 Md. 71, 75, 548 A.2d 832 (1988)). <em>Accord Armstead v.

State, </em>325 Md. 272, 292 [600 A.2d 430] (1992) (citation omitted); <em>accord Berry v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 144, 156, [843 A.2d 93] <em>cert. denied, </em>381 Md. 674 [851 A.2d 594] (2004). The State is not required to show a formal agreement in order to prove conspiracy. As this Court has stated, \u201c[i]t is sufficient if the parties tacitly come to an understanding regarding the unlawful purpose. In fact, the State was only required to present facts that would allow the jury to infer that the parties entered into an unlawful agreement.\u201d <em>Acquah v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 29, 50 [686 A.2d 690] (1996) (citations omitted). And, a conspirator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u201cis liable for an act of a coconspirator not only when such act was part of the original plan but also when it was a natural and probable consequence of a carrying out of the plan.\u201d 4 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 685, at 561-63 (15th ed.1996).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Here, Ms. Flemming testified that she frequently saw appellant and Mr. Stevenson together in the parking lot of the apartment complex, that she saw appellant shoot Maurice, and that appellant and Mr. Stevenson then shot Wayne as he ran toward her car. Ms. Flemming testified further that both Mr. Stevenson and appellant shot at her car. Sean similarly testified that he observed appellant shoot Maurice, and that both appellant and Mr. Stevenson shot Wayne.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">With this evidence, a rational juror could infer that appellant and Mr. Stevenson had an understanding regarding the shooting of Maurice and Wayne. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s convictions for conspiracy to commit first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Transferred Intent and Kill Zone Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding transferred intent and kill zone, two theories that appellant asserts were inapplicable to the charges in this case. He notes that \u201cthe State made clear that it was not relying on either of these two theories in its prosecution of this case,\u201d asserting instead that appellant had the specific intent to kill Maurice and Wayne.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The State notes that there was no objection to the instructions below, and therefore, it argues that appellant has waived his right to appellate review of this issue. It urges this Court to decline to exercise plain error review of this issue. The State argues that \u201cthere was no error, much less plain error, because the evidence clearly generated the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The instructions that are the subject of appellant\u2019s challenge on appeal involved the charges of attempted murder, both first and second degree. The court instructed the jury, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">Attempted murder in the first degree is defined as taking a step, beyond mere preparation, towards the commission of murder in the first degree. In order to convict the Defendant of ... attempted murder in the first degree, the State must prove ... that the Defendant took a substantial step, beyond mere preparation, towards the commission of murder in the first degree, or that the Defendant aided and abetted another towards the commission of murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">Now, based on the totality of facts and circumstances in evidence before you, you may, but are not required to find, that where the nature and scope of an attack, while directed at a primary or primary victim or victims was intended to insure the harm to the primary victim or victims by harming everybody in their path, or everybody in the primary victim\u2019s vicinity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">For example, when one places a bomb on a commercial airplane intended to harm a primary target on board, that person insures by this method of attack that all passengers will be killed. In that instance, the perpetrator by such intentional conduct and action, has intentionally created a zone of harm or danger to insure the death of his primary victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">As you may, but are not required, to infer from the method and manner employed a concurrent intent to kill all in the intended victim\u2019s immediate vicinity so as to insure the primary victim\u2019s death. This is true without regard to whether or not the intended victim was, in fact, killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">And if you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the conduct that created the zone of danger was done willfully and with premeditation and deliberation, with intent to kill the primary actor, you may, but are not required, if you find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was a substantial step beyond mere preparation towards the commission of murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">And that the Defendant had the apparent ability at the time to commit the crime of murder in the first degree, or that he aided and abetted another who had the apparent ability at the time to commit the crime of murder in the first degree; and ... that the Defendant created a zone of danger or aided and abetted another who created a zone of harm or danger as I instructed you, and that harm of danger was done willfully, and with premeditation and deliberation with intent to kill a primary actor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">If you find that, then all persons in that zone of harm you may, but are not required to find, attempted murder in the first degree. Does everybody understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Now this is with regard to attempted second degree murder. When a person or persons engage in a shooting in a crowded urban city area, they collectively trigger an escalating chain reaction that creates a high risk to human life. Each participant displays a wanton and depraved indifference to any human life that may randomly fall within their overlap and deadly encounter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">Should death to an unintended victim or to an innocent bystander ensue, each participant in the illegal encounter has exhibited conduct that qualifies him for a depraved heart. Now this applies only to second degree murder and attempted second degree murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">On August 3, 2009, the court, in response to a jury question, again instructed the jury regarding first and second degree murder. The court repeated its zone of danger instruction regarding the first degree murder charge, stating, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">[Y]ou can find first-degree murder [ ] one of two ways. And a death that was caused by the Defendant that was willful, deliberate, and premeditated as instructed by me a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>moments ago, or you could find a death that was caused by the Defendant willfully, and in which the nature and scope of an attack, while directed at a specific person or persons known as the primary victim, where the nature and scope of that attack was intended to ensure harm or death to the primary actor by harming or killing everyone that was in the primary victim\u2019s, or the intended victim\u2019s, vicinity. That replaces, you must find an intent to kill, but that replaces the need for deliberation and premeditation. Does everybody understand that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The court proceeded to instruct the jury on second degree murder, making no mention of kill zone or transferred intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We address first the State\u2019s claim that appellant failed to preserve his objection to the instruction. As previously noted, Maryland Rule 4-325(e) requires a party to object to a jury instruction \u201cpromptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d Appellant failed to argue, as he does on appeal, that the court\u2019s instructions were not applicable based on the facts of this case. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s contention is not preserved for review. <em>See Alston, </em>414 Md. at 110-11, 994 A.2d 896 (failure to object to instruction at trial precludes review of claim of error on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">With respect to appellant\u2019s request that we exercise plain error review of the trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding transferred intent and kill zone, we have made clear that such requests are not routinely granted. This Court recently discussed the plain error review analysis in <em>Kelly, </em>195 Md.App. at 432, 6 A.3d 396, where we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201c \u2018[P]lain-error review' \u2014 involves four steps, or prongs. First, there must be an error or defect \u2014 some sort of \u2018[deviation from a legal rule\u2019 \u2014 that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned, i.e., affirmatively waived, by the appellant. Second, the legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. Third, the error must have affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means he must demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>strate that it \u2018affected the outcome of the [ ] court proceedings.\u2019 Fourth and finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error \u2014 discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 Meeting all four prongs is difficult, \u2018as it should be.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">(quoting <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 578, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010)). We have explained that plain error review is a \u201c \u2018rare, rare phenomenon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly, </em>195 Md.App. at 432, 6 A.3d 396 (quoting <em>Hammersla v.

Appellant has not even attempted to show how this instruction, even if erroneous, affected the outcome of the proceedings to his detriment. The instructions at issue were given with respect to the charges of attempted first degree murder, attempted second degree murder, and first degree murder, charges on which appellant was found not guilty.
