We agree and therefore vacate the judgment of the circuit court and, for the reasons set forth below, direct that a verdict of guilty of theft of property worth less than $500 be entered and that appellant then be sentenced on that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">On August 28, 2008, John Englehart, Sr., reported a burglary at his home in Columbia, Maryland. Among the items he reported stolen was a Dell Inspiron laptop computer. After the laptop was recovered from appellant\u2019s home, he was charged with first- and fourth-degree burglary and theft of property (the laptop) with a value of $500 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The only evidence of the laptop\u2019s value was the testimony of Englehart, who, at trial, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">[Prosecutor]: What was the approximate value of that laptop computer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">[Englehart]: I think I bought it originally for probably about \u2014 with all the \u2014 the loaded software and all on it for about sixteen, eighteen hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">[Prosecutor]: When had you \u2014 or how old was it, if you k,now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">[Englehart]: About \u2014 about three years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">[Prosecutor]: About three years old?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">[Englehart]: Mmm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">When the jury returned a guilty verdict on the count alleging theft of property with a value of $500 or more but was unable to reach a verdict on either the first- or fourth-degree burglary counts, the State entered a nolle prosequi as to each of those counts. Appellant was thereafter sentenced to a term of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to a sentence he was currently serving for violating his probation in an unrelated case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">Because appellant concedes that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to convict him of the theft of the computer, the sole issue, on appeal, is whether the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the value of the laptop at the time of the theft was $500 or more.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>that, although the jury heard evidence as to what Englehart paid for the computer three years before it was stolen, \u201cthere was no effort to determine the fair market value of the three-year-old computer, nor was there any effort to show what Mr. Englehart would have had to pay to replace his three-year-old computer\u201d at the time of trial. Consequently, the evidence was not sufficient, insists appellant, to establish that the computer was worth $500 or more at the time of the theft. The State contends otherwise, asserting that the jury was \u201cfree to make a fair inference of market value based on evidence regarding the original purchase price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Under Maryland\u2019s consolidated theft statute that was in effect at the time of the theft at issue, felony theft, as opposed to misdemeanor theft, was a theft of property or services with a value of $500 or more. Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 7-104(g) of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cValue\u201d was (and still is) defined in section 7-103 of the Criminal Law Article, as \u201cthe market value of the property or service at the time and place of the crime\u201d or, \u201cif the market value cannot satisfactorily be ascertained, the cost of the replacement of the property or service within a reasonable time after the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">To determine whether the evidence was sufficient, we must decide \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664 (2003) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (additional citations omitted). In making that decision, we \u201cgive great deference to the trier of facts\u2019 opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, and resolve conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 311, 329, 827 A.2d 124 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The present market value of stolen property may be proven by direct or circumstantial evidence and any reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. <em>Wallace v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 399, 410, 492 A.2d 970 (1985) (\u201c[T]he test for the value of stolen goods is market value, but proof of market value \u2018may be indirect as well as direct.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Vucci v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 694, 701, 284 A.2d 646 (1971))) (citations omitted). Moreover, a property owner\u2019s testimony regarding the original purchase price is \u201ccircumstantially relevant to the present market value\u201d of that property. <em>Id. </em>at 410-11, 492 A.2d 970. Thus, Englehart\u2019s testimony as to the original purchase price was relevant to the determination of the market value at the time of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">It does not follow, however, that his testimony, alone, was sufficient to establish that the value of the three-year-old computer was, in fact, over $500 at the time of the theft. It is \u201ccommon knowledge,\u201d the Court of Appeals has observed, \u201cthat in the field of computer technology advances are constantly being made so that used equipment depreciates in value over relatively short periods of time.\u201d <em>In re Christopher R., </em>348 Md. 408, 412-13, 704 A.2d 443 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Nor is Maryland alone in acknowledging the difficulties in assessing the value of computer equipment at the time of theft because of the rapid decline in the value of such equipment. Florida\u2019s Fourth District Court of Appeal recently observed that \u201c[e]lectrical components\u201d such as \u201ccomputers ... are subject to accelerated obsolescence because manufacturers are constantly releasing new, improved technology at lower prices.\u201d <em>Lucky v. State, </em>25 So.3d 691, 692 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.2010). \u201cFor this reason,\u201d it concluded, the \u201cpurchase price alone is generally insufficient to establish the value of such property in theft cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">No less significant, for our purposes, is an.earlier observation by another Florida District Court of Appeal, the Fifth District, that \u201ccomputer equipment can become obsolete very quickly\u201d and that, consequently, \u201ctestimony as to the manner in which the items had been used, its general condition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>quality, or its depreciation percentage\u201d was warranted. <em>Doane v. State, </em>847 So.2d 1015, 1018 (Fla. 5th Dist.Ct.App.2003). No such testimony was presented here, and, like the Florida appellate courts, we believe that its absence left the claimed value of the equipment at issue, namely $500 or more, unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">We, therefore, conclude that Englehart\u2019s testimony as to the price he paid for his computer three years earlier was insufficient to establish that its value was $500 or more at the time it was stolen. In so holding, we acknowledge that there are cases, of course, where the value of a stolen item is so obvious or so clearly within the common knowledge and experience of the jury, <em>see, e.g., Angulo-Gil v. State, </em>198 Md.App. 124, 153, 16 A.3d 283 (2011) (\u201c[W]e are convinced that a jury reasonably may conclude that, in April 2007, a one year-old operable Ford Focus was worth more than $500.\u201d), or where the item stolen is manifestly not subject to rapid depreciation or obsolescence, <em>see, e.g., State v. Spikes, </em>111 Conn.App. 543, 961 A.2d 426, 433 (2008) (\u201cUnlike the situation with electronic equipment, which is generally subject to prompt depreciation, we have recognized that jewelry may appreciate in value.\u201d); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>805 A.2d 919, 928 (D.C.2002) (\u201cUnlike the electrical goods, ... [the] jewelry was not subject to \u2018prompt depreciation or obsolescence.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>People v. Womble, </em>111 A.D.2d 283, 489 N.Y.S.2d 521 (N.Y.App.Div.1985) (noting that jewelry is the \u201csort [of property] not \u2018subject to prompt depreciation or obsolescence\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Commonwealth v. Parsons, </em>233 Pa.Super. 419, 335 A.2d 800, 805 n. 5 (1975) (\u201c[J]ewelry is one of the few types of goods that does not usually depreciate in value with use and age.\u201d), that such evidence is unnecessary. But that, as we have pointed out, is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Although we conclude that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that the value of the laptop computer was $500 or more at the time of the theft, there is, as appellant acknowledges, no need for a new trial as to whether appellant was guilty of theft of property worth less than $500. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Theft of property worth less than $500 is a lesser included offense of theft of property worth $500 or more, <em>see Hagans v. State, </em>316 Md. 429, 438, 559 A.2d 792 (1989), and, because \u201ca conviction for a greater offense constitutes a finding of guilt for all lesser included offenses,\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>412 Md. 150, 165, 985 A.2d 1204 (2009) (citing <em>Brooks v. State, </em>314 Md. 585, 601, 552 A.2d 872 (1989)), he was, in fact, convicted of that offense. Consequently, as appellant requests, we direct that the judgment in the circuit court be vacated, that a verdict of guilty of the lesser included offense of theft of property worth less than $500 be entered, and that appellant be sentenced on that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">JUDGMENT VACATED.
