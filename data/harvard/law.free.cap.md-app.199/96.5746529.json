EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">On October 6, 2009, Michael Turkes, Jr., appellant, was tried on a not guilty agreed statement of facts in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on charges of possession of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. That trial followed an October 2, 2009 motions hearing, during which the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. Ultimately, the court found appellant guilty of both charges. On January 8, 2010, the court sentenced appellant to twenty years of imprisonment, suspending all but eighteen months in favor of five years of supervised probation. Appellant then appealed to this Court, challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">The following facts were adduced at the motions hearing. On May 2, 2009, at approximately 11:45 a.m., Officer Anthony Smith was patrolling the 6400 block of Greig Street in Prince George\u2019s County, when he observed a brown Cadillac with dark-tinted windows drive past him.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Officer Smith\u2019s testimony concerning the events that transpired was as follows. The tint on the Cadillac was so dark that Officer Smith could not see who was in the vehicle. Suspecting that the tint was darker than legally permissible, Officer Smith pulled in behind the Cadillac and activated his emergency equipment to make a traffic stop. The Cadillac pulled over immediately, and Officer Smith parked at an angle behind it. Officer Smith\u2019s vehicle was about one-half of a car length from the Cadillac, canted to the left a bit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Appellant, the driver of the Cadillac, then turned off the ignition, exited the driver\u2019s side of his car, and quickly started walking towards an apartment building. Officer Smith told appellant to get back in his vehicle. Appellant replied that he could not open the driver\u2019s side door, so Officer Smith ordered him to open the passenger\u2019s side door. Appellant did so, and, through the passenger\u2019s side door, unlocked all the car doors. Then, appellant walked back to the driver\u2019s side door. Officer Smith was standing next to appellant when appellant opened the driver\u2019s side door. When appellant opened the door, he quickly looked to the left towards a black bag in the door well, and then looked at Officer Smith nervously. This drew Officer Smith\u2019s attention to the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Officer Smith described the bag as a black plastic half-gallon sized bag (about 12 inches, or the size of a tissue box). He testified that the bag had mass to it, and that the mass was about the size of a soda can, three to four inches in diameter. At that time, Officer Smith thought that the bag could contain \u201ca weapon, ... drugs, or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Officer Smith then asked appellant for his driver\u2019s license and registration and told appellant that he was stopped because of the tint on his windows. Officer Smith advised appellant that, after receiving a ticket for a repair order, appellant would be free to leave. Officer Smith then told appellant to roll down his windows for safety purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Officer Smith returned to his police car, informed the dispatcher of his location, and called for backup assistance. He noticed that appellant was looking through his rear view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>mirror and side view mirrors and pushing or raising up from his seat, with his head going toward the ceiling. According to Officer Smith, those movements seemed \u201cextremely suspicious.\u201d With the windows down, Officer Smith could see into appellant\u2019s car, but he could not see appellant\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Shortly thereafter, Officer Ivey arrived on the scene to provide backup assistance. Officer Smith and Officer Ivey approached appellant\u2019s vehicle. Officer Smith was on the driver\u2019s side, and Officer Ivey was on the passenger\u2019s side. Officer Smith asked appellant to step out of the vehicle to sign the citation. Officer Smith testified as to why he thought it was important to have appellant exit the car to sign the repair order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">Due to the initial traffic stop, in exiting the vehicle, while he was under lights and sirens, his nervous behavior, by looking at the bag when he opened the door; the furtive movements in the seat, pushing up from his seat; and continuously looking back through his rearview mirror, coupled with those movements, were very suspicious and there could possibly be a weapon in the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">As appellant opened the door to get out of his car and sign the repair order, Officer Smith noticed that the black bag was no longer in the door well of the driver\u2019s side door. Appellant followed Officer Smith to Officer Smith\u2019s police vehicle, and Officer Smith told appellant that he would be free to go once he signed a repair order for the tinted windows. Appellant signed the order. Officer Smith testified that appellant was not in fact free to leave; that he had only told appellant he would be free so that appellant would get out of the vehicle without incident, but that he intended to check the vehicle because he suspected it contained weapons or drugs. Officer Smith explained that he was in the middle of an investigative stop at that point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">I\u2019m investigating his furtive movements, him exiting the vehicle quickly against my lights and sirens, him nervously looking at a black bag in the door well that had mass to it, the black bag has now disappeared from the door well when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>he opens the door the second time, as well as him raising up in his seat, pushing with his head going towards the ceiling and nervously, continuously, over a five-minute time, looking back through his rearview mirror and side view mirror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Before appellant could walk back to his car, Officer Smith asked appellant if there was anything in the vehicle that he needed to know about. Appellant said no. Officer Smith said that he would check, and according to Officer Smith, appellant consented. Appellant stood with Officer Ivey while Officer Smith checked the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Officer Smith checked the \u201cwing span\u201d area of the Cadillac, including the door wells, the space beneath the seats, the dash, and the center console. He could not find the black bag that had been in the door well. Officer Smith returned to appellant and asked him where the black bag was that had been in the door well. Appellant answered that the bag was trash, and that it was underneath the seat. Officer Smith returned to appellant\u2019s car and searched the passenger compartment again, but could find no bag. Again, Officer Smith asked appellant where the bag was. According to Officer Smith, appellant replied, \u201cwhat bag, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Officer Smith testified that, at that point, he thought that \u201cwhatever was in that bag, whether it could be a weapon or knife, or drugs, or anything, ... it was now on [appellant].\u201d Officer Smith thus asked appellant to place both hands on the hood of the police car so that Officer Smith could perform a pat-down search for weapons. Using an open hand, Officer Smith began patting appellant down. As Officer Smith\u2019s hand came up the inside of appellant\u2019s leg, towards the crotch area, appellant pulled his hand from the hood of the car. Officer Smith asked appellant to put his hand back on the car, and began the pat-down again. As Officer Smith\u2019s hand approached appellant\u2019s crotch area, Officer Smith felt \u201ca very hard object\u201d in between appellant\u2019s legs. When Officer Smith pressed upwards on the hard object, appellant pushed off of the car and began to run. Officer Smith grabbed appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>and they fell to the ground. Officer Ivey assisted in restraining appellant, who was resisting. Officer Smith told appellant that he was under arrest, and the two officers handcuffed him behind his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Once appellant was handcuffed, Officer Smith conducted another search of appellant, who was sitting on the curb between the Cadillac and the police vehicle. As a result of the search, Officer Smith found \u201c[flour hundred ... glassine baggies, a razor blade, and 40 grams of crack cocaine, as well as the black bag that was in the door well of the Cadillac.\u201d Officer Smith described the search as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">[Officer Smith]: ... After [appellant] was placed in the handcuffs, we turned him over on his \u2014 for him to sit on his butt, and I undid the front of his pants, opened it up. And down on the \u2014 where I felt the hard object, I saw that there was a very large bulge there. I pulled the inside \u2014 on his left leg, I pulled up his underwear there and I could see the black bag, and I pulled it out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">[Prosecutor]: ... You said that you unbuttoned his pants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGa\">[Officer Smith]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">[Prosecutor]: Was his pants or his underwear removed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">[Officer Smith]: No, sir. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">[Prosecutor]: Were they pulled down in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">[Officer Smith]: They weren\u2019t pulled down, but they were opened. He had \u2014 I believe he had a button fly, so I completely undid them, yes, sir. But I didn\u2019t pull them off of his body, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">[Prosecutor]: Were any of his private parts exposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ak-dedup-0\">[Officer Smith]: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">[Prosecutor]: When you reached in, you said that you reached in through the underwear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">[Officer Smith]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">[Prosecutor]: Officer, can you describe where the item was found in relation to the Defendant\u2019s body and how you went into his pants area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>[Officer Smith]: The item was found underneath his scrotum. I went in, down his left pants leg. So I undid his buttons as far down as I could, opened his pants leg, reached in overhand, over the top of the underwear, from the \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to explain it. From the bottom piece of his underwear, I went in through the bottom and pulled out the bag and pulled it up and out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">[Prosecutor]: At any time did you see, or were you able to see his \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 his penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">[Officer Smith]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">[Prosecutor]: And was anyone else able to see his penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq6\">[Officer Smith]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">[Prosecutor]: At the time that you did the search was anyone else in this area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">[Officer Smith]: No, sir. Only Officer Ivey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">On cross-examination, Officer Smith testified that the traffic stop occurred about 7-8 blocks from the police department, which is about a five minute drive. He explained that four to five buildings of garden style apartments were approximately 40 yards from the street, with about 15 windows on each building facing the street. On the other side of the street, there were five single-family homes. It was a sunny day, around 11:45 a.m., when the traffic stop occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Appellant\u2019s testimony at the motions hearing conflicted substantially with Officer Smith\u2019s. Appellant testified that, as soon as he parked, he saw a police vehicle make a u-turn and drive towards him. Appellant stated that he had already gotten out of his car and walked to the door of an apartment when Officer Smith turned on his lights and ordered him to go back to his car. Appellant also testified that there never was a black bag visible in the door well and that Officer Smith just made up the fact that he saw the bag in the door well as an \u201cexcuse ... for [the] search.\u201d Further, appellant claimed that he never gave Officer Smith consent to search the vehicle. Appellant also denied running from the officers during the pat-down. Appellant testified that he was uncomfortable when Officer Smith began unbuckling his pants, so he pushed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Officer Smith off of him. In other words, appellant was not trying to resist or leave, but was merely reacting to an uncomfortable search.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Appellant\u2019s account of the subsequent search of his person also differs substantially from Officer Smith\u2019s. On direct examination, appellant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">[Appellant]: ... [F]or the record, I had on boxer briefs, not boxers. It was hard to go under boxer briefs, you know. So he pulled my \u2014 he unbuckled my pants. He had my pants halfway down while I was sitting on the curb, with my boxer briefs down, and that\u2019s how he went under my scrotum, underneath my scrotum area and everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIH\">[Defense Counsel]: Now, when you say unbuckled your pants, what did he do \"with your pants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">[Appellant]: Well, as I\u2019m in restraints, he unbuckled my pants and he unloosened my belt. I had fly buttons. He unbuttoned those. Then he pulls them down. And then, he also pulls my boxer briefs down -with them. That\u2019s when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-6\">[Defense Counsel]: He pulls them? How far down does he pull these?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">[Appellant]: I\u2019d say about, mid-like, close to my \u2014 close to like, or parallel to my scrotum area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">[Defense Counsel]: So you\u2019re saying your pants and your boxers were both pulled down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">[Appellant]: As I was sitting on the curb, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">[Defense Counsel]: And you\u2019re telling me that this area was completely exposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">[Defense Counsel]: And for the record, the area where \u2014 or what bodily parts are there that were completely exposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aem\">[Appellant]: My scrotum and my penis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">[Defense Counsel]: They were completely visible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoQ\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-15\">[Defense Counsel]: Your penis was completely visible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"at-dedup-0\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: Your testicles completely visible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"al-dedup-0\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">[Defense Counsel]: Your pubic hair\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 was completely visible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">[Defense Counsel]: And it was right there on Greig Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACz\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Was there anything blocking you while \u2014 well, was the cruiser blocking you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">[Appellant]: No. I was actually in between the \u2014 this is the cruiser, and you could say this is my car, so I was actually sitting here, in between, like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">[Defense Counsel]: Was you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">[Appellant]: There was no blockage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-14\">[Defense Counsel]: was your penis, all your private parts, were they completely visible to all of these windows\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-15\">[Appellant]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-16\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 the 60 or so windows\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-17\">[Appellant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-18\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 of the apartments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-19\">[Appellant]: Yes. Well, you could say the houses, because my back was towards the apartments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-20\">[Defense Counsel]: Your back was. But they were completely visible to all the apartments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-21\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-22\">[Defense Counsel]: And you\u2019re telling me that it wasn\u2019t a reaching under, that he actually pulled down\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-23\">[Appellant]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-24\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 your underwear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-25\">[Appellant]: You can\u2019t reach under boxer briefs when they fit tight to your leg.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>At the close of the hearing, the court concluded that neither the initial stop nor the search of appellant\u2019s person was illegal. With respect to the stop, the court stated simply that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">It appears to the Court that the officer believed that the tint was too dark, that there was no other reason for the stop, and that the officer did have a reasonable and articulable suspicion of the violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Turning to the question of the search of appellant\u2019s person, the court made several findings. First, the court deemed credible Officer Smith\u2019s testimony that \u201cafter being stopped by the police ... [appellant] was observed moving about in the car in a suspicious manner and that he appeared very nervous and that at one point he tried to flee.\u201d Further, the court \u201cbelieve[d] that the officer had seen a black bag in the car, ... and that it was no longer there after the defendant had been left in the car with it,\u201d which \u201ccaused [Officer Smith] a great deal of concern.\u201d To that end, the court discredited appellant\u2019s testimony that \u201cthere was never a black bag in the door, [and] that the officer never saw this bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">With respect to the bag\u2019s appearance, the court found that \u201cthe bag, which has been described as the length and size of a Kleenex box ... was not just a ... small baggie that would be likely to be drugs; but that this was large enough that it could [contain] weapons as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In terms of the reasonableness of the search, the court noted that \u201cthe search does need to be considered under all of the factors such as the scope of the intrusion, the manner it was conducted in, the justification that initiated it and the place that it was conducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">First, the court found that \u201cthe search was really a reach in,\u201d acknowledging the \u201cbig difference between the officer\u2019s testimony and [appellant\u2019s] testimony\u201d on this point. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">The officer testified that during the pat down he felt an object that was in [appellant\u2019s] pants, and that the officer then unbuckled his belt and unbuttoned the pants, opened the pants, reached into [appellant\u2019s] underwear \u2014 and I be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>lieve that it was between the underwear and the skin \u2014 and he reached down to [appellant\u2019s] scrotum to remove the bag that [appellant] had hidden on his body, but on his scrotum. The Court is not convinced that the defendant is being truthful in testifying that the police pulled his pants down so that all of his genitals were exposed, and that the police, with his bare hand, reached into his underwear and to pull out the bag. I\u2019m betting that this was not a bare hand that reached in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">With respect to the place of search, the court found that the search occurred \u201cright there on a city street, in broad daylight, near residences. There\u2019s houses across the street and apartments to the back of [appellant].\u201d Further, the court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">although no person was identified as having people standing in and around and observing this, or who were watching it from some other site, it\u2019s certainly reasonable to assume that someone, either in cars driving by or in any of the homes, could have observed this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Thus, the court concluded that \u201cthe location [was] certainly not [one] of any privacy whatsoever to [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Nevertheless, the court deemed Officer Smith\u2019s justification for the public search reasonable. Specifically, the court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">the police, upon determining that [appellant] had some type of an object in his pants \u2014 and that it was not his own natural body parts \u2014 had reason to be concerned that this may be a weapon. You know, like a razor blade, if not a gun____ [T]his, again, was not a small baggie that would just indicate that there were just drugs in it; that this was larger, that this was more substantial, and it has been described as one that caused the police officer to be concerned that it could be a weapon as likely as any other object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">The court then concluded that if Officer Smith had merely suspected that the hard object could be drugs, the search would have been unreasonable because, under that scenario, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>appellant could simply have been transported to a less public place. But because the officer feared there may have been a weapon involved, \u201cthe concern for [appellant\u2019s] privacy loses out to the greater concerns as to the safety of the officers and anyone else who may [have been] in any danger\u201d if appellant had in fact possessed a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Thus, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Appellant challenges that denial on appeal. Additional facts will be incorporated as necessary in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We defer to the trial court\u2019s fact-findings at the suppression hearing unless the findings were clearly erroneous. <em>Bailey v. State, </em>412 Md. 349, 362, 987 A.2d 72 (2010). Where the court\u2019s fact-findings are either \u201c(1) ambiguous, (2) incomplete, or (3) non-existent[,]\u201d the appellate Court can turn to the following \u201csupplemental rule of interpretation\u201d in order to \u201cfill those fact-finding gaps[:]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">In determining whether the evidence was sufficient, as a matter of law, to support the ruling, the appellate court will accept that version of the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party. It will fully credit the prevailing party\u2019s witnesses and discredit the losing party\u2019s witnesses. It will give maximum weight to the prevailing party\u2019s evidence and little or no weight to the losing party\u2019s evidence. It will resolve ambiguities and draw inferences in favor of the prevailing party and against the losing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\"><em>Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 489-90, 837 A.2d 248 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">The suppression hearing court\u2019s legal determinations, unlike its fact-findings, are paid no deference on review. <em>See Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 569, 774 A.2d 420 (2001) (\u201cWe will review the legal questions <em>de novo </em>and based upon the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the applicable law, we then make our own constitutional appraisal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">Appellant offers five arguments on appeal: (1) the traffic stop was initiated without reasonable articulable suspicion; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>appellant was held after the purpose of the initial traffic stop ended and was thus subject to a \u201csecond stop,\u201d which was not supported by reasonable articulable suspicion; (3) the search of appellant\u2019s car was not supported by reasonable articulable suspicion; (4) the frisk of appellant was not supported by reasonable articulable suspicion; and (5) appellant was improperly strip-searched in a public area.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Only the first and fifth arguments were made at trial. Thus, appellant has waived the remaining three arguments, and they are not properly before us on appeal. This Court has held that the failure to argue a specific theory in support of a motion waives that argument on appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any [non-jurisdictional] issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court....\u201d); <em>Evans v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 549, 557, 922 A.2d 620 (2007). Nevertheless, for completeness, we consider the merits of the unpreserved arguments and conclude that, were they preserved, they would lack merit. For ease of analysis, we have consolidated appellant\u2019s second, third, and fourth arguments into one.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>1. Reasonable Suspicion in Support of the Initial Traffic Stop</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Appellant argues that the initial traffic stop was not supported by a reasonable articulable suspicion, and thus \u201cany evidence flowing there from should have been suppressed at trial.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">When an officer observes a vehicle that is in violation of window tint regulations, the officer may stop the driver of the vehicle and, in addition to issuing a citation charging the driver with the offense, may issue to the driver a safety repair order. <em>State v. Williams, </em>401 Md. 676, 934 A.2d 38 (2007). In <em>Williams, </em>the Court of Appeals summarized Maryland law requirements as to vehicle window tinting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">The amalgam of these statutes and the MVA-ASED regulation is that (1) post-manufacture tinting is permissible pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>vided that it allows at least 35% light transmittance and other conditions set forth in the regulation, including the requirement that a label stating the percentage of light transmittance be permanently attached to the window between the glass and the tinting material, are satisfied, but (2) if a police officer observes a vehicle being driven on a highway that is not in compliance with those requirements, the officer may stop the vehicle and issue both a citation for the traffic offense and a vehicle equipment repair order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACp\"><em>Id. </em>at 685, 934 A.2d 38. The Court in <em>Williams </em>explained that a traffic stop is justified under the Fourth Amendment if the officer has a reasonable articulable suspicion that a traffic law has been violated. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 934 A.2d 38. In the absence of objective measurement of the tint, which may not be feasible prior to a stop, the following standard applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">If an officer chooses to stop a car for a tinting violation based solely on the officer\u2019s visual observation of the window, that observation has to be in the context of what a properly tinted window, compliant with the 35% requirement, would look like. If the officer can credibly articulate that difference, a court could find reasonable articulable suspicion, but not otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 692, 934 A.2d 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Further, applicable regulations require that a label or sticker be placed on a window that has post-manufacturing tinting. <em>Id. </em>Thus, if an officer stops a car based solely on visual inspection, the officer could check the car for an inspection sticker to determine whether the sticker indicates that the tint is in compliance with the law. <em>Id. </em>at 692 n. 3, 934 A.2d 38. If there is no reason to believe the sticker is not genuine, there would be no reason to continue detaining the motorist. <em>Id. </em>However, if there is no label, or the label appears to be not genuine, \u201cthat alone may justify a citation ..., a repair order, and some further investigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In this case, Officer Smith stopped appellant on a sunny morning. Officer Smith testified that, when he saw appellant\u2019s vehicle, he was unable to see into the vehicle at all to tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the number of occupants in the car or to distinguish movement in the car. He also did not see an inspection sticker on the tint. He testified that he had approximately 8 to 10 seconds to observe the car before initiating a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Those facts justified the stop, especially in light of Officer Smith\u2019s training and experience in recognizing legally tinted windows. Officer Smith testified that he was familiar with the appearance of a legal tint at 35% and had observed the difference between legal and non-legal tints during traffic stop training at the police academy. He also had conducted at least 100 traffic stops for tinted windows. Officer Smith noted that, based on his training and experience, if a window\u2019s tint is legal, a person should be able to see into the window because sunlight can get through. We affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the stop was supported by a reasonable articulable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\n<em>2. Reasonable Articulable Suspicion to Support a \u201cSecond Stop, \u201d a Search of Appellant\u2019s Vehicle, and a Frisk of Appellant\u2019s Person</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Appellant argues that (1) Officer Smith \u201ccontinued to hold [appellant] after the purpose of the original stop was effectuated, thereby conducting an unlawful \u2018second stop[,]\u2019 [which was] unsupported by reasonable suspicion or probable cause[;]\u201d (2) the search of appellant\u2019s car was not supported by reasonable articulable suspicion; and (3) the frisk of appellant was not supported by reasonable articulable suspicion. Although these arguments were not preserved for appeal, we address their merits below.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 735 A.2d 491 (1999),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANy\">the officer\u2019s purpose in an ordinary traffic stop is to enforce the laws of the roadway, and ordinarily to investigate the manner of driving with the intent to issue a citation or warning. Thus, once the underlying basis for the initial traffic stop has concluded, a police-driver encounter which implicates the Fourth Amendment is constitutionally per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>missible only if either (1) the driver consents to the continuing intrusion or (2) the officer has, at a minimum, a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. 355 Md. at 372, 735 A.2d 491 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We agree that appellant was subjected to a \u201csecond stop\u201d because Officer Smith continued to detain appellant after appellant signed the citation for the tinting violation, which marked the conclusion of the initial stop. <em>See Id. </em>at 373, 735 A.2d 491 (\u201cWe conclude ... that the traffic stop essentially came to an end upon the trooper\u2019s delivery of the citation, and return of the driver\u2019s license and registration.\u201d); <em>Charity v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 598, 753 A.2d 556 (2000) (explaining that in <em>Ferris, </em>the initial traffic stop ended \u201c[a]t the moment when Trooper Smith returned Ferris\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration card to him and handed Ferris a copy of the speeding citation\u201d). However, we conclude that the \u201csecond stop\u201d in the case <em>sub judice </em>was supported by reasonable articulable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The reasonableness of any intrusion is based on an objective standard \u2014 \u201cwhether a reasonably prudent person in the officer\u2019s position would have been warranted in believing that ... criminal activity ... was afoot.\u201d <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 384, 735 A.2d 491. We shall not give weight to an officer\u2019s \u201cinchoate\u201d or \u201cunparticularized\u201d suspicion or mere \u201chunch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384-85, 735 A.2d 491 (citations omitted). Rather, we look for \u201cspecific reasonable inferences\u201d that the officer drew from the facts in light of his experience. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The concept of \u201creasonable articulable suspicion\u201d cannot be \u201creduced to a rigid analytical framework or a set of specific, bright-line rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, any determination of reasonable articulable suspicion must be based on the circumstances as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Factual circumstances that \u201c \u2018describe a very large category of presumably innocent travelers\u2019 cannot, in and of themselves, justify a seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 441, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980)). However, acts that might be innocent when viewed separately may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>provide a basis for reasonable suspicion when viewed together. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 9-10, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)). In <em>Ferris, </em>the Court of Appeals explained that <em>\u201cReid </em>and <em>Sokolow, </em>taken together, demonstrate [that] it is not enough that law enforcement officials can articulate reasons why they stopped someone if those reasons are not probative of behavior in which few innocent people would engage \u2014 the factors together must serve to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers before the requirement of reasonable suspicion will be satisfied.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">As discussed, Officer Smith\u2019s reasons for detaining appellant after appellant signed the citation were as follows: (1) the fact that appellant exited the vehicle when first pulled over; (2) the fact that appellant nervously looked in the door well at the black bag, which had mass to it, and then back at Officer Smith; (3) the fact that, while Officer Smith was in the police vehicle, appellant was \u201cnervously, continuously, over a five-minute time [period], looking back through his rearview mirror and his side view mirror[;]\u201d (4) the fact that Officer Smith could see from the police vehicle that appellant was \u201craising up in his seat, pushing up with his head going towards the ceiling[;]\u201d and (5) the fact that the black bag was missing from the door well when Officer Smith returned to appellant\u2019s vehicle and asked appellant to step out. The court made specific findings as to several of those factors, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">The Court finds credible testimony that after being stopped by the police ... [appellant] was observed moving about in the car in a suspicious manner and that he appeared very nervous and that at one point he tried to flee. The officer had \u2014 I believe had seen a black bag in the car, when he observed it, and that it was no longer there after [appellant] had been left in the car with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The court made no specific findings as to the remaining factors. We shall \u201cfill those fact-finding gaps\u201d by viewing the remaining factors in a light most favorable to the party that prevailed below \u2014 here, the State. <em>See Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. at 489-90, 837 A.2d 248. Accordingly, we accept as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>true <em>all </em>of Officer Smith\u2019s professed reasons for detaining appellant after he signed the citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">We conclude that, at the point where appellant signed the citation and the initial stop ended, those factors, in the aggregate, justified further detention. Although the factors, viewed individually, may not have given rise to a reasonable articula-ble suspicion, we discuss them separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Turning to the first factor (Officer Smith\u2019s testimony that appellant exited the vehicle after being pulled over) we note that the Court of Appeals held in <em>Ransome v. State, </em>373 Md. 99, 816 A.2d 901 (2003), that an officer\u2019s testimony was <em>not </em>supported by sufficient articulable facts, in part because the defendant \u201cdid not take evasive action or attempt to flee.\u201d 373 Md. at 110, 816 A.2d 901 (emphasis added). In contrast, appellant in the case <em>sub judice </em>did exit the vehicle \u201cquickly against [Officer Smith\u2019s] lights and sirens,\u201d locking the driver\u2019s side door.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The next two factors concern appellant\u2019s nervousness during the stop. In <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 497, 698 A.2d 1115 (1997), we explained that \u201c[t]he nervousness, or lack of it, of the driver pulled over by a Maryland State trooper is not sufficient to form the basis of police suspicion that the driver is engaged in the illegal transport of drugs.\u201d 116 Md.App. at 505, 698 A.2d 1115. In finding no reasonable articulable suspicion to support a second stop, the Court of Appeals in <em>Ferris </em>cited <em>Whitehead </em>and a long list of cases in other jurisdictions, in which courts have cautioned against placing too much reliance on a suspect\u2019s nervousness when analyzing reasonable suspicion. 355 Md. at 387-89, 735 A.2d 491. The <em>Ferris </em>Court held that \u201cthe case at bar is not one where the suspect\u2019s nervousness can fairly be characterized as especially \u2018dramatic,\u2019 or in some other way be objectively indicative of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 735 A.2d 491. The Court reasoned that the suspect\u2019s \u201cunexceptional nervousness, in reaction to encountering [the officer], was simply too ordinary to suggest criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also stated that the fact that the suspect and his passenger \u201cturned around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>three or four times to look back at [the officer] is hardly evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 735 A.2d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Thus, the fact that appellant nervously checked his rear and side view mirrors during the stop, standing alone, could not give rise to reasonable suspicion. Neither could appellant\u2019s general nervousness during the stop. Those considerations could fit \u201ca very large category of presumably innocent travelers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Reid, </em>448 U.S. at 441, 100 S.Ct. 2752). However, appellant\u2019s nervousness was not merely \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201cunexceptional\u201d nervousness. <em>Id. </em>Appellant\u2019s nervousness was piqued specifically by the black bag. Appellant\u2019s specific attention to the bag was more \u201cobjectively indicative of criminal activity\u201d than general nervousness during a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">When combined with the factors above, the last two factors-appellant\u2019s raising up in his seat, and the black bag\u2019s removal from the door well-provided a basis for reasonable suspicion. Appellant was nervous about the black bag, was shifting around when left alone in his car, and had removed the bag from the door well by the time Officer Smith returned to the car. \u201c[P]resumably innocent travelers\u201d would not engage in that behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s argument that the search of his car was not supported by reasonable suspicion. Citing to <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983), the Court of Appeals in <em>McDowell v. State, </em>407 Md. 327, 965 A.2d 877 (2009), stated that reasonable suspicion may justify the search of the passenger compartment of a vehicle. 407 Md. at 335, 965 A.2d 877. The standard articulated in <em>Michigan v. Long </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">[T]he search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the officers in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain control of weapons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>463 U.S. at 1049, 103 S.Ct. 3469 (citations omitted). The same factors that justified detention after the initial stop ended justified the search of appellant\u2019s car. As discussed above, the court found that \u201cthe bag ... was large enough that it could [contain] weapons as well [as drugs].\u201d Officer Smith was thus justified in suspecting that \u201cthere could possibly be a weapon in the vehicle,\u201d and the search of appellant\u2019s car was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The frisk of appellant\u2019s person was also legal. The Court of Appeals has reiterated the standard for conducting a frisk for weapons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">Where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous ... and where nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear for his own or others\u2019 safety, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him. Such a search is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\"><em>McDowell, </em>407 Md. at 334-35, 965 A.2d 877 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The McDowell Court explained further that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">In justifying the need for the particular intrusion, \u2018the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the intrusion\u2019 and, in assessing whether the officer has done so, the facts must be judged against an objective standard....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-9\"><em>McDowell, </em>407 Md. at 334, 965 A.2d 877 (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Officer Smith initiated a pat-down of appellant after noticing that the black bag was no longer in the door well, nor anywhere in the passenger compartment, and after appellant had lied to him about where the bag was and then claimed not to know anything about the bag at all. At that point, Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Smith worried that \u201cwhatever was in that bag, whether it could be a weapon or knife, or drugs, or anything, ... it was now on [appellant].\u201d Again, we emphasize the court\u2019s finding that the bag had bulk and was large enough to contain a weapon. Those \u201cspecific and articulable\u201d facts, when coupled with the factors discussed above that justified the \u201csecond stop,\u201d the search of appellant\u2019s vehicle, and the frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\n<em>3. Reasonableness of Strip-Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is that he was subjected to an illegal strip search. Though preserved for appeal, this argument lacks merit. To determine whether the search of appellant\u2019s person subsequent to his arrest was reasonable, we look to the following four factors set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979):(1) the scope of the intrusion; (2) the manner in which the search was conducted; (3) the justification for initiating the search; and (4) the place in which the search was conducted. <em>Allen v. State, </em>197 Md.App. 308, 323 (2011). <em>\u201cBell </em>requires a flexible approach, one that takes into account the relative strength of each factor\u201d and balances \u201cthe need for a particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\u201d <em>Paulino, </em>399 Md. 341, 355, 924 A.2d 308 (2007) (quoting <em>Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 599, 99 S.Ct. 1861).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The Court of Appeals applied the <em>Bell </em>factors to a search incident to arrest in <em>Paulino, </em>399 Md. at 355-61, 924 A.2d 308. In <em>Paulino, </em>police found drugs between Paulino\u2019s buttocks. <em>Id. </em>at 346-47, 924 A.2d 308. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe search of Paulino unreasonably infringed on his personal privacy interests when balanced against the legitimate needs of the police to seize the contraband that Paulino carried on his person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 924 A.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">With respect to the scope factor, an officer that searched Paulino described the search as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">[Detective Latchaw]: Well, when we \u2014 when Mr. Paulino was removed from the vehicle and laid on the ground, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>pants were already pretty much down around his \u2014 below his butt ... so it was just a matter of lifting up his shorts, and \u2014 and between his butt cheeks the drugs were \u2014 I believe one of the detectives actually put on a pair of gloves and just spread his cheeks apart a little bit and it was right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">[Defense Counsel]: So they were not visible before you actually spread his cheeks apart, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">[Detective Latehaw]: I don\u2019t think they were.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 346, 924 A.2d 308. Paulino offered a different version of the scope of search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">[Mr. Paulino]: They had searched me in my pockets, didn\u2019t find nothing, and eventually, they came to the subject where \u2014 in my report, it states that the officer said, Mr. Paulino, why is your butt cheeks squeezed? And in further response, I said nothing. He said it again, and another officers come behind with gloves and pulled my pants down and went in my ass. Well, my cheeks. Sorry about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_K\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On appeal, Paulino argued that \u201cthe scope of the intrusion involved in the [search of his person] was great[,]\u201d as he had to \u201csuffer the indignity of having an officer view his naked body\u201d and had to \u201cendure the humiliation of having an officer physically manipulate his buttocks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355-56, 924 A.2d 308. The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that \u201cthe police officers\u2019 search of Paulino was highly intrusive and demeaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 924 A.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Turning to the location and manner factors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court in <em>Paulino </em>noted that the search was conducted at night in a well-lit parking lot of a car wash within plain view of people who were not involved in the search itself. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 924 A.2d 308. The fact that members of the public were present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>was crucial in the Court\u2019s conclusion that the search location was illegal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">It is [the presence of members of the public], whether their view was obscured or otherwise, that makes the search of Paulino unnecessarily within the public view and thus viola-tive of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The State in <em>Paulino </em>described the justification for the search of Paulino as follows: \u201c... the police had sufficient cause to believe that the illegal narcotics Paulino was known to be possessing were actually being concealed in that place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 924 A.2d 308. The police had arrested Paulino pursuant to information provided by an informant. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 924 A.2d 308. The informant had told the police that Paulino would be at a certain location in Dundalk, Maryland that evening, and would be in possession of a quantity of controlled dangerous substance. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe informant also advised the police that Paulino typically hides the controlled dangerous substance in the area of his buttocks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the Court of Appeals in <em>Paulino </em>concluded that \u201cthe police officers were justified in initiating the search of Paulino[,]\u201d but that the officers were not justified in \u201csearching him to the extent he was searched under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 924 A.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In <em>Allen, </em>197 Md.App. at 312-13, officers performed searches incident to arrest on two defendants \u2014 Mr. Allen and Mr. Smith. The officers in <em>Allen </em>retrieved drugs from between the defendants\u2019 buttocks. <em>Id. </em>Like the Court of Appeals in <em>Paulino, </em>this Court applied the <em>Bell </em>factors to determine the legality of the searches. <em>Id. </em>at 323-27, 13 A.3d 801. Ultimately, we held that the searches were \u201creasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327,13 A.3d 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In terms of scope and manner,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the search of Mr. Allen was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Detective Beal ... first searched Mr. Allen\u2019s pockets and pant legs, and then he checked for \u2018slits in the waistband area of his pants,\u2019 but he did not find any narcotics. Detective Beal then pulled back Mr. Allen\u2019s pants and saw a plastic bag \u2018protruding\u2019 from between his buttocks. While holding the waistband of Mr. Allen\u2019s pants out, Officer Beal directed Mr. Allen to \u2018spread his legs and squat.\u2019 A bag dropped from between Mr. Allen\u2019s buttocks to \u2018his underwear area,\u2019 and Officer Beal \u2018reached in and pulled it out.\u2019 The bag contained 28 orange ziploc bags filled with narcotics. Officer Beal testified that he did not touch Mr. Allen while recovering the narcotics....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 312-13, 13 A.3d 801. The search of Mr. Smith was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">Detective Wiman pulled back the waistband of Mr. Smith\u2019s pants and saw \u2018a plastic baggy kind of coming up through ... his cheeks.\u2019 The bag was \u2018kind of half concealed\u2019 in Mr. Smith\u2019s buttocks area. Detective Wiman then \u2018reached down and pulled it out.\u2019 The bag contained 24 ziploc bags filled with narcotics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 313, 13 A.3d 801. The trial court in <em>Allen </em>\u201cfound the testimony of the police officers to be credible, specifically finding as a fact that no one but the officers conducting the searches could see inside appellants\u2019 pants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 13 A.3d 801. It also found that, \u201cwith respect to each appellant, his \u2018genitalia [was] not exposed, his anus [was not] exposed,\u2019 and the officer merely \u2018reached in\u2019 appellant\u2019s pants with \u2018no manipulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 13 A.3d 801. On appeal, this Court held that \u201cthe scope and manner of the searches were not unreasonable\u201d in part because \u201cthe police officers merely pulled the appellants\u2019 pants and underwear away from their waist, ... [appellants\u2019 clothing was not removed and the private areas of their bodies were not publicly exposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 13 A.3d 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">With respect to the location of the search, an officer in <em>Allen </em>described the search as follows: \u201cthere were a series of storage garages on one half of the block, which was divided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>a wide alley, and residential homes on the other side of the block.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 13 A.3d 801. The search in that case \u201cwas conducted near the storage garages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There were no civilians in the area, and no one, including the other officers present, could have observed the defendants\u2019 buttocks, especially because \u201cthe officer stood directly behind [each suspect] and he was the only one who could see appellants\u2019 buttocks during the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324-25, 13 A.3d 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In terms of justification for the searches in <em>Allen, </em>the officers arrested the defendants after the officers saw the defendants engaging in what the officers believed was a drug transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 312, 13 A.3d 801. We concluded that \u201cthe police had justification for the searches, given that they were \u2018incident to a lawful arrest for narcotics distribution, and it was reasonable for the police to believe that Mr. Allen and Mr. Smith were concealing drugs on their persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 13 A.3d 801. We reasoned that \u201cit is Veil known in the law enforcement community, and probably to the public at large, that drug traffickers often secrete drugs in body cavities to avoid detection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 13 A.3d 801 (quoting <em>Moore v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 695, 718 (2010)). After balancing the <em>Bell </em>factors, we held that the searches in <em>Allen </em>were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 13 A.3d 801.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>We now apply the <em>Bell </em>factors to the facts in the case <em>sub judiee. </em>In terms of scope and manner,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we agree with the trial court that the search of appellant was a \u201creach-in\u201d search, as opposed to a full-fledged strip search. \u201cA \u2018reach-in\u2019 search involves a manipulation of the arrestee\u2019s clothes such that the police are able to reach in and retrieve the contraband without exposing the arrestee\u2019s private areas.\u201d <em>Paulino, </em>399 Md. at 360 n. 6, 924 A.2d 308. In a \u201creach-in\u201d search, \u201cclothing is pulled away from the body but not removed.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>197 Md.App. at 322. By contrast, a strip search involves either \u201cthe removal of the arrestee\u2019s clothing for inspection of the under clothes and/or body,\u201d <em>State v. Nieves, </em>383 Md. 573, 586, 861 A.2d 62 (2004), or \u201cthe removal or rearrangement of some or all clothing to permit the visual inspection of the skin surfaces of the genital areas, breasts, and/or buttocks\u201d <em>Paulino, </em>399 Md. at 352-53, 924 A.2d 308 (quoting <em>Nieves, </em>383 Md. at 586, 861 A.2d 62). A \u201creach-in\u201d search where no one, including the officers, sees the defendant\u2019s private parts is, in some sense, less invasive than a full-blown strip search. <em>See Allen, </em>197 Md.App. at 322-23 (\u201cTo be sure, a \u2018reach-in\u2019 search may be less invasive than a search requiring a suspect to remove his or her clothing. To the extent that it <em>allows an officer to view a person\u2019s private areas, </em>however, it still is intrusive and demeaning.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court credited Officer Smith\u2019s description of the search and discredited appellant\u2019s. Thus, the court concluded that, like the officers in <em>Allen, </em>Officer Smith merely reached into appellant\u2019s underwear, rather than pulling the underwear down or otherwise exposing appellant\u2019s private parts to the public. The court also believed that, unlike in <em>Paulino, </em>neither officer even saw appellant\u2019s private parts themselves. Under the appropriate standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>review, we defer to those credibility findings. We thus conclude that the search in this case was merely a \u201creach-in\u201d search, during which appellant\u2019s private parts were visible to no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">With respect to the location of search in this case, we note that the search occurred in broad daylight in front of a public apartment complex and several single-family homes that faced the road on which the search occurred. The officers made no attempt to transport appellant to the police station, which was 7-8 blocks away. Appellant testified that, during the search, he was seated on the curb, facing the single-family homes and with his back to the apartments. Although he was seated in the space between his own vehicle and Officer Smith\u2019s vehicle, \u201c[t]here was no blockage\u201d <em>(ie., </em>he was not shielded from public view). Although, unlike in <em>Paulino, </em>no evidence suggests that members of the public were <em>in fact </em>present at the scene, residents of the apartments and houses on either side of the search, along with potential passerby, <em>could </em>potentially have viewed the scene. Thus, the location of the search was not a private location.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We must now weigh the scope, manner, and location of the search against the last <em>Bell </em>factor \u2014 -justification for the search. We hold that, in this ease, the exigency of the search outweighed any intrusion on appellant\u2019s privacy. In fact, the urgency of the search in this case was much greater than that in <em>Paulino </em>and <em>Allen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">First, in both <em>Paulino, </em>399 Md. at 356, 924 A.2d 308, and <em>Allen, </em>197 Md.App. at 312, 13 A.3d 801, the officers\u2019 purported justification for the search was that the officers believed the defendants were possessing illegal narcotics. In this case, Officer Smith was reasonably concerned that appellant had not only drugs, but a <em>weapon </em>on his person. More specifically, Officer Smith was confronted with the fact that the black bag, which was big enough to contain a weapon, was missing; that appellant had lied to him twice by telling him the bag was under the seat and then by telling him he did not know anything about a black bag; and that appellant resisted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>pat down and tried to flee when Officer Smith felt something hard in appellant\u2019s crotch area. Because Officer Smith reasonably suspected that appellant was hiding a weapon, an immediate and relatively intrusive search was warranted. Indeed, in holding that the public location of the search of Paulino was <em>not </em>justified by sufficiently exigent circumstances, the Court of Appeals in <em>Paulino </em>reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">There was no testimony at the suppression hearing ... that Paulino was attempting to destroy evidence, <em>nor that he possessed a weapon </em>such that an exigency was created that would have required the police officers to search Paulino at that precise moment and under the circumstances, in a Veil-lit\u2019 public car wash.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">399 Md. at 360, 924 A.2d 308 (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Smith, </em>345 Md. 460, 469, 693 A.2d 749 (1997) (\u201cWhere [a] pat-down reveals a hard object that the police officer reasonably believes may be a weapon, the officer may further intrude upon the individual to the extent necessary to seize the suspected weapon.\u201d). The fact that appellant\u2019s hands were cuffed behind his back does not alter our analysis. The officers could reasonably have feared that if they transported appellant to the police station and appellant was indeed hiding a weapon between his legs, appellant could access the weapon while sitting in the back of the police vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Second, Officer Smith\u2019s belief that contraband of any type was hidden on appellant was even more justified than the officers\u2019 belief in both <em>Paulino </em>and Allen. Again, in <em>Paulino, </em>the officers suspected that Paulino was hiding drugs between his buttocks because an informant had told police that Paulino would be at a certain location with controlled dangerous substances, which Paulino typically hid in the area of his buttocks. 399 Md. at 344, 924 A.2d 308. Likewise, in <em>Allen, </em>the officers\u2019 belief that drugs were hidden in the defendants\u2019 buttocks was based solely on the fact that the officers witnessed the defendants engaging what they thought was a drug trade, and the fact that drug traffickers in general frequently hide drugs in body cavities to avoid detection. 197 Md.App. at 312, 324, 13 A.3d 801. By contrast, in the case <em>sub judice, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Officer Smith had already conducted a pat-down, during which he <em>actually felt </em>a hard object that he believed could be contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Having weighed the <em>Bell </em>factors, we conclude that the search was legal under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\">. The Court of Appeals set forth both versions of the facts in its opinion, stating that what happened after the stop of Paulino was unclear. 399 Md. at 346, 924 A.2d 308.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-11\">.

Although this opinion focuses closely on <em>Paulino </em>and <em>Allen </em>because those cases are the most squarely on point, we note briefly that several other cases have analyzed the reasonableness of strip searches in Maryland. <em>See, e.g., State v. Harding, </em>196 Md.App. 384, 9 A.3d 547 (2010) (examining the justification required to expand a routine search incident to arrest into a strip search); <em>Moore v.
