Thomas, appellant, was tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (Smith, J.) from August 14 to 23, 2006 on charges of bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit theft. The jury convicted appellant of conspiracy to commit bribery and bribery, but acquitted him of conspiracy to commit theft. On May 11, 2007, appellant was sentenced to twelve years in prison, with all but thirty months suspended, in lieu of five years supervised probation. Appellant was also ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Appellant appeals his conviction and presents three questions for this Court\u2019s review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">I. Were the trial court\u2019s instructions on the elements of bribery incorrect and misleading?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">II. Did the trial court err by allowing a witness for the State to testify that, in his opinion, appellant had influence over the awarding of contracts with the county?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">III. Did the trial court err by denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II of the charging document for failure to state an offense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">For the reasons that follow, we answer all three questions in the negative. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Appellant was hired in December 2003 as the Deputy Director of the Prince George\u2019s County Office of Central Services. In that capacity, appellant managed the County\u2019s fleet and facilities. Floyd Holt, another deputy director, was responsible for procurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The State alleged that appellant solicited bribes and engaged in a conspiracy to bribe Interior Systems, Inc. (ISI), in exchange for appellant\u2019s efforts to influence the awarding of a County security management system contract to another company, ADT/Tyco, which would subsequently employ ISI as a subcontractor. The two other individuals alleged to have engaged in this conspiracy with appellant were Paul Wright and Robert Isom.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Appellant\u2019s trial lasted several days and produced several hundred pages of testimony. We shall recount below only those facts necessary for an understanding of our assessment of the issues raised by appellant to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>A. The Process of Awarding Contracts</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Pamela Piper, Director of the Office of Central Services and Deputy Chief Administrative Officer for Government Internal Support, testified that she was the purchasing agent for the County with sole legal authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the County. Once a County agency requests certain goods or services, Piper may, <em>inter alia, </em>issue a request for bids (whereby the contract is awarded to the lowest bidder) or a request for proposals (whereby vendors submit proposals describing the provision of goods or services and the contract is awarded based on a number of factors not necessarily limited to price).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Under the latter method, proposals are reviewed by a proposal analysis group (PAG) consisting of, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201cprocurement official\u201d and five voting members. Each member of the PAG rates each proposal individually according to agreed-upon criteria. The procurement official then submits a final score for the proposal, along with the group\u2019s recommendation, to the Director. Once the Director approves the recommendation, a contract is drafted which, after other intervening steps not relevant here, is signed by the County and the successful vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In June 2003, prior to Piper\u2019s appointment, the County issued an invitation for bids to install a security management system in two County buildings. The invitation for bids also indicated that the County would consider expanding the contract to approximately 140 buildings should additional funding become available. The bidding process took place and the procurement official assigned to the matter, Frederick Dorsey, recommended an award to the lowest bidder. Piper, however, retracted the invitation for bids when she was appointed to her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In February 2004, the Office of Central Services issued a request for proposals to install the aforementioned security management system. Piper appointed the requisite five members to the PAG tasked with the proposal review process. In July 2004, the PAG unanimously recommended awarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>contract to the same company that had been the lowest bidder under the invitation to bid process. However, Piper again rejected the PAG recommendation for multiple reasons, including the fact that she learned from appellant, who was not part of the PAG at that time, that a PAG member had a possible business relationship with the lowest bidding company. Subsequently, interested vendors were requested to give oral presentations regarding their proposals. To accomplish that end, in September 2004, Piper replaced two members of the PAG with appellant and Floyd Holt. Several vendors, including ADT/Tyco, gave presentations as requested. ISI, as a prospective subcontractor, participated in ADT/Tyco\u2019s presentation and proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Dorsey, the procurement official assigned to the PAG, testified that appellant and Holt asked him to see the scoring of the other PAG members of the various proposals prior to submitting their final scores, which, according to Dorsey, had never previously been done. Appellant, Holt and another member of the group ultimately gave perfect scores to ADT/ Tyco\u2019s proposal. The other two members of the group also gave relatively high scores to ADT/Tyco\u2019s proposal. In November 2004, Piper was notified of the PAG\u2019s unanimous recommendation to award the contract to ADT/Tyco, with ISI as a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The events that form the basis for the criminal charges against appellant occurred after ADT/Tyco\u2019s oral presentation in September 2004 and are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">B. Initial Meeting and Commencement of Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Melvin Pulley was ISPs Director of Telecommunications in 2004. In 2004, Dallas Evans was ISI\u2019s president. Both Pulley and Evans attended the ADT/Tyco presentation on September 29, 2004. Although Holt was present at the presentation, appellant was not. Afterwards, Pulley, Evans and others went to a restaurant to celebrate what they believed was a successful presentation. According to Pulley, he encountered Robert Isom at the restaurant. Pulley described Isom as a \u201csocial friend of mine.\u201d Pulley also knew that Isom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>was, at that time, working for Prince George\u2019s County. Pulley informed Isom about the presentation and Isom offered to introduce Pulley to appellant. Pulley testified that he followed Isom to another restaurant, where Pulley met appellant for the first time. Appellant told Pulley that he \u201cknew all about ISI and the contract and [that] everyone on their committee worked for him.... \u201d Pulley shared some additional information about ISI with appellant. The next day, Isom called Pulley and informed him that \u201c[appellant] wants to know if ISI and ADT will play.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Isom, who ultimately pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery in connection with these events, testified at appellant\u2019s trial in exchange for a reduced sentence. His version of this first meeting differed from Pulley\u2019s version. According to Isom, he spoke with Evans at the restaurant and not Pulley. Isom added that it was Evans who asked Isom to introduce Pulley to appellant. He admitted, however, to calling Pulley the next day, at the request of appellant, \u201cto see if ISI would play.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">On October 1, 2004, Isom called Pulley and arranged a meeting at a restaurant, at appellant\u2019s request, between Isom, Pulley and appellant. Isom testified that, before Pulley arrived, appellant told Isom that they would ask ISI for $250,000 and that there would be a \u201cconduit.\u201d Pulley testified that, when he arrived at the restaurant, appellant told Pulley he could not talk with him because another panel member was present in the restaurant. According to Pulley, Isom gave him a piece of paper, which stated that appellant could guarantee the contract for a price of $250,000 and that appellant would issue \u201cchange orders\u201d so that ISI could recoup Hhat amount. Pulley was told that ISI would have to pay one-half of that amount initially, with the other half due upon the awarding of the contract. According to Isom, appellant advised Pulley of the terms of the deal while Isom only took notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Pulley testified that he left the restaurant and reported the incident to Evans, who was then the president of ISI. After a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>meeting between ISPs counsel and other ISI employees, the decision was made to report this situation to the relevant authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Isom testified that, over the following weeks, appellant asked him to call Pulley a number of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">C. Recorded Phone Conversations</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">On October 7, 2004, Special Agent John Poliks of the Office of the State Prosecutor met with Pulley at ISI and copied a voice message left on Pulley\u2019s cell phone by Isom. This message, played for the jury at trial, consisted of Isom asking Pulley to contact him in order to set up a meeting between Evans and appellant. In Agent Poliks\u2019 presence, Pulley called Isom and told him that he had spoken with Evans who \u201cfeels that ... that amount\u2019s a little steep.\u201d Isom replied, \u201cthat\u2019s no problem,\u201d and \u201cwe just need to ... get them together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">On October 14, 2004, Agent Poliks again copied five more voice mail messages from Isom to Pulley. These, too, were played for the jury. In one of these messages, Isom gave Pulley a phone number for \u201cthe other Bob,\u201d ostensibly referring to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">In addition, on October 14, 2004, Evans called appellant with Agent Poliks present. This conversation between appellant and Evans was recorded and played for the jury. During this phone call, Evans told appellant that he had spoken with Pulley and was \u201ctrying to understand exactly what the deal is.\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cWell[,] I don\u2019t want to talk about it on the phone \u2014 you understand.\u201d When Evans told appellant that ISI \u201ccouldn\u2019t come up with a number that quick and that soon,\u201d appellant responded, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no, no we can, we can work with numbers okay.\u201d Evans asked appellant \u201cwhat we would be getting, ah, you know, out of, what, what consideration we\u2019d be getting.\u201d Appellant replied, in part, that \u201cthere\u2019s 144 buildings\u201d that \u201cwe gotta add security to,\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m going to make the decision ... then I\u2019m going to send you a letter ... of intent to award.... \u201d This conversation took place approximately one month before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Piper was notified of the PAG\u2019s unanimous recommendation to award the contract to ADT/Tyco.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Later that day, during a telephone call initiated by Evans, Isom stated, \u201cI was ... informed ... to let you know ... that what we\u2019re talking about, he said that can be done ... in 12 months. And he has the conduit.\u201d Regarding the money requested from ISI, Isom stated, \u201cwe understand that that\u2019s kind of steep ... but he just wanted to get assurance [sic] from you.\u201d Isom added that \u201che wants to assure you that he\u2019s going to take you on your word ... and ah, just go ahead on and sign and you\u2019ll know the job\u2019s out there for contractor. Your [sic] gonna get it ah, not only that one ... once you get in here your [sic] going to be the model for the ... county. ...\u201d Isom also said that he wanted to get a commitment from Evans so that Isom could \u201ctake it back to him because you know, he\u2019s back and forth in fact he\u2019s in, in the office now ... Director\u2019s office ... and he got to make a decision today----\u201d Evans responded, \u201cWell, tell him to execute it.\u201d Over defense objection, Evans told the jury that, at the time, Evans believed appellant had the authority to influence the awarding of contracts for the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">D. Consulting Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">As part of the on-going investigation, Agent Poliks and another special agent conducted surveillance of a meeting between Pulley and Isom at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. on October 19, 2004. At that meeting, Isom gave Pulley a manila envelope and instructed Pulley to have Evans review the enclosed document, which consisted of a draft consulting agreement to retain Washington Business Management Consulting Group, LLC (WBMCG) for a fee of $260,000, payable monthly. On October 23, 2004, appellant and Pulley met at another restaurant. Pulley gave appellant a \u201cmarked-up\u201d copy of the consulting agreement in an ISI envelope. Appellant took the envelope but did not open it. According to Pulley, appellant told him that \u201che was going to award the contract the next day to ADT and ISI.\u201d A contract was not, in fact, awarded the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>WBMCG was a consulting company belonging to Paul Wright, who was also charged with bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit theft. Wright was acquitted of these charges prior to appellant\u2019s trial. Wright testified at appellant\u2019s trial, pursuant to an agreement with the State to cooperate in an on-going investigation of public corruption in Prince George\u2019s County, in exchange for transactional, use and derivative use immunity. According to Wright, he was contacted by appellant in October 2004, when appellant suggested to Wright the possibility of jointly pursuing consulting opportunities. Wright testified that he did not know at the time that appellant was employed by the County. Wright prepared a draft consulting agreement and was surprised when, later that month, appellant returned a completed contract signed by ISI. In addition, Wright maintained that he had never heard of ISI before receiving the agreement from appellant. Nonetheless, he signed the agreement and agreed to attend a meeting with ISI employees on November 1, 2004. He maintained that he never thought the consulting agreement was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The November 1st meeting was to include appellant, Pulley and William Marcellino, Chief Operating Officer and a principal shareholder of ISI. The FBI prepared a check for $10,000, made to look like a check from ISI, and Marcellino took that check with him to the meeting. Wright testified that appellant called him prior to the meeting to tell him he would not be there, but that Isom would attend. Wright\u2019s understanding, based on what appellant told him, was that ISI had already won the contract and that this meeting was to discuss future work. At the meeting, Marcellino gave Wright the check as an initial payment on the consulting agreement with WBMCG. Isom told Pulley and Marcellino that appellant \u201cwas going to release the contract that day\u201d and would later issue change orders so that ISI could recoup its expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">An award of the contract, however, was not forthcoming. Agent Poliks asked Marcellino to arrange another meeting with appellant on December 6, 2004. Once again, appellant did not attend the meeting. Wright, who attended the meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ing at appellant\u2019s request, gave Marcellino a copy of a memorandum from Piper to a former member of the PAG, indicating that she had accepted the PAG\u2019s recommendation to award the contract to ADT/Tyco.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">On January 31, 2005, Pulley met again with Isom, who told him that he was \u201cno longer part of this mess Bob was doing.\u201d Wright testified that he also decided to end his involvement in the matter for a number of reasons, including his concern that his business relationship with appellant was not a \u201cgood fit.\u201d Agent Poliks testified that he made an attempt, to no avail, to meet with Wright under the guise of being a project manager for ISI. Phone records indicated that appellant maintained contact with Isom through January 5, 2005 and with Wright through February 5, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">E. WBMCG Bank Account</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">On May 24, 2005, Agent Poliks executed warrant searches of the homes and offices of appellant, Isom and Wright. A number of items were seized from Wright\u2019s house, including a copy of the ISI and WBMCG consulting agreement, documents related to WBMCG\u2019s business bank account and an invoice prepared by Wright to Marcellino. Agent Rick Barger testified that, when presented with the affidavit accompanying the search warrant, appellant stated that he had no capacity to affect bidding on contracts in the County. Appellant also denied picking anything up from Pulley at the monitored October 23, 2004 meeting. He did admit, however, to doing paid accounting work for Wright\u2019s consulting business, WBMCG.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Wright opened a WBMCG business account on November 3, 2004, in which he deposited the $10,000 check given to him by Marcellino. Both Wright and appellant made withdrawals from this account. Wright testified that he would give some or all of his withdrawals to appellant. Wright also testified that he felt appellant took too much money from the WBMCG account. Isom testified that he never received any money for his role in this matter, despite appellant\u2019s promise that Isom would be paid $2,000 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Additional facts will be discussed in our analysis as warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Appellant initially argues that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury, over appellant\u2019s objection, that \u201c[i]t is not a defense to the crime of bribery that the public employee did not have the actual authority, power, or ability to perform the act for which the money was demanded or received.\u201d Appellant argues that this instruction was incorrect and misleading. According to appellant, a correct statement of the law is rather that \u201cit is not a defense [to bribery] that the defendant did not have <em>expressly or officially prescribed </em>authority, power, or ability to act <em>so long as he implicitly had the authority, power, or ability to act in accordance with established custom or practice.\u201d </em>Appellant contends that he was prejudiced by the alleged erroneous jury instruction because it allowed the jury to convict him of bribery, notwithstanding any reasonable doubt that it might have had as to whether the awarding of contracts was part of appellant\u2019s \u201cofficial duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The State counters that appellant was attempting to persuade the jury that he could not be convicted of bribery if he lacked the actual authority to award contracts on behalf of the County. According to the State, this entitled the State to ask for, and receive, a jury instruction stating that the lack of actual authority to perform the act is no defense to bribery. Lack of actual authority, asserts the State, is a defense to bribery <em>only if </em>the public employee is acting in a matter <em>outside </em>his or her official capacity or <em>not related to </em>his or her official duties. When read as a whole, the State posits, the jury instructions correctly conveyed the law on bribery. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">It is well-settled that \u201cso long as the law is fairly covered by the jury instructions, reviewing courts should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>disturb them.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>403 Md. 659, 663, 944 A.2d 505 (2008) (quoting <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 46, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999)). On the other hand, if a challenged jury instruction is \u201cambiguous, misleading or confusing\u201d to jurors, a reversal of the conviction and a new trial on remand is required. <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Jury instructions cannot be read in a vacuum; rather, they must be examined as a whole, in the context of the entire charge to the jury. <em>Id. </em>As the Court of Appeals recently reiterated, a reviewing court \u201cwill not condemn a charge [to the jury] because of the way in which it is expressed or because an isolated part of it does not seem to do justice to one side or the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Morris v. Christopher, </em>255 Md. 372, 378, 258 A.2d 172 (1969) (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">With this standard of review in mind, we turn to the merits of appellant\u2019s challenge to the bribery jury instruction offered at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">B. Authority to Act and \u201cOfficial Duties\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">At trial, appellant elicited testimony suggesting that he lacked the actual authority to award contracts to vendors. For example, Piper testified on cross-examination that she had the sole legal authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the County. The gravamen of appellant\u2019s complaint before this Court is that the jury was incorrectly instructed that the <em>lack of actual authority </em>to commit the act for which payment is received is no defense to bribery.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Appellant was convicted under \u00a7 9-201 (c) of the Criminal Law (C.L.) Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides, in pertinent part, that a \u201c[a] public employee may not demand or receive a bribe, fee, reward, or testimonial to ... influence the performance of the official duties of the public employee.... \u201d Maryland\u2019s bribery statute \u201cembodies the basic elements of the common law without extending its boundaries to persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>outside the ambit of the common law.\u201d <em>State v. Canova, </em>278 Md. 483, 491, 365 A.2d 988 (1976) (discussing <em>Blondes v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 165, 294 A.2d 661 (1972) and construing the former Md.Code 1957, art. 27, \u00a7 23, a predecessor statute to C.L. \u00a7 9-201).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under both the Maryland statute and the common law, \u201cIt is essential for a conviction of bribery that the briber must make an attempt to influence the bribee in the performance of his \u2018official,\u2019 \u2018public\u2019 or \u2018legal\u2019 duty.\u201d <em>Richardson v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 324, 328, 492 A.2d 932 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Maryland case law instructs that a public employee violates the provisions of the bribery statute by demanding or receiving a bribe to influence the employee\u2019s performance of duties that are either <em>expressly </em>authorized, <em>e.g., </em>by statute, rule or regulation, or <em>implicitly </em>authorized. In <em>Kable v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 16, 299 A.2d 493 (1973), we held that a police officer who accepted $250 in exchange for agreeing to ask an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to various motor vehicle offenses was properly found guilty of bribery. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19, 299 A.2d 493. We rejected the officer\u2019s argument that he was not influenced in the performance of his \u201cofficial duties\u201d because the State\u2019s Attorney, and not the officer, had the actual authority to <em>nol. pros, </em>the traffic violations. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 299 A.2d 493. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">In concluding that the appellant was acting within his \u201cofficial duties\u201d... we \u201chave given the statutory definition of bribery a construction broad enough to cover cases,\u201d such as this one, \u201cwhere a public officer has accepted a bribe to act corruptly in a matter <em>to which he bears some official relation, </em>though the act itself <em>may be technically beyond his official powers or duties.\u201d </em>Thus, while the actual decision to nol. pros, a traffic violation is one which rests with the State\u2019s Attorney of Prince George\u2019s County, the right of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>police officer in that County to recommend the nol. pros, of traffic cases in which he brought the original charges must be considered <em>a responsibility implicitly authorized by custom and circumstance, amounting to an official practice and, consequently, one of his \u201cofficial duties\u201d </em>within the language of Article 27, Section 23 of the Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A88\"><em>Id. </em>at 22, 299 A.2d 493 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Similarly, in <em>Richardson, </em>63 Md.App. at 327, 492 A.2d 932, we upheld the bribery conviction of a defendant who, as a clerk at the State Department of Vital Records, accepted $300 in exchange for blank birth certificates. We emphasized the holding in <em>Kable </em>and noted \u201cthat it is sufficient that the illegal act requested of the state employee bear some <em>relation </em>to his official duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 492 A.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Indeed, an isolated statement that \u201c[i]t is not a defense to the crime of bribery that the public employee did not have the actual authority, power or ability to perform the act for which the money was demanded or received,\u201d would, without more, give an incomplete picture of Maryland\u2019s law on bribery. The lack of actual authority, power or ability to perform the act for which the money is demanded or received <em>is, </em>in fact, a defense to bribery, <em>if </em>the act for which the public employee accepted the bribe involves a matter to which the public employee <em>bore no official relation. See also </em>12 Am.Jur.2d Bribery \u00a7 19 (1997)(\u201cThe lack of authority of the officer or governmental employee bribed is <em>not </em>a defense to the criminal offense of bribery, <em>so long </em>as the officer or employee acted in his or her official capacity.\u201d) (emphasis added). Perkins and Boyce, Criminal Law 536 (3d ed.1982), agree, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">For guilt of bribery it is obviously not necessary, that the act requested be one which the bribee has authority to do, for it is frequently illegal.... If he has the power or ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>or apparent ability to <em>comply with the </em>request, no more is needed. And bribery is not precluded by the fact that the bribee is only one member of a board, council or other body, and hence will be unable to bring about the desired result if other members are obstinate. The prevailing -view is that bribery may be predicated upon an effort corruptly to influence the action of an officer or public employee provided the act is apparently within the ambit of the general scope of his duties or authority, but not if it is obviously unrelated thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">C. The Challenged Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Based on the foregoing discussion, the challenged portion of the trial court\u2019s jury instruction, read out of context, would have the tendency to obscure some of the nuances set forth in <em>Kable, Richardson </em>and other authorities discussed <em>supra. </em>We do not evaluate jury instructions, however, in a vacuum. We place them in their proper context and assess the jury instructions as a whole to determine whether the instructions fairly covered the law or, conversely, whether they were ambiguous, confusing or misleading to the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Prior to the jury\u2019s deliberations, the trial court instructed the jury, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">Bribery. To constitute bribery, the State must prove that the defendant was an officer or employee of Prince George\u2019s County, who corruptly demanded or received, directly or indirectly, something of value from another <em>for the purpose of influencing the officer or employee in the performance of his official duties.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">In count one, the defendant is charged with Conspiracy to Commit Bribery. In count two he is charged with Bribery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">Now, in order to prove bribery, the State is not required to prove that payment was in exchange for any particular action by the Prince George\u2019s County employee; rather it is sufficient for the State to prove that payments were demanded or received with the intent to influence the conduct of the employee <em>in relationship to his employment or duty.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>(Emphasis added). The trial court then instructed the jury as to the charge of conspiracy to commit theft by deception and explained the elements of a conspiracy. At the end of that particular charge to the jury, the trial court promulgated the challenged instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">Now, in order for the State to prove a conspiracy, it is not necessary that a formal agreement be shown or that the conspiracy agreement as [sic] manifested by formal words either written or spoken. An agreement exists if the parties to a conspiracy passively come to an understanding by words or actions with regard to an unlawful act or purpose. <em>It is not a defense to the crime of bribery that the public employee did not have the actual authority, power, or ability to perform the act for which the money was demanded or received.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We hold that, read in their entirety, the jury instructions fairly conveyed Maryland law on bribery. \u201c[W]hen objection is raised to a court\u2019s instruction, attention should not be focused on a particular portion lifted out of context, but rather its adequacy is determined by viewing it as a whole.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>403 Md. at 666, 944 A.2d 505 (quoting <em>State v. Foster, </em>263 Md. 388, 397, 283 A.2d 411 (1971)). The jurors here were instructed that, to convict appellant of bribery, the State was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that (1) appellant was an officer or employee of Prince George\u2019s County, (2) appellant corruptly demanded or received, directly or indirectly, something of value from another and (3) this thing of value was demanded or received for the purpose of influencing the appellant <em>in the performance of his official duties. </em>The challenged \u201clack of authority\u201d instruction must be read in that context. As explained <em>supra, </em>even if a particular act is <em>technically </em>beyond a public employee\u2019s authority, it is enough that the public employee accepted a bribe to influence a matter to which the public employee bears some official relation. <em>See Kable, </em>17 Md.App. at 22, 299 A.2d 493. The jury was fully informed that if, for whatever reason, it had reasonable doubt as to whether the State had proven that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>proscribed act was within the general scope of appellant\u2019s \u201cofficial duties,\u201d it was required to acquit appellant of that charge. Any testimony establishing that appellant lacked authority to award contracts on the part of the County was part of the body of evidence the jury was entitled to weigh and consider in determining whether the elements of bribery had, in fact, been established by the State beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Appellant further argues that remarks by the State during closing argument,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when coupled with the challenged bribery instruction, allowed the jury to believe that it could convict appellant of bribery \u201ceven if he was unable to influence the awarding of the contract because he either lacked the power or ability to do so or because the decision to award the contract had already been made before he demanded and received a bribe from ISI.\u201d Given the foregoing, such a conclusion by the jury would, in fact, be consistent with the law, as long as it found appellant to have accepted or demanded the bribe for the purposes of influencing him in the performance of his official duties. Appellant does not contest that he was an official member of the PAG, which was tasked with reviewing proposals by vendors in order to make an ultimate recommendation as to the final awarding of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Finally, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that the challenged instruction \u201ccreated a conflict with the <em>mens rea </em>element of bribery.\u201d Appellant argues that, if appellant lacked the authority, power or ability to influence the awarding of the contract, he would also likely lack the intent to take any action in exchange for the bribe. This argument is unpersuasive. A public employee may very well choose to accept a bribe with the intent that the bribe influence his or her performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>an official duty even if the employee knows that he or she does not have technical authority to make the final decision regarding the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">In sum, we conclude that, when viewed in their entirety, the jury instructions fairly covered the relevant law on bribery.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Appellant next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision to allow, over appellant\u2019s objection, the testimony of Dallas Evans, a senior official at ISI, indicating that Evans believed that appellant had the ability to influence the awarding of a contract on behalf of the County. According to appellant, Evans expressed a lay opinion not authorized under Maryland Rule 5-701 because \u201cEvans\u2019 opinion as to [appellant\u2019s] position and authority was neither helpful to the jury nor rationally based on the witness\u2019 first-hand observations.\u201d Appellant adds that Evans\u2019 belief was also irrelevant, because it was appellant\u2019s intent and ability to influence the awarding of contracts (for bribery) and his intent to deceive (for conspiracy to commit theft by deception), and not Evans\u2019 belief, that mattered. Appellant contends that Evans\u2019 testimony was \u201cextremely prejudicial in light of the State\u2019s closing argument and the court\u2019s erroneous instructions on the elements of bribery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The State argues that appellant was charged with conspiracy to commit theft by deception and that the effect that appellant\u2019s misleading solicitations had on Evans is relevant evidence relating to appellant\u2019s intent to deceive. As to bribery, the State argues that it was \u201cpermitted to demonstrate that the defendant had the apparent ability to contribute to the desired end,\u201d adding, \u201cwho better than the victim to testify about whether they [sic] believed the defendant had such ability and the basis for such conclusion?\u201d The State does not address appellant\u2019s argument that Evans\u2019 comments represented inadmissible lay opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">We conclude that, even if this issue is properly preserved, and even if Evans expressed an improper lay opinion, appellant suffered no harm or prejudice as a result of that testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ny and, consequently, a reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction is not required. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">A trial court has wide discretion to rule on the relevance of evidence. <em>See Cook v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 404, 416-17, 702 A.2d 971 (1997) (internal citations omitted). Similarly, the decision to admit lay opinion testimony lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>348 Md. 104, 118-19, 702 A.2d 741 (1997) (internal citations omitted). In either case, the trial court\u2019s decision to admit such evidence will not be overturned unless it is shown that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">A. Evans\u2019 Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Evans testified that he served as the president of ISI from 2004 to 2005. He described his responsibilities at that time as involving business development matters, primarily providing for, <em>inter alia, </em>government clients. In 2004, Melvin Pulley was the director of telecommunications for ISI. During the first week of October 2004, Evans learned that Pulley had been approached by Isom, at the request of appellant, asking if ISI and ADT/Tyco wanted \u201cto play.\u201d In addition, Pulley met with appellant and Isom at a restaurant, where it was communicated to Pulley that appellant could guarantee the security management contract for a price of $250,000. At a meeting involving ISI senior management and counsel, the decision was made to report the incident to the \u201cappropriate authorities.\u201d Investigators from the Office of the State Prosecutor asked Evans to participate in an investigation by making various telephone calls to appellant. Evans, though reluctant, agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">On October 14, 2004, Evans, in the presence of a deputy state prosecutor and other officers, placed a recorded call to appellant. A recording of that call was played for the jury. A transcription of that telephone call was offered by the State as State\u2019s Exhibit 16:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>EVANS: Okay, ah, what, what are we going to be talking about here? I know ah, Mel\u2019s given me a little highlight but, I\u2019m trying to understand exactly what the deal is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">[APPELLANT]: Well I don\u2019t want to talk about it on the phone \u2014 you understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">EVANS: Yeah, give me a rough, ah, yeah, if I don\u2019t pick up right away I\u2019m probably sitting in a meeting and I\u2019ll have to call you right back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">[APPELLANT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">EVANS: [A]nd what not. But ah, ah, I, I do know based on what Mel indicated to me that the ah, the num, we couldn\u2019t come up with a number that quick and that soon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">[APPELLANT]: No, no, no, no, no, no we can, we can work with numbers okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">EVANS: I see, I see, ah, it, while we\u2019re talking about this, what, do you have any sense as to when ah, ah, notification for the ah, ah, security piece is coming out? Cause we\u2019ve been, we were told 10 days and now its [sic] been moved again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">[APPELLANT]: [I]t will be tomorrow ... that\u2019s why I need to talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">EVANS: [Y]ou going [sic] to make an announcement tomorrow[,] okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah, I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going to make the decision ... then I\u2019m going to send you a letter ... of intent to award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Evans further testified that he expected another telephone call from appellant that afternoon, but no call was forthcoming. The following then transpired before the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">[THE STATE]: Sir, leading into these two phone calls, these \u2014 the first one that was played and the second one that was just played, the message; leading into that, who did you believe [appellant] was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-18\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">[THE STATE]: From your personal perspective, sir, who did you believe [appellant] was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">[THE WITNESS]: My understanding was that [appellantjwas Deputy Director for Contracts and Procurement for Prince George\u2019s County Government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">[THE STATE]: And that knowledge was before making these phone calls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">[THE STATE]: And what did you believe, again, this date and this time; what did you believe was [appellant\u2019s] ability to influence the awarding of the contract that you were involved in bidding on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s approach the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">At the bench, the following ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-13\">THE COURT: Do you have much more to go on this witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-14\">[THE STATE]: I have about maybe two minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-15\">THE COURT: His beliefs, his understandings, his perceptions are not at issue. The issue is, did this man enter into a conspiracy and accept a bribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-16\">[THE STATE]: If I may, Your Honor, I respectfully disagree insofar as it\u2019s been no secret from the beginning of the case that defense\u2019s position that he didn\u2019t have actual ability to influence, actual ability to do certain things. And I think it\u2019s crucial that the jury hear what these people believed [appellant] could do the whole way. If they believed he had the ability to influence the contract, that would be why he\u2019s entering \u2014 why he\u2019s going into the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>This is also, as [the Deputy State Prosecutor] just pointed out to me, we\u2019re talking about conspiracy to commit theft by deception. This is evidence of his intent to deceive, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">THE COURT: Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">[THE STATE]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">THE COURT: You can ask the questions, but let\u2019s get it to a close.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">This line of questioning then concluded as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">[THE STATE]: Mr. Evans, as I just asked you, at that time, what did you believe was the ability of [appellant] to influence the contract that ISI and ADT were bidding on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">[THE WITNESS]: As Deputy Director of Contracts and Procurement, I believed that the position can have influence over or does influence or would influence the awarding of a contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Appellant points out that Evans\u2019 knowledge of appellant\u2019s title was acquired before the October 14, 2004 recorded conversation. Prior to that time, Evans had had no contact with appellant and, according to appellant, \u201cvery limited contact with the other alleged co-conspirators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">B. Lay Opinion Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">As an initial matter, we view the preservation of appellant\u2019s arguments to be tenuous at best. It is well-established that we will generally not review any issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the court below. Md. Rule 8-131(a). It is also well-settled that a party need not state the grounds for the objection unless requested to by the court. Md. Rule 4-323(c). Where a party asserts specific grounds for an objection, all other grounds not specified by the party are waived. <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 541, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">To be sure, appellant objected generally to Evans\u2019 testimony regarding his belief as to appellant\u2019s title and his belief as to appellant\u2019s ability \u201cto influence the contract that ISI and ADT were bidding on.\u201d The trial court conducted a bench conference to consider appellant\u2019s objection and his counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>was conspicuously silent, offering no argument as to the basis for the admission of Evans\u2019 testimony. Under these circumstances, appellate review should be limited to the basis on which the trial court decided the matter. At the bench conference, neither the trial court nor the State addressed whether Evans\u2019 comments constituted inadmissible lay opinion testimony. Indeed, the issue regarding whether Evans\u2019 testimony of his belief as to appellant\u2019s ability to influence the awarding of the subject contract even constituted lay <em>opinion </em>testimony was never raised or decided. However, even if this issue is preserved for our review, we perceive no prejudice or harm visited upon appellant by Evans\u2019 testimony. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">An opinion is a belief or view base on an interpretation of observed facts and experience. Merrjam-Webster\u2019s, New International Dictionary, Third Edition, Unabridged 1582 (1986). Rule 5-701 provides that a \u201cwitness\u2019s testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d The distinction between fact and opinion is not always clear. <em>See Bell v. State, </em>114 Md.App. 480, 508, 691 A.2d 238 (1997) (quoting the Hon. Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook, \u00a7 603(B), at 330 (1993)). In <em>Robinson, </em>348 Md. at 115, 702 A.2d 741, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap4L\">In distinguishing between opinion testimony, as opposed to testimony detailing solely factual information, this Court has previously defined</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">[a]n opinion [as] a belief based upon inferences drawn from ascertained or assumed facts, the soundness of which depends both on the truth of the premises and upon the <em>knowledge, skill, and intelligence of the witness, </em>and is to be distinguished from positive knowledge based upon the direct evidence of the senses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\"><em>Baltimore C. &amp; A. Rwy. Co. v. Turner, </em>152 Md. 216, 225, 136 A. 609 (1927). This distinction between testimony con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>veying opinion, and testimony merely relating fact, was a product of the common law system of proof, and its exacting \u201cinsistence upon the most reliable sources of information.\u201d 1 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 10, at 37 (J. Strong ed., 4th ed.1992). <em>Bom of this insistence upon reliability was ths evidentiary rule that generally \u201cwitnesses are not allowed to testify to their opinions or conclusions on material matters, but must [only] state facts within their knowledge relevant to the issues. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Irrespective of the purpose for which the State offered Evans\u2019 testimony, in order for it to be <em>opinion </em>testimony, much less inadmissible, lay opinion testimony, the threshold issue is the manner in which the <em>purported </em>opinion was formulated. The prescribed manner in which the opinion is formulated under Maryland Rule 5-701 is through the witness\u2019 perceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">As stated, the definition in Webster\u2019s Dictionary is that an opinion is based on an interpretation of observed facts and experience. Before engaging in an analysis of whether Evans\u2019 testimony should have been excluded because it was inadmissible lay opinion evidence, the salient question is whether Evans\u2019 testimony as to his \u201cbelief\u201d as to what appellant\u2019s title was and his authority relative to the awarding of contracts was a result of positive knowledge based upon the direct evidence of the senses, rather than any interpretation or perception of facts or experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Initially, the most direct source of Evans\u2019 knowledge of appellant\u2019s authority is appellant\u2019s own representation to Evans in the telephone conversation in which appellant said that he \u201cwas going to make the decision.\u201d Prior to the investigation conducted by the Office of the State Prosecutor, Evans attended a meeting of the senior management and counsel of ISI, where the decision was made to report the offer of a bribe to the authorities. One may reasonably infer that, during the investigation of appellant, for which Evans was enlisted to make the aforementioned telephone call, Evans was briefed\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>providing him with background including information about appellant. Evans\u2019 belief that appellant had the authority to influence the awarding of the subject contract emanated, not from any opinion based on perception of facts or interpretation of facts or experience, but rather from what he was told.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Were we to accept appellant\u2019s proposition that Evans\u2019 testimony constituted lay opinion testimony because he expressed a \u201cbelief\u2019 as to what appellant\u2019s authority in the awarding of contracts was, it would be subject to the provisions of Md. Rule 5-701. Although Evans\u2019 testimony may have been admissible on other grounds, a ruling admitting testimony of Evans\u2019 belief as lay opinion evidence under Rule 5-701 would have been erroneous. The first requirement set forth in Rule 5-701 is that a witness have first-hand knowledge as to the matter about which he or she expresses an opinion. <em>See Waddell v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 54, 66, 582 A.2d 260 (1990). According to Evans\u2019 testimony, he came to the understanding that appellant was the Deputy Director for Contracts and Procurement for Prince George\u2019s County before he spoke to appellant by telephone October 14, 2004.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While one may not ascertain the authority of a public official from knowledge of a job title alone,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as stated, Evans formulated his opinion based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>on appellant\u2019s representation in their telephone conversation and, one may infer, in his briefings with the state prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Moreover, regarding whether Evans\u2019 testimony was helpful to the jury\u2019s clear understanding of his testimony or determination of a fact in issue, the jury was not tasked to decide Evans\u2019 \u201cbelief\u2019 as to appellant\u2019s authority. What was at issue was appellant\u2019s authority in the awarding of or influencing of the award of the subject contract and whether that authority bore a relationship to the illegal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In order to convict appellant of bribery under C.L. \u00a7 9-201(c), the jury was required to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant was a public employee who demanded or received a bribe or fee for the purpose of influencing his or her performance of official duties. There is no dispute that appellant was a member of a committee tasked with reviewing proposals of various vendors and making recommendations as to the awarding of the security management contract. Nor is it disputed that appellant recommended awarding the contract to ADT/Tyco and ISI.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In addition, numerous witnesses established that appellant approached ISI, either directly or through Wright and Isom, prior to the official awarding of the security management contract, for the purposes of requesting or convincing ISI to enter into a consulting agreement with WBMCG. In addition, the evidence demonstrated that appellant communicated to employees of ISI, either directly or indirectly, that he had the authority and ability to influence the awarding of the contract if ISI agreed to offer something of value to appellant. Finally, appellant, in fact, received a signed consulting agreement and money from ISI, which was deposited in a WBMCG account from which appellant withdrew funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The extent of appellant\u2019s authority and his role, as a member of the PAG, in the recommendation of which proposal should be accepted, was overwhelmingly established by the evidence. Without the benefit of the issue squarely before him, as the trial judge presciently stated, \u201c[Evans\u2019] beliefs, his understandings, his perceptions are not at issue. The issue is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>did this man enter into a conspiracy and accept a bribe.\u201d Evans\u2019 testimony, regarding appellant\u2019s authority, was superfluous at best. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The resolution of issues presented on appeal are most efficaciously disposed of when they are properly litigated at the trial level. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131. Because counsel failed at trial to raise the issue of whether Evans\u2019 testimony constituted inadmissible lay opinion evidence, we do not have the benefit of the court\u2019s ruling based on evidence before it and evidence not adduced as to whether Evans\u2019 testimony constituted lay opinion evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Based upon our review of the record, we do not believe that Evans\u2019 \u201cbelief\u2019 constituted an opinion. Accordingly, the testimony was nothing more than a reiteration of the evidence and therefore cumulative. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the evidence was opinion testimony which failed to comport with the requirements of Maryland Rule 5-701, because, for instance, the fact(s) for which the testimony was offered to clarify a matter for the jury was not determinative of a fact in issue, any error in admitting same would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665. The weight of the evidence supported the jury\u2019s conclusion, however, as to each element of the bribery count and Evans\u2019 testimony regarding his belief as to appellant\u2019s authority in the awarding of contracts was, in this context, inconsequential. We perceive no harm and thus decline to reverse on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">D. Relevance</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">As a general rule, evidence is admissible \u201cif it is relevant to the issues in the case and tends either to establish or disprove them.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>118 Md.App. at 416, 702 A.2d 971. Evans\u2019 statement was generally relevant because it tended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>establish that appellant approached ISI, as an official of the County, in a manner that conveyed to ISI that appellant could influence the awarding of the contract. Certainly, relevant evidence may be excludable on other grounds and appellant asks us to find that this particular witness offered inadmissible lay opinion testimony. As explained <em>supra, </em>we decline to reverse on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The State, for its part, cites to <em>Linden v. United States, </em>254 F.2d 560, 565 (4th cir.1958), in support of the proposition that, \u201cwhere, as here, the indictment charges the defendant with making captious, deceptive, and misleading solicitations, the effect of the solicitations upon the recipients is a highly pertinent fact in determining whether the solicitations are of the nature charged.\u201d According to the State, \u201cthe testimony of Mr. Evans about his belief was relevant to the conspiracy to commit theft by deception count since it assisted in proving [appellant\u2019s] intent,\u201d positing that \u201c[t]he jury could have reasonably concluded that [appellant] intended to deceive ISI, as verified by the fact that ISI [Mr. Evans] believed [appellant] and agreed to the demands.\u201d Because Evans was participating in an official investigation, it is unclear how Evans was deceived. Nor is it clear how Evans \u201cbelieved appellant and agreed to [appellant\u2019s] demands.\u201d The State\u2019s relevancy argument, on the other hand, is not persuasive, but, nonetheless, we reemphasize the utter lack of prejudice to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Appellant, in turn, argues that, if Evans\u2019 testimony was in fact relevant to the issue of appellant\u2019s intent to deceive, the trial court should have issued a limiting instruction directing the jury not to consider Evans\u2019 testimony in its deliberation on the bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery counts. Appellant did not request such an instruction, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 5-105, nor do we think one was necessary. We see no reason to reverse appellant\u2019s conviction based on the admission of Evans\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>indictment, which charged appellant with the offense of bribery under C.L. \u00a7 9-201 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">ROBERT L. THOMAS and PAUL WRIGHT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">at Prince George\u2019s County, aforesaid, from on or about September 29, 2004, and continuing through on or about February 11, 2005, the exact days to the Grand Jury being unknown, the said Robert L. Thomas being then and there a public employee working for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland in the capacity of Deputy Director of the Department of Central Services, did demand and receive a bribe for the purpose of influencing the said Robert L. Thomas in the performance of his official duties in violation of <em>\u00a7 9-201, </em>Criminal_ <em>Law Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, </em>and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">(Bribery, <em>\u00a7 9-201, Criminal Law Article, Annotated Code of </em>Maryland).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">According to appellant, the indictment failed to state an essential element of the crime of bribery \u2014 namely, that the bribe must have been demanded or received <em>from another. </em>At the close of the State\u2019s case, appellant moved to dismiss the bribery count for failure to state an offense. The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s argument, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">With respect to Count 2, certainly if there was any confusion on behalf of the defendant, he could have filed a motion for a Bill of Particulars, initiated discovery or moved to dismiss. I believe for the reasons expressed by the State, the Count 2 is a count drawn in accordance with the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">The State argues that appellant waived this argument by raising it for the first time at the end of the State\u2019s case. The State adds that the failure of the indictment to aver that appellant demanded or received a bribe <em>from another </em>did not render the indictment defective, because \u201cbasic common sense says that \u2018you cannot bribe yourself.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Although we agree with the State that the trial court did not err by denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the bribery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>count, we reach that conclusion for reasons other than those advanced by the State. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">A. Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">As an initial matter, we hold that appellant did not waive this argument by raising it for the first time at the close of the State\u2019s case. The State\u2019s waiver argument is not supported by the plain language of Maryland Rule 4-252(d), which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] motion asserting failure of the charging document ... to charge an offense may be raised and determined at any time.\u201d Appellant argued that the bribery count should be dismissed because it failed to properly charge him with the offense of bribery. He was entitled, under Rule 4-252(d), to raise this allegation at any time. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 792, 490 A.2d 1277 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">B. Failure to State an Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The State is correct, however, in asserting that the trial court did not err when it denied appellant\u2019s request to dismiss the bribery count. The Court of Appeals has previously explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">A primary purpose to be fulfilled by a charging document under the Maryland Law is to satisfy the constitutional requirement of Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights that each person charged with a crime be informed of the accusation against him, first, by characterizing the crime and, second, by so describing it as to inform the accused of the specific conduct with which he is charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-10\"><em>Jones v. State, </em>303 Md. 323, 326, 493 A.2d 1062 (1985) (internal citations omitted). In addition, Maryland Rule 4-202(a) requires that a charging document \u201cshall contain a concise and definite statement of the essential facts of the offense with which the defendant is charged and, with reasonable particularity, the time and place the offense occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">It is well-established that \u201cindictments for statutory offenses are sufficient if laid in the words of the statute,\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>long as the statutory words are \u201csufficient to meet the practical needs which an indictment is intended to supply....\u201d <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>190 Md. <em>578, 583, 59 </em>A.2d 337 (1948) (internal. citations omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Cunningham, </em>the Court of Appeals upheld indictments charging a defendant with bribing a police officer because the indictments plainly followed the language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 59 A.2d 337; <em>see also Bosco v. State, </em>157 Md. 407, 146 A. 238 (1929) (upholding indictment charging defendant with attempting to bribe a justice of the peace on the ground that it tracked the language of the bribery statute, noting that the allegation of knowledge, if required at all for the offense of bribery, was sufficiently implied from a statement of the acts that constituted the offense of bribery); <em>Tapscott v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 109, 127, 664 A.2d 42 (1995) (holding that, an indictment that tracked the language of the statute in charging a defendant with child abuse was sufficient to put the defendant on notice of the charged crime, even though the exact age of the victim was not specified in the charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In this case, appellant\u2019s indictment charged him with committing bribery, as codified in C.L. \u00a7 9-201, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">(c) A public employee may not demand or receive a bribe, fee, reward, or testimonial to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">(1) influence the performance of the official duties of the public employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">(2) neglect or fail to perform the official duties of the public employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The indictment alleged that appellant was a \u201cpublic employee working for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland in the capacity of Deputy Director of the Department of Central Services,\u201d and that appellant \u201cdid demand and receive a bribe for the purpose of influencing the said [appellant] in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>performance of his official duties in violation of \u00a7 9-201, Criminal Law Article____\u201d The indictment thus plainly-tracked the language of \u00a7 9-201. Moreover, as the State posits, it is implied in the language of the bribery statute that one must demand or receive a bribe from another. One cannot bribe oneself.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the indictment sufficiently characterized the crime of bribery under C.L. \u00a7 9-201(c) and, therefore, Count II of appellant\u2019s indictment did not fail to state an offense. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. In this opinion, reference will be made to Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2008 Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\">. Former Md.Code 1957, art. 27, \u00a7 23 prohibited a public officer from demanding or receiving a bribe for the purpose of influencing the public officer in the performance of his or her duties. This later became Md.Code 1957, art. 27, \u00a7 22, which was later reenacted, without substantive change, as C.L. \u00a7 9-201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. As explained <em>supra, </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 23 of the Maryland Code was a predecessor statute to C.L. \u00a7 9-201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">. Appellant points specifically to the following remark by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">Whether [appellant] had the actual ability to award anything or not himself, whether he already knew it was going to be awarded to them or not, he is conveying to them that he can and that he will. That's what you to need to focus on here.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b198-17\">. As noted, appellant\u2019s actual title was Deputy Director of the Prince George\u2019s County Office of Central Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\">. It was at this juncture that appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the State's question as to what Evans believed was \"[appellant\u2019s] ability to influence the awarding of the contract that you were involved in bidding on.\u201d At the bench conference which ensued, the court, opining that Evans\u2019 \u201cbeliefs, his understandings, his perception are not an issue,\" permitted the State to asked the question, but, in affirming his belief that the position can have influence over or does influence or would influence the awarding of a contract, Evans never explicitly testified as to the source of the information regarding appellant\u2019s position and authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">. It is unclear as to why the State was insistent upon asking Evans to explicate appellant\u2019s authority. Evans' testimony was unnecessary to establish that appellant had represented to others that he had the actual or apparent ability or authority to influence the awarding of contracts. In the recorded conversation played for the jury, appellant told Evans, \"I\u2019m going to make the decision ... then I'm going to send you a letter ... of intent to award.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">. Rather than delimit the State's line of questions regarding how Evans learned of appellant\u2019s job title, description and authority, the court may have considered and decided the issue of whether Evans' knowledge was acquired from his interpretation, perceptions or inferences drawn from ascertained or assumed facts and whether it was determinative of a fact in issue, rendering his \"belief\u201d subject to a Rule 5-701 analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\">. We note that appellant makes no challenge to sufficiency of the statutory language itself, but rather, argues that the essential elements of bribery were not sufficiently averred in Count II of the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
