State, </em>389 Md. 681, 887 A.2d 564, and <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 887 A.2d 602. Several categories of verbal conduct that had theretofore been considered non-hearsay were brought within the expanded definition of \u201cimplied assertions\u201d and, thereby, came under the potential exclusionary ban of the Rule Against Hearsay. The present case poses the question of whether yet another traditional category of non-hearsay, frequently referred to as \u201cverbal parts of acts\u201d and represented in this case by incoming telephone calls to gambling parlors or to sellers of narcotics, will also be swept away by the strong undertow of <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn, </em>or whether the expansionist tide that produced those opinions is actually on the ebb.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The appellant, Alphonso Garner, was convicted by a Queen Anne\u2019s County jury, presided over by Judge John W. Sause, Jr., of the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, of driving on a revoked license, and of other related offenses that were merged for sentencing. On this appeal, the appellant raises the three contentions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">1. that Judge Sause erroneously failed to comply with Maryland Rule 4-215 before allowing the appellant to waive his right to counsel,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">2. that Judge Sause erroneously admitted inadmissible hearsay evidence, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">3. that Judge Sause\u2019s improper comment deprived the appellant of his right to a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">The appellant does not challenge the legal sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence to prove his guilt generally. The only small residuum of controversy was his effort to convince the jury that he was only a user of drugs and not a pusher.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>At 3:45 in the afternoon on June 22, 2006, Trooper Jeremy Gussoni of the Maryland State Police and Scott Myers, a State Police Academy candidate, stopped the appellant, who was driving on U.S. Route 301 in Queen Anne\u2019s County, for no less than three minor traffic infractions. As they approached the appellant\u2019s stopped car, they heard him yell into a cell phone that he had been \u201cprofiled.\u201d The appellant immediately handed Trooper Gussoni an identification card and volunteered that his driver\u2019s license had been suspended. Trooper Gussoni verified the fact that the driver\u2019s license had been revoked. Trooper William Heath arrived on the scene and arrested the appellant for driving on a revoked license. A search incident to the appellant\u2019s arrest revealed 13 individually wrapped baggies containing what turned out to be cocaine \u201csecreted in the vehicle\u2019s glove box, inside a fuse box.\u201d The aggregate weight of the cocaine was 6.9 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On the way to the police station, the appellant asked, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen next?\u201d Trooper Gussoni replied that the baggies were going to be fingerprinted. The appellant then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. That shit is mine.\u201d When Trooper Gussoni said, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t use cocaine; that ... ruins your heart, your brain,\u201d the appellant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t do that stupid stuff, I only do it every now and again.\u201d Taken from the appellant at the police station was his cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">At trial, the appellant called his girlfriend as a witness. She testified that the appellant had a cocaine problem and that she had sometimes seen him \u201ceating\u201d cocaine. Corporal Aaron Michael testified as an expert witness and testified that he had never heard of anyone eating cocaine. He further testified that each of the 13 rocks of cocaine seized from the appellant had a street value of between $40 and $60. Trooper Gussoni had testified that when the appellant\u2019s cell phone rang at the station house, Gussoni answered it and said, \u201cHello.\u201d The caller asked, \u201cCan I get a 40?\u201d but then hung up when Gussoni asked him for his name. Trooper Michael explained that the term \u201c40\u201d is a \u201ccommon reference\u201d for four-tenths of a gram of crack cocaine. It was Trooper Michael\u2019s expert opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that the 13 baggies of cocaine taken from the appellant were intended for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The Minefield of Rule 4-215</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Before we can take up the evidentiary matter that is the marquee issue of this appeal, we must get across an ugly patch of difficult terrain. For a judge to traverse Rule 4-215 is to walk through a minefield. A miracle might bring one across unscathed. For mere mortals, the course will seldom be survived. The appellant\u2019s first contention is that Judge Sause failed to comply with the provisions of Rule 4-215(e) when he \u201callowed [the appellant] to waive his right to counsel\u201d immediately before the trial began. Rule 4-215(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">(e) Discharge of Counsel \u2014 Waiver. If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. <em>If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(1)-(f) of this Rule </em>if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Operating on the assumption that the appellant had been permitted to discharge his counsel, the appellant contends that compliance with subsection (a)(3) then requires that the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>(3) advise the defendant of the nature of the charges in the charging document, and the allowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In this case, the appellant was charged by a criminal information filed by the State\u2019s Attorney for Queen Anne\u2019s County on August 3, 2006. The flagship count was the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. The initial appearance of the appellant was set for August 25, 2006, but the summons was \u201cnot served.\u201d Judge Thomas G. Ross issued a bench warrant for the appellant. It was served on the appellant on September 7, 2006. On September 8, the appellant appeared, without counsel, for a bail review and initial appearance hearing. Judge Ross advised the appellant of the allowable penalties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">THE COURT: So you understand that you are charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance, not marijuana; that carries four years in prison $25,000 fine or both. <em>Charged with possession with intent to distribute controlled dangerous substance, not marijuana; that carries 20 years in prison, $25,000 fine or both. </em>You\u2019re charged with possession of paraphernalia; that\u2019s a fine only, unless subsequent offender papers are filed. That carries a $500 fine. Charged with distributing paraphernalia. Let me see about that. That carries a $500 fine. You are charged as well, in Count 5 with driving without a license; carries a $500 fine in this court. You are charged with violation of Transportation Article 16-303(c) driving on a suspended license; that carries a year in jail, $1,000 fine or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">Charged in the seventh count with driving on a revoked license and privilege; carries a year in jail, $1,000 fine or both. You are charged in Count 8 with a violation of 303(h) of the Transportation Article which is driving a motor vehicle while suspended under certain provisions of the Transportation Article. That carries 60 days in jail, $500 fine or both. You are charged with throwing, dumping, discharge, deposit of refuse on a public highway, carries $500 fine in this court. Charged with driving with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>obstructed windshield view which carries a $500 f\u00edne in this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">Okay. I\u2019ve advise you of the nature of the charges, the range of allowable penalties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The advice as to the allowable sentence for a conviction of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute was meticulously correct for a first offense on that charge. The \u201ckicker\u201d was that the appellant was apparently a fourth-time offender and was subject to a sentence, pursuant to Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 5-608(d), of \u201cnot less than 40 years.\u201d With respect to the required advice under that circumstance, the unforgiving command of <em>Knox v. State, </em>404 Md. 76, 88, 945 A.2d 638, is clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\"><em>We hold that \u201callowable penalties, </em>including mandatory penalties, if any,\u201d as stated in Rule 4-215, <em>includes notice of subsequent offender penalties </em>.... Absent information as to mandatory or <em>enhanced penalties, </em>it <em>could hardly be said that a defendant makes a knowing </em>and voluntary <em>decision to waive [or to discharge] counsel </em>with eyes open or with full knowledge of the ramifications of the choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">(Emphasis supplied). In this case, no advice was given with respect to the \u201cmandatory or enhanced penalties\u201d for a subsequent offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Counsel Was Not Discharged</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The saving grace is that the triggering event for the imposition of Rule 4-215(a)(3) never came to pass. The activating clause in subsection (e) is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\"><em>If this court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, </em>it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHC\">(Emphasis supplied). In this case, the trigger was never pulled. Counsel was never actually discharged. The minefield, though it could have been fatal, never actually had to be traversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Curt Anderson, Esq. was engaged as privately retained counsel on October 10, 2006. A pretrial conference was scheduled for October 20, 2006, but was \u201cvacated\u201d by mutual consent. Also by consent of the parties, the trial was postponed from November 29 to November 30, 2006. As of the morning of trial, however, trouble was in the air. Apparently Mr. Anderson\u2019s appraisal of the case was that the appellant\u2019s chances of acquittal were virtually non-existent, that the potential sentence the appellant was facing was heavy, and that the appellant\u2019s only feasible strategy was to make the best deal possible for himself. The appellant, on the other hand, was not inclined to deal. Judge Sause assured the appellant that he did not have to agree to a plea.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">MR. ANDERSON: Your Honor, as you can imagine, this is a very serious case with the State intending to pull a mandatory 25[on] Mr. Garner is \u2014 well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Potential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">MR. ANDERSON: Potential, the mandatory for Mr. Garner, if proceeded to trial. For the last couple of days, <em>I\u2019ve explained to Mr. Gamer the nature of the case, the evidence against him. </em>In other words, <em>things that a lawyer does prior to </em>trial and <em>I had recommended to Mr. Gamer a certain disposition </em>in this case, <em>as opposed to going to trial </em>and I have, apparently, done too consistently because Mr. Garner has indicated to me that he doesn\u2019t think that I have his best interests at heart with regard to this case. <em>He doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m going to try the case wholeheartedly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>became of my continued assertions that he take a, plea in the case. </em>Again, the only reason why I have suggested that to him \u2014 not the only reason \u2014 it\u2019s sometimes what I do prior to cases when I think the State \u2014 after my assessment of the State\u2019s case. So I thought I ought to bring that to the Court\u2019s attention because I think he was going to stand up and say it, but I thought, perhaps, at a bench conference it might be better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">THE COURT: Oh, yeah, I quite agree with that. Mr. Garner, you heard what Mr. Anderson said, do you want to add anything to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir. <em>I feel like he\u2019s not going to represent me in my best interest.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">THE COURT: Why didn\u2019t you do something about it before now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Because I thought he was going to try to represent me in my best interests, but after a couple days, I done seen that he\u2019s not trying to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">MR. ANDERSON: But I told you, I showed you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">THE DEFENDANT: \u2014 and I\u2019m not trying to take a plea. <em>He is trying to force a plea, make me take a plea that I don\u2019t want to take.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">THE COURT: <em>Well, you don\u2019t have to take a plea. I\u2019m not going to make you take a plea.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t feel that he don\u2019t want to represent me with my best interests with the case that\u2019s at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-13\">THE COURT: Well, then you should have done something about it before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">The attorney-client relationship that at one point was perilously hanging on the ropes then appeared to catch a second wind.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-16\">THE COURT: [Y]ou chose the attorney. If you had problems, you had to work it out with him. Mr. Anderson is a member of the bar, I\u2019m sure if you told him what your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>feelings were, I\u2019m sure he would have done something about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">THE DEFENDANT: I have told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">THE COURT: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>He can sit there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">THE COURT: <em>What?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>He can sit there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">THE COURT: <em>Okay. Thank you. Go ahead.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">At that point, to be sure, the status of the attorney-client relationship was still perilously ambiguous, but it gathered strength as the trial progressed. The appellant\u2019s only expressed dissatisfaction with Anderson initially had been over the issue of whether to proceed with a full-blown trial on the merits or to enter a guilty plea. Once that question was resolved as the appellant wished it to be, there was no indication of any further strategic disagreement between attorney and client. The bottom line is that Anderson was never discharged as counsel for the appellant and that the provisions of Rule 4-215(a)(3), therefore, never came into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">Our concern, and the concern of Rule 4-215, is with the fundamental right of a defendant to have the effective assistance of counsel when going to trial in a criminal case. That basic purpose was well expressed by Judge Orth in <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 281-82, 523 A.2d 597 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">It is perfectly clear that <em>the purpose of Rule k-215 is to protect that </em>most important <em>fundamental right to the effective assistance of counsel, </em>which is basic to our adversary system of criminal justice, and which is guaranteed by the federal and Maryland constitutions to every defendant in all criminal prosecutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">As we assess whether the appellant received that constitutionally guaranteed effective assistance of counsel, we will look to what actually took place at the appellant\u2019s trial and not at what looked as if it might take place in the waning moments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>before the trial began. Although the colloquy at that time was a bit vague, there loomed at least the possibility that Anderson might be discharged and might remain available only in a stand-by capacity by way of giving legal advice if such advice were to be sought by the <em>pro se </em>defendant. In fact, no such watered down relationship ever asserted itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Mr. Anderson professionally and ably conducted the complete defense of this case from start to finish. He conducted the voir dire examination of the prospective jurors and then selected the jury. He made a motion in limine. He delivered the opening statement. He cross-examined the State\u2019s witnesses and made objections. He called the appellant\u2019s girlfriend as a defense witness. He made motions, at the end of the State\u2019s case and at the end of the entire case, for a judgment of acquittal. He delivered a closing argument. He referred to the appellant as \u201cmy client.\u201d The State referred to him as \u201ccounsel\u201d: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m going to file the additional penalties 1 previously served on counsel, subsequent offender notice.\u201d He represented the appellant at sentencing. He filed and argued a new trial motion. Indeed, at that hearing on the motion for a new trial, Judge Sause noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7K\">I\u2019m delighted to see that there has apparently been a rapprochement. As I pointed out before, <em>Mr. Anderson participated to his usual able way throughout the trial.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">From the opening gavel through the conclusion of the motion for a new trial, there was never the remotest indication that Mr. Anderson was not full-fledged counsel for the defense. The appellant himself did not actively participate in the conduct of his trial in any way nor did he protest his passive role. This was in no respect the \u201chybrid representation\u201d described by <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. at 264, 523 A.2d 597:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">Hybrid representation is apparently considered to encompass both the participation of the defendant in the conduct of his trial when he had not effectively waived the assistance of an attorney to defend him, and the participation by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>attorney in the conduct of the trial when the defendant was defending <em>pro se.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In this case, it was Mr. Anderson and not the appellant who \u201ccalled the shots\u201d from start to finish. Judge Orth described the difference in roles.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\"><em>When a defendant appears pro se, it is he who calls the shots, </em>albeit, <em>perhaps, with the aid, advice and allocution of counsel </em>in the discretion of the trial judge. <em>When a defendant is represented by counsel, it is counsel who is in charge of the defense </em>and his say as to strategy and tactics is generally controlling, but again with such participation by the defendant as the trial judge deems appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">309 Md. at 265, 523 A.2d 597 (emphasis supplied). In the last analysis, the potential Rule 4-215 problem turns out to have been a non-starter. The minefield was finessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">When Is an Out-of-Court Utterance Non-Hearsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">That brings us to the fascinating evidentiary issue which is the main feature of this appeal. At the police station following his arrest, the appellant was relieved of his cell phone. When the cell phone rang, Trooper Gussoni answered it by saying, \u201cHello.\u201d A male caller inquired, \u201cCan I get a 40?\u201d but then hung up when Trooper Gussoni asked him his name. Trooper Gussoni actually described the phone as \u201cringing non-stop.\u201d \u201cAgain, it was just continually ringing, ringing.\u201d Although this brief telephone exchange added little, if anything, to the proof of the appellant\u2019s guilt as a possessor, it clearly helped to characterize that possession as commercial in nature and not as simple possession for personal use. The defense moved in limine to have the content of the call excluded from evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">Obviously, it\u2019s an anonymous call. We don\u2019t know who it was from, we don\u2019t know if they got the right number and <em>I\u2019m not able, obviously, to cross-examine. I think the reliability of whatever was said on the other end is subject to suspicion </em>and I think the probative value of that would certainly not outweigh the prejudice that it would weigh on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>my client in this particular case. The person on the other end said something about do you have \u2014 do you have a 40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alq\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The motion in limine was denied and the State did not hesitate, in opening statement, to characterize the call as precisely the thing it was.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">He [had] a cell phone that he was actually talking on immediately when Trooper Gussoni stopped him and his phone kept ringing at the barrack. Eventually, Trooper Gussoni picked it up and <em>the person on the other end of the phone </em>asked <em>him </em>\u2014 said <em>he needed a 40. </em>I think you\u2019ll hear from Corporal Michael <em>a 40 is slang for a $40 piece of cocaine.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In closing argument, the State again referred to the phone call as proving precisely the thing that it validly served to prove, to wit, that the appellant was a pusher and not a mere user.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">There are lots of factors for distribution. Very few factors for possession in this case. I mean, not possession \u2014 personal, mere use. Very little actually, nothing for mere use because there\u2019s nothing to use it with. But I keep coming back, I know I said this before, you do not, <em>you do not ca[ll] a user a mere user of cocaine and ask him for a 40. </em>As Corporal Michael tells you, crack cocaine, the language on it is a 20, a 40, a 60, a 80, 100. A 40 is a $40 piece of crack cocaine. Once you do the math, which I did. 6.9 divided by 12, is .53. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re all .53. Some could be .4, some could be .6, but we\u2019re in that range, between a 40 and a 60, on the average. <em>That\u2019s what he\u2019s got. Call this guy\u2019s phone, </em>the phone is blowing up. <em>Phone is going crazy, Trooper Gussoni </em>probably <em>answers it, </em>maybe it\u2019s his girlfriend, <em>yes, I need a 40. That\u2019s a pretty big factor.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">To be admissible, evidence must be competent, relevant, and material. The evidence of the phone call in this case was self-evidently relevant and material. What remains to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tested is its competence. That will depend upon whether it is or is not hearsay. The basic rule, most aptly described as the Rule Against Hearsay,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is set out in Maryland Rule of Procedure 5-802.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">Except as otherwise provided by these rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes, <em>hearsay is not admissible.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">(Emphasis supplied). Rule 5-801, in turn, gives us the necessary definitions to go to work on the problem.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">(a) Statement. <em>A \u201cstatement\u201d is </em>(1) <em>an oral </em>or written <em>assertion </em>or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, <em>if it is intended by the person as an assertion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">(b) Declarant.

It was also universally recognized, virtually <em>ab origine, </em>that <em>a hearsay statement could consist of a nonverbal action if the action were intended by the actor to be an assertion. </em>The pointing of a finger at Suspect # 4 is just as assertive as are the words, \u201cThe man who robbed me is Suspect #4.\u201d Just as surely assertive, in response to a question, is a vertical shaking of the head (\u201cYes\u201d), a horizontal shaking of the head (\u201cNo\u201d), or a shrug of the shoulders (\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In <em>Holland v.

The making of a wager or the purchase of a drug, legally or illegally, is a form of contract. <em>Little v. State, </em>204 Md. 518, 522-23, 105 A.2d 501 (1954). There is an offer and an acceptance. The telephoned words of the would-be bettor or would-be purchaser are frequently categorized, therefore, as verbal parts of acts. They are not considered to be assertions and do not fall under the scrutiny of the Rule Against Hearsay. Sometimes, however, the categorization traveled under the now discredited label of res gestae. See <em>Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 1, 12-14, 536 A.2d 666 (1988). (It was only the academic rationale that has been discredited, not the admissibility <em>per se </em>of the telephoned utterances.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">In John Strong, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>(4th ed.1992), \u00a7 249, \u201cSome Out-of-Court Utterances Which Are Not Hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>say,\u201d under the subhead \u201cVerbal parts of acts,\u201d p. 102, appears the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">Similar considerations are commonly said to prevail when the character of an establishment is sought to be proved by evidence of statements made in connection with activities taking place on the premises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">(Emphasis supplied).

Over \u201cthe period of an hour various persons calling from places unknown placed $85 in bets with him.\u201d 187 Md. at 3, 48 A.2d 430. The contents of the calls were held to be admissible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">[T]he evidence, as we have seen, was offered to show that the place in question was a gambling place and that some or all of the persons found therein were engaged in taking bets in violation of law.

Analogously, Detective Eller\u2019s testimony about the phone call in this case was offered as evidence that the call was made for the purpose of arranging an illegal drug transaction.

Long, </em>905 F.2d 1572 (D.C.Cir.1990), a warranted search of a premises for narcotics was in process when the police answered a telephone call. The caller wanted to know whether Keith (the defendant) \u201cstill had any stuff.\u201d When the officer sought clarification, the caller explained that she was asking about \u201ca fifty.\u201d The defendant Long objected to the admissibility of the contents of the call on the ground that it was an implied assertion that the defendant had narcotics for sale. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected the challenge on the basis that it was not an assertion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">Although the rule does not define \u201cassertion,\u201d the accompanying advisory committee note stresses that <em>\u201cnothing is an assertion unless intended to be one.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\"><em>The caller\u2019s words, thus, cannot be characterized as an \u201cassertion, \u201d even an implied one, unless the caller intended to make such an \u201cassertion. \u201d </em>... <em>[T]he crucial distinction </em>under rule 801 <em>is between intentional and unintentional messages, </em>regardless of whether they are express or implied. <em>It is difficult to imagine any question or for that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>matter any act, that does not in some way convey an implicit message.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">905 F.2d at 1579-80 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The D.C.

Lewis, </em>902 F.2d 1176 (5th Cir.1990); also involved a telephone call, but one with an added dimension. The police arrested the defendant Lewis as a narcotics pusher and seized from him a pager or beeper. When the pager began beeping, the police called the number displayed on it. The person on the other end of the line picked up the phone and asked, \u201cDid you get the stuff?\u201d The defendant interposed a hearsay objection, which the Fifth Circuit rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\"><em>The questions </em>asked by the unknown caller, <em>like most questions </em>and inquiries, <em>are not hearsay because they do not, </em>and were not intended, to <em>assert anything.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">902 F.2d at 1179 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">The Fifth Circuit went on to explain why implied assertions do not qualify as \u201cstatements\u201d within the contemplation of the Rule Against Hearsay as that rule is now almost universally defined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">Appellants argue that while the questions in this case are not direct assertions, there are certain assertions implicit in the questions. For example, they argue that implicit in the question \u201cDid you get the stuff?\u201d is an assertion that Lewis and/or Wade were expecting to receive some \u201cstuff.\u201d How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ever, <em>Rule 801, through its definition of \u201cstatement, \u201d forecloses appellants\u2019 argument by removing implied assertions from the coverage of the hearsay rule.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">As these federal circuit court decisions illustrate, the danger of a sweepingly broad definition of \u201cimplied assertion\u201d is that virtually every utterance can arguably be deemed to be an implied assertion of the thing it is offered to prove, no matter how attenuated the string of inferences. Without some constraint on the process, there could be virtually nothing left to the very concept of non-hearsay. The utterance, after all, would not be offered if it were not offered to prove something. In a sense, any piece of evidence \u201cimplies\u201d the thing it is offered to prove, lest it be deemed irrelevant. That is why the participle \u201cimplied\u201d is such a treacherous term. Any doctrinal discipline, if it is to exist, must be found in the noun \u201cassertion.\u201d A careful and insistent application of the term \u201cassertion\u201d is an indispensable antidote to the promiscuous explosion of the Rule Against Hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Reach and the Future of <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bernadyn</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In arguing that the anonymous telephone caller\u2019s question, \u201cCan I get a 40?\u201d was an implied assertion that the appellant was a seller of cocaine and that it, therefore, fell under the ban of the Rule Against Hearsay, the appellant, of necessity, relies upon a broad reading of the Court of Appeals opinions in <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bernadyn. </em>The appellant\u2019s tactic is an astute one. It also pinpoints for us the precise point on which our decision must pivot one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">If we give <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bernadyn </em>the broad and expansive reading urged by the appellant, the untethered sweep of \u201cimplied assertions\u201d could easily embrace the anonymous caller\u2019s question in this case. Indeed, a large part of the pre<em>Stoddard </em>and <em>pre-Bemadyn </em>constraint on the excessive overuse of the Rule Against Hearsay was the requirement that the out-of-court declaration actually be an assertion. A broad definition of implied assertion, however, as any utterance that can be used by its proponent to prove anything effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>excises the word \u201cassertion\u201d out of every definition of hearsay. It brings into play the very looseness of language (and of thought) that we cautioned against in our <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>157 Md.App. at 273 n. 12, 850 A.2d 406.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">The problem, of course, is that the phrase \u201cimplied assertion,\u201d in widespread use for 150 years, had nothing to do with an action\u2019s or an utterance\u2019s being assertive. It was simply a poor choice of words to connote the capacity of the action or the utterance to be, circumstantially, the trigger for an inference. The sophisticated may be comfortable with it, but <em>the very idea of a non-assertive assertion </em>is going to continue to trip a lot of people up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">If, on the other hand, we read the decisions in <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn </em>conservatively and as carefully confined to the situations before the Court on those occasions, we would not hesitate to hold the brief telephoned inquiry in this case was non-hearsay and, therefore, admissible. <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn </em>were not dealing with that variety of non-hearsay frequently described by the academic commentators as \u201cverbal parts of acts.\u201d <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn </em>did not overrule, or even mention, for example, Judge Karwacki\u2019s decision in <em>Best v. State </em>or the impressive body of nationwide caselaw represented by <em>Best v. State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Although we would not normally presume to undertake such an assessment, the pivotal decision of which way to turn in this case leaves us no choice but to attempt to diagnose the relative vitality or fragility of <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\"><em>Fields v. State: </em>A Harbinger of Retreat</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Almost four months after <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn </em>were decided, this Court filed its opinion in <em>Fields v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 22, 895 A.2d 339 (2006). The appellant there was convicted of one count of first-degree murder and two counts of first-degree assault. The evidence showed that Fields had engaged in a shooting spree just outside a bowling alley. His defense \u201cwas that he was not the shooter and was not even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>present at the bowling alley when the shootings happened.\u201d 168 Md. at 28, 176 A. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">A key item of State\u2019s evidence helped to prove that Fields was, indeed, at the bowling alley on the night of the shootings. There was a television monitor at each bowling lane. The names and scores of the bowlers at that lane were displayed on a screen. One of the three names on the screen above Lane 22 was \u201cSat Dogg.\u201d Other evidence established that Fields\u2019s nickname was \u201cSat Dogg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The defense contention before the trial court was that the writing of the name \u201cSat Dogg\u201d was hearsay because it was an implied assertion of the fact that Sat Dogg was present at the bowling alley that night.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">Immediately before the start of trial, the defense moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude the State from eliciting testimony from Detective Canales that the name \u201cSat Dogg\u201d appeared on a television screen in the bowling alley or introducing into evidence the detective\u2019s handwritten list showing that the name \u201cSat Dogg\u201d appeared on the television screen at bowling lane 22. <em>Defense counsel argued that the evidence was hearsay. Specifically, she maintained that the name </em>\u201cSat Dogg\u201d on the screen <em>was an implied assertion, </em>by an unknown declarant, made out of court, <em>that the appellant was present in the bowling alley that night; and the State was offering the implied assertion in evidence to show its truth. </em>Because the evidence did not fall within any exception to the rule against hearsay, it was inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">168 Md.App. at 29, 895 A.2d 339 (emphasis supplied). The trial judge denied the motion, ruling that there was no reason to think that the writer of the name intended it to be \u201can assertion that the appellant was present at that location.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 895 A.2d 339. Fields was convicted of all three crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The procedural history of the <em>Fields </em>appeal provides insight into some arguable restiveness within the Court of Appeals about <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn. </em>An unreported opinion of this Court, authored by Judge Deborah Eyler, had initially affirmed Fields\u2019s conviction. It was filed on May 25, 2005. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of the contentions was the hearsay issue. This Court rejected it. On December 8, 2005, the Court of Appeals filed its decisions in <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn. </em>On January 11, 2006, the Court of Appeals vacated the decision of this Court in the <em>Fields </em>case and remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Bemadyn. </em>In our published opinion of March 80, 2006, Judge Eyler reaffirmed our earlier position.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">We have reconsidered our decision in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Bemadyn, </em>and shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">168 Md.App. at 26, 895 A.2d 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Our opinion acknowledged that, under <em>Stoddard, </em>the ruling of the trial judge that the writing was not hearsay because it was not intended to be an assertion could no longer be sustained.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\"><em>[T]he reason the trial judge gave for concluding that the evidence </em>that the appellant\u2019s nickname was on a television screen in the bowling alley <em>was non-hearsay was incorrect, under Stoddard. </em>The trial judge determined that the person who entered the name \u201cSat Dogg\u201d on the screen did not intend to assert that the appellant was present in the bowling alley. If the words \u201cSat Dogg\u201d were an implied assertion of the factual proposition that the appellant was present in the bowling alley at the time of the shootings, it would make no difference whether the \u201cdeclarant\u201d of the words intended to convey that factual proposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">168 Md.App. at 35-36, 895 A.2d 339 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">We nonetheless held that the writing was not hearsay for the independent reason that it was non-assertive circumstantial evidence that Fields was at the crime scene.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\"><em>The appellant\u2019s name on the television screen </em>in the bowling alley was not an implied assertion of the factual proposition that the appellant was present at the bowling alley, although it <em>was circumstantial evidence </em>that could be probative of that fact. <em>Because the evidence was not an \u201cassertion,\u201d </em>under Rule 5-801 (a), <em>it was not a \u201cstatement\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>under that subsection <em>and hence was not hearsay </em>under Rule 5-801(c). <em>It was admissible non-hearsay evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 38, 895 A.2d 339 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Judge Kenney was also a member of that panel and dissented from the majority decision. It was his opinion that the writing, under the authority of <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn, </em>was an implied assertion and was, therefore, hearsay.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\"><em>Stoddard and Bemadyn lead me to conclude that the evidence </em>at issue <em>cannot be treated merely as circumstantial evidence </em>from which a fact finder might conclude that appellant was present at the bowling alley on the night of the incident, a fact that appellant denies.... [T]he name \u201cSat Dogg\u201d on the television monitor, standing alone, has no purpose except to assert that appellant was obviously present and bowling on Lane 22 on the night in question. Its probative value is dependent on an unknown scribe\u2019s belief that one of the bowlers on lane 22 was \u201cSat Dogg,\u201d and the accuracy of that belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">168 Md.App. at 49-50, 895 A.2d 339 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">On June 14, 2006, the Court of Appeals granted certiorari expressly to consider the specific question of \u201cwhether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that petitioner\u2019s nickname, \u2018Sat Dogg,\u2019 which was displayed on a television monitor above a bowling lane, was not hearsay.\u201d 390 Md. 513, 889 A.2d 1025 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The issue was thus cleanly joined. It would have been hard to drive a wedge between the circumstantial nature of the evidence in <em>Fields </em>and the circumstantial nature of the evidence in <em>Bemadyn. </em>There was no impediment to the deciding of the case on the issue for which certiorari had been granted. The decision in the case was filed on December 8, 2006, one year to the day after <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn </em>had been handed down. <em>Fields, </em>395 Md. 758, 912 A.2d 637. After a routine recitation of the facts of the case and of its procedural history, the Court based its decision on a not particularly certworthy alternative ground.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>We need not determine whether the testimony </em>of Detective Canales <em>was inadmissible based on Bemadyn, </em>or even if the evidence is distinguishable, because even if it was hearsay and not admissible, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">395 Md. at 763-64, 912 A.2d 637 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In the wake of <em>Fields, </em>only an automaton could refrain from asking, \u201cWhy?\u201d We would have to be blind not to conclude that something was in ferment behind the scenes; and that it was something other than a ringing endorsement of <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn. </em>Perhaps the energy that fueled the <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn </em>decisions a year ago has to some greater or lesser extent cooled. We are not suggesting for a moment that we would not follow the express and literal holdings of <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn. </em>We are simply pointing out that, in order to decide this case, we have to read the tea leaves. Reading those auguries, we are not persuaded to give <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn </em>a liberal or expansive interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The Plague of Plain Error</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In establishing his expertise on the subjects of drug use, detection, identification, and distribution, Corporal Aaron Michael of the Maryland State Police Drug Task Enforcement Division testified that he had made between 75 and 100 cocaine related arrests. On cross-examination it was brought out that Corporal Michael had never arrested the appellant. From that modest launching pad, the defense attempted a Herculean leap of logic in closing argument. It sought to persuade the jury that if Corporal Michael, with 75 to 100 notches in his belt in a sparsely populated rural area, had never arrested the appellant, the appellant, <em>ipso facto, </em>must have had a clean record. The State objected, and Judge Sause reminded defense counsel that Corporal Michael was not the only police officer in Queen Anne\u2019s County.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [C]learly <em>had this gentleman been arrested </em>for distribution <em>before by the expert, </em>who had made 75 to 100 arrests, <em>he could have brought that up, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>talked about that, \u201cYou know, this is one of the guys that we know about\u201d or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">Clearly, <em>had they made buys from him </em>in the past, <em>they could say, </em>\u201cCome to think of it, <em>we made buys from him </em>\u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKz\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m going to object, Your Honor, we can\u2019t raise that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">THE COURT: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: He is saying we could have raised if we made buys from him or not in the past. We can\u2019t, we can\u2019t say that we know about him or not, we can\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">THE COURT: That\u2019s right. All right. That is correct. So, Mr. Anderson, as you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I was going on what the corporal actually said with regard to him having never arrested Mr. Garner in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019ll leave it at that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">THE COURT: <em>I mean, there are an awful lot of police officers in Queen Anne\u2019s County </em>and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>That\u2019s true.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-14\">THE COURT: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">In an even more Herculean leap of logic, the appellant now contends that Judge Sause, in effect, told the jury that the appellant had a criminal record for narcotics violations. He claims that his case was hopelessly compromised.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-17\">There is no possible construction of this remark which does not presuppose that Mr. Garner had a criminal history related to drug distribution. Judge Sause\u2019s extremely prejudicial comment, which was made in full hearing of the jury, requires reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">We are not disposed to give the matter any further thought. There was no objection, and the issue is not preserved for appellate review. Maryland Rule 4-323(c). In that the appellant, strangely, does not even ask us to overlook non-preservation, this contention may qualify as an instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>of non-preservation squared. By arguing the contention at length, however, the appellant would seem to invoke, at least implicitly, the plain error provision of Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The frequency with which we are called upon to throw the life preserver of plain error to sinking (and eminently sinkable) contentions is almost a litigational scandal. It is as if appellate preservation had become an anachronistic embarrassment. We know, of course, that the possibility of plain error is out there, and on a rare and extraordinary occasion we might even be willing to go there. One must remember, however, that a consideration of plain error is like a trip to Angkor Wat or Easter Island. It is not a casual stroll down the block to the drugstore or the 7-11. The exaggerated cry of alarm in this case evokes no echo of Angkor Wat or Easter Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\">.
