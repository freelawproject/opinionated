B. Lafferty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The jury found the following verdict: \u201cWe the jury find for the plaintiff, that he recover from the defendant possession of the tracts of land described and specified in the declaration as being situate in the tributaries of God-win\u2019s Island creek, containing two and two-tenths acres, fifty-five one-hundredths acres, four and one-fourth -acres and one and three-tenths acres, and that he is entitled to said parcels of land in fee simple.\u201d Upon this verdict the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The defendant\u2019s title to the parcels of land held by him is founded upon an assignment, under the oyster laws of the State, from the oyster inspector for District 23 A, in Northampton county. He has paid all rents, taxes and fees, as required by law, and planted a large quantity of oysters on the ground assigned to him. The plaintiff\u2019s title is based upon a tax deed from the clerk of the court, bearing date February 11, 1890, whereby, for the consideration of $2.50, he conveyed to the plaintiff real estate, standing in the name of Jesse Hutchinson and sold for delinquent taxes. The tax deed (after reciting that there was a report of the county surveyor \u201cspecifying the metes and bounds\u201d of the real estate, \u201cand the names of the owners of the adjoining tracts or lots, and giving further description of the land as will identify the same\u201d) grants to Laf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ferty \u201cthat tract of land sold by the treasurer of Northampton county as aforesaid, described as Godwin\u2019s Island, containing forty-three and three-fourths acres, and mentioned in the said report of the said county surveyor, as surrounded by New Inlet, Wreck Island creek, Ship Shoals Inlet and Godwin\u2019s Island creek, for a more particular description of which reference is made to said report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The report of the surveyor was lost and its contents not proved. The land books of the county show that the only land assessed to the plaintiff in Northampton county is 44 acres, valued at $50.00 and buildings at $100.00, and that the total tax assessed thereon for the year 1908 was $2.42; yet the land included in this tax-title deed forms the nucleus for a claim by the plaintiff to a boundary of 1,400 or 1,500 acres (or, according to the estimate of one of the oyster inspectors, to from 2,000 to 3,000 acres) of alleged tributary lands, to low water mark where the waters ebb bare. But the evidence fails to locate and identify the forty-odd acres of land acquired by the plaintiff at the tax sale; and consequently it does not and cannot appear that the outlying oyster-planting ground assigned to the defendant is in any wise appurtenant to the original tract. Indeed, the consensus of the testimony of witnesses both for the plaintiff and defendant (including that of the county surveyor) is, that the lands claimed by the plaintiff cannot be located. Nor was it shown that the lands described in the declaration as \u201csituated on the southern side of what is commonly known as Lafferty\u2019s or Godwin\u2019s Island\u201d are bounded by the lands of the plaintiff. That averment has for its support the opinion of the plaintiff, whose conclusion is 'drawn from undisclosed facts. Obviously, the dominant estate must first be clearly located in order to determine the extent of the servient tenement.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Nor is the situation aided by the verdict, which finds four out of the seven parcels of ground sued for, for a description of which the declaration is referred to. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>; In <em>Slocum </em>v. Compton, 93 Va. 374, 25 S. E. 3, the court held: \u201cWhere the verdict in an action of ejectment is for a part only of the land sued for, the boundaries of the part recovered should be designated. The verdict must be certain in itself, or must refer to some certain standard by which to ascertain the land found, otherwise it will be too uncertain to warrant a judgment upon it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The present case in this aspect is quite similar to the case of <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Bunting, </em>107 Va. 174, 57 S. E. 567, where Judge Cardwell, speaking for the court, says: \u201cTo sustain his contention that, as riparian owner, he also owned the whole of Little Assoteague bay, it was necessary for Bunting (plaintiff in the action of ejectment) to establish his ownership of the lands adjacent to the bay on all of the shore sides thereof. ... In other words, Bunting\u2019s claim is that he owned the whole of the bay by virtue of owning the high ground around the bay; that his title as owner of the ground around the bay extended to low-water mark; that the bay ebbed bare; and that he, therefore, owned the whole of the bay.\u201d The court held that \u201cthe land conveyed was described as situated on Chincoteague Island, and embraced within courses and distances, but no starting point or ending point is given, and hence the location of the land could not have been ascertained, and the deed is inoperative as against a subsequent purchaser for value, even if he had notice of its existence.\u201d <em>Mundy </em>v. <em>Vawter, </em>3 Gratt. 518; <em>Florance </em>v. <em>Morien, </em>98 Va. 35, 34 S. E. 890: <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>106 Va. 701, 56 S. E. 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">If, therefore, there were no other assignment of error, the failure of the plaintiff to establish his title to the parcels of oyster-planting ground in the possession of the defendant, as appurtenant to the forty-four acres acquired by him at the tax sale, would necessitate a reversal of the judgment. But we are of opinion that the court also erred in excluding from the evidence the grant from the Commonwealth to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Hutcheson, dated March 13, 1877. That grant conveyed to Hutcheson 855 57/100 acres of land situated in Northampton county, including Ship Shoal and Godwin\u2019s Islands, and was admissible evidence as tending to show an outstanding legal title to at least part of the appurtenant lands claimed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">As the case must be. remanded for a new trial along essentially different lines, we deem it unnecessary to notice objections to the ruling of the court with respect to instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">For these reasons the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>Re versed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
