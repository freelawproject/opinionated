J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK3\">\u2014In <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson </em>the People appeal from an order of the court granting a defense motion in arrest of judgment. In 46 other cases which we have consolidated for purposes of argument and decision, the People appeal from orders dismissing the actions after demurrers were sustained. Each of the 47 cases involves the constitution\u00e1lity of section 103.103.1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. That section requires that a permit be issued by the board of police commissioners before anyone can operate a \u201csocial club.\u201d  The trial courts involved here concluded that the section was unconstitutional. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The ordinance in question reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">\u201cSEC. 103.103.1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-7\">\u201c(a) Definition.

The Board may require a public hearing prior'to taking action on an application for a permit pursuant to this section. The applicant shall cause to be published a notice of public heaping two times at intervals of not less than five days, within the 21-day period following the filing of an application, in a newspaper of general circulation in the district where the business is to be located. Furthermore, the Board may give notice by mail to all property owners within three hundred feet of the proposed business. The Board shall cause a suitable public notice to be posted at the location where the business is to be conducted. The applicant shall bear all expenses involved in mailing, printing, publishing;, and posting such notice. Such public notice shall conform to the rules and regulations adopted by the Board and shall be designed to inform the public as to the nature of the business to be engaged in; its location, the names of the applicant or applicants, the time of the public hearing and the right of persons objecting to be heard. Any interested person may file written protests or objections, or appear at the hearing. The Board shall give consideration to all such protests in reaching a decision on such application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The ordinances which set the standards for the granting of a license of this type are Los Angeles Municipal Code sections 103.29 and 103.31 which read as follows: \u2022 \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-5\">\u201cSEC. 103.29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">\u201cAfter an investigation, the Board may: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-7\">\u201c(a) Issue Permit.

The Board shall not issue a permit for a business prohibited by any local or state law, statute, rule or regulation, or prohibited in the particular location by the provisions of Chapter 1 of this Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-5\">\u201c(b) Ground for Denial\u2014Nuisance. The Board shall not issue a permit for a business which has been or is a public nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-6\">\u201c(c) Further Grounds for Denial. The Board may deny a permit on any of the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-7\">\u201c1. The applicant is unfit to be trusted with the privileges granted by such permit, or has a bad moral character, intemperate habits or a bad reputation for truth, honesty or integrity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-8\">\u201c2. The applicant is a person under the age of 18 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-9\">\u201c3. The applicant, his agent or employee, or any person connected or associated with the applicant as partner, director, officer, stockholder, associate, or manager has committed or aided or abetted in the commission of any act or act of omission which, if committed by a permittee, would be a ground for disciplinary action under this Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-10\">\u201c4. The applicant, his agent or employee, or any person connected or associated with the applicant as partner, director, officer, stockholder, associate or manager has been refused a permit or had a permit revoked or has been an officer, director, member, partner or manager of any person who has been refused a permit or had a permit revoked by the Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">The People place most of their reliance on <em>Sunset Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 64 [101 Cal.Rptr. 768, 496 P.2d 840]. However, <em>Sunset Amusement </em>dealt with the denial of renewal permits to run a roller rink. Though it stated that the standards for issuing the permit, those of Los Angeles Municipal Code section 103.29, were sufficiently specific to comport with due process, that holding was based on the finding that the statute applied only to activity not protected by the First Amendment. The pertinent language of <em>Sunset Amusement </em>(7 Cal.3d at pp. 72-73) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-12\">\u201cA municipality has broad power to enact \u2018all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7.) An ordinance so enacted will ordinarily be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 14\">*Supp. 14</page-number>upheld if \u2018it is reasonably related to promoting the public health, safety, comfort, and welfare, and if the means adopted to accomplish that promotion are reasonably appropriate to the purpose. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Higgins </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, </em>62 Cal.2d 24, 30 [41 Cal.Rptr. 9, 396 P.2d 41].) The requirement that a license first be obtained before conducting a business or activity has long been recognized as a valid exercise of the police power. <em>(Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>68 Cal.2d 684, 690 [68 Cal.Rptr. 721, 441 P.2d 281]; <em>In re Fuller, </em>15 Cal.2d 425, 431 [102 P.2d 321].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-4\">\u201cNevertheless, where First Amendment activities are involved, this court has subjected licensing ordinances to strict scrutiny. (See <em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>5 Cal.3d 656, 661-663 [97 Cal.Rptr. 320, 488 P.2d 648]; <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, 4 </em>Cal.3d 860, 866 [94 Cal.Rptr. <em>777, </em>484 P.2d 945]; <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 684, 690-697.) In <em>Burton, </em>we were faced with the validity of the same subdivision of section 103.29 (then subd. (b)) involved herein, as applied to an exhibitor of motion picture films to the public. In our analysis of the constitutionality of that subdivision we noted that \u2018The crucial factor here is our zealous solicitude for rights falling within the protection of the First Amendment,\u2019 since in that category of cases, \u2018 \u201c \u2018precision of regulation must be the touchstone\u2019 \u201d [citations] and the standards set forth [in the ordinance] must be \u201csusceptible of objective measurement\u201d [citations].\u2019 (Pp. 690-691.) We concluded that the subdivision in question here contained \u2018overly broad standards [which] are fraught with the hazard that an applicant will be denied his rights to free speech and press through exercise of the power of the board, in its discretion, to refuse a permit because of the content of the films which the applicant exhibits in his theater.\u2019 (P. 692.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-5\">\u201cIt is apparent that the rule announced in <em>Burton </em>applies only to those situations in which the operation of a licensing ordinance impinges upon the exercise of First Amendment activities, rather than ordinary commercial enterprises. <em>(Saunders </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 407, 411 [78 Cal.Rptr. 236].) Thus, in <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 566, 573 [12 Cal.Rptr. 226], the court upheld section 103.29 against a claim of vagueness and lack of standards in the context of the denial of a license for premises upon which food and beverages were sold and live entertainment provided. In <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 684, 693, we noted that the holding in <em>Daniel </em>was \u2018not necessarily in conflict with the views we express\u2019 since the <em>Daniel </em>opinion \u2018does not discuss the question of licensing activities within the ambit of the First Amendment . . . .\u2019 Nevertheless, presumably because the <em>Daniel </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 15\">*Supp. 15</page-number>did involve the licensing of \u2018live entertainment\u2019 possibly protected by the First Amendment (see <em>In re Giannini, </em>69 Cal.2d 563, 568-570 [72 Cal.Rptr. 655, 446 P.2d 535]), we disapproved <em>Daniel, </em>but only \u2018insofar as its language may be deemed inconsistent with the results . . . announced\u2019 in <em>Burton. </em>(68 Cal.2d at p. 693.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><em>\u201cTherefore, we conclude that insofar as Daniel involved activities not falling within the ambit of the First Amendment, that case correctly held that the language of section 103.29furnishes adequate standards to guide the Board in licensing matters and is not unconstitutionally vague. </em>(See also <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 407, 411-412; <em>Carolina Lanes, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 831, 835-836 [61 Cal.Rptr. 630]; <em>Sultan Turkish Bath </em>v. <em>Board of Police Comrs., </em>169 Cal.App.2d 188, 199-201 [337 P.2d 203].)\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">It would appear that the People are bootstrapping here. They ask us to assume that nothing goes on in any of the social clubs which might be protected by the First Amendment and then use that assumption to maintain their assertion that section 103.29 provides adequate guidelines for the restriction of these activities. Unlike a roller rink, a \u201csocial club\u201d may be a multitude of things. Nothing in the ordinance restricts the use of the term to any meaningful degree. The city attorney\u2019s argument that \u201cwe know\u201d what goes on there, just is not supported by the language of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Respondents correctly point out that when considering a claim of overbreadth, a reviewing court may take into account the operation of the provisions in factual situations other than the one at bar. <em>(In re Berry </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 137, 152 [65 Cal.Rptr. 273, 436 P.2d 273]; <em>N.A.A.C.P. </em>v. <em>Button </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 415, 432 [9 L.Ed.2d 405, 417-418, 83 S.Ct. 328].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fogelson </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 158 [145 Cal.Rptr. 542, 577 P.2d 677], the court recently emphasized that an individual charged with violating a law or regulation may attack its constitutionality on the basis that it substantially encroaches upon First Amendment protected activity whether or not the defendant\u2019s own conduct is shown to be constitutionally privileged. The court explicated at length that the vice of an overbroad ordinance affecting First Amendment rights is not only its effect in a particular case but also the \u201cchilling effect\u201d it has on the exercise by others of constitutional rights. We need not repeat that reasoning here. (At pp. 163-164.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 16\">*Supp. 16</page-number>In <em>Sunset Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, supra, </em>the following also was said: \u201cPetitioners also claim that \u2018the joint participation involved in skating (and watching skaters) at a roller skating rink is an assemblage entitled to protection under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of association and assembly . . . .\u2019 There is no question that petitioners\u2019 patrons are assembled together in one building or rink, and in that sense constitute an \u2018assemblage.\u2019 But again, no case has ever suggested that the constitutional freedom of assembly or association extends to a congregation of persons engaged in mere physical activity or self-amusement. \u2018It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association <em>for the advancement of beliefs and ideas </em>is an inescapable aspect of the \u201cliberty\u201d assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech. [Citations.]\u2019 (Italics added; <em>N.A.A.C.P. </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 460 [2 L.Ed.2d 1488, 1498, 78 S.Ct. 1163].) In the words of our state Constitution, \u2018The people shall have the right to freely assemble together <em>to consult </em>for the common good, <em>to instruct </em>their representatives, and <em>to petition </em>the Legislature for redress of grievances.\u2019 (Italics added; art. I, \u00a7 10.)\u201d (7 Cal.3d at pp. 74-75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The court concluded that no significant First Amendment activities were involved in the operation of the rollerskating rink.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">With respect to the ordinance here involved, the People contend that \u201cthe main purpose of social clubs, as defined by section 103.103.1, is to provide recreation and amusement and <em>not </em>communication or advancement of ideas and beliefs.\u201d This contention, although repeated several times by the People in varying language, simply cannot be upheld in light of the broad definition given to \u201csocial club\u201d by the ordinance itself and the principles of law set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fogelson, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The orders appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Pacht, J., and Bigelow, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
