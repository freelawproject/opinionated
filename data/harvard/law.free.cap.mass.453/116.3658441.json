Elizabeth Mancuso was a minor when the underlying action was commenced, but is now an adult.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b139-12\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEo\">The plaintiff, Elizabeth Mancuso, claims that she has a property interest in participating in interscholastic athletics as a member of her high school swim team. She contends that the defendant Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) deprived her of that property interest without due process, and that such deprivation entitles her to relief under the Federal and State civil rights laws. The plaintiff also maintains that the defendant violated her right to equal protection as a \u201cclass of one\u201d by denying her eligibility under its so-called \u201cfifth year student rule.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She claims the defendant unfairly declared her ineligible because of her participation in a private swimming club, while others who also swam in such clubs were not deemed ineligible. In addition, the plaintiff argues that the MIAA has promulgated rules intended to discourage the exercise of her right to seek judicial review of the MIAA\u2019s decision, and that these rules amount to \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d in violation of her rights under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 11I.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">We conclude that the plaintiff has no property interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>participating in interscholastic athletics, and thus no due process rights in the circumstances. Furthermore, the plaintiff has not shown that she was treated differently from other similarly situated students, or that this alleged differential treatment resulted from a gross abuse of power or fundamental procedural unfairness on the part of the MIAA. Thus, the plaintiff has failed to establish the existence of an equal protection violation. Finally, we conclude that the MIAA\u2019s rules do not amount to \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d that is actionable under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Facts and prior proceedings. </em>We recite the facts that the jury could reasonably have found from the evidence at trial, reserving certain details for later discussion in connection with the issues raised. At the end of her freshman year at the Austin Preparatory School (Austin) during the 1999-2000 academic year, the plaintiff (who had started school a year earlier than most of her peers) repeated the ninth grade at Andover High School (Andover).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The plaintiff has been a competitive swimmer since she was eight years old. During her freshman year at Austin, the plaintiff did not swim for the school\u2019s team, but was a member of a private swimming club. When the plaintiff transferred to Andover for her second freshman year in the fall of 2000, the plaintiff joined the school\u2019s varsity swim team. The plaintiff was one of the faster swimmers on that school\u2019s swim team, which is regarded as one of the most successful in Massachusetts. Indeed, the plaintiff was considered one of the fastest high school swimmers in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The plaintiff continued to compete with the Andover swim team during the fall athletic seasons<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of her sophomore and junior years. Shortly before the plaintiff\u2019s senior year, the MIAA,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an association that regulates competitive interschool athletic pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>grams as the authorized representative of its member school committees,* <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> deemed her ineligible to compete that year pursuant to its \u201cfifth year student rule.\u201d See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Andover Principal Peter Anderson, on behalf of the plaintiff,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> applied to the MIAA, requesting a waiver allowing her to compete during her senior year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The request was denied in May of 2003 by Assistant Director Brian Halloran, the MIAA\u2019s eligibility officer. Principal Anderson, again on behalf of the plaintiff, appealed this decision according to the MIAA\u2019s internal review process, taking the matter first to a three-member subcommittee of the MIAA\u2019s Eligibility Review Board (ERB). Following a hearing where the plaintiff was represented by Principal Anderson and gave testimony, the ERB unanimously upheld Halloran\u2019s initial decision. Principal Anderson next appealed to the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Council (MLAC), the final reviewing entity in the MIAA\u2019s waiver appeals process. The MIAC upheld the denial of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">On October 10, 2003, the plaintiff commenced this action in the Superior Court and filed a motion for a temporary restrain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ing order to allow her to compete during her senior year despite the MIAA\u2019s determination of ineligibility. Her complaint was in four counts. Count I sought relief in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from the adverse decision of the MIAA. In this count, the plaintiff asked the court to vacate the MIAA\u2019s denial of the waiver and to reinstate the plaintiff as a member of the Andover swim team. Counts II and III claimed that the MIAA had violated the plaintiff\u2019s civil rights<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and requested an award of compensatory and punitive damages in addition to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 &amp; 1988 (b) (2000); G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H &amp; 11I. Count IV sought declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231 A.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On October 23, 2003, a Superior Court judge granted a preliminary injunction,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the plaintiff competed for the Andover swim team for the remainder of the fall 2003 season.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Prior to trial, the plaintiff moved for partial judgment on the pleadings on count I (certiorari), and the MIAA filed a cross motion for summary judgment on all counts. The plaintiff responded to the MIAA\u2019s cross motion by filing her own cross motion for summary judgment on counts II through IV. The same Superior Court judge who issued the preliminary injunction granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial judgment on the pleadings on count I (certiorari) of her complaint, concluding that the MIAA\u2019s decision to deny the waiver was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The judge denied summary judgment for both parties on counts II through IV, thereby allowing the plaintiff\u2019s claims for Federal and State civil rights violations and for declaratory relief to proceed to trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The case was tried before a jury in the Superior Court. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, which was also the close of all the evidence, the MIAA moved for directed verdicts on all counts. The trial judge<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> granted the MIAA\u2019s motion with respect to all the plaintiff\u2019s claims except her \u00a7 1983 claim based on the alleged violation of due process. The judge reserved the question whether the plaintiff had a property interest in her participation in interscholastic athletics, and submitted the \u00a7 1983 claim to the jury. The jury were asked to decide (1) whether the MIAA had afforded the plaintiff due process; (2) if not, then what (if any) compensable harm the plaintiff had sustained; and (3) whether the MIAA\u2019s conduct, if unlawful, was sufficiently malicious and intentional to warrant an award of punitive damages. The jury returned a special verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, finding that the MIAA had failed to provide the plaintiff with due process and awarding the plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $10,000. The jury declined to award punitive damages. The MIAA then moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.), which the judge granted, ruling that the plaintiff had \u201cno constitutionally protected interest in the right to participate on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>swim team\u201d that would entitle her to pursue a due process claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court on her civil rights claims, and the MIAA cross-appealed from the entry of judgment on the pleadings on the certiorari count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. We transferred the case to this court on our own initiative. We conclude that there was no error in the allowance of either the directed verdicts or judgment n.o.v. in favor of the MIAA. We also conclude that the MIAA\u2019s cross appeal is not properly before us, and order it dismissed for reasons we shall discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We apply the same standard in reviewing a motion for a directed verdict that we apply to a motion for judgment n.o.v., both of which are at issue here. See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>400 Mass. 82, 100 (1987), quoting <em>D\u2019Annolfo </em>v. <em>Stoneham Hous. Auth., </em>375 Mass. 650, 657 (1978). In deciding whether either motion was properly allowed, \u201c[we] must determine, on viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, or if the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Farrakhan, </em>436 Mass. 94, 96 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">1. <em>The \u00a7 1983 claim. </em>The plaintiff claims that she is entitled to recover under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for damages resulting from the MIAA\u2019s infringement of her Federal civil rights. As the text of the statute<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> makes clear, \u201ctwo elements ... are necessary for recovery. First, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>has deprived [her] of a right secured by the \u2018Constitution and laws\u2019 of the United States .... Th[e] second element requires that the plaintiff show that the defendant acted \u2018under color of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adickes </em>v. <em>S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 150 (1970). Generally, \u201cconduct satisfying the state-action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] satisfies the statutory requirement of action under color of state law.\u201d <em>Lugar </em>v. <em>Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 935 n.18 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We have previously decided that the MIAA is a State actor. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>378 Mass. 342, 349 &amp; n.18 (1979) (\u201c[t]he parties agree, and we concur, that [the MIAA\u2019s rules] must be viewed as \u2018State action\u2019 for legal purposes\u201d). The only issue on appeal<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> regarding the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claims under \u00a7 1983 is whether the MIAA has deprived her of any \u201crights, privileges, or immunities secured by [Federal law].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The plaintiff argues that she has been deprived of two Federal constitutional rights and that either deprivation is sufficient to support a \u00a7 1983 action. First, the plaintiff argues that she has a property interest in her participation in interscholastic athletics that arises either under State law or under the rules governing interscholastic athletics promulgated by the MIAA, and that the MIAA has deprived her of this interest without due process<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in violation of her rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Alternatively, the plaintiff contends that the MIAA treated her differently from other students <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>who participate in both interscholastic swimming and in private swimming clubs by denying her one year of eligibility, and that this differential treatment violated her rights as a \u201cclass of one\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We discuss each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">a. <em>Property interest under the due process clause. </em>To prevail on her due process claim, the plaintiff must show that she has been deprived of a \u201cproperty\u201d interest within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Property interests \u201care not created by the [Federal] Constitution,\u201d but \u201care created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source, such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The plaintiff argues that she has a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement,\u201d see <em>id., </em>to her participation in interscholastic athletics under State law, as an implied \u201coutgrowth\u201d of her recognized right to an education, which includes physical education.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Worcester, </em>421 Mass. 117, 128-129 (1995) (recognizing existence of right to public education under Massachusetts Constitution). See also <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 573-574 (1975) (State law right to public education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>is property interest protected by due process clause). In the alternative, the plaintiff claims that, having participated for three years on the Andover swim team, she has a property interest created by the MIAA\u2019s eligibility rules because her receipt of a long-standing benefit (i.e., eligibility) supports a reasonable expectation that the benefit will continue. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Assessors of Granby, </em>387 Mass. 117, 120 (1982). See also <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972) (property interest found \u201cif there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support [the person\u2019s] claim of entitlement to the benefit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held that, where the right to a public education exists under State law, a student has a property interest that prevents a school from \u201ctotally] excluding] [the student] from the educational process\u201d without due process of law. See <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 576. Because all children in the Commonwealth have a constitutional right to a public education, see <em>McDuffy </em>v. <em>Secretary of Executive Office of Educ., </em>415 Mass. 545, 621 (1993), it is clear under <em>Goss </em>that no State actor could deny the plaintiff a public education without complying with the requirements of the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">However, the right to a public education, even one with a mandatory physical education component, is not synonymous with the right to participate in extracurricular activities, such as interscholastic athletics. Although such activities may serve as a beneficial supplement to required physical education, they are by their nature separate from that curriculum. Practices and competitions for interscholastic athletic teams generally take place outside of regular school hours and, as is true for Andover\u2019s swim team, may take place in nonschool facilities. The provisions of G. L. c. 71 do not confer an individual right to participate in interscholastic athletics, even as an \u201coutgrowth\u201d of the right to a public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Like many other courts that have considered this question, we do not expand the contours of a student\u2019s property interest in public education to include within it every extracurricular activity that might enrich the educational experience, however meaningful those activities might be to individual students. See, e.g., <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>California Interscholastic Fed\u2019n-San Diego Section, </em>94 Cal. App. 4th 1048, 1063 (2001); <em>Proulx </em>v. <em>Illinois High Sch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, </em>125 Ill. App. 3d 781, 786-787 (1984); <em>Adamek </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>57 Pa. Commw. 261, 263-265 (1981) (collecting cases). \u201cThe myriad activities which combine to form that educational process cannot be dissected to create hundreds of separate property rights, each cognizable under the Constitution. Otherwise, removal from a particular class, dismissal from an athletic team, a club or any extracurricular activity, would each require ultimate satisfaction of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Dallam </em>v. <em>Cumberland Valley Sch. Dist., </em>391 F. Supp. 358, 361 (M.D. Pa. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The plaintiff directs our attention to a number of cases which she claims support the existence of such a right. Only one of these cases explicitly does so, and that case contains no discussion of the reasons for its conclusion. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Kansas State High Sch. Activities Ass\u2019n, </em>13 Kan. App. 2d 71, 76 (1988). We decline to follow it. The other cases cited by the plaintiff either fail to provide clear support for the claimed proposition,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or are readily distinguishable because of significant differences from Massachusetts law. See <em>Duffley </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>122 N.H. 484, 492 (1982) (agency regulations explicitly deemed student activities, including athletics, part of curriculum). Accordingly, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s contention that her property interest in her right to public education implies that she also has a property interest in her participation in extracurricular activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The plaintiff does no better by construing the source of her property interest to be the MIAA\u2019s eligibility rules. To the extent the MIAA\u2019s eligibility rules create any property interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility, that interest is \u201cdefined by the terms of [those rules].\u201d <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, supra </em>at 578. The text of rule 59.1 of the MIAA Rules and Regulations Governing Athletics (as in effect July 1, 2001, through June 20, 2003) (MIAA rules) makes clear that one is entitled to participate only for \u201c12 consecutive athletic seasons (i.e. four consecutive years) beyond the first completion of grade 8.\u201d Under this rule, the plaintiff\u2019s period of eligibility began to run once she entered her freshman year at Austin. She was allowed to participate that year, though she chose not to, and was likewise eligible for the following three years, comprising her freshman, sophomore and junior years at Andover. The plaintiff received the full benefit that rule 59.1 conferred. She had no \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to further participation under the MIAA rules.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, supra </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Without a property interest in her participation in extracurricular, interscholastic athletics, the plaintiff has no right to the protection of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, supra </em>at 569. Because we conclude that the plaintiff has no such interest, either as part of her recognized right to public education or under the MIAA\u2019s eligibility rules, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s decision<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>allow judgment n.o.v. in favor of the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s due process claim.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">b. <em>Equal protection \u201cclass of one. \u201d </em>The plaintiff argues that she is entitled to recover under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because the MIAA violated her Federal equal protection rights as a \u201cclass of one\u201d by arbitrarily singling her out for worse treatment than other similarly situated persons. See note 19, <em>supra. </em>In essence, the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the MIAA treated her differently from other swimmers by taking into account her participation in a private swimming club during her first year of eligibility (i.e., her first ninth grade year at Austin). See <em>Willowbrook </em>v. <em>Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000). The plaintiff maintains that this reason for not granting a waiver penalized her for swimming with a private team, while others who also swam with private teams were not penalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment mandates that \u201call persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\u201d <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). However, \u201c[wjhere applicable state law vests the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>decisionmaker with discretionary authority to award or withhold a state benefit, a plaintiff who grounds an equal protection claim on the denial of that benefit faces a steep uphill climb.\u201d <em>Pagan </em>v. Calderon, 448 F.3d 16, 34 (1st Cir. 2006). In such cases, the plaintiff must show that \u201c(i) he was treated differently than other similarly situated supplicants and (ii) the differential treatment resulted from a gross abuse of power, invidious discrimination, or some other fundamental procedural unfairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[E]yen an arbitrary denial of a [discretionary benefit] in violation of state law \u2014 even in bad faith \u2014 does not rise above the constitutional threshold for equal protection . . . claims.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Coxe, </em>230 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 2000), cert, denied, 532 U.S. 995 (2001). There must be at least an \u201cegregious abuse of power.\u201d See <em>Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Custodio, </em>964 F.2d 32, 44 &amp; n.5 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The plaintiff failed to meet her burden. First, the evidence presented was insufficient to show that the MIAA granted waivers with respect to other swimmers who were similarly situated to the plaintiff. It is true that the evidence at trial demonstrated that nearly half of all high school swimmers participate in both interscholastic swimming and in private swimming clubs (presumably with no adverse consequence to their eligibility under the MIAA rules). There was no evidence, however, whether any of these other swimmers had attended high school for five years, thus also running afoul of the MIAA\u2019s \u201cfifth year student rule.\u201d The plaintiff also introduced evidence that at the time Principal Anderson sought a waiver to set aside the application of the \u201cfifth year student rule\u201d on behalf of the plaintiff, the MIAA granted waivers to set aside that same rule in fifty-two out of the sixty-five cases under its consideration. However, the plaintiff failed to present any evidence of the particular circumstances of these other cases. Without more information, it is impossible to determine whether the students in these other cases were similarly situated to the plaintiff. Thus, the plaintiff failed to prove the first element of her \u201cclass of one\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Second, even if the plaintiff had presented evidence sufficient to prove that other similarly situated persons were granted a waiver, the plaintiff introduced no evidence tending to show that this alleged differential treatment resulted from \u201cinvidious dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>crimination,\u201d \u201cfundamental procedural unfairness,\u201d or a \u201cgross abuse\u201d of the MIAA\u2019s power. <em>Pagan </em>v. <em>Calderon, supra. </em>The plaintiff has not alleged that she was subjected to invidious discrimination, i.e., that the MIAA denied the waiver on the basis of some suspect or quasi-suspect classification. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36. Furthermore, with regard to the procedures employed, there was no evidence at trial that the MIAA failed to provide the plaintiff with the same opportunity to be heard that it provided to every other athlete for whom a waiver was sought. This procedure allowed the plaintiff to present evidence on her behalf, and the plaintiff conceded at trial that the MIAA did not \u201ccurtail [her] presentation in any way.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s complaints about the procedures employed by the MIAA, see note 18, <em>supra, </em>are not indicative of the kind of \u201cegregious procedural irregularities or abuse of power . . . conceivably rising to the level of a federal equal protection violation.\u201d <em>PFZ Props., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>928 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The burden was on the plaintiff to introduce evidence sufficient for the jury to find that she had been treated differently from other similarly situated persons, and that this treatment resulted from truly egregious procedural unfairness or an abuse of the MIAA\u2019s power. Because the plaintiff failed to meet her burden on the essential elements of her equal protection claim, the trial judge\u2019s decision to direct a verdict on that theory for the MIAA was proper. Cf. <em>Blais-Porter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Simboli, </em>402 Mass. 269, 274 (1988).

To prevail, \u201cthe plaintiff must prove that the defendant[] used \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion\u2019 to interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 707-708 (1999). \u201cA \u2018threat\u2019 is \u2018the intentional exertion of pressure to make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm.\u2019 <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 474, cert, denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994) .... \u2018Intimidation\u2019 involves putting one \u2018in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>\u2018Coercion\u2019 is the application to another of force \u2018to constrain him to do against his will something he would not otherwise have done.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Deas </em>v. <em>Dempsey, </em>403 Mass. 468, 471 (1988).\u201d <em>Kennie </em>v. <em>Natural Resource Dep\u2019t of Dennis, </em>451 Mass. 754, 763 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The plaintiff argues that the MIAA\u2019s rules constitute an attempt to dissuade her from exercising her right of access to the courts, and more specifically her right to seek judicial review of the MIAA\u2019s decision refusing to grant her a waiver. The MIAA has promulgated several rules that it concedes are intended to discourage its member schools and student athletes from litigating eligibility disputes outside the MIAA\u2019s internal hearing process. Rule 29.2 of the MIAA rules, provides that \u201cany contest in which an ineligible student or coach participates under court order will be forfeited if the order is dissolved or the plaintiff ultimately fails to prevail.\u201d Another rule provides that students or teams participating in any contest under court order will be seeded last, imposing a competitive disadvantage on that team. See rule 29.3 of the MIAA rules. The plaintiff contends that these rules constitute an attempted interference with the enjoyment of her right to seek judicial review by \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion,\u201d for which she has a remedy under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H &amp; 11I. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Although \u201centitled to liberal construction of its terms,\u201d <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 822 (1985), the act \u201cwas not intended to create, nor may it be construed to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>lish, a \u2018vast constitutional tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 635, 645 (2003), quoting <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em>394 Mass. 176, 182 (1985). It is for this reason that \u201c[t]he Legislature \u2018explicitly limited the [act\u2019s] remedy to situations where the derogation of secured rights occurs by threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., supra </em>at 646, quoting <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>403 Mass. 713, 718 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Although the MIAA has admitted that the rules are, at least in part, designed to discourage the litigation of eligibility disputes in the courts, we conclude that these rules do not constitute the kind of actionable \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d contemplated by the act. \u201cGenerally, by itself, a threat to use lawful means to reach an intended result is not actionable under \u00a7 11I.\u201d <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., supra </em>at 648, quoting <em>Sena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 250, 263 (1994). The MIAA rules merely inform athletes seeking to challenge adverse eligibility determinations that, if they force their way into competition, but are later determined to have been ineligible, the MIAA will apply its traditional rules and practices regarding ineligible athletes, i.e., that a winning team which includes an ineligible athlete must forfeit its win.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Similarly, the MIAA rule that students and teams competing under court order will be seeded last may be justified as a means of ensuring that the participation of athletes whose eligibility is still unclear will not unduly prejudice the rights of the other teams whose eligibility is not in doubt. The MIAA likely anticipates that it will prevail on judicial review of its eligibility determinations, and thus it presumably seeks to seed potentially ineligible athletes and teams in the manner least likely to affect the outcome of the competition. There is nothing unlawful or unfair about either of these practices, and we do not think the Legislature intended to include them within the ambit of \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d prohibited by the act. We therefore conclude that the trial judge properly allowed the MIAA\u2019s mo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>tian for a directed verdict on the plaintiff\u2019s claim under the act.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">3. <em>MIAA\u2019s cross appeal from the grant of certiorari. </em>As mentioned, the MIAA seeks to cross-appeal from the entry of judgment on the pleadings for the plaintiff on the certiorari count of her complaint. However, our review of the docket reveals that the MIAA has never paid a docket fee in regard to its purported cross appeal, either in this court or, prior to our transfer sua sponte, in the Appeals Court. The MIAA\u2019s attorney also conceded at oral argument that the fee has never been paid. Earlier procedural maneuvering by both parties, which we need not detail, should have alerted the MIAA to the need to perfect its appeal by paying the fee.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The MIAA has provided no explanation for its failure to pay the fee, nor has it sought permission from this court to pay late, even though it sought permission from the Appeals Court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The rules of appellate procedure impose a clear duty upon \u201ceach appellant, including each cross-appellant,\u201d to \u201cpay to the clerk of the appellate court the docket fee fixed by law\u201d within the applicable ten-day period. See Mass. R. A. P. 10 (a) (1), as amended, 435 Mass. 1601 (2001). \u201c[W]hen faced with such a clear violation of the rules,\u201d we have the \u201cauthority to apply sanctions, including that of refusing to consider the appeal.\u201d <em>Larabee </em>v. <em>Potvin Lumber Co., </em>390 Mass. 636, 639 (1983). Although we have discretion to consider the MIAA\u2019s cross appeal notwithstanding its failure to comply with the rules of appellate procedure, \u201cthere is a strong sense that rules of procedure ought to be followed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We therefore decline to consider the cross appeal because it is not properly before us.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> See <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Stratus Pharms., Inc., </em>51 Mass.

L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, the plaintiff has no right to review of an arbitrary action by the MIAA. As a State actor, the MIAA is not empowered to deal with individuals arbitrarily. In the absence of a specific statutory remedy, the plaintiff was entitled to proceed under the certiorari statute for review of the MIAA\u2019s action. However, for the reason stated, we do not address the merits of the decision of the motion judge on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that the plaintiff has no property interest in her participation in interscholastic athletics, and therefore, she has suffered no due process violation actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In addition, the plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence that, if believed, would have allowed the jury to find an equal protection violation. She has also failed to establish that the MIAA interfered with or attempted to interfere with her enjoyment of her civil rights by \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion,\u201d as required in order to prevail under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. We therefore affirm the trial judge\u2019s allowance of the MIAA\u2019s motions for directed verdicts and for judgment n.o.v.

The plaintiff also faults Halloran for speaking to outside sources to determine the policy of the Andover girls\u2019 swimming coach with respect to the selection of team members. Finally, she claims the hearing process was unfair because the MIAA investigated and sanctioned Andover in a different matter concerning the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility during the fall 2001 season, which was brought to the attention of those responsible for reviewing Halloran\u2019s decision to deny the waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The alleged \u201cclass of one\u201d here consists of the plaintiff herself, insofar as she claims \u201cthat she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\u201d <em>Willowbrook </em>v. <em>Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000).

Although the MIAA\u2019s rule 84.2, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>provides four factors to guide its discretion, this discretion is not \u201cmeaningfully channelled],\u201d because the rule \u201cdoes not require a certain outcome, but merely authorizes particular actions and remedies.\u201d See <em>Sealed </em>v. <em>Sealed, supra. </em>Thus, the plaintiff has no property interest in the waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">We therefore do not decide whether the alleged defects in the MIAA\u2019s hearing process, see note 18, <em>supra, </em>denied the plaintiff \u201cthe opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,\u2019 \u201d as due process requires. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976), quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The plaintiff argues, in a footnote to her brief, that the trial judge erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>refusing to adopt the conclusions of the judge who granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial judgment on the pleadings regarding her claim for relief in the nature of certiorari. The motion judge\u2019s decision might, in other circumstances, have collateral effect on a subsequent trial to the extent that the judge\u2019s findings are relevant to the remaining counts. Generally, the doctrine of issue preclusion or collateral estoppel will apply only where (1) there has been a final judgment on the merits; (2) the party against whom preclusion is asserted was a party (or in privity with a party) to the prior adjudication; and (3) the issue in the prior adjudication was identical to the issue in the current adjudication, and essential to the earlier judgment. See <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>444 Mass. 837, 843-844 (2005). There is no preclusion in this case. First, the motion judge made no findings of fact that were binding on the trial judge. (Because the motion judge conducted what was essentially a judicial review, he did not make findings of fact, and was not required to do so. He ruled only as a matter of law that the agency\u2019s decision was in error.) Second, there was no final judgment entered on the certiorari count until after trial. Cf. <em>Herbert A.

P. 16, as amended, 428 Mass. 1603 (1999), and for \u201cmisrepresenting] the date of service.\u201d The MIAA did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>participate at oral argument, and that aspect of the plaintiffs motion is moot. We decline to strike the MIAA\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">While we note that the MIAA\u2019s brief fails fully to conform to the requirements of rule 16, we conclude that the MIAA\u2019s violations of the rule are not so egregious as to warrant the extraordinary sanction of striking the brief. Furthermore, the only evidence the plaintiff has presented of the MIAA\u2019s alleged misrepresentation of the date of service is that the brief was postmarked two days after the date on which the certificate was signed. There is no evidence, however, that the discrepancy was the result of intentional misrepresentation, rather than mere inadvertence, or that, at the time the MI-AA\u2019s attorney signed the certificate, he knew that the brief would not be mailed on the date specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\">In its brief, the MIAA requested an award of costs under Mass. R. A. P. 26 (a), 378 Mass. 925 (1979), as well as damages under Mass. R. A. P. 25, as appearing in 376 Mass. 949 (1979), on the ground that the plaintiffs appeal is \u201cfrivolous.\u201d \u201cWhile we consider the [plaintiffs] arguments to be unpersuasive, we do not consider them frivolous.\u201d <em>Shahzade </em>v. <em>C.J. Mabardy, Inc., </em>411 Mass. 788, 797 n.8 (1992). Therefore, we deny the MIAA the relief it requests under rule 25. Pursuant to rule 26(a), we further direct that each side shall bear its own costs of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
