R. Crim. P. 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a judge in the District Court reported to the Appeals Court this case and in particular several questions concerning the constitutionality of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, a statute that requires a person who is \u201cplaced on probation\u201d for certain sex offenses to wear a global positioning system device as \u201ca requirement of any term of probation.\u201d We transferred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>case on our own motion. We conclude that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, does not apply to persons placed on probation prior to trial and prior to conviction or entry of a plea of guilty or admission to facts sufficient for a finding of guilt (admission to sufficient facts).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the defendant, with his consent, has been placed on pretrial probation under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, without a guilty plea or admission to sufficient facts, it follows that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, has no application to him. Accordingly, we decline to answer the constitutional questions reported.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><em>Background. A </em>global positioning system (GPS) device is an electronic monitor designed to report continuously the probationer\u2019s current location. General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 47 (\u00a7 47), requires \u201c[a]ny person who is placed on probation\u201d for certain sex offenses to \u201cwear a [GPS] device, or any comparable device, administered by the commissioner of probation, at all times for the length of his probation.\u201d A GPS device, as implemented by the Commissioner of Probation (commissioner), consists of two pieces of electronic equipment: an ankle bracelet, which is permanently attached to the probationer, and a GPS-enabled cellular telephone, which communicates with the ankle bracelet and transmits the probationer\u2019s current location to the probation department. Under \u00a7 47, the commissioner is directed to \u201cestablish defined geographic exclusion zones,\u201d or areas whose entry will be reported by the GPS device, leading to various sanctions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">On November 1, 2005, the defendant was charged by complaint in the District Court with one count of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, in violation of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>c. 265, \u00a7 13B, and one count of disseminating obscene matter to a minor, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28. Both offenses are among the sex offenses to which \u00a7 47 applies. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. On December 28, 2006, the defendant and the Commonwealth, through counsel, jointly recommended to a District Court judge that the defendant be placed on pretrial probation under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, for a period of two years, subject to certain conditions. The judge accepted the recommendation and imposed pretrial probation terms that included the following: the defendant would have no contact with children under sixteen, or with the victim in the case or her mother; would live with his grandmother and be subject to a 9 p.m. curfew; would remain employed; would submit to a mental health evaluation and counselling, if ordered; and would remain drug- and alcohol-free and submit to random testing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant signed a copy of the probation order of conditions on December 28, 2006.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Section 47 went into effect on December 20, 2006, one week before the defendant signed the order of probation. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, inserted by St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7 8. In its original form, the defendant\u2019s December 28, 2006, probation order of conditions did not contain any reference to \u00a7 47 or to any requirement that the defendant wear a GPS device or be subject to GPS monitoring (GPS requirement). In a December 20, 2006, memorandum to the chief probation officers of all court departments, the commissioner took the position that \u00a7 47 applied to all persons placed on probation, whether found guilty, given a continuance without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>a finding after admitting to sufficient facts, or prior to trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On learning of the new policy, the defendant\u2019s probation officer made an ex parte request to the judge that the GPS requirement be added to the defendant\u2019s terms of pretrial probation. On January 3, 2007, the judge signed a new probation order that included the GPS requirement, which was then presented to and signed by the defendant without hearing or advance notice. Defense counsel, apparently learning of the new condition after the order had been signed, requested a stay of execution and moved to vacate the GPS requirement. Another District Court judge granted the stay and reported five questions of law to the Appeals Court pursuant to rule 34. The questions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201c[1] Whether the language of G. L. c. 265, [\u00a7] 47, requiring \u2018all persons on probation\u2019 for certain sex offenses to wear a [GPS] device at their own expense, regardless of whether they have been convicted of any sex offense, made admissions to sufficient facts, or [have been] placed on pre-trial probation without any admission, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and/or [arts.] 1, 10 or 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">\u201c[2] Whether G. L. c. 265, [\u00a7] 47, both as written and as particularly applied to this defendant and others similarly situated, is punitive rather than remedial, and thus violates the Due Process Clause . . . and [arts.] 1, 10, 12 and 24 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, because it allows for punishment of an individual who has not been convicted of a crime and intrudes upon the defendant\u2019s liberty and privacy interests without the right to a hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">\u201c[3] Do the provisions of G. L. c. 265, [\u00a7] 47, requiring all persons on probation for certain sex offenses to wear a [GPS] device, regardless of whether they were convicted of the sex offense or made admissions to the offense for which they are on probation, violate the Fifth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and [arts.] 1, 10, and 12 . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\u201c[4] Does the application of G. L. c. 265, [\u00a7] 47, constitute cruel and unusual punishment to a person such as this defendant who has neither been convicted of any enumerated sex offense [n]or admitted to such an offense, thus violating the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and [art.] 26 ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">\u201c[5] Whether the application of G. L. c. 265, [\u00a7] 47, to this defendant and others similarly placed on pretrial probation without an admission to a sex offense which was allegedly committed prior to the enactment of the statute, constitutes an ex post facto law in violation of [art.] 1, [\u00a7] 10 of the United States Constitution, and [art.] 12 . . . ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cIn answering questions reported under Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, we first address any potentially dispositive preliminary questions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>447 Mass. 577, 584 n.10 (2006). \u201cWe do not decide constitutional questions unless they must necessarily be reached.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paasche, </em>391 Mass. 18, 21 (1984). See <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>448 Mass. 441, 451 n.9 (2007), quoting <em>1010 Memorial Drive Tenants Corp. </em>v. <em>Fire Chief of Cambridge, </em>424 Mass. 661, 663 (1997) (\u201cissues of statutory interpretation should be resolved prior to reaching any constitutional issue\u201d). Because we conclude that \u00a7 47 does not apply to a person, such as the defendant in this case, who is placed on probation before trial or entry of a guilty plea or admission to sufficient facts, and not as part of a sentence or disposition following conviction, we need not reach the reported constitutional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\u201cWe interpret a statute \u2018according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language ... to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Nantucket County, </em>437 Mass. 430, 435 (2002), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). We begin with the language of the statute. <em>Rowley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>438 Mass. 798, 802 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Chapter 265, \u00a7 47, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">\u201cAny person who is <em>placed on probation for any offense </em>listed within the definition of \u2018sex offense,\u2019 a \u2018sex offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>involving a child\u2019 or a \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019, as defined in [\u00a7] 178C of chapter 6, shall, as a requirement of <em>any term of </em>probation, wear a global positioning system device, or any comparable device, administered by the commissioner of probation, at all times for the <em>length of his probation for any such </em>offense\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The defendant argues that the phrase \u201cplaced on probation for any offense\u201d renders the GPS statute unconstitutionally vague, because persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess whether the law refers to probation for a <em>charged </em>offense, or only for a <em>convicted </em>offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jaffe, 398 Mass. 50, 54 (1986), quoting <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 873 (1983) (\u201cA law is void for vagueness if persons \u2018of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application\u2019 \u201d). The Commonwealth, ignoring the phrase \u201cfor any offense,\u201d responds that the statute is unambiguous, and the plain meaning of \u201cany person placed on probation\u201d and \u201cany term of probation\u201d includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>probation of any kind \u2014 a temporary placement pending trial, a pretrial disposition of the case, or probation ordered by a judge as part of the disposition of a case after conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ R., </em>433 Mass. 515, 520 (2001) (\u201cWhen a statute is plain and unambiguous, we interpret it according to its ordinary meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We do not agree with either analysis. Section 47 is not without ambiguity, but established rules of statutory construction point to a reasonable, and comprehensible, interpretation of the section. A statute\u2019s terms must be read harmoniously to effectuate the intent of the Legislature, see <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>441 Mass. 846, 853 (2004), and in seeking to do so, \u201cwe look first and foremost to the language of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>447 Mass. 88, 90 (2006). The first sentence of \u00a7 47 speaks twice of being placed on \u201cprobation for any offense.\u201d The phrase \u201cfor any offense\u201d by its terms suggests that the offense has been proved to have occurred, rather than just charged or alleged. The final two sentences of \u00a7 47, set out in the section\u2019s second paragraph (see note 7, <em>supra), </em>support this conclusion, and offer guidance for the interpretation of the section as a whole, when they refer interchangeably to a \u201cprobationer\u201d and an \u201coffender\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201cThe fees incurred by installing, maintaining and operating the [GPS] device, or comparable device, <em>shall be paid by the probationer. If an offender </em>establishes his inability to pay such fees, the court may waive them\u201d (emphases added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\u201cIf a sensible construction is available, we shall not construe a statute ... to produce absurd results.\u201d <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000). Section 47 does not define \u201coffender,\u201d but the ordinary and accepted meaning of the word \u201coffender\u201d is \u201c[a] person who has committed a crime.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed. 2004). See <em>Boylston </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>434 Mass. 398, 405 (2001) (\u201cWe usually determine the \u2018plain and ordinary meaning\u2019 of a term by its dictionary definition\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If one accepts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>this definition of offender, then adopting the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed interpretation of the word \u201cprobationer,\u201d to mean not only convicted defendants who have been placed on probation as part of a sentence but all defendants on probation, whether before trial or after conviction, leads to the following result: the section would require fees from all \u201cprobationer[s],\u201d but allow fee waivers only for probationers who were also \u201coffenders].\u201d This is an absurd, and untenable, result. Clearly, it is more reasonable to infer that the Legislature was using the terms \u201cprobationer\u201d and \u201coffender\u201d interchangeably in the second paragraph of \u00a7 47, and therefore intended the term \u201cprobationer\u201d to cover only those defendants who had been convicted and sentenced to a term of probation. And because we assume that the Legislature intended consistency between the first and second paragraphs of \u00a7 47, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, </em>437 Mass. 809, 816 (2002), we interpret the phrase \u201c[a]ny person . . . placed on probation for [a sex] offense\u201d in the first paragraph as referring to a person who is placed on probation as part of a sentence after conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 47 supports our reading. See <em>Matter of the Liquidation of Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 796, 801-802 (2004), quoting <em>Boylston </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>434 Mass, at 401 (\u201cBecause the statutory language \u2018does not provide a definite answer to the question, it is appropriate to consult other sources to obtain a resolution,\u2019 . . . including the relevant legislative history, insofar as it sheds light on the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the section\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millican, </em>449 Mass. 298, 305 (2007), quoting <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986) (\u201cAlthough we have concluded that the words of the statute are not ambiguous, \u2018we should not accept the literal meaning of the words of a statute without regard for that statute\u2019s purpose and history\u2019 \u201d). Section 47 originated in the House of Representatives. The original bill had no provisions relating to GPS; it provided only for the extension of the statute of limitations for certain sex offenses. 2006 House Doc. No. 5131. See 2005 House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Doc. No. 836. On July 26, 2006, the House of Representatives adopted a substitute bill, adding a section to require that \u201c[a]ny individual convicted of\u201d certain sex offenses be monitored by GPS.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 2006 House Doc. No. 5234, \u00a7 7. Convicted individuals were required to wear the GPS devices as a \u201ccondition[] of <em>post-release </em>supervision\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 a phrase that clearly suggests parole \u2014 but the commissioner was designated in the bill to administer the devices. It was not entirely clear whether the Commissioner of Probation or the Commissioner of Correction would establish geographic exclusion zones. Violations would be adjudicated by the parole board, and the new language would be added to G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133, relating to parole. The bill thus suffered from several internal contradictions: it placed convicted individuals under the dual authority of both the Commissioner of Probation and the parole board; and while it purported to cover all convicted individuals, it referred to conditions of postrelease supervision, which would only apply to those sentenced to a term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">On July 27, 2006, the Senate amended the bill to resolve these contradictions, by splitting the GPS section into two: one referring to parolees, to be administered and adjudicated by the parole board; and the other referring to probationers, to be administered and adjudicated by the commissioner. See 2006 Senate J. 2678. These two proposed sections replaced the term \u201cconvicted individual\u201d in the House bill with \u201cparolee\u201d or \u201cprobationer,\u201d as appropriate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Senate version of the GPS monitoring requirement was enacted with no further substantive changes. See St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8. There is no evidence in the legislative history to indicate or suggest that the Senate intended by its amendments to expand the scope of the legislation beyond convicted individuals; the more reasonable conclusion to draw is the one implicit in the structure and language of the amendments themselves, namely, that the Senate was attempting to resolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>obvious jurisdictional confusion in the House version by clarifying that convicted sex offenders on probation would have their GPS devices monitored by the commissioner, and those on parole would have theirs monitored by the parole board.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In sum, we conclude from the language and history of \u00a7 47 that the Legislature intended the GPS requirement to apply only to convicted individuals.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commonwealth argues, however, that \u00a7 47 must be interpreted harmoniously with G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, the statutory authority on which the defendant\u2019s probation was set, which uses the blanket term \u201cprobation\u201d to refer to both pretrial and postconviction probation. The argument is not persuasive. While G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, does use the word \u201cprobation\u201d as the Commonwealth states, the section also contains specific language to indicate when it is referring to pretrial probation (a court \u201cmay place on probation . . . any person before it charged with an offense or a crime . . . with the defendant\u2019s consent, before trial and before a plea of guilty\u201d), and when it is referring to postconviction probation (\u201cor in any case after a finding or verdict of guilty\u201d). The section thus may suggest that when the Legislature intends the term \u201cprobation\u201d to apply to both types of probation, it demonstrates that intent with explicit, descriptive language. Moreover, the Legislature has also used the term \u201cprobation\u201d in statutes other than \u00a7 47 to refer solely to postconviction probation. See, e.g., G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58 (factors in setting bail include \u201cwhether [the person] is on probation, parole, or other release pending completion of sentence for any conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We hold that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, does not apply to persons, such as the defendant in this case, who are placed on pretrial probation. We therefore do not reach the reported questions. The report is discharged and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-14\">Rule 34 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-15\">\u201cIf, prior to trial, or, with the consent of the defendant, after conviction of the defendant, a question of law arises which the trial judge determines is so important or doubtful as to require the decision of the Appeals Court, the judge may report the case so far as necessary to present the question of law arising therein. If the case is reported prior to trial, the case shall be continued for trial to await the decision of the Appeals Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The remainder of this opinion contrasts pretrial probation with probation after a finding of guilt (postconviction probation). We leave for a more appropriate case, and one in which the issue is briefed by the parties, whether G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, applies to defendants whose cases are continued without a finding after a guilty plea or an admission to sufficient facts. Such a disposition has elements in common with, but is distinct from, both pretrial and postconviction probation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millican, </em>449 Mass. 298, 304-305 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sebastian S., </em>444 Mass. 306, 314 n.12 (2005) (\u201cprobation imposed after a guilty plea or an admission is not \u2018pretrial\u2019 probation\u201d). See also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registiy Bd., </em>452 Mass. 764, <em>777 </em>(2008) (continuance without finding not \u201cprior offense\u201d for sex offender classification).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Because we do not answer the reported questions, the report will be discharged. However, the case raises an important issue of statutory construction that deserves consideration, and we address that issue in this opinion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cargill, 445 Mass. 329, 329-330 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The judge noted, in accepting the recommendation, that the defendant (age twenty-one) was \u201cintellectually challenged,\u201d the victim\u2019s mother was reluctant to have the victim (age eight) testify, and the victim had not responded to two summonses to court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\">As indicated in the reported questions, when the judge accepted the joint recommendation for pretrial probation under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, the defendant had not been convicted, entered a guilty plea, or admitted to facts sufficient for a finding of guilt (admission to sufficient facts). While the parties do not discuss the point, during the hearing on December 28, 2006, the judge stated to the defendant that if he complied with all the terms of the pretrial probation for the prescribed two years, the case would be dismissed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tim T., </em>437 Mass. 592, 597 (2002). For a discussion of the disposition of dismissal by agreement after satisfactory completion of the terms of pretrial probation, as opposed to the disposition of continuance without a finding and dismissal after an admission to sufficient facts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millican, </em>449 Mass. 298, 304-305 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">In the same memorandum, the probation department \u201crecognize[d] that courts may view this interpretation differently.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 47, provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">\u201cAny person who is placed on probation for any offense listed within the definition of \u2018sex offense\u2019, a \u2018sex offense involving a child\u2019 or a \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019, as defined in [G.

L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C (to which \u00a7 47 refers for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>other definitions), defining \u201c[s]ex offender\u201d as a person \u201cwho has been <em>convicted </em>of a sex offense\u201d (emphasis added). See also G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 52 (\u201c[y]outhful offender\u201d); G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1 (c) (\u201ccommitted offender\u201d).
