L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32. He filed a motion to suppress all evidence found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>on his person by Boston Housing Authority police officers, as well as any statements he may have made to them, on the ground that he was unlawfully seized without a warrant in violation of his State and Federal constitutional rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing, a judge in the Boston Municipal Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth to pursue an interlocutory appeal to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). In an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed the suppression order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyles, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 1127 (2008). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. For the reasons that follow, we now affirm the order of the Boston Municipal Court judge allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">We summarize the facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented by uncontested testimony from the suppression hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 368 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">At approximately 1:30 p.m. on April 15, 2005, Boston Housing Authority police Officers O\u2019Connor and Saunders, who were on patrol and wearing plain clothes, observed the defendant in the area around a community housing development, with respect to which the police had received complaints about drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant was alone, and he was not known to either officer. Based only on their observation of the defendant as he walked along a public sidewalk, the officers, who were armed, got out of their unmarked vehicle, approached the defendant, displayed their badges, identified themselves, inquired as to the defendant\u2019s name, and asked him for identification. The defendant provided some form of identification to the officers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While they were still standing on the sidewalk, Officer O\u2019Connor proceeded to radio for a check of outstanding warrants, and when he discovered that there was one, he placed the defendant under arrest. During the subsequent booking procedure, the officers found nineteen plastic bags of heroin and $263 in cash on the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge stated that the encounter between the officers and the defendant went beyond a permissible field interrogation observation (FIO).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the judge\u2019s view, the encounter was a stop pursuant to <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968). The judge further stated that the defendant did not voluntarily provide his identification to the officers, but did so only after the officers confronted him on the street and asked him for it. The judge concluded that the officers restrained the defendant such that he was not free to leave, and that the seizure of the defendant was not based on specific and articulable facts that would give rise to reasonable suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>of a crime. Rather, the judge continued, the officers acted on a hunch, which did not meet the standard for reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">When reviewing the disposition of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sauna, 424 Mass. 92, 97 (1997). We make an independent determination whether the judge correctly applied constitutional principles to the facts as found. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Robbins, 407 Mass. 147, 151 (1990). The motion judge\u2019s determinations regarding the weight and credibility of the testimony presented at the suppression hearing are entitled to deference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990), and cases cited. The Commonwealth bears the burden of demonstrating that the actions of law enforcement officials were within constitutional limits. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, supra </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The Commonwealth contends that the judge erred in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the encounter between the officers and the defendant, on a public sidewalk, was a permissible HO during which the defendant voluntarily responded to the officers\u2019 inquiry as to his name. The Commonwealth argues that because there was no evidence that the officers issued any orders to the defendant, or physically prevented him from leaving the scene, there was no seizure. The circumstances of the encounter, the Commonwealth continues, were not sufficiently intimidating that a reasonable person would have concluded that he was not free to leave. Accordingly, the Commonwealth asserts that the evidence found on the defendant\u2019s person at the police station following his arrest on an outstanding warrant should not be suppressed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We begin our analysis with a pertinent observation made by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 13: \u201cStreet encounters between citizens and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity. They range from wholly friendly exchanges of pleasantries or mutually useful information to hostile confrontations of armed men involving arrests, or injuries, or loss of life.\u201d The particular character of such an encounter will determine whether it is an intrusion of constitutional dimensions by law enforcement officials such that justification is required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 789 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>We have stated that a person has been \u201cseized\u201d by a police officer \u201cif, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 791 (1985), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) (officer\u2019s request that defendant remove shoes constituted seizure within meaning of art. 14 of Massachusetts Declaration of Rights). \u201c[T]he police do not effect a seizure merely by asking questions unless the circumstances of the encounter are sufficiently intimidating that a reasonable person would believe he was not free to turn his back on his interrogator and walk away.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 544 (1991) (officer did not seize defendant when he approached defendant, identified himself as police officer, and asked defendant to remove hands from pockets). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>451 Mass. 608, 610-612 (2008) (no seizure where officers merely asked to speak with citizen in absence of intimidating circumstances); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 403, 405-407 (1999) (no seizure where officer only asked questions during HO without show of authority); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Think Van Cao, </em>419 Mass. 383, 387-388, cert, denied, 515 U.S. 1146 (1995) (no seizure in circumstances of HO where officer approached defendant in public, asked several questions concerning his identity, wrote information on notecard, and did not indicate that defendant was not free to terminate encounter).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, the actions of Officers O\u2019Connor and Saunders went beyond merely approaching the defendant and asking his name. Although dressed in plain clothes, the officers were armed, they displayed their badges to the defendant, and they identified themselves as police officers. Officer O\u2019Connor requested the defendant\u2019s identification and took it from him, not just to view the information and verify that the defendant was who he purported to be, but to ran a check for outstanding warrants, notably without the defendant\u2019s consent. By retaining the defendant\u2019s identification to perform this task, Officer O\u2019Connor was implicitly commanding the defendant to remain on the scene. At this juncture, a reasonable person would not believe that he could terminate the encounter and leave, given the importance of having identification, such as a driver\u2019s license, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>to daily transactions in today\u2019s society.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A reasonable person simply would not relinquish his identification to the police and continue on with his business. Moreover, it is unlikely that a reasonable person, who will not be versed in the intricacies of the law of search and seizure, would feel free to ask for the immediate return of his identification from a pohce officer, regardless of whether the officer is standing next to him or is several feet away in a patrol car. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the actions of Officer O\u2019Connor in retaining the defendant\u2019s identification constituted a seizure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">In a case that is factually analogous to the present one, the Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>12 S.W.3d 420, 427-428 (Tenn. 2000), concluded that a defendant was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. I, \u00a7 7, of the Tennessee Constitution when, after requesting and examining the defendant\u2019s identification, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>police officer retained the identification to run a computer check for outstanding warrants. The court stated that the officer\u2019s conduct in merely approaching the defendant, inquiring what was going on, and asking to see his identification did not constitute a seizure because it appeared that this encounter was not accompanied by physical force or a show of authority. <em>Id. </em>at 427. It was the officer\u2019s retention of the defendant\u2019s identification to run a computer check for outstanding warrants that, in the court\u2019s view, transformed a consensual police-citizen encounter into a seizure of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Tennessee cogently recognized, as do we here, that an individual is effectively \u201cimmobilized\u201d without his identification, and that abandoning one\u2019s identification is not a practical or realistic option. <em>Id. </em>As such, the court opined, no reasonable person would believe that he could simply terminate the encounter by asking the officer to return the identification. <em>Id. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. Jordan, 958 F.2d 1085, 1087-1088 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that, for purposes of Fourth Amendment, retention of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license during police questioning constituted seizure); <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>355 Ill. App. 3d 1030, 1034-1035 (2005) (concluding that officer\u2019s retention of defendant\u2019s identification to run computer warrant check following consensual police-citizen encounter constituted seizure within meaning of Fourth Amendment); <em>Salt Lake City </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>998 P.2d 274, 278 (Utah Ct. App. 2000) (same). See also 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(a), at 428 &amp; n.81 (4th ed. 2004) (collecting cases where encounter becomes seizure when law enforcement official holds individual\u2019s identification papers or other property).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Here, what began as a consensual police-citizen encounter matured into a seizure of the defendant, with respect to which the officers lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Given that Officer O\u2019Connor\u2019s knowledge of the outstanding warrant was the fruit of the defendant\u2019s unlawful seizure, the evidence recovered from the defendant during the booking procedure must be suppressed, as required by art. 14. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 795 (1985). Accordingly, we affirm the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The defendant asserted in his suppression motion that the officers\u2019 conduct violated his rights under both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We have held that art. 14 provides more substantive protection than does the Fourth Amendment in defining the moment when an individual\u2019s personal liberty has been significantly restrained by police such that the individual may be said to have been \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of art. 14. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 786-789 (1996). Accordingly, here, we consider the challenged seizure in light of the more stringent standards of art. 14 with the understanding that, if these standards are satisfied, then so too are those of the Fourth Amendment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 115 n.9 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">After initially hearing oral argument in the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, the Appeals Court remanded the case to the District Court for written findings regarding the credibility of the police officer who testified at the suppression hearing, and regarding the evidence necessary to determine whether a stop in the constitutional sense occurred. Once it received the judge\u2019s findings, the Appeals Court ruled on the merits of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed in support of the defendant by Suffolk Lawyers for Justice, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Boston Housing Authority police officers are specially detailed officers of the Boston police department and are under its authority.

In fact, it would be difficult to cash checks, enter secured areas, or even purchase alcohol without a driver\u2019s license. In this way, it has become the form of identification upon which Americans most often depend.\u201d Comment, Are You Ready for a National ID Card? Perhaps We Don\u2019t Have to Choose Between Fear of Terrorism and Need for Privacy, 17 Emory Int\u2019l L. Rev. 287, 321 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367 (2007), is not to the contrary. There, the defendant was walking alone shortly past midnight in a \u201chigh crime\u201d neighborhood when two police officers approached him in their vehicle and called out to him. <em>Id. </em>at 368. At some point during their conversation with the defendant, the officers stepped out of their car. <em>Id. </em>at 369. Without being asked, the defendant gave them his student identification and driver\u2019s license. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the defendant was not seized when he voluntarily offered his identification to the officers. <em>Id. </em>at 370. \u201cThat the officers accepted the identification when offered, and held it during the brief conversation that followed, [did] not \u2018amount to a show of official authority such that \u201ca reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 502 (1983) (plurality opinion). In the <em>DePeiza </em>case, because the defendant voluntarily offered his identification to the police without being asked for it, his actions were not an acquiescence to authority. Further, there was no evidence that the officers retained the defendant\u2019s identification to run a check for outstanding warrants. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 11, 19 (2005) (stating that police officer\u2019s demand that defendant produce identification, made as officer conducted patffisk, \u201cwas not a request for voluntary cooperation, but a show of authority with which a reasonable person would feel compelled to comply\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
