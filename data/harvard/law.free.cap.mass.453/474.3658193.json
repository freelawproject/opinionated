One sentence imposed a term of incarceration; the other six imposed a term of probation, to run \u201cfrom and after\u201d the incarcerated sentence. At issue in this appeal is whether a defendant\u2019s probation may be revoked based on noncriminal acts proscribed by the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>of probation (in this case, contact with the victim) for another offense where the noncriminal act occurred while the defendant was still incarcerated for the first offense. The Appeals Court concluded that a judge may revoke a \u201cfrom and after\u201d probationary term based on a violation of its conditions prior to the commencement of the term of probation and affirmed the decision of a judge in the Superior Court who had done so in this case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 578, 579, 582-585 (2008). On the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, we conclude that, while a judge may have that authority, in this case the defendant did not receive adequate notice that the condition of probation prohibiting contact with the victim was in effect during the period of his incarceration. We reverse the decision of the Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The material facts are not in dispute. The defendant attacked, on two separate occasions, a woman with whom he had been in a relationship and who was the mother of his daughter. On March 8, 2004, a grand jury returned seven indictments charging the defendant in connection with his attacks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant pleaded guilty on September 7, 2004. The judge, accepting the disposition agreed to by both parties,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sentenced the defendant to a term of from five to five and one-half years in State prison on the indictment charging rape and to a three-year term of probation on the six other indictments \u201cfrom and after\u201d the sentence for rape. Because the circumstances surrounding the wording and the issuing of the probationary sentence are significant, we describe them in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">At the plea hearing, the defendant\u2019s term of probation was orally described, three separate times, as commencing \u201cfrom and after\u201d or \u201con and after\u201d his term of incarceration. Thus, in explaining the agreed-on disposition to the judge, the assistant district attorney stated that she was recommending \u201ca three year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>probation ... to be served from and after his incarceration.\u201d During the plea colloquy, the judge asked the defendant whether he understood \u201cthat if the Court accepts the agreed recommendation, that if you are placed on probation <em>on and after </em>the sentence that would be imposed, that if you do violate those terms and conditions of probation that you can be brought in for a violation of probation\u201d (emphasis added). The defendant responded affirmatively. Finally, the clerk, in announcing the sentence, described it as \u201ca period of three years probation to commence from and after\u201d the sentence on the rape conviction. The clerk then recited certain of the conditions of probation, which included \u201cno contact with the victim,\u201d and asked the defendant whether he recognized the probation officer, who was present in the court, with whom he should be in contact, \u201c[d]uring the three year period\u201d of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The defendant signed a probation agreement form that included preprinted and handwritten terms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The form states, \u201cYou have been placed on probation for the period <em>3 yrs from &amp; after,\u201d </em>the italicized words having been written by hand. In preprinted language, the form also states, \u201cIf you fail to comply with any of the following conditions of probation now placed on you by this court, you may be ordered to appear again in court, after due notice, and the court may change the conditions, extend the period of probation or impose sentence.\u201d Under a heading \u201cConditions of Probation,\u201d the form sets forth twelve preprinted conditions, most notably, \u201cYou shall not have any direct or indirect contact with the victim(s) nor reside in the same house or apartment with the victim(s) unless approved by the court.\u201d The form includes several handwritten \u201cspecial conditions of probation,\u201d including \u201cno contact [with] victim,\u201d and \u201c[r]eport to probation immediately upon release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In the spring of 2005, the defendant, while incarcerated, wrote letters to the victim. The victim brought the letters to the attention of the Superior Court probation department, and on May 18, 2005, the probation department issued a notice of probation surrender for \u201cfailure to comply with the no contact order imposed by the Court.\u201d The defendant moved to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>on grounds that his conduct was not criminal, that the sentencing judge did not intend the condition of probation prohibiting contact with the victim to take effect until his probationary term commenced, and that \u201cit offends due process to revoke probation that, at the time of the conduct at issue, the defendant does not know or have reason to know is in effect.\u201d After a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court, who was not the sentencing judge, denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and a probation surrender hearing commenced on September 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">At the probation surrender hearing, the Commonwealth and the defendant stipulated to the following: the defendant admitted he was the author of the letters received by the victim. Although the victim had obtained a protective order against the defendant that was in effect at the time he was sentenced, see G. L. c. 209A, the order had lapsed in March, 2005, and the victim had not sought to renew it at that time. After the victim received the letters from the defendant, she obtained, on May 31, 2005, another protective order against the defendant, who remained incarcerated. Thus, at the time that the defendant wrote the letters to the victim, no protective order was in effect prohibiting him from contacting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The judge found that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation. Having earlier reviewed the letters later introduced in evidence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the judge also found that one of the letters addressed to the victim had a \u201cnot so subtle threatening tone to it.\u201d He sentenced the defendant to a term of incarceration of from one year to one year and a day, revoking the defendant\u2019s probation on the defendant\u2019s conviction of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The defendant\u2019s appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant does not suggest that the specific conditions of his probation, including that he refrain from contact with the victim, were ambiguous in any respect, or that he did not understand that contact with the victim could result in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>revocation of his probation with the attendant consequences. His claim is more focused, specifically that he was not given fair warning or clear notice that his probation or any condition of his probation, including the condition that prohibited him from contacting the victim, were in effect while he was incarcerated, at a time when no protective order was in effect. For this reason, he argues, revocation of his probation, which the Commonwealth acknowledges is based solely on the defendant\u2019s contacting the victim in writing, violated his rights to due process guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and arts. 10, 12, and 24 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Because it is dispositive of the case, we first address the due process claim. The principles of due process apply to probation revocation proceedings. See <em>McHoul </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 465, 469 (1974), citing <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 781-782 (1973); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>20 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1994). Among other things, due process \u201crequires that a person be given a \u2018reasonable opportunity to know what the order prohibited, so that he might act accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 592 (1997), cert, denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 906, 907 (1996). Thus, a statute may not be enforced \u201cwhen individuals of normal intelligence must guess at the statute\u2019s meaning and may differ as to its application, thus denying them fair notice of the proscribed conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Disler, </em>451 Mass. 216, 223 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 288-289, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989), and cases cited. The \u201cconstitutional rule against vague laws applies as equally to probation conditions as it does to legislative enactments.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>420 Mass. 410, 421 (1995), cert, denied, 516 U.S. 1042 (1996). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Due process therefore requires that a defendant sentenced to probation receive fair warning of conduct that may result in the revocation of probation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>446 Mass. 72, 75 (2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallo, supra. </em>In other words, a condition of probation must provide \u201creasonable guidance\u201d as to the conduct prohibited so that people of \u201ccommon intelligence\u201d will understand its meaning. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>325 F.3d 384, 385 (2d Cir. 2003), citing <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972) (probation condition must give person of ordinary intelligence reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited); 6 W.R. LaFave, J.H. Israel, N.J. King, &amp; O.S. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 26.9(b), at 863 (3d ed. 2007), quoting <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>406 So. 2d 1262 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) (\u201ca probation condition does not afford fair notice as required by due process unless \u2018the average person would understand the meaning of the admonition\u2019 \u201d); 16C C.J.S. Constitutional Law \u00a7 1669 (2005) (\u201cIn general, in order to comport with the requirements of due process, a condition of probation must be sufficiently precise and unambiguous to inform the probationer of the conduct that is essential so that he or she may retain his or her liberty\u201d). In addition to unambiguous guidance about the conduct prohibited, probationers are entitled to clear guidance as to <em>\u201cwhen </em>their actions or omissions will constitute a violation of their probation\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 603 (2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A judge\u2019s inquiry whether a defendant has received the required \u201cfair notice\u201d is not \u201cconfined to the four comers of the probation order\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>rather, the order\u2019s meaning may be illuminated by the judge\u2019s statements and other events that are part of the notification process. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallo, supra </em>at 12, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Where a defendant is sentenced to both incarceration and probation, probation typically begins on the defendant\u2019s release from incarceration. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Juzba, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 457, 459 (1998). See <em>id. </em>at 461 (\u201cit is a strain to imagine that the defendant was intended to be on probation while he was imprisoned, and the defendant was made aware of his true situation when he signed a \u2018probation conditions\u2019 sheet to \u2018Report upon release to this office\u2019 \u201d). While a judge \u201cis not barred from placing a defendant on probation during the period of his incarceration,\u201d there must be evidence that the judge in fact did so. <em>Id. </em>at 459. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 74, 77 (2001) (rejecting contention that defendant\u2019s probationary term commenced while he was committed at civil treatment center in part because \u201cgoals of probation ... are only brought into play when the offender is released into the community\u201d). Thus the terms of probation may state explicitly \u2014 as they did not do so here \u2014 that probation and some or all of its attendant conditions are to commence during the period of incarceration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Here, certain of the conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation, by their express terms, could not apply during his incarceration. For example, the conditions mandated that the defendant report to the probation department \u201cimmediately upon release,\u201d that he not \u201creside in the same house or apartment with the victim(s) unless approved by the court,\u201d and that he \u201cwork, seek employment or participate in education programs/training to the satisfaction\u201d of his probation officer. Where not all of the conditions of his probation could apply during his term of incarceration, the question is whether the defendant was on notice that <em>any </em>conditions of his probation \u2014 that he not contact the victim, for example \u2014 were in effect during his incarceration. The record is devoid of any evidence to that effect. If anything, the record confirms that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>was informed of the contrary, being told repeatedly, orally and in writing, that his probation was to commence \u201cfrom and after\u201d or \u201con and after\u201d the completion of the sentence on the rape charge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The probation form signed by the defendant states \u201cno contact with victim.\u201d This use of the \u201cpresent tense,\u201d the Commonwealth argues, indicates that the condition \u201ctook immediate effect upon imposition of [the] sentences.\u201d If that were the only probationary condition imposed and the only notice given to the defendant, the point might have some merit. Where the defendant was repeatedly and expressly told that probation was to take effect \u201cafter\u201d he had served his sentence of incarceration, the claim lacks merit. In addition, it is not clear that the phrase is in fact in the \u201cpresent tense\u201d; the tense is dependent on the context and surrounding language. An isolated, arguable use of the present tense describing one of many conditions of probation is hardly the \u201cclear\u201d guidance required to put the defendant on notice that a particular condition of probation is to take effect immediately. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lally, supra. </em>The use of any \u201cpresent tense\u201d at most obfuscates what was otherwise made clear at the plea hearing, that the term of probation and its attendant conditions were to begin after incarceration. To the extent there is any ambiguity, and we discern none, we construe the lack of clarity in the defendant\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>420 Mass. 410, 421 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lally, supra </em>(\u201cAs in criminal statutes, ambiguities in probation conditions are construed in favor of the defendant\u201d). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>257 S.C. 44, 49-50 (1971) (court could not revoke probation where sentencing order was ambiguous whether defendant was \u201cin a probationary status\u201d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>time offenses were committed; \u201c[a]mbiguity or doubts relative to a sentence should be resolved in favor of the accused\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the <em>revocation </em>of the defendant\u2019s probation complied with due process misses the point: the defendant does not challenge the adequacy of the due process afforded in connection with the revocation hearing. In addition, while we agree with the Commonwealth that the record indicates that the defendant was informed of the consequences of violating the conditions of probation, the record is devoid of evidence to support the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the defendant \u201cknew that the judge did not want him to have contact with the victim\u201d while he was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The Commonwealth argues that, as a matter of sound public policy, the Commonwealth should make a \u201creasonable effort\u201d to ensure that a perpetrator of a crime not be permitted to threaten or harass a victim, whether the perpetrator is incarcerated or on probation in the community. We agree. Our decision today does not foreclose the Commonwealth from doing so. As the Commonwealth has acknowledged, the Commonwealth may act to prevent an incarcerated criminal from contacting his victim. For example, the Commonwealth may request, and a judge may order, a sentence of probation to run concurrently with the defendant\u2019s term of incarceration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Juzba, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 457, 459 (1998).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A defendant must, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>have clear notice if any terms of probation are to be in effect while he is incarcerated. See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Commonwealth relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 801, 803 (1996), for the proposition that \u201cthere is nothing in either G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 1 or \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which precludes a judge from revoking a probationary term for a violation of its conditions after its imposition, but prior to its commencement.\u201d The authority of a judge to revoke probation is not the issue here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The issue is whether this particular defendant had fair notice that one condition of his probation \u2014 prohibiting contact with the victim \u2014 was in effect during his term of incarceration. The Commonwealth\u2019s citations to cases from other jurisdictions are inapposite. Most do not concern a due process claim for failure to provide clear notice to a defendant. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kierstead, </em>141 N.H. 803 (1997). In the few cases on which the Commonwealth relies where the issue of notice did arise, the conduct prompting the revocation of probation was conduct that violated the criminal laws. See, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>564 S.W.2d 21, 23 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977) (\u201cappellant was on notice that the commission of an additional crime was in viola-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>tian of the conditions of probation\u201d). A defendant, like all members of society, is on notice that he may not violate the criminal law at any time. Thus, no additional or special notice is required. In contrast, where a condition of probation proscribes conduct that is not itself unlawful, \u201cthe dictates of due process forbid the forfeiture of an actor\u2019s liberty by reason of such conduct unless he is given fair warning.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>20 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1994). See note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For all these reasons, we conclude that the defendant did not receive clear notice that the condition of probation prohibiting contact with the victim was in effect while he was incarcerated. The judge\u2019s order revoking his probation and imposing a further term of incarceration is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The indictments charged unarmed robbery, G.

Cohen, Probation and Parole \u00a7 7:18, at 7-34 (2d ed. 1999), where \u201cdeprivation of the defendant\u2019s conditional liberty . . . rests upon the commission of a non-criminal act, the defendant must be given some form of warning to ensure that he or she understands, in plain and certain terms, the conditions of his or her sentence.\u201d 16C C.J.S. Constitutional Law \u00a7 1669, at 608 (2005), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Budgett, </em>146 N.H. 135 (2001). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>20 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1994) (\u201cWhen, as now, a court order is read to proscribe conduct that is not in itself unlawful, the dictates of due process forbid the forfeiture of an actor\u2019s liberty by reason of such conduct unless he is given fair warning\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Juzba, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 457, 459 n.3 (1998), the court noted that placing a defendant on probation during the period of incarceration \u201cis uncommon and is typically reserved for cases where it can be foreseen that the person will cause trouble while jailed, e.g., as a member of a prison gang.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The docket lists the defendant\u2019s sentences for probation as \u201con and after\u201d his incarcerated sentence. Likewise, the \u201cClerk\u2019s Log\u201d for each of the indictments to which the defendant received a sentence of probation indicates that the probation is \u201con &amp; aft\u201d the defendant\u2019s incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The parties suggest different views of what the sentencing judge intended. Because we conclude that the defendant did not receive adequate notice that he was prohibited from contacting the victim while incarcerated, we need not address the issue. The question here is adequacy of notice to the defendant, not discernment of a judge\u2019s intention. In any event, had the judge intended one or more of the probationary conditions to become effective immediately, and during the defendant\u2019s term of incarceration, he could have made that explicit. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Juzba, supra </em>at 459 &amp; n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\"> As to the defendant\u2019s understanding of the terms and conditions of probation, he claims, and the Commonwealth does not contend otherwise, that he did not contact the victim at any time after he was sentenced in this case when any protective order against him was in effect, nor did he contact the victim after he was informed that doing so was considered a violation of the terms of his probation order. This suggests that the defendant did not intend to violate any term of his probation order. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Kendrick, 446 Mass. 72, 76-77 &amp; n.7 (2006) (although question is what \u201creasonable person\u201d would understand condition of probation to mean, court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cno contact\u201d condition of probation was \u201creasonably understood\u201d to prohibit conduct in which probationer engaged was buttressed by \u201cevidence that the defendant himself understood the condition\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">A judge may also modify the terms of probation, while a defendant is incarcerated or after his release, should the need arise. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Quincy Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>395 Mass. 815, 817-819 (1985), quoting <em>Burns </em>v. <em>United States, </em>287 U.S. 216, 221 (1932) (courts possess authority to modify probationary conditions \u201cto serve \u2018the ends of justice and the best interests of both the public and the defendant\u2019 \u201d; rejecting argument that \u201cthe addition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>reasonable conditions to an individual\u2019s probation\u201d constitutes \u201ca revision or revocation of a sentence\u201d pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, 378 Mass. 899 [1979], which provides temporal limits on modification of sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen a person convicted before a court is sentenced to imprisonment, the court may direct that the execution of the sentence, or any part thereof, be suspended and that he be placed on probation for such time and on such terms and conditions as it shall fix.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 3, provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time before final disposition of the case of a person placed under probation supervision or in the custody or care of a probation officer, the probation officer may arrest him without a warrant and take him before the court, or the court may issue a warrant for his arrest. When taken before the court. . . if he has been sentenced, it may continue or revoke the suspension of the execution of his sentence J 5</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b505-10\">The defendant argues that \u201c[o]nly conduct occurring during the term of the probation may be considered by a trial court when determining whether there has been a probation violation,\u201d relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>451 Mass. 1010, 1011 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aquino, </em>445 Mass. 446, 449 (2005) (\u201cthe judge \u2018may not penalize the defendant for violations committed beyond\u2019 the probationary period\u201d). Both of these cases addressed whether, in determining whether to revoke probation and what sentence to impose if probation was revoked, a judge could consider conduct occurring <em>after </em>the probationary term had expired. The cases are inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
