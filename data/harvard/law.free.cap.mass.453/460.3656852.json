L. c. 197, \u00a7 10 (\u00a7 10), and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 8, seeking, among other things, the reinstatement of certain claims against the estate of their aunt, Mildred K. Dooling, that had been dismissed in the Superior Court as untimely filed under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 (\u00a7 9). A single justice of this court ordered that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims be reinstated. The defendants appealed from the single justice\u2019s decision to the full court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">1. <em>Background and procedural history. </em>Mildred K. Dooling died testate on May 12, 2003. At the time of her death, Dooling owned the Devereux School (school), located at 44 Smith Street in Marblehead, and a substantial interest in the property at 44 Smith Street. M.D. Realty Trust owned the remaining interest in that property. The school and Dooling\u2019s interest in the real property at 44 Smith Street were assets subject to the probate of her estate. Dooling never married and had no issue. She was survived by eight nephews and nieces, including the plaintiffs Gates and Russell, and the defendant executors Joseph Reilly and James Georges.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Gates and Russell worked at the school for many years, first as teachers, and eventually came to be responsible for all aspects of the school\u2019s operations except bookkeeping and financial affairs. Gates and Russell allege that they justifiably relied on Dooling\u2019s repeated promise that in exchange for their services at the school (for which they were compensated far below market rates), Gates and Russell would become the sole owners of the school and the property at 44 Smith Street on their aunt\u2019s death. They also allege that they were unaware of Dooling\u2019s transfer of a portion of the real estate at 44 Smith Street to the M.D. Realty Trust during her lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">a. <em>Probate of the will. </em>On June 24, 2003, Reilly and Georges (named in the will as executors) filed a petition for the probate of Dooling\u2019s will with the Essex Division of the Probate and Family Court Department seeking the allowance of the will and their appointment as coexecutors. The will left Dooling\u2019s estate (including the school and her interest in the real property at 44</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Smith Street) to her eight nieces and nephews in equal shares. On August 26, 2003, Gates and Russell (acting pro se) filed challenges to the will in the Probate and Family Court, claiming that the will was the product of duress and undue influence. When the executors filed a motion to strike the challenges, Gates and Russell hired the firm of Straub &amp; Lyons, LLP (Straub &amp; Lyons), who filed a response on their behalf.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Gates and Russell\u2019s objection to the will was pending in the Probate and Family Court (and within one year of Dooling\u2019s death), their attorney filed a number of pleadings and documents that put Reilly and Georges on notice that Gates and Russell were claiming to be creditors of the estate in an amount of $1,800,003.42. On May 26, 2004, a judge allowed Reilly and Georges\u2019s motion to strike Gates and Russell\u2019s challenge to the will. The will was allowed in the Probate and Family Court on June 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">b. <em>Superior Court action. </em>On June 14, 2004 (thirteen months after Dooling\u2019s death), Gates and Russell, still represented by Straub &amp; Lyons, filed a verified complaint in the Superior Court against Reilly and Georges as executors of Dooling\u2019s estate. They again claimed to be creditors of Dooling\u2019s estate and sought monetary damages based on Dooling\u2019s alleged promise to leave them the school and all of the related real estate in her will. The verified complaint included eleven counts. On July 16, 2004, Gates and Russell filed an amended verified complaint to add Patrick Curtin, trustee of M.D. Realty Trust, as a defendant, as well as to add three additional counts, now totaling fourteen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">On August 31, 2004, the defendants moved to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>amended verified complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), on the grounds that the action was not commenced within one year of Dooling\u2019s death as required by G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 (a), in \u201can action by a creditor.\u201d On June 7, 2005, a Superior Court judge allowed in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion. While dismissing the claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, services rendered, deceit, and constructive trust, the judge let stand the plaintiffs\u2019 claims seeking an equitable interest in the school property and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Thus, counts nine, ten, eleven, and fourteen remain pending in the Superior Court. In counts nine, ten, and eleven, the plaintiffs seek specific performance (i.e., transfer to Gates and Russell of title and interest in the school and 44 Smith Street), or restitution payable to Gates and Russell if specific performance is unavailable. The school and Dooling\u2019s interest in the real estate at 44 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Smith Street remain in the estate as a consequence of a preliminary injunction ordered by a Superior Court judge on August 9, 2004, enjoining the estate from selling, transferring, encumbering, or otherwise disposing of the school, its assets, or the real estate at 44 Smith Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">c. <em>County court bill in equity. </em>Gates and Russell hired new counsel in May, 2006, who filed his appearance in the Superior Court case on May 10, 2006. Although the Superior Court judge dismissed the claims that are now before us on June 7, 2005, it was not until September 15, 2006, fifteen months later and four months after the appearance of new counsel, that a bill in equity was filed in the county court. On October 2, 2007, based on the documents, affidavits, and pleadings filed in the case, a single justice issued a memorandum of decision and judgment with the following findings of fact and conclusions of law: (1) Gates and Russell\u2019s attorney filed a notice of creditor\u2019s claim well within the one-year statute of limitations, but did not file the corresponding civil action until one year and thirty-three days after the death of Dooling; (2) the delay of thirty-three days was due solely to former counsel\u2019s neglect; (3) the neglect may not be attributable to the plaintiffs under principles of agency; (4) the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are meritorious; (5) justice and equity require that the plaintiffs be allowed to pursue those claims; and (6) the defendants have shown no prejudice from the delay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The single justice ordered that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims be reinstated in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Before we review the single justice\u2019s determination that Gates and Russell are entitled to relief under \u00a7 10, we address a preliminary argument raised by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">a. <em>Res judicata. </em>The defendants argue that the claims dismissed in the Superior Court (i.e., counts one through eight, twelve, and thirteen) are res judicata and cannot be reasserted via \u00a7 10. We disagree. Neither issue preclusion nor claim preclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>sion bars the present bill in equity. A requirement of each is the entry of final judgment on the merits, see <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>444 Mass. 837, 843 (2005), and <em>Tuper </em>v. <em>North Adams Ambulance Serv., Inc., </em>428 Mass. 132, 134 (1998), and no final judgment has been entered on the dismissed claims under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), nor did the parties request entry of such judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">b. <em>Standard of review. </em>A bill in equity filed in this court under \u00a7 10 must be filed in the county court to be \u201cheard and determined\u201d in the first instance by a single justice. See G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An appeal from the decision of a single justice under \u00a7 10 may be taken to the full court. See Mass. R. A. P. 1 (b), as amended, 421 Mass. 1601 (1995) (\u201cAll proceedings related to any appeal from ... a decision of a single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court . . . shall be had only before the full Supreme Judicial Court. . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Our cases have not clearly described the proper standard of review of a single justice\u2019s decision on a bill in equity under \u00a7 10. All parties cite to and rely on the standard of review applicable to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>427 Mass. 1016, 1017 (1998), quoting <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Suffolk Div. of the Probate &amp; Family Court Dep\u2019t, </em>418 Mass. 153, 156 (1994) (\u201cthis court will not reverse an order of a single justice in the absence of an abuse of discretion or clear error of law\u201d). That standard is not appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">In appeals from a single justice\u2019s decision on a bill in equity, this court has stated that it will not reverse a finding of fact based on oral testimony unless \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d8 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>222 Mass. 382, 386 (1916), quoting <em>Colbert </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>185 Mass. 227, 228 (1904) (\u201cupon an appeal from a decree of a judge in equity upon questions of fact, arising on oral testimony heard before him, his decision will not be reversed unless it is plainly wrong\u201d). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>insofar as there was no evidentiary hearing before the single justice in this case, and no findings of fact based on oral testimony, the court may draw its own inferences from the documentary evidence. See, e.g., <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>220 Mass. 348, 348-349 (1915) (\u201cIn reviewing the facts, this court stands where the single justice stood\u201d when reviewing decree of single justice on bill in equity where no oral testimony heard).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">When reviewing a decision by a single justice on a bill in equity under \u00a7 10, this court has reviewed questions of law de nova, albeit without explicitly stating so. See, e.g., <em>Tamulevich </em>v. <em>Robie, </em>426 Mass. 712 (1998) (reviewed question of law de nova without stating standard); <em>Haven </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>250 Mass. 546 (1925) (same). See also <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>233 Mass. 351, 364-366, 369-376 (1919) (standard not stated but question of law reviewed de nova after decision by single justice on bill in equity not brought under \u00a7 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In summary, in a bill in equity proceeding heard in the first instance by a single justice, we review without deference factual findings made solely on documentary evidence, and review de nova questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">c. <em>Statutory framework. </em>General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 9 (a), sets forth a one-year statute of limitations for an \u201caction by a creditor of the deceased\u201d against the deceased\u2019s executor or administrator.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThe purpose of the statute is to expedite the settlement of estates.\u201d <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>310 Mass. 424, 429 (1941), and cases cited. Section 10, however, allows a creditor who has failed to comply with \u00a7 9\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to file a bill in equity seeking \u201cjudgment for the amount of his claim against the estate of the deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>person.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To receive judgment in its favor, such a creditor must demonstrate two things: (1) \u201cthat justice and equity require it\u201d; and (2) \u201cthat such creditor is not chargeable with culpable neglect in not prosecuting his claim within\u201d the one-year statute of limitations. G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10. In other words, a creditor must show \u201cboth that justice and equity require recognition of a meritorious claim and that failure to bring the claim was not due to carelessness or lack of diligence.\u201d <em>Matter of the Estate of </em>Grabowski, 444 Mass. 715, 719 (2005) (Grabowski). Moreover, \u00a7 10 \u201cis remedial in character, and \u2018[i]ts operation is not limited to cases where the failure to sue seasonably was due to such fraud, accident or mistake as would be a ground for equitable relief if there were no statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 27, 32 (1980), quoting <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Miller, 192 </em>Mass. 241, 242 (1906). See <em>Grabowski, supra, </em>citing <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>(relief under \u00a7 10 not limited to cases of fraud, accident, or mistake).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">d. <em>Justice and equity. </em>\u201c[A] creditor whose claim is barred by [\u00a7 9] is not entitled to relief under [\u00a7 10], unless he shows a claim of such substantial merit that equity and justice require that its validity should be recognized.\u201d <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>312 Mass. 405, 408 (1942). Justice and equity favor recognizing a creditor\u2019s time-barred claims where the claims are meritorious and the estate has not shown prejudice. <em>Grabowski, supra </em>at 720. A claim is meritorious where it has both legal and factual support, see <em>id. </em>at 719-720, and a court is unlikely to find prejudice where the estate was on notice of the creditor\u2019s claims within the one-year limitations period. See <em>id. </em>at 720; <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Garthwait, </em>875 F. Supp. 14, 21 n.10 (D. Mass. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Gates and Russell\u2019s time-barred claims are supported by evidence in the record. The claims are based essentially on alleged promises, made over more than three decades, on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Gates and Russell claim to have relied. Gates and Russell have submitted their own affidavits and corroborating deposition testimony from family members, friends, and others in support of their claims. They have also submitted an affidavit from an expert establishing that they were compensated at far below market rates during their employment by the school. We conclude that the time-barred claims are sufficiently grounded in law and fact to be deemed meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Moreover, the defendants have not shown that they were prejudiced by the filing of Gates and Russell\u2019s creditor claims in the Superior Court thirty-three days after the one-year statute of limitations expired. As described earlier, the defendants were on notice of the claims well within the one-year limitations period. See <em>Grabowski, supra </em>at 720 (no prejudice where estate was on notice of claim via letter from creditor\u2019s attorney within one year of decedent\u2019s death); <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Garthwait, supra </em>(no prejudice where estate knew claim would be brought).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Further, the equitable claims (seeking relief both in the form of specific performance and restitution) remain pending in the Superior Court. Even if relief under \u00a7 10 were denied, the defendants would have to defend against those claims that are premised on the same underlying events, promises, and relationships as the dismissed claims. Finally, the school and Dooling\u2019s interest in the real estate at 44 Smith Street remain in the estate as a consequence of a preliminary injunction ordered by the Superior Court judge in the pending action. The defendants have thus failed to demonstrate the type and level of prejudice that might otherwise counsel against equitable relief. We conclude that justice and equity require us to recognize Gates and Russell\u2019s time-barred claims, and turn now to whether they are chargeable with culpable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">e. <em>Culpable neglect. </em>To be entitled to relief under \u00a7 10, a creditor must establish that his failure to file suit within the one-year limitations period \u201cwas not due to his carelessness or to any lack of diligence for which he might properly be censured or blamed.\u201d <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., supra </em>at 408-409, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">We agree with the single justice that Gates and Russell are not themselves guilty of culpable neglect. The defendants do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>not contend that Gates and Russell are chargeable with culpable neglect in their hiring of Straub &amp; Lyons to represent them, or in their reliance on counsel\u2019s advice. See <em>id. </em>(creditor justified in relying on experienced attorney\u2019s advice, and thus not chargeable with culpable neglect); <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>at 32-33 (same). Rather, they argue that Gates and Russell are chargeable with culpable neglect because they \u201cintentional[ly]\u201d waited for the outcome or settlement of the will contest in the Probate and Family Court before filing suit in the Superior Court. See <em>Monaghan </em>v. Monaghan, 323 Mass. 96, 97-98 (1948) (\u201cIt is settled that one[] who insists upon staking all in prosecuting a pending proceeding to a final conclusion while knowing all the material facts which indicate that the short statute of limitations is running against him, and yet neglects to resort to another remedy available to him and sufficient to protect his rights, is not entitled to maintain a bill under [\u00a7 10], in the event that the proceeding which he pursued terminated in a final decision unfavorable to him\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The defendants point to statements made by former counsel, Melissa Tzanoudakis, that she \u201cprepared a lawsuit to be filed in Superior Court in the event that the Probate matter was not settled, or the Probate Court judge did not rule in favor of the Objection to the Probate of the Will.\u201d The defendants argue that Gates and Russell offered no evidence that their attorney\u2019s decision to await the outcome of the Probate and Family Court proceedings was contrary to their instructions or not based on their informed decision. Notably, however, Tzanoudakis\u2019s affidavit states that \u201cthe failure to file the Superior Court action was not due to carelessness, or lack of diligence on the part of my clients. They relied upon my assurances that their interests were being protected and <em>did not knowingly disregard their rights. . . </em>. My clients should not be charged with culpable neglect where I assured them that we were doing everything that could be, and needed to be done, to fully assert their claims.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The defendants do not offer any evidence to contradict Tza-noudakis\u2019s statements, nor did they offer evidence to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Gates and Russell were negligent or careless, or lacked diligence. And Gates and Russell submitted affidavits to the effect that they did not know until after the limitations period had passed that their attorneys had not done what was necessary to protect their creditor claims in a timely fashion. We therefore conclude that Gates and Russell were not themselves guilty of culpable neglect in failing to file their creditor claims within the limitations period, and consider whether any culpable neglect on the part of Gates and Russell\u2019s attorneys can be attributed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In <em>Grabowski, </em>our most recent decision under \u00a7 10, we allowed the untimely claim of a minor who suffered lead poisoning sustained in his home, which was owned by the decedent, to go forward, concluding that the child was not chargeable with culpable neglect for his mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s failure to file a claim against the estate within one year. <em>Grabowski, supra </em>at 716-717, 722. The child\u2019s mother engaged an attorney on the child\u2019s behalf, who sent a letter of demand concerning the child\u2019s damages from lead poisoning to the decedent\u2019s attorney within six months of the decedent\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 716-717. Through counsel, the decedent\u2019s attorney responded by letter stating that she had petitioned to be appointed administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate and that once she was appointed she would be willing to negotiate concerning the child\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at <em>111. </em>However, after being appointed, she refused to make a settlement offer and took the position that the claim was by then time barred by \u00a7 9. <em>Grabowski, supra </em>at 718. The child\u2019s attorney filed a claim against the estate, arguing that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> tolled the statute of limitations in \u00a7 9, because the petitioner was a minor, thereby allowing the petitioner to file a claim under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Grabowski, supra </em>at 718, 722. A Probate and Family Court judge granted the administratrix\u2019s motion to dismiss because the one-year statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>limitations had ran. <em>Id. </em>at 718. The child filed a bill in equity under \u00a7 10. <em>Grabowski, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">After concluding that justice and equity required us to recognize the child\u2019s claim, we concluded that any carelessness or lack of diligence by the child\u2019s attorney did not create culpable neglect on the part of the child, <em>id. </em>at 720-721, relying principally on <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 27 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>at 29-31, a decedent\u2019s will did not contain his oral promise to the creditor plaintiff to leave him one-half of his estate in return for performing certain services. On learning this, the creditor promptly consulted with an attorney, but the attorney failed to file a claim on his behalf until after the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 31. The court held that the creditor was not himself guilty of culpable neglect because he spoke limited English, had no formal education, and had engaged an experienced and respected attorney to represent him. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33, citing <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>312 Mass. 405, 408-409 (1942). The court further held that the attorney\u2019s conduct was not attributable to his client because the attorney \u201cmisunderstood or misinterpreted the salient provision of [\u00a7 9].\u201d <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>at 33. The court reached this conclusion by applying the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201cIf the attorney\u2019s failure was \u2018due to inadvertence, misunderstanding, illness or some cause other than neglect or breach of duty,\u2019 . . . that misstep is not culpable under the statute, nor attributable to the creditor client. The statute thus leaves to the judge some leeway to pardon those errors which arise from a misunderstanding of the controlling law as distinguished from mere procrastination in callous disregard of professional responsibilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 33, quoting <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., supra </em>at 409. The court noted that the attorney was aware of the short statute of limitations in \u00a7 9, that he always intended to file suit in a timely fashion, and that two recent amendments to \u00a7 9 \u201ccould explain his error.\u201d <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>at 33-34 &amp; n.5 (\u201cmany a well intentioned lawyer has felt the pricks of the statute\u2019s brambles\u201d). The <em>Hastoupis </em>court went on to conclude that the attorney \u201cmisunderstood or misinterpreted the time limitations in the statute and that his conduct was within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>range of ordinary excusable fallibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. Consequently, where an attorney misunderstands or misinterprets the salient provisions of \u00a7 9, there is no culpable neglect, and the attorney\u2019s conduct is not attributable to the client creditor. See <em>Grabowski, supra </em>at 721 (discussing holding in <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">After discussing the <em>Hastoupis </em>case in <em>Grabowski, </em>we stated that \u201c[ajgency principles (which might operate to make an attorney\u2019s neglect attributable to the client as principal) do not apply to [\u00a7 10].\u201d <em>Grabowski, supra, </em>citing <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>at 31. See <em>Haven </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>250 Mass. 546, 549 (1925) (\u201c \u2018culpable neglect\u2019 mean[s] the neglect which arises from the creditor\u2019s own carelessness in not seasonably enforcing his claim\u201d). But see <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>at 33, and cases cited (\u201c \u2018creditors\u2019 can be charged with the result of their lawyers\u2019 blameworthy conduct under \u00a7 10\u201d). We went on to explain that the estate had misinformed the child\u2019s attorney about the status of the administratrix\u2019s appointment and lulled the child\u2019s attorney into believing that the administratrix would be willing to settle the claim when she was appointed. <em>Grabowski, supra. </em>We also deemed it \u201cunderstandable\u201d that the attorney would assume that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7, tolled the statute of limitations, thereby allowing the child to file a claim under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, and concluded that, \u201c[i]n these circumstances, it would be unjust to charge the petitioner with culpable neglect for the mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s failure to file a claim against the estate within one year.\u201d <em>Grabowski, supra </em>at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We continue to adhere as a general matter to the proposition that agency principles do not strictly apply to equitable proceedings brought under \u00a7 10, where a creditor\u2019s attorney is responsible for missing the one-year statute of limitations, <em>Grabowski, supra </em>at 721; however, the attorney\u2019s conduct may be attributable to the client where the attorney exhibits a \u201cdisregard of professional responsibilities\u201d as opposed to \u201ca misunderstanding of the controlling law.\u201d <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>at 33. See <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Garthwait, </em>875 F. Supp. 14, 24 &amp; n.21 (D. Mass. 1994), quoting <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>(discussing <em>Hastoupis </em>standard and concluding that court \u201ccan \u2018pardon\u2019 errors arising from \u2018misunderstandings of the controlling law\u2019 not amounting to \u2018mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>procrastination\u2019 or \u2018callous disregard of professional responsibilities\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">While Gates and Russell\u2019s attorneys may have been negligent in failing to file suit against the estate within one year of Dool-ing\u2019s death,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we conclude that their conduct was sufficiently the product of a misunderstanding of the controlling law that it ought not be attributed to Gates and Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the single justice reinstating the claims dismissed by the Superior Court judge is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The record indicates that Gates and Russell hired Neila J. Straub of the law firm of Straub &amp; Lyons, LLP, and that Melissa M. Tzanoudakis of that firm entered an appearance in the Probate and Family Court for Gates and Russell. At least one other attorney from the firm, Mark B. Lyons, submitted filings in the Probate and Family Court on behalf of Gates and Russell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The fourteen counts were as follows: (1) breach of contract (Gates); (2) breach of contract (Russell); (3) unjust enrichment (Gates); (4) unjust enrichment (Russell); (5) services rendered (Gates); (6) services rendered (Russell); (7) deceit (Gates); (8) deceit (Russell); (9) deceit (equitable interest) (Gates and Russell); (10) unjust enrichment (equitable interest) (Gates and Russell); (11) promissory estoppel (equitable interest) (Gates and Russell); (12) constructive trust for fraud and deceit (Gates and Russell); (13) constructive trust for breach of fiduciary duty (Gates and Russell); (14) injunctive relief (Gates and Russell).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The judge reasoned that the term \u201ccreditor\u201d as construed by Massachusetts courts includes persons with contract and tort claims against the estate. Further, the term \u201caction\u201d applies to proceedings in law and equity. The judge noted, quoting <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>310 Mass. 424, 430 (1941), however, that the \u201cstatute does not apply to suits to enforce equitable interests in property of a decedent in the possession of an executor, as such a suit is not one by a creditor to collect a debt but one by the holder of an equity to enforce his title.\u201d Accordingly, the judge dismissed counts one through eight because they sounded in tort and contract. The judge declined to dismiss counts nine, ten, and eleven because they each sought relief in the form of an \u201cequitable interest in property.\u201d Count fourteen, which sought injunctive relief pending adjudication of the claims, was not dismissed. Finally, the judge dismissed counts twelve and thirteen (constructive trust claims) on the authority of <em>Geldurt </em>v. <em>Usher, </em>248 Mass. 323, 326 (1924), which she concluded made such claims subject to the one-year statute of limitations in G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 (\u00a7 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The judge rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the Statute of Frauds mandated dismissal of counts nine, ten, and eleven because Dooling\u2019s alleged promise of the transfer of land was oral. The judge reasoned that the plaintiffs may come within an exception to the Statute of Frauds because they may be able to prove that they changed their positions in reliance on Dooling\u2019s promise, that they were put into possession of the land by performing most of the administrative and ministerial functions at the school, and that they furnished part of the consideration by performing services at below minimum wage. See <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Green, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 673-674 (1982), citing <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>332 Mass. 727, 729 (1955). If the plaintiffs come within this exception, the judge reasoned, they will be entitled to specific performance. See <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Green, supra. </em>Through the remedy of specific performance, the plaintiffs would be seeking to enforce an \u201cequitable interest in property,\u201d which would make the statute of limitations in \u00a7 9 inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The defendants argue that the single justice committed reversible error by not ordering an evidentiary hearing or appointing a commissioner or special master. See G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A (giving single justice authority to transfer case to lower court for partial disposition); S.J.C. Rule 2:13, as appearing in 382 Mass. 749 (1981) (providing for designation of special masters and commissioners).
