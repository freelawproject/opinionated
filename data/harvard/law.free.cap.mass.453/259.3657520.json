Maloof, commenced a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>civil action against the defendant, David A. Maloof, in which he alleged that the defendant misappropriated funds from his late mother\u2019s estate. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in which he asserted the action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In particular, the defendant asserted that his sister Suzanne Ayoub became aware of the facts necessary to trigger the statute of limitations no later than June 18, 1998, while she was present during the deposition of the defendant in a separate action she had filed against him, and that her knowledge must be imputed to the plaintiff. A judge in the Superior Court agreed and granted summary judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The following facts are not in dispute. The decedent, Adele H. Maloof, and her husband, Edward D. Ma-loof, had five children: Edward A. Maloof (Edward), Suzanne Ayoub (Suzanne), Marilyn Sullivan (Marilyn), Paul Maloof (Paul), and David Maloof, the defendant. Adele\u2019s husband died on May 26, 1991, leaving her the sole owner of their two-family house in Norwood. On July 3, 1991, Adele transferred the house to Suzanne and the defendant, and she had the defendant\u2019s name added to various bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Adele died July 1, 1992. She had executed a will dated February 26, 1971, in which she left her entire estate (save two small charitable bequests) to her husband, but if he died before her, to her five children in equal shares. She nominated her husband to be executor of her will, but if he predeceased her, she nominated her son Edward to be executor. Approximately one year after Adele\u2019s death, the defendant delivered the will to his cousin, Andrew Howard, for safekeeping. Edward requested the will from Howard sometime in June, 1998. Because of internal family difficulties, described below, Howard caused the will to be filed in the Norfolk Division of the Probate and Family Court Department on or about July 23, 1998, approximately six years after Adele\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>In the meantime, on August 30, 1995, Suzanne agreed to transfer her title to Adele\u2019s house to the defendant so he could secure a mortgage loan to address some personal financial difficulties. A disagreement arose over the defendant\u2019s control of the house, and Suzanne brought a civil action against the defendant in Superior Court seeking, inter aha, a declaration that the defendant held the house in trust for all five of Adele\u2019s children.* <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Paul and Marilyn were added as plaintiffs, but Edward refused to participate in the action. That action ultimately was settled in May, 1999, and the defendant transferred title of the house to Suzanne, Paul, and Marilyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In the course of that litigation, on June 18, 1998, the defendant was deposed. During that deposition, which Suzanne attended, the defendant testified that Adele had added his name to \u201cone or two\u201d of her bank accounts, as a convenience to her, so he could pay her bills. These accounts (there were six) contained about $200,000 at the time. After Adele\u2019s death the defendant closed the accounts, which he said contained over $100,000. He opened a joint account with his brother Edward at a bank in New Hampshire. The defendant since has withdrawn nearly all the funds, and only about $1,000 remained at the time of her death. The defendant testified that he spent the money for Adele\u2019s purposes, but he resisted attempts that he produce documentation to support that assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Suzanne filed a petition to probate Adele\u2019s will on July 23, 1998, approximately one month after the defendant\u2019s deposition in her Superior Court action. She alleged that Edward was unsuitable to be appointed executor because he and the defendant misappropriated assets of the estate. Internal family conflict resulted in none of the Maloof siblings being appointed fiduciary of the estate, and the plaintiff was appointed administrator with the will annexed on January 14, 1999. He gave bond as required by law. See G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 7; G. L. c. 205, \u00a7 1 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">After investigation, the plaintiff determined that Adele had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>$225,203.95 in six bank accounts in her name approximately one year before her death, and that her two-family house generated rental income of $1,200 per month after her death. The plaintiff requested the defendant to provide him with an accounting of money he spent from Adele\u2019s bank accounts. The defendant provided the plaintiff with an accounting of $212,865 spent for or on behalf of Adele. After further investigation the plaintiff determined that \u201cmany of [the defendant\u2019s purported] expenses [were] inflated, untruthful, misleading and false,\u201d and that \u201cthe rents collected were sufficient to pay all of the outstanding repairs and renovations\u201d to Adele\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiff commenced a civil action against the defendant on December 12, 2001, within three years of his appointment as administrator. He alleged that the defendant\u2019s name was added as a joint owner of Adele\u2019s six bank accounts, without donative intent, solely as a matter of convenience to assist Adele in paying her bills and managing her finances. The complaint alleged it was Adele\u2019s intent that on her death the balance in said accounts would be distributed equally among her children, and that at the time of Adele\u2019s death, on July 1, 1992, said accounts contained $225,203.95 in the aggregate. The complaint further alleges that the defendant secretly withdrew the funds from said accounts, which he \u201cheld in trust for the benefit of all the Maloof siblings,\u201d and wrongfully expended them for his own purposes. A similar allegation is made as to rental income from Adele\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant contends the judge correctly ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s action is barred by the three-year statute of limitations, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, because Suzanne became aware on June 18, 1998, that he had control over Adele\u2019s bank accounts, and her knowledge is imputed to the plaintiff, who did not commence this action until December 12, 2001, approximately three and one-half years after Suzanne gained such knowledge. Relying on <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>429 F. Supp. 2d 270, 277 (D. Mass. 2006), he reasons that Suzanne had full authority under G. L. c. 230, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to bring an action on behalf of Adele\u2019s estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>to recover funds allegedly misappropriated by the defendant once Edward, the original executor, refused to bring such a lawsuit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cIt shall be unnecessary to remove an executor or administrator in order that an action to enforce a claim in favor of the estate may be brought by an administrator to be appointed in his place, when he <em>refuses </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>to bring such action at the request of an heir, legatee or creditor, or is <em>unable </em>to do so by reason of his interest or otherwise, but an heir, legatee or creditor having an interest in the enforcement of any such claim may bring a civil action to enforce it for the benefit of the estate . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Bennett </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>was not decided on the basis of Massachusetts law, but under Federal law. The court held that under the terms of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), a surviving child who was a beneficiary of the estate, along with the executor or administrator of the estate, had \u201cfull authority to file the administrative claim\u201d needed to initiate the compensatory process under the FTCA. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 278, quoting <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>FBI, </em>278 F. Supp. 2d 104, 114 (D. Mass. 2003). The court held that the beneficiary\u2019s knowledge may be imputed to the estate because, under the FTCA, the beneficiary had the same authority as the executor or administrator to prosecute the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant argues that under <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>Suzanne\u2019s knowledge must be imputed to the estate because she could have prosecuted the instant claim against him under authority of G. L. c. 230, \u00a7 5, after Edward, the executor named in Adele\u2019s will, refused to bring such a claim. We do not agree. Edward was not the executor of the estate for purposes of G. L. c. 230, \u00a7 5. The word \u201cexecutor,\u201d as it appears in that statute, refers to a fiduciary who has been appointed by a court, not someone who merely has been named executor in a will. Where the statute speaks of no necessity to \u201cremove\u201d an executor, it is referring to one who has been placed in a position of authority by a court, not a testator. It is the former who is \u201cremoved,\u201d not the latter, who has been \u201cnamed\u201d executor in a will. A named executor is not \u201cremoved\u201d from a will. Rather, if he is appointed executor by a court, he then may be \u201cremoved\u201d from his office. If the Legislature meant an \u201cexecutor\u201d to be an unappointed \u201cexecutor under the will,\u201d it would have so indicated. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Assessors of Wenham, </em>350 Mass. 629, 632 (1966) (statute authorizing \u201cexecutor . . . under the will\u201d to apply for abatement of real estate taxes refers to executor named in will and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>yet appointed). The context in which the word \u201cexecutor\u201d is used in G. L. c. 230, \u00a7 5, imbues the word with the official status of being court appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the plaintiff, as administrator, either refused or was unable to bring suit against the defendant, so as to trigger authority for Suzanne to bring suit against the defendant pursuant to G. L. c. 230, \u00a7 5. Suzanne had no authority to sue the defendant except as provided by \u00a7 5. See <em>Stuck </em>v. <em>Schumm, </em>290 Mass. 159, 163-164 (1935). Because there was no refusal or inability on the part of the plaintiff to bring suit, Suzanne had no authority to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Unlike the heir in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>Suzanne was not on an equal footing with the plaintiff to bring suit. The property in question was personalty. As such, title to those assets vested in her administrator, the plaintiff, on his appointment, and related back to the date of Adele\u2019s death. <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>306 Mass. 579, 581 (1940). Thereafter, only the plaintiff could have prosecuted an action to recover Adele\u2019s personal property, <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>183 Mass. 365, 366 (1903), unless he refused or was unable to proceed, in which case an heir or devisee could have proceeded pursuant to G. L. c. 230, \u00a7 5. For reasons previously stated, that statute has no application here, and Suzanne had no right to bring suit against the defendant. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>has no application to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The plaintiff initiated the present action within the three-year statute of limitations. Whatever knowledge he acquired, it was not before his appointment as administrator, on January 14, 1999. The plaintiff had no duty to search for assets before his appointment, even if he had been named executor in the will.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>330 Mass. 323, 325 (1953). There is no basis to impute Suzanne\u2019s knowledge to the plaintiff. Thus, suit was timely commenced on December 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Finally, we address a related problem. The plaintiff has alleged a cause of action against the defendant for breach of a resulting trust as to rents collected before Adele\u2019s death and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the proceeds of her bank accounts that he held jointly with her. This is a recognized cause of action. See <em>Corkum </em>v. <em>Salvation Army of Mass., Inc., </em>340 Mass. 165, 167-168 (1959); <em>Dorfman </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 952, 953 (1981); <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Wadas, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 656 (1974). However, he also has brought suit for rents obtained by the defendant <em>after </em>Adele\u2019s death. Where the plaintiff did not take control of Adele\u2019s house after her death, he has no right to rents accruing after her death. \u201cSuch rents belong to the heirs or devisees of the real estate as an incident of the reversion.\u201d <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>291 Mass. 411, 414 (1935).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cf. G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 8 (\u201cIf real estate of a deceased person is used, occupied or taken charge of by an executor or administrator, he shall account for the income and management thereof in the same manner as in the case of personal property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for trial, except as to the issue of rents accruing after Adele\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2A, states: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided, actions of <em>tort, </em>actions of contract to recover for personal injuries, and actions of replevin, shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">General Laws c. 191, \u00a7 13, requires a person having custody of a will to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>deliver the will to the appropriate Probate and Family Court within thirty days after notice of the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\u201cThe heirs of a decedent stand in his shoes as the beneficiaries of a resulting trust [with respect to realty] after his death.\u201d <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Wadas, </em>1 Mass.
