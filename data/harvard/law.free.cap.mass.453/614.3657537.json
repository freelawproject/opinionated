L. c. 272, \u00a7 53A, and keeping a house of ill fame, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 24, the Fall River Housing Authority (FRHA) notified her it was terminating her participation in the Section 8 rent subsidy program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Costa pursued and exhausted her administrative appeals, and thereafter brought an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) and G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, against the FRHA in the Housing Court, challenging the termination. Her complaint contained three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"A3l\">On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge in the Housing Court concluded that regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) did not permit the FRHA to terminate a recipient\u2019s Section 8 rent subsidy benefits for \u201ccriminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents and persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises,\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(1), and that the termination appeal hearing conducted by the FRHA, and its resulting decision, violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Costa\u2019s regulatory and constitutional right to due process of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the FRHA\u2019s appeal to the Appeals Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that court reversed the Housing Court judge\u2019s decision with respect to the meaning of HUD\u2019s regulations, but agreed that the termination appeal hearing and decision in this case violated Costa\u2019s procedural due process rights in several respects, including the fact that the grievance panel conducting the hearing based its decision to terminate solely on hearsay evidence. <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 269 (2008) <em>(Costa). </em>We granted the FRHA\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We conclude that the applicable HUD regulations allow a public housing authority (PHA) such as the FRHA to terminate a recipient\u2019s participation in the Section 8 rent subsidy program for criminal activity beyond that which is violent or drug related, and in particular, for criminal conduct \u201cthat threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents and persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(1). We also conclude that while a PHA such as the FRHA may permissibly base an appeal decision terminating Section 8 benefits on reliable hearsay evidence, in this case the grievance panel\u2019s decision failed to comply with applicable HUD regulations in several respects. We affirm the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Housing Court in part, reverse in part, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Gale Costa is a participant in the Section 8 rent subsidy program administered by the FRHA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f and implementing HUD regulations. In September, 2003, Costa rented a single-family home in Fall River, using a housing voucher issued by the FRHA to subsidize approximately eighty-five per cent of her rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">On June 24, 2004, Costa was arrested by officers of the Fall River police department. The police report, prepared by Detective Jay Huard, related the following narrative. On June 23, 2004, investigating suspected prostitution activity, Huard made an appointment to go to Costa\u2019s house at 9:30 p.m. the following evening. He arrived at her house at the appointed time, supported by an anticipatory search warrant and several other detectives. Huard was met by Costa and another woman, Judy Kaeterle, both wearing lingerie. Costa asked if Huard had the money, and Huard asked how much it would cost. Costa replied, \u201cWell it costs $75.00 for the dominatrix session and if you want sex with me it will cost you another $25.00. If you want sex with Judy and me it will be $150.00 total.\u201d Huard summoned the other detectives, arrested Costa and Kaeterle, and performed a search. Huard heard Costa state to Kaeterle, \u201cI told you we should not have gotten into the sex thing. Charging money for the sex is what got us into trouble. DOM [charging for \u2018dominatrix\u2019 services] is not illegal. We should have stuck to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">On July 12, 2004, the FRHA notified Costa that it planned to terminate her participation in the Section 8 program because she had violated the \u201c[f]amily [obligation,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> set forth in 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551, not to engage in \u201c[cjrime by household members.\u201d An unsigned copy of Detective Huard\u2019s police report was attached to the notice. Costa exercised her right to appeal from the decision. On July 22, 2004, she was given an informal preliminary hearing \u2014 referred to in the FRHA grievance procedures as an \u201cinformal settlement conference\u201d \u2014 before an FRHA hearings officer, Theresa Quental, who \u201caffirmed\u201d the FRHA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Costa then received a hearing before the FRHA grievance panel (grievance panel). Under the FRHA\u2019s grievance procedures, the appeal termination hearing to which a Section 8 recipient has a right under HUD regulations \u2014 referred to in those regulations as an \u201cinformal appeal hearing,\u201d see 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555 \u2014 is conducted by the grievance panel, consisting of two FRHA employees, two tenants, and one person who is neither an FRHA employee nor a tenant. In Costa\u2019s case, one of the two FRHA employees on the grievance panel was Quental, the hearing officer who had conducted Costa\u2019s preliminary hearing. Costa, represented by counsel, appeared before the grievance panel on August 3, 2004. The grievance panel had before it materials including the unsigned copy of Detective Huard\u2019s June 24, 2004, police report; a letter from Costa\u2019s treating physician, indicating that she suffered from bipolar disorder, which could result in \u201crisky behaviors\u201d; and a local newspaper article dated July 8, 2004, two weeks after the arrest. The article, titled \u201cPolice Close House of Prostitution Taking Orders Online,\u201d quoted a police \u201cspokesman,\u201d Detective Lieutenant John DeMello. While substantially repeating the information contained in the police report, the article added the claims that \u201c[p]olice have cracked a prostitution operation that a woman allegedly ran out of her home to clients who made appointments over the Internet,\u201d and that Huard\u2019s investigation was prompted by \u201cinformation that Costa . . . was \u2018running a house of prostitution\u2019 at her home.\u201d The article was also, apparently, the only source of information before the grievance panel identifying the specific criminal charges against Costa.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Costa testified at the grievance panel hearing. She stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>she had agreed to meet Huard in order to engage in \u201cfantasy play\u201d as a \u201cdominatrix\u201d for money; that Huard had pressured her to participate in sex acts, but she had refused; but that Ka-eterle had agreed to engage in sex with Huard. Costa also offered two letters from her nearest neighbors, indicating that she was a good and quiet neighbor, and a letter from a treating therapist, stating an opinion that her behavior was unlikely to repeat if her mania could be stabilized. At the conclusion of the hearing, the grievance panel orally advised Costa that it had voted unanimously to uphold the FRHA\u2019s termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The grievance panel provided Costa with written notice of its decision in a letter signed by Quental and dated August 31, 2004. Also on August 31, 2004, Costa pleaded guilty in the District Court to both criminal charges against her, and was sentenced to eighteen months\u2019 probation. Costa appealed from the grievance panel decision to the FRHA\u2019s board of commissioners, which reviewed her file and notified her on October 14, 2004, that it had found enough evidence to warrant termination from the program, effective November 1, 2004. There is no evidence that the board of commissioners knew of Costa\u2019s guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Costa filed the present action against the FRHA in the Housing Court, seeking to enjoin her termination from the Section 8 program and to recover compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988; she also sought certiorari review of the FRHA\u2019s termination decision pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. After hearing, the Housing Court judge issued a decision allowing Costa\u2019s motion with respect to her claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and dismissing her claim for certiorari review. The parties thereafter stipulated to damages in the amount of $1,950 for emotional distress, $11,000 for attorney\u2019s fees, and $235 for costs. The FRHA\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>(a) <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cAn order granting or denying summary judgment will be upheld if the trial judge ruled on undisputed material facts and [her] ruling was correct as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>451 Mass. 80, 84 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992). Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the material facts are not in dispute. \u201cWe review questions of statutory interpretation de nova.\u201d <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">(b) <em>FRHA\u2019s regulatory authority. </em>The judge concluded that HUD regulations do not authorize a PHA such as the FRHA to terminate Section 8 assistance for criminal activity that is not drug related or violent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She then ruled that because the criminal activity Costa was charged with having engaged in \u2014 soliciting sex for a fee (prostitution) and keeping a house of ill fame \u2022\u2014 was neither related to drugs nor violent, the FRHA could not terminate Costa\u2019s participation in the Section 8 program for such conduct. The Appeals Court disagreed. Based on its analysis of the three pertinent HUD regulations, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 982.551(1), 982.552(c)(1)(i), and 982.553(b), the Appeals Court concluded that a PHA may permissibly terminate Section 8 rent subsidy benefits for all three categories of criminal activity mentioned in those regulations: violent criminal conduct, criminal conduct related to drugs, and also \u201cother criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents and persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises,\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(1), the latter of which could include the alleged criminal conduct at issue here. <em>Costa, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 275-278. For essentially the reasons stated by the Appeals Court, we agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>(c) <em>Procedural due process claims. </em>The judge determined that the FRHA\u2019s hearing process failed to provide Costa with the procedural due process required by both HUD regulations and the United States Constitution. In particular, the judge concluded that the FRHA failed to provide Costa with (1) an impartial decision maker; (2) an opportunity to confront and cross-examine each witness; and (3) an explanation of the reasons for its decision. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 266-271 (1970). See also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>85 F.3d 146, 150 (4th Cir. 1996) (noting that HUD regulations governing Section 8 termination hearing process are designed to implement procedural protections described in <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra). </em>The FRHA challenges each of the judge\u2019s conclusions. We consider each separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">(i) <em>Impartial decision maker. </em>The judge concluded that the FRHA failed to comply with HUD regulations, and denied Costa due process, when it permitted Theresa Quental to serve as the hearing officer for the \u201cinformal settlement conference\u201d with Costa, and then as a member of the grievance panel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Appeals Court agreed. Without reaching the constitutional ques-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>tian, we agree that under the applicable HUD regulation, Quen-tal was not permitted to serve in both capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As previously mentioned, when a PHA terminates a recipient\u2019s Section 8 assistance, the recipient has a right to an \u201cinformal hearing\u201d before the termination takes effect. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(a)(l)(v). See <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Auth., </em>450 Mass. 626, 633-634 (2008) <em>(Carter). </em>The HUD regulations go on to state that the informal hearing \u201cmay be conducted by any person or persons designated by the PHA, <em>other than a person who made or approved the decision under review or a subordinate of this person\u2019'' </em>(emphasis added). 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(4)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The FRHA argues that Quental\u2019s participation in Costa\u2019s informal hearing as a member of the grievance panel did not violate 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(4)(i), because \u201cthe decision under review\u201d was not \u201cmade\u201d or \u201capproved\u201d by her at the earlier informal settlement conference that she conducted. There is no claim that Quental \u201cmade\u201d the decision to terminate Costa at the informal settlement conference; the issue is only whether she \u201capproved\u201d it. The language used in the FRHA\u2019s grievance procedures to describe that proceeding provides some support for the position that the role of the settlement conference is not to review and approve or disapprove the initial decision to terminate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, the letter informing Costa of the date for her informal settlement conference describes the conference as a \u201cpreliminary appeal hearing,\u201d at which the hearing officer (Quental) would evaluate any records or witnesses in Costa\u2019s favor and either \u201crule[] in favor of the participant\u201d or \u201crule[] in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>[FRHA].\u201d And in the affidavit submitted to the Housing Court in support of the FRHA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, an FRHA employee described Costa\u2019s settlement conference as \u201can informal hearing before Theresa Quental, Hearing Officer,\u201d at which Quen-tal \u201caffirmed the [FRHA\u2019s] decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Thus, by the FRHA\u2019s own descriptions of the informal settlement conference in this particular case, it seems clear that Quental was \u201capproving\u201d the FRHA\u2019s decision to terminate Costa; we see no meaningful distinction between \u201cruling in favor of\u201d and \u201caffirming\u201d (the language used by the FRHA), on the one hand, and \u201capproving\u201d (the language of the HUD regulation) on the other. Accordingly, given her role as a person who \u201capproved\u201d the termination decision, we conclude that Quental\u2019s participation thereafter in the grievance panel violated 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 555(e)(4)(i).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">(ii) <em>Opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. </em>The judge ruled that the FRHA denied Costa the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and violated her right to procedural due process by relying solely on hearsay in documents in reaching its decision. The Appeals Court agreed and perhaps went further; its opinion can be read to preclude the use of any hearsay evidence in termination appeal hearings. <em>Costa, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 281. The FRHA argues that it did not rely solely on hearsay, and that its procedure complied with the mandates both of HUD regulations and of due process. As discussed in the paragraphs that follow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>we conclude that (1) the FRHA\u2019s decision appeared to rest on hearsay evidence; (2) neither HUD regulations nor the due process clause bars the FRHA from basing its decision in whole or in part on hearsay evidence so long as the evidence is reliable; and (3) some of the hearsay on which the grievance panel rested its decision in this case was not sufficiently reliable to provide permissible evidentiary support for that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The FRHA first argues that the judge inaccurately characterized the grievance panel as relying exclusively on the police report and newspaper article, inasmuch as the grievance panel also had before it Costa\u2019s testimony, which, it contends, corroborated many details. While it is true that Costa testified that she agreed to provide \u201cdominatrix\u201d services in exchange for a fee,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> she did not corroborate any of the essential facts supporting the grievance panel\u2019s conclusion that she herself committed \u201ccriminal activity.\u201d In particular, the allegations that Costa agreed to trade sex for money and engaged in prostitution, and had been charged with criminal offenses, are found only in the police report and newspaper article. Therefore, if the panel\u2019s determination is to be sustained, it must be on the basis of those two exhibits alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The next question is whether HUD\u2019s regulations permit or preclude the use of hearsay evidence. Hearing procedures are governed by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e), and the issue of evidence is addressed specifically in \u00a7 982.555(e)(5), which states: \u201cThe PHA and the family must be given the opportunity to present evidence, and may question any witnesses. Evidence may be considered without regard to admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings.\u201d We can discern nothing in \u00a7 982.555(e)(5) that precludes or even addresses the use of hearsay evidence; the clear import of the regulation\u2019s first sentence is that the PHA and the recipient have a right to \u201cquestion\u201d only those persons who actually appear and testify as \u201cwitnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, we read the regulation\u2019s specific reference to the inapplicability of formal rules of evidence as support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>for the conclusion that there is no categorical prohibition of hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Moving beyond the HUD regulation, the judge ruled that the FRHA\u2019s \u201cexclusive reliance on hearsay violated [Costa\u2019s constitutional] due process rights because it deprived her of her right to cross-examine the witnesses upon whom [it] relied in making [its] decision to terminate her assistance.\u201d The judge\u2019s conclusion ultimately rested on her reading of <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 270 (1970). However, we do not read the <em>Goldberg </em>decision as a strict bar on hearsay evidence; as we have said in another context, \u201cthe due process clause does not place a per se prohibition on the use of hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 115 (1990) <em>(Durling). </em>\u201cUnlike the confrontation clause, due process demands that evidence be reliable in substance, not that its reliability be evaluated in \u2018a particular manner.\u2019 <em>[Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 61 (2004).] That the focus on reliability may not accommodate a simple, predictable, bright-line rule does not alter the fact that reliability, not cross-examination, is the \u2018due process touchstone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>441 Mass. 741, 747 n.9 (2004), quoting <em>Durling, supra </em>at 117 (discussing use of hearsay evidence in sexually dangerous person commitment proceeding).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">A determination of procedural due process requirements in a particular context calls for the balancing of (1) the private interest affected by the official action; (2) \u201cthe risk of an erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>deprivation of such interest through the procedure used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\u201d; and (3) the governmental interest, \u201cincluding the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>451 Mass. 399, 412 (2008), quoting <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">With respect to the private interest at stake, the right to public housing assistance is \u201cof great personal importance,\u201d but not \u201cfundamental,\u201d deriving from \u201cno deeper source than the State\u2019s undertaking to provide it.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258, 275 (1982). As for the risk of error arising from reliance on hearsay, the risk will vary widely with the nature of the hearsay. Reliance on hearsay that is anonymous, uncorroborated, or contradicted by other evidence will create particular risk of error. See <em>Merisme </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 475 (1989). See also <em>Kurdi </em>v. <em>Du-Page County Hous. Auth., </em>161 Ill. App. 3d 988, 993-994 (1987). On the other hand, reliance on hearsay from known, disinterested parties that is factually detailed, is given under penalty of law, or fits a recognized hearsay exception, will be relatively unlikely to result in error. See <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass, at 121; <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 526, 530 (1988). See also <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 402-403 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Finally, we consider the several public interests involved. The public has an interest in the enforcement, on a timely basis, of the \u201c[f]amily [obligations\u201d of Section 8 participants, which cover both threats to the public fisc and threats to public safety, see, e.g., 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551b), (d), (h), (k), (l), (m). Cf. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 115-116 (need to protect public from recidivist probationer). Particularly where both HUD and the FRHA lack the authority to subpoena witnesses, 55 Fed. Reg. 28,538, 28,541 (1990), a requirement that the FRHA proceed only with live testimony would often substantially delay or prevent enforcement. The public also has an interest in affordable administration of the Section 8 program, which, we are told, cannot serve anywhere near the number of persons who seek to participate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ment of live testimony and cross-examination could substantially raise the cost of administration. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. at 348; <em>Durling, supra </em>at 116 (\u201cthe Government\u2019s interest, and hence that of the public, in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources is a factor that must be weighed\u201d). On the other hand, additional procedure may bring a \u201cbenefit... to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just,\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, supra, </em>a consideration that potentially weighs in favor of excluding hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Balancing these factors leads to the conclusion that consistent with applicable due process requirements, hearsay evidence may form the basis of a PHA\u2019s decision to terminate Section 8 assistance so long as that evidence contains substantial indicia of reliability.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Gammons </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Dep \u2019t of Hous. &amp; Community Dev., 502 F. </em>Supp. 2d 161, 165-166, <em>S.C., </em>523 F. Supp. 2d 76, 85 (D. Mass. 2007) (dismissing due process challenge to Section 8 assistance termination decision based in part on hearsay statements of landlord). See also <em>Beauchamp </em>v. <em>de Abadia, </em>779 F.2d 773, 775-776 (1st Cir. 1985) (\u201cThe principle that hearsay evidence is admissible in administrative proceedings would be vitiated if a party could object to its admission on the ground that he was denied his [due process] right to cross-examination\u2019 \u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The question remains whether the hearsay evidence introduced at the grievance panel hearing was sufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for the panel\u2019s termination decision. As to the police report of Detective Huard, we conclude that it was. The police report offered a detailed factual account based on the personal observations of the detective, and it is a crime for a police officer to file a false report. G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 6A. See <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass, at 120-121.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Kurdi </em>v. <em>DuPage County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>Hous. Auth., </em>161 Ill. App. 3d at 993-994 (hearsay statements of anonymous persons who \u201cbelieved\u201d information stated was not reliable and could not be basis of decision). Cf. also <em>Basco </em>v. <em>Machin, </em>514 F.3d 1177, 1182-1183 (11th Cir. 2008) (questioning admissibility and use of police report based on second-level hearsay at Section 8 termination hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The newspaper article is a different matter. Much of the article clearly derives from the police report, and is cumulative even if it were properly admitted. However, the article persistently states that Costa had made an ongoing practice of offering sex for money at her home, a suggestion that relies on information supplied by an unidentified source and is not specifically stated in the police report. Thus, the article states that \u201c[police spokesman] DeMello said Detective Jay Huard got information that Costa lived at the address and was \u2018running a house of prostitution\u2019 at her home\u201d \u2014 a statement representing several levels of hearsay, with the final level anonymous.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The grievance panel could not properly base a decision to terminate assistance on this kind of unattributed, multi-level, and conclusory hearsay evidence. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>446 Mass. 54, 56, 57, 59 (2006) (at probation revocation hearing, named robbery victim\u2019s hearsay statement to police officer describing robbery incident and perpetrator sufficiently reliable where it was factually detailed, based on personal knowledge and direct observation, and made soon after events at issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The consequence of the improper consideration of the newspaper article turns on the weight the grievance panel might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>have placed on it as reflected in its decision. We therefore turn to the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">(iii) <em>Explanation of reasons for decision. </em>Under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(6), the grievance panel, as the entity that conducted the hearing, was required to \u201cissue a written decision, stating briefly the reasons for the decision.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As the words of the regulation make clear, the written decision must \u201creflect factual determinations relating to the individual circumstances of the family (based on a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing).\u201d <em>Carter, </em>450 Mass, at 636. See <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Auth., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 110-112 (2006) (\u201cthe hearing officer must hear evidence and find facts relating to \u2018all relevant circumstances\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>85 F.3d 146, 150 (4th Cir. 1996) (HUD regulations, designed to implement protections in <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>391 U.S. 254 [1970], require, inter alla, decision based on evidence, stating reasons for decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The grievance panel\u2019s decision stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201cAfter careful consideration of all presented at the hearing, the Grievance Panel voted unanimously in favor of the [FRHA] to terminate your [Section 8] subsidy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">\u201cThis determination is based on the following: the preponderance of evidence of criminal activity that includes \u2014 police report from the Fall River Police Department dated June 24, 2004 of your arrest and a newspaper article from the Fall River Herald News dated July 8, 2004.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The second quoted paragraph clearly represents the panel\u2019s statement of reasons, but the statement does not readily translate into the findings or \u201c[f]actual determinations\u201d required by \u00a7 982.555(e)(6); it simply lists the evidentiary sources on which the grievance panel relied. The first difficulty presented by this approach is that we cannot determine if the panel based its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>termination decision solely on the information in the police report concerning Costa\u2019s offer to engage in sex for a fee on June 24, 2004, and the reported results of the search made by the police of Costa\u2019s house; or whether it relied in whole or in part on the statement in the newspaper report that Costa was running \u201ca prostitution operation\u201d out of the rented premises \u2014 a statement that implies an established, ongoing enterprise. For reasons we have previously discussed, the former would be based on reliable evidence, but the latter would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The second difficulty concerns the grievance panel\u2019s statement that it based its decision on \u201cthe preponderance of evidence of criminal activity.\u201d A determination that a recipient has engaged in generic criminal activity by itself is not a sufficient reason for termination of assistance under the HUD regulations. Rather, the panel was obligated by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(6), to state, at least in brief form, its factual findings concerning the specific criminal activity Costa had engaged in, and then to indicate whether it found that such conduct \u201cthreatened] the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents and persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(1).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">There is a third difficulty with the panel\u2019s decision that in a sense underlies the second. As HUD states in its amicus brief, HUD regulations give PHAs discretion to determine which particular types of criminal activities within the three broad categories delineated in \u00a7 982.551(1) create cause for termination of assistance. See, e.g., 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 982.552(c)(1)(i), 982.553(b). See also 61 Fed. Reg. 47,380, 47,380 (1996) (impossible to define \u201ccriminal activity that threatens,\u201d because \u201cit turns on the facts in every given situation\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The regulations also vest discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>in PHAs to decide whether, in a particular case, even though the criminal conduct or activity at issue may \u201cthreaten\u201d and may be serious enough to warrant termination, there are mitigating facts that point in the other direction. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See also <em>Carter, </em>450 Mass, at 636; <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Auth., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. at 111-112. As we have indicated (see note 10, <em>supra), </em>we do not reach here the question whether prostitution is a type of criminal conduct that, as the FRHA suggests, constitutes a per se threat to the \u201chealth, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment\u201d of others living in the immediate vicinity, within the scope of \u00a7 982.551(1). However, we do not doubt that the FRHA or any PHA could exercise its discretion to make such a determination, at least in some circumstances. Cf. <em>Lowell Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>449 Mass. 34, 39-40 &amp; n.3 (2007), quoting <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 776, 780 (1998) (under G.

The significant point is that the grievance panel has discretion, both in determining the types of nonviolent crimes that might pose the requisite \u201cthreat\u201d to the immediate neighborhood, and in determining whether in a particular case, all the individual circumstances, considered together, warrant termination. We are not able to ascertain from its decision whether the grievance panel was aware of its discretion in these areas.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See <em>Carter, supra </em>at 636-637.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Clearly, the hearing on termination of Section 8 assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>can be, and is intended to be, informal, and the procedural requirements applicable to it are designed to be flexible. Nevertheless, \u201c[r]egardless of the statutory or regulatory scheme, and regardless whether the hearing is [formal] or informal, no reviewing court can determine whether a hearing officer has fulfilled his statutory or regulatory obligations in the absence of an adequate record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636-637 n.16. See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Council HRA, </em>686 N.W.2d 334, 338 (Minn. Ct.

We agree with the Appeals Court that these guilty pleas do not render moot Costa\u2019s claims of procedural unfairness in this case because, among other reasons, guilty pleas are not conclusive of the underlying facts, but evidence of them. See <em>Costa, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 282-283 &amp; nn. 10-12.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Also noted previously was the fact that in the Housing Court, Costa was awarded, in amounts stipulated by the parties, damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for emotional distress as well as attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The Appeals Court concluded that because the Housing Court judge had erred in accepting Costa\u2019s claim that HUD regulations do not permit termination of Section 8 assistance for criminal activity unless it qualified as violent or related to drugs, Costa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>could not qualify as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d with respect to this particular claim (set forth in the first count of Costa\u2019s complaint) for purposes of the award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and there must be a recalculation of the attorney\u2019s fee award. <em>Costa, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 284. Neither the FRHA nor the Attorney General addresses in the briefs before us the question of damages or of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Costa also does not argue the issue, although she does ask this court to \u201cmake an appropriate order for plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees for work performed in the trial court.\u201d In these circumstances, we express no opinion on the question whether the award of attorney\u2019s fees to Costa, who remains the prevailing party, should be recalculated; we leave this question for the Housing Court to consider on remand.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of the Housing Court is affirmed with respect to the second count of Costa\u2019s complaint, and reversed with respect to the first count of the complaint.

The comment and response, which deal with termination of tenancy rather than termination of assistance (see 66 Fed.

The FRHA responds that the crimes Costa was charged with committing are per se threats to others living nearby. Like the Appeals Court, we also do not decide the issue, because, as we discuss in part 2 (c) (iii), <em>infra, </em>the grievance panel\u2019s written statement of reasons in this case is insufficient to permit meaningful review. In particular, it does not indicate on what basis the grievance panel itself decided that Costa\u2019s criminal activity violated 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The Attorney General as intervener, argues, as to this and other of Costa\u2019s due process arguments, that they are waived because \u201c[t]here is no indication in the record\u201d that they were raised before the grievance panel. Costa\u2019s complaint states that she did ask Quental to recuse herself.

In any event, the absence of a signature would not seem to affect materially the reliability of the report, particularly where Costa would have had the ability to obtain, for comparison purposes, a copy of the report actually on file at the police department following her arrest, and also had the ability to present evidence challenging the report\u2019s accuracy \u2014 which she did, through her testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">As further examples, the article was titled, \u201cPolice close house of prostitution taking orders online,\u201d and began, \u201cPolice have cracked a prostitution operation that a woman allegedly ran out of her home to clients who made appointments over the Internet.\u201d There was no mention of use of the Internet to \u201crun\u201d a prostitution ring in the police report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Title 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(6) provides: \u201c(e) Hearing procedures . . .

See <em>Costa, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 283.
