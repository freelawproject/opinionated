Cheney, supra </em>at 569. The court vacated the dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings in the Superior Court. <em>Id. </em>at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In the present case, we must decide whether a Superior Court judge may dismiss an indictment in the interests of justice (over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection) after accepting a guilty plea and after the successful completion by the defendant of what the judge characterized as conditions of probation. We must also decide whether the form of disposition imposed by the judge, the filing of the indictment without a finding of guilt to be dismissed on compliance with conditions of probation, is consistent with the statutes and the rules of criminal procedure that govern such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We conclude that a Superior Court judge may dismiss a valid indictment, in certain circumstances, after accepting a guilty plea, by \u201ccontinuing the case without a finding,\u201d and imposing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>On January 9, 2002, an indictment was returned charging the defendant, Travis Powell, with unarmed burglary in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 15. On June 18, 2003, following a full plea colloquy, Powell pleaded guilty to the indictment. The judge accepted Powell\u2019s guilty plea, and in \u201cthe interests of justice,\u201d \u201cplac[ed] it on file\u201d without entering a guilty finding and imposed a three-year term of probation with conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge stated that if Powell complied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>all of the conditions of probation, \u201cit is anticipated that the court will dismiss the case\u201d in accordance with the procedure outlined in <em>Brandano, supra </em>at 337. The Commonwealth filed a motion for clarification on June 23, 2003, pointing out that although the June 18, 2003, docket entry stated that the case was \u201c[f]iled with no guilty finding entered,\u201d the judge\u2019s \u201cdisposition memorandum\u201d noted that \u201cthe interests of justice warranted] accepting the plea of guilty, [and] placing it on file.\u201d The judge ruled that the docket entry was correct. On July 7, 2003, the Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal from the judge\u2019s disposition of the indictment. The Commonwealth did not prosecute this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Six months later, in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cheney, </em>the Commonwealth filed motions for reconsideration and for the entry of a guilty finding and a sentencing hearing. On July 16, 2004, the Commonwealth\u2019s motions were denied.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Powell\u2019s probation was terminated on August 8, 2006, and he was discharged, having complied with all of its terms and conditions. The Commonwealth moved to vacate the termination of probation and discharge, and renewed its motion for the entry of a finding of guilt and the scheduling of a sentencing hearing. Powell filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and then a motion to compel dismissal and preclude objection by the Commonwealth on the ground that the Commonwealth waived its right to object to the dismissal by failing timely to pursue its right to appeal. After a hearing, a judge dismissed the indictment, ruling both that the remedy sought by the Commonwealth was unjust because Powell had completed the terms of his probation and the Commonwealth had not pursued earlier opportuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>ties to appeal from the disposition; and that the <em>Cheney </em>decision did not preclude the dismissal of the indictment because the judge had imposed the disposition after accepting the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, which the dismissal \u201cdoes not erase,\u201d and had not therefore interfered with the Commonwealth\u2019s judgment to prosecute the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyles, </em>423 Mass. 717, 719 (1996) (prosecutor has \u201cbroad discretion in deciding whether to prosecute a case\u201d). The Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal on March 1, 2007, and we allowed Powell\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In <em>Brandano, supra </em>at 334-335, the court distinguished the authority of a judge to dismiss an otherwise valid criminal charge (in the interests of justice) prior to a trial or guilty plea, from the authority to dismiss such a charge after a trial or a guilty plea. The court explained that in the former circumstance the effect of the judge\u2019s action is that of \u201cquashing or entering a <em>nolle prosequi,\u201d id. </em>at 335, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bressant, </em>126 Mass. 246, 247 (1879), a power reserved for the executive branch, while the latter \u201cinvolves no interference with the proper function of prosecuting officials.\u201d <em>Brandano, supra. </em>The authority for the former it described as constitutionally questionable, and the latter, as \u201cwell established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Bran-dano </em>court went on to delineate an adversary, evidentiary procedure that it believed would satisfy the constitutional question of dismissal prior to a trial or guilty plea, although it explicitly did not decide \u201cthe ultimate question of [its] constitutionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In <em>Cheney, supra </em>at 568, 574, we confronted the constitutional question and essentially disagreed that such a procedure was adequate in the face of the requirements of art. 30 that the judiciary \u201cshall never exercise the . . . executive powers.\u201d The circumstances we confront in the present case are different. The disposition of a criminal case after a trial or a guilty plea by a dismissal contingent on conditions does not constitute the improper entry of a nolle prosequi, and does not infringe on the powers of the executive branch, at least where the disposition imposed by the judge is one that is recognized by the Legislature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyles, supra </em>at 723 (upholding Legislature\u2019s enactment of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, which permits disposition of continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ance without a finding [CWOF] and dismissal after guilty plea, against separation of powers challenge by Commonwealth).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">As we have noted in prior decisions, the Legislature has, by enacting G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, provided a statutory procedure available in the District, Juvenile, and Boston Municipal Courts for the disposition of criminal cases by means of a CWOF, the imposition of conditions, and dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In those courts, this statutory procedure replaced the practice of CWOF dispositions that followed in the wake of <em>Brandano.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The procedure requires that the defendant tender a plea of guilty (or admit to sufficient facts) as a precondition to such a disposition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>did not make G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, applicable to criminal proceedings in the Superior Court, we do not infer that it intended to bar the imposition of such dispositions in cases pending there, unless otherwise prohibited by law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, the Legislature has delineated expressly crimes, over which neither the District Court nor the Boston Municipal Court has jurisdiction, where such dispositions may not be utilized.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Legislature has thus acknowledged that the disposition of \u201ccontinued without a finding\u201d remains available in the Superior Court for those offenses that do not prohibit such dispositions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Simmons, </em>448 Mass. 687, 694 (2007) (although practice of placing cases \u201con file\u201d with guilty finding is not specifically authorized in General Laws, it enjoys strong legislative recognition where Legislature has delineated crimes \u201cwhere the case may not be placed on file\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A recent amendment to the sentencing provisions of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (failure to register as sex offender), is illustrative. Under \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(2), a second and subsequent conviction can only be disposed of in the Superior Court. Prior to 2006, the statute provided that certain prosecutions commenced thereunder \u201cshall neither be continued without a finding nor placed on file.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (c), as appearing in St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2. In 2006, the statute was amended in several respects. The amendments eliminated the section prohibiting prosecutions from being continued without a finding, St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7 5, and enhanced the penalty for a \u201csecond and subsequent conviction\u201d by adding a further \u201csentence of community parole supervision for life [to] commence immediately upon the expiration of [a prison sentence, probation, parole or] a continuance without a finding,\u201d St. 2006, c. 139, \u00a7 27; thus, plainly anticipating that a CWOF disposition could be imposed by a Superior Court judge in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The procedure used in this case does not present the concern that we expressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tim T., </em>437 Mass. 592, 596-597 (2002), about unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth. In that case, we held that a judge in the juvenile session of the District Court could not dispose of a case over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection by imposing a term of probation under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, without first complying with G. L. c. 278, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u00a7 18, which requires a guilty plea or admission to sufficient facts. <em>Id. </em>at 594-595. We emphasized that \u201cin the event the probationary terms were violated, the only recourse would be to return the case to the trial calendar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596. In such circumstances, the Commonwealth would then \u201cface the task of prosecuting a stale case, with all the difficulties that plague such a delayed trial \u2014 disintegrating evidence, fading memories, inability to locate crucial witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted that a \u201ccontinuance without a finding under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, eliminates this prejudice by obtaining, in advance of the continuance, the defendant\u2019s admission, so that any violation of the probationary terms may lead directly to an adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This concern applies with equal force to cases disposed of in the Superior Court. The Superior Court judge in this case, however, avoided the problem of unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth by accepting a guilty plea from Powell before placing him on probation. \u201c[A]ny violation of the probationary terms [would] lead directly to an adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence,\u201d <em>id., </em>thereby eliminating the problem that we identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Accordingly, unless the statutory language of the charged offense prohibits it, the dismissal of an indictment in the interests of justice after a guilty plea and after the satisfaction of conditions remains a viable disposition in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For reasons of practicality and fairness, the Commonwealth should be permitted to exercise its right of appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, and Mass. R. Crim. P. 15, as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), at the time the judge disposes of the case as if it were an appeal from a dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>This case was initially disposed of on June 18, 2003. At that time, the judge made written findings as to why the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d warranted a disposition with no finding of guilt. She did so after conducting an adversary proceeding. In her \u201cdisposition memorandum,\u201d the judge noted that Powell\u2019s \u201clife was in turmoil for several years\u201d at the time this offense occurred; that Powell\u2019s father, with whom he shared a close relationship, moved to Georgia and his parents separated and divorced; that Powell was devastated by this change in family circumstances; and that as a result his school work and personal life suffered, and he began using alcohol. She also noted that after Powell\u2019s arrest, he \u201cturned himself around\u201d with the help of his parents and the Franklin High School community; conformed to parental and school rules; and disassociated himself from old companions and achieved academic success. The judge referenced a letter written by the assistant principal of Franklin High School in June, 2002, confirming that Powell had transformed. She further noted that after graduating high school in 2002, Powell moved in with his father in Georgia and began attending college; that his freshman year transcript reflected a grade point average of 3.0 for the fall semester, and he earned grades of B and A during the spring semester; that he was employed during the summer of 2003 and planned to return to college in the fall. The judge considered a statement by the victims in the case, but also took into consideration that during the incident no one was hurt, Powell made no threats, the victims never saw Powell, no physical damage was done to the home, and no weapon was seen or used. This memorandum provides a sufficient basis on which an appellate court can conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion by ruling that the interests of public justice warranted a dismissal of the indictment after a period of time and contingent on the compliance with conditions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyles, </em>423 Mass. 717, 723-724 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Nevertheless, the Superior Court judge in this case did not label her disposition a \u201ccontinuance without a finding.\u201d The docket indicates that Powell \u201cplead[ed] guilty,\u201d but it also states that the indictment was \u201c[f]iled with no guilty finding entered.\u201d Placing an indictment on file without the consent of the Commonwealth, however, is inconsistent with our long-established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>practice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>448 Mass. 687, 693-694 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowdican\u2019s Bail, </em>115 Mass. 133, 136 (1874) (describing \u201ccommon practice\u201d of laying indictments on file \u201cwith the consent of the defendant and of the attorney for the Commonwealth\u201d). See also G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 70B (requiring written statement of reasons prior to filing case \u201con motion of a district attorney or assistant district attorney\u201d); Fisher, Plea Bargaining\u2019s Triumph, 109 Yale L.J. 857, 936-965 (2000) (concluding practice of placing cases \u201con file\u201d in Massachusetts was used by prosecutors, since its origin, as form of plea bargaining that served as predecessor to modem probation). Moreover, consistent with its historical origins, the purpose of placing a case \u201con file\u201d is to suspend sentencing indefinitely, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, supra </em>at 688, 693, not to prevent a guilty finding from entering on the record. The purpose of the disposition imposed in this case was clearly to protect Powell\u2019s criminal record by avoiding the entry of a guilty finding in the event that he complied with the conditions outlined by the judge. The judge\u2019s disposition here was essentially a \u201ccontinuance without a finding\u201d because the judge declined to enter a guilty finding, and delayed the anticipated dismissal of the case, which was conditioned on Powell\u2019s compliance with specific terms and conditions of what the judge characterized as probation. Cf. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18 (statutory procedure for case to be \u201ccontinued without a finding\u201d in Juvenile Court, Boston Municipal Court, or District Court); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. 834, 837-838 (1982) (describing practice of \u201ccontinuing without a finding\u201d in District Court before it was codified in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, in 1992; see note 8, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">As a result, the case must be remanded to the Superior Court to correct the docket entry, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sebastian S., </em>444 Mass. 306, 312 (2005) (\u201cuniformity, accuracy, and consistency in the description of dispositions is of systemic importance\u201d),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to reflect that the indictment was continued without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>finding of guilt, after a guilty plea, with conditions, and then dismissed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The case is remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\">In a \u201cdisposition memorandum\u201d prepared by the judge on June 18, 2003, the following conditions were imposed on Travis Powell: monthly reporting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>probation by telephone and twice yearly in person, abstaining from alcohol and drugs (except those prescribed by a physician), remaining in school, paying all applicable probation and court fees, and refraining from violating any law. During the June 18, 2003, plea hearing, the judge also stated that Travis Powell was to keep his address and telephone number current with the probation department, and that the probation department was to run a monthly Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) check.

Such request may include any disposition or dispositional terms within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, including, unless otherwise prohibited by law, a dispositional request that a guilty finding not be entered, but rather the case be continued without a finding to a specific date thereupon to be dismissed, such continuance conditioned upon compliance with specific terms and conditions or that the defendant be placed on probation pursuant to the provisions of [G.

The benefit to a defendant is obvious: he may be able to avoid a trial and \u2018earn\u2019 a dismissal of the indictment or complaint, thereby avoiding the consequences of having a criminal conviction on his record. These advantages would be especially appealing to a first offender or a defendant whose job security or family situation might be threatened by a conviction. The Commonwealth avoids the more time-consuming process of trial and sentencing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. 834, 843 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The use of such dispositions, over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, in cases pending before the Superior Court (which disposes of the most serious criminal matters), ought to be issued sparingly. In such cases, the judge\u2019s reasons should be, as here, fully explained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sebastian S., </em>444 Mass. 306, 307 (2005), we concluded that there was \u201cno legally cognizable disposition of \u2018pretrial probation\u2019 after an \u2018admission to sufficient facts\u2019 distinct from a \u2018continufance] without a finding\u2019 conditioned on probation, a disposition authorized by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18,\u201d and remanded the cases for the correction of the dockets to reflect the lawful sentences of \u201c \u2018continuance without a finding\u2019 conditioned on probation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Given our resolution of this case, we need not reach Powell\u2019s contention that because he was discharged after successfully completing his probationary term, due process and fundamental fairness dictate that he cannot be compelled to withdraw his guilty plea and either plead guilty to a lesser offense and be sentenced again or to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
