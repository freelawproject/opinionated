Bendetson (Bendetson); CDE Revere, LLC (CDE); and Carson Revere, EEC (Carson), pursuant to G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>which allows a joint venturer in certain circumstances to dissolve unilaterally a joint venture without thereby causing a breach of the joint venture agreement. Such agreements have become known as \u201cat-will\u201d joint venture agreements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants refused to acknowledge BPR\u2019s notices as effectuating dissolution under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>prompting BPR to file a complaint in the Superior Court seeking a declaratory judgment that its notices had dissolved the joint ventures under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b),</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or, alternatively, decrees dissolving the joint ventures on equitable grounds under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) <em>(f).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendants counterclaimed that the notices of dissolution effectively dissolved the joint ventures in contravention of the joint venture agreements under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">A judge in the Superior Court resolved the liability phase on cross motions for partial summary judgment in two stages. He initially addressed whether the joint ventures were at will, and ruled that they were not at will because the joint venture agreements set forth the exclusive circumstances under which they could be dissolved. The judge further concluded that the notices operated to dissolve the joint ventures in contravention of the joint venture agreements. However, he expressly gave BPR leave to show that it was entitled to an order of equitable dissolution. After the parties conducted further discovery, he considered whether dissolution was appropriate on equitable grounds. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to the counts of BPR\u2019s complaint seeking decrees of dissolution on equitable grounds, which had the effect of reaffirming his earlier ruling that the joint ventures were dissolved in contravention of the joint venture agreements by BPR\u2019s notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Following a trial to determine the value of BPR\u2019s interest in the joint ventures as of the date of the dissolutions and the damages, if any, incurred by the defendants as a result of the dissolu-tions, an order issued awarding BPR $2,759,098, less the defea-sance fees associated with two mortgages on property belonging to the joint ventures; the costs of refinancing those mortgages; and postdissolution distributions made to BPR. BPR\u2019s request for prejudgment interest was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">BPR appealed, arguing that the joint ventures were at will, and even if they were not at will, the judge should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the joint ventures should have been dissolved on equitable grounds. It further argues that assuming the joint ventures were dissolved in contravention of the joint venture agreements, the judge erred in concluding that the defeasance fees and costs of refinancing resulted from the dissolution, and in denying BPR\u2019s request for prejudgment interest. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Considerable confusion has resulted from the fact that the liability phase of this case occurred in two stages of motions for partial summary judgment. As we explain <em>infra, </em>for purposes of this appeal, by abandoning certain positions, the parties implicitly have accepted the judge\u2019s determinative structure of the case, namely, that the joint ventures would be deemed dissolved by notice in contravention of the joint venture agreements unless BPR could prove it was entitled to equitable dissolution. More specifically, BPR has abandoned its claim that a notice purporting to dissolve an at-will joint venture is ineffective to dissolve a joint venture that is not at will. Similarly, the defendants have abandoned their claim that BPR is not entitled to equitable dissolution where the judge earlier ruled the agreements were dissolved by notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">For the reasons that follow, we agree with the judge that the joint ventures were not at will because the joint venture agreements set forth the circumstances under which the joint ventures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>could be dissolved. However, because we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists concerning the counts of BPR\u2019s complaint seeking decrees of dissolution of the joint ventures pursuant to G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) (f), we reverse the grant of partial summary judgment on those counts. We also address BPR\u2019s arguments concerning damages in the event that BPR does not succeed on its claim for equitable dissolution under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) (f), on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the following additional facts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> reserving details concerning damages for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Atlantic Corporation, Bendetson, Robert L. Buonato (Buon-ato), Herbert Carver, and C. Gerard Drucker entered into three joint venture agreements in 1980 and 1981.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The joint ventures were formed for purposes of acquiring, operating, and developing several parcels of real estate. Section 4 of all three agreements states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">\u201cTerm. This Agreement shall commence as of the date hereof and shall continue and not be dissolved or terminated except as hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Section 11 of each agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">\u201cThis Joint Venture shall terminate upon the first to occur of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-10\">\u201c1. Upon notice of any non-defaulting Member, if any other Member shall fail to perform his or its obligations hereunder and such default shall continue uncured for a period of at least sixty (60) days after written notice thereof from the party claiming such default; the party desiring to terminate under this provision shall, after the expiration of the sixty (60) day period, give one (1) month\u2019s written notice of his or its intention to terminate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>\u201c2. Upon the conveyance of all the real estate comprising the Property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-5\">\u201c3. At the option of any Member not in default within a reasonable time after notice that any other Member shall have had filed by or against him pursuant to a statute of the United States or of any statute, a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a portion of such other party\u2019s assets and such other party fails within sixty (60) days to secure a discharge thereof, or if such other party shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or petition for or voluntarily enter into an arrangement for the benefit of creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">\u201c4. By mutual agreement of all of the Members.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The agreements further provide that Bendetson\u2019s company, Diversified Funding, Incorporated (Diversified), would manage the properties of the joint ventures.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Buonato\u2019s interests subsequently were assigned to BPR, the vehicle through which Buonato, his wife, Barbara Buonato, and their son, Robert, participate in the joint ventures. Drucker\u2019s interests, including his one-half share of Atlantic Corporation\u2019s interest, were transferred to CDE. Carver\u2019s interests, including Atlantic Corporation\u2019s other half-share, were transferred to Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">In the late 1990\u2019s, relations between Buonato and Bendetson began to sour. In or around 1997, Buonato found it increasingly difficult to obtain information about the properties from Bendet-son directly and resented being referred to Bendetson\u2019s chief financial officer, Garry Cuneo, for such information. Buonato also became concerned that Diversified was letting at least one of the properties \u201cslide into a slum,\u201d observing that the hallways, elevator, and grounds were in unsatisfactory condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">In or around October, 1999, Buonato and his wife expressed their dissatisfaction with Bendetson to Drucker. In addition to their concerns about Bendetson\u2019s management of the joint venture property, they were upset that Bendetson had ignored their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>requests to pay off a loan made by Bendetson\u2019s father to a Buonato-Bendetson real property endeavor unaffiliated with the joint ventures. The interest on the loan was eighteen per cent and yielded a $750 monthly interest payment to Bendetson\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">In or around March, 2000, Buonato learned that $300,000 had been transferred from the joint ventures\u2019 account to Bendet-son\u2019s personal account.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Bendetson subsequently replaced the $300,000, and later explained that Cuneo had transferred the money without Bendetson\u2019s knowledge. Carver and Drucker were satisfied with Bendetson\u2019s explanation and replacement of the funds, but Buonato was not. Buonato suspected that Bendet-son had misappropriated the money from the joint ventures, and had worked out some sort of deal with Carver and Drucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">A meeting between the joint venturers was scheduled for August 16, 2000. Bendetson suggested that the Buonatos (on behalf of BPR), Carver, and Drucker submit questions for him before the meeting so he could prepare for the meeting. Buonato sent Bendetson a number of questions primarily concerned with the finances of the joint ventures. A couple of weeks before the meeting, Drucker drafted and circulated an agenda to all the joint venturers, which incorporated many of Buonato\u2019s questions and concerns. The meeting was not successful. Bendetson began the meeting by reading from a prepared statement, which angered Buonato who apparently expected Bendetson to answer the questions he had sent to him beforehand. When Bendetson declined to answer Buonato\u2019s questions, Buonato got out of his chair and began to yell at Bendetson. Drucker attributed Buonato\u2019s conduct to \u201ca history and a litany of things that have built up to that day,\u201d and later admitted that it was fair to say that Buonato and Bendetson could not stand one another and that the relationship had been damaged beyond repair.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">By December, 2003, at least four other real estate endeavors involving the Buonato family and Bendetson had also deteriorated and were the subject of litigation. Buonato was particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>upset about a lawsuit Bendetson brought against his son, Robert, to recover excess distributions Robert had received from one of the real estate endeavors. The acrimony wrought by these litigations hardened Buonato\u2019s lack of trust in Bendetson, which spilled over into the joint ventures. Bendetson characterized the nature of communications between the Buonato family and himself from 2000 to 2003 as \u201c[s]trained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">On December 22, 2003, Buonato, as president of BPR, sent notices of dissolution of all three joint ventures to the defendants. As the ground for dissolution, these notices cited G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>which provides that a partnership may be dissolved at any partner\u2019s election if the agreement lacks a \u201cdefinite term\u201d or \u201cparticular undertaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">On January 13, 2004, BPR filed a complaint in the Superior Court, seeking, inter aha, a declaratory judgment that the notices dissolved the joint ventures under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>or alternatively, decrees of dissolution pursuant to G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) (f). The defendants answered, denying that dissolution was governed by G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>and counter-claimed that BPR\u2019s dissolution was in contravention of the agreements. On cross motions for partial summary judgment as to whether the joint ventures were at will, BPR and the defendants agreed that termination had not occurred under \u00a7 11 of the joint venture agreements, but disagreed as to whether the notices dissolved the joint ventures under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>or G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 11 were \u201csufficiently definite terms as to how the agreements are to be dissolved to make the agreements not at will.\u201d He concluded that BPR\u2019s notices dissolved the joint ventures in contravention of the joint venture agreements under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, he also indicated that he would consider giving BPR an opportunity to show that it was entitled to equitable dissolution under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) <em>(f).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>After the parties conducted further discovery, the judge considered the defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the counts of BPR\u2019s complaint seeking equitable dissolution of the joint ventures pursuant to G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) <em>(f). </em>See note 4, <em>supra. </em>BPR, citing the discord between BPR\u2019s members and Bendetson, opposed the motion. In April, .2006, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion, reasoning that Buonato\u2019s loss of confidence in Bendetson did not fall within any of the circumstances enumerated under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) (c)-(e), and thus did not fall under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) (f). The judge noted that the joint ventures had been highly profitable, that Buonato had seldom been involved in their day-to-day operation, and that neither CDE nor Carson had any expressed concern about Bendetson\u2019s management of the joint ventures\u2019 properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">After a trial to determine the value of BPR\u2019s interests in the joint ventures and the damages suffered by the defendants as a result of the dissolutions, the judge, using the going concern method, see <em>Anastos </em>v. <em>Sable, </em>443 Mass. 146, 149 (2004), found that BPR\u2019s interest was worth $2,759,098. He also found that, if the defendants refinanced two mortgages on two properties to raise money to buy BPR\u2019s interests, the defendants would incur damages in the form of defeasance fees and other costs associated with refinancing, and would be entitled to deduct those costs from BPR\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge additionally ordered the deduction of any distributions made to BPR after December 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The defendants subsequently submitted an affidavit stating that the defeasance fees and refinancing costs totaled $352,103.72. That amount was later reduced to $311,843.40 to account for the savings inuring to the defendants as a result of refinancing. After deducting the refinancing costs, including the defeasance fees, and $548,313.47 in postdissolution profits distributed to BPR, judgment in the amount of $1,898,941.13 entered for BPR.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>(a) <em>Dissolution under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Although this case involves joint ventures, the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), codified at G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., \u201cis generally applicable to joint ventures by analogy, though it does not govern directly.\u201d <em>Doiron </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>401 Mass. 705, 707 n.2 (1988). The UPA \u201cis intended to be a type of \u2018form contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, </em>404 Mass. 419, 430 n.7 (1989). Consequently, parties may vary the provisions of the UPA, which generally supplies default terms. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>This case requires us to determine the extent to which \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 11 of the joint venture agreements varied the dissolution provisions set forth in G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Section 31 (l)-(5) enumerates the ways in which a partnership may be dissolved by actions of the partners themselves. See <em>Infusaid Corp. </em>v. <em>Intermedics Infusaid, Inc., </em>739 F.2d 661, 665-666 (1st Cir. 1984). Under this section, a partner causes dissolution \u201cby his \u2018express will ... at any time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 578, 591 (1975), quoting G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31. The consequences flowing from dissolution by express will depend on whether the dissolution occurred without violation, or in contravention, of the agreement. See G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7\u00a7 31 (l)-(2), 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">General Laws c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1), provides, in pertinent part, that dissolution is caused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-7\">\u201c(1) <em>Without violation of the agreement between the partners,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-8\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>By the termination of the definite term or particular undertaking specified in the agreement,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-9\"><em>\u201c(b) </em>By the express will of any partner when no definite term or particular undertaking is specified . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Section 31 (2) states that dissolution occurs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-11\"><em>\u201cIn contravention of the agreement between the partners, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>where the circumstances do not permit a dissolution under any other provision of this section, by the express will of any partner at any time ...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In addition to several other causes of dissolution not here relevant, see G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (3)-(5), dissolution also may be caused \u201c[b]y decree of court under section thirty-two.\u201d G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (6). In contrast to G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31, dissolution under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32, occurs on application by or for a partner to a court. See <em>Infusaid Corp. </em>v. <em>Intermedics Infusaid, Inc., supra </em>at 665. Under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32, a court may decree dissolution if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-6\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>A partner has been declared a lunatic in any judicial proceeding or is shown to be of unsound mind,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-7\"><em>\u201c(b) A </em>partner becomes in any other way incapable of performing his part of the partnership contract,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\"><em>\u201c(c) </em>A partner has been guilty of such conduct as tends to affect prejudicially the carrying on of the business,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\"><em>\u201c(d) A </em>partner wilfully or persistently commits a breach of the partnership agreement, or otherwise so conducts himself in matters relating to the partnership business that it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with him,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-10\"><em>\u201c(e) </em>The business of the partnership can only be carried on at a loss,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-11\"><em>\u201c(f) </em>Other circumstances render a dissolution equitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">If a partnership is \u201cat will,\u201d i.e., it lacks a \u201cdefinite term\u201d or \u201cparticular undertaking,\u201d G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>dissolution by express will occurs \u201c[w]ithout violation of the agreement between the partners,\u201d \u00a7 31 (1), and, unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise, the dissolving partner is entitled to compel liquidation of the partnership\u2019s assets to pay the partnership\u2019s debts and obtain a cash amount commensurate with the dissolving partner\u2019s interest. See G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 38 (1). If, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>however, a partnership is dissolved \u201cin contravention of the agreement between the partners,\u201d \u00a7 31 (2), then the dissolving partner is liable for any damages caused by dissolution, see G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 38 (2) (a) (II), and the remaining partners may elect to continue the partnership for the duration of the agreed-upon term or particular undertaking. See G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 38 (2) <em>(b). </em>In the case of a wrongful dissolution, the value of the dissolving partner\u2019s interest is determined according to the going concern method, see <em>Anastos </em>v. <em>Sable, supra </em>at 152, which may entitle the dissolving partner to less than the partner would have received had dissolution not occurred in contravention of the partnership agreement. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>(applying forty per cent minority shareholder discount to value of partnership\u2019s net assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The first question raised is whether the joint ventures were at will. If the agreements were at will, and if BPR\u2019s notices dissolved the joint ventures, then BPR was entitled to compel liquidation of the partnership\u2019s assets and a judgment. If, however, the agreements were not at will and the notices dissolved the joint ventures in violation of the joint venture agreements, then the remaining partners could elect to continue the joint ventures, BPR\u2019s interest properly was valued according to the going concern method, and BPR was liable for damages resulting from the dissolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">We conclude that the joint venture agreements were not at will. In its brief, BPR focuses on whether the joint venture agreements specify \u201cdefinite terms\u201d or \u201cparticular undertakings.\u201d G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1). However, analysis under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>is inapposite. The UPA applies only \u201cwhen there is either no partnership agreement governing the partnership\u2019s affairs, the agreement is silent on a particular point, or the agreement contains provisions contrary to law.\u201d <em>Creel </em>v. <em>Lilly, </em>354 Md. 77, 99 (1999). See <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, supra </em>at 430 n.7. Where an agreement addresses a particular issue, the terms of the agreement control, and the rights and obligations of the parties are determined by reference to principles of contract law. See <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Neptune Towers Assocs., </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 508 n.9 (2008) (\u201cCourts interpret partnership agreements in accordance with general contract principles\u2019\u2019); 2 A.R. Bromberg &amp; L.E. Ribstein, Partnership \u00a7 6.01 (c), at 6:6-6:7 n.4 (Supp. 2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>See also <em>Chokel </em>v. <em>Genzyme Corp., </em>449 Mass. 272, 278 (2007) (rights of shareholders arising under contract governed by principles of contract law and not by fiduciary principles that would otherwise apply). Thus, an agreement specifying the circumstances under which a partnership may be dissolved is not at will.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>In re Popkin &amp; Stern, </em>340 F.3d 709, 714 (8th Cir. 2003) (partnership agreement\u2019s dissolution terms supplanted Missouri UPA); <em>Dental Health Assocs. </em>v. <em>Zangeneh, </em>34 A.D.3d 622, 624 (N.Y. 2006) (partnership not dissolved under statute by noticing other partner of dissolution where noticing other partner was insufficient to dissolve partnership under partnership agreement); <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Straube, </em>273 Or. 720, 726-730 (1975) (filing lawsuit dissolved partnership in contravention of partnership agreement specifying circumstances under which partnership could be dissolved). See also <em>Cominos </em>v. <em>Kalkanes, </em>37 Wash. 2d 843, 848 (1951) (\u201cIt is always open to parties to provide in any agreement they may make, how and under what circumstances, their business relationship may be terminated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Here, \u00a7 11 of the joint venture agreements addresses dissolution; it specifies that dissolution may transpire in four circumstances, none of which had occurred here. When read in conjunction with \u00a7 4, which provides that dissolution may not occur except as provided by the joint venture agreement, \u00a7 11 demonstrates that the joint ventures are not at will. Therefore, G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>does not apply. See <em>In re Popkin &amp; Stern, </em>supra; <em>Dental Health Assocs. </em>v. <em>Zangeneh, supra; Hunter </em>v. <em>Straube, supra. </em>See also <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, supra </em>at 433 n.12.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, dissolution, if not warranted by G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) (f), occurred \u201c[i]n contravention of the agreement between the partners . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">As previously noted, in his ruling that the joint ventures were not at will and that they had all been dissolved by BPR\u2019s notices of dissolution dated December 22, 2003, the judge allowed BPR the opportunity to show it was entitled to equitable dissolution. The parties moved for clarification and reconsideration. The defendants sought clarification as to how there could be equitable dissolution when the judge found dissolution occurred by notice. The judge recognized the understandable confusion in his ruling, and he issued a written decision that emphasized his conclusion that \u201cthe three joint ventures were dissolved by BPR pursuant to G. L. c. 108A, [\u00a7] 31 (2), on December 22, 2003, in a manner that was in contravention of the joint venture agreements,\u201d but he stated he was giving BPR the opportunity to show, as alleged in its complaint, that it was entitled to equitable dissolution, basically nunc pro tune to December 21, 2003. He acknowledged he was proceeding in this manner because the different theories of dissolution that were raised in the case were not being presented to him at the same time, but rather in serial manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Thereafter BPR abandoned its argument that the December 22, 2003, notices of dissolution were expressly invoking the authority of \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b), </em>and that they could not effectuate dissolution under \u00a7 31 (2), as the judge found. See <em>Fischer </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>197 S.W.3d 98, 106 (Ky. 2006) (letter claiming to dissolve allegedly at-will partnership under statutory equivalent of \u00a7 31 [1] [b] ineffective to dissolve partnership that was not at will). In addition, the defendants do not argue, as they did below, that BPR\u2019s notices of dissolution dissolved the joint ventures when the defendants received the notices, obviating the possibility of equitable dissolution under \u00a7 32 (1) (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">(b) <em>Judicial dissolution under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) (f). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>BPR argues that even if the joint ventures were not at will, there exists a genuine issue of material fact requiring an eviden-tiary hearing to determine whether the deterioration in Buonato and Bendetson\u2019s relationship warranted dissolution under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) <em>(f),</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the judge erred by granting summary judgment on this issue to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">At the outset, we note that the defendants do not claim that \u00a7 4 of the joint venture agreements precludes recourse to dissolution under \u00a7 32 (1) (f). See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Isaacs, </em>448 F.2d 1202, 1206 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (partnership agreement specifying how partnership could be terminated did not foreclose possibility of dissolution under D.C.\u2019s equivalent to \u00a7 32); <em>Imperial Litho/Graphics </em>v. <em>M.J. Enters., </em>152 Ariz. 68, 76 (Ct. App. 1986) (same under Arizona law).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">We have not had occasion to consider when \u201c[o]ther circumstances render a dissolution equitable.\u201d \u00a7 32 (1) (f). However, in <em>Ferrick </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>320 Mass. 217, 222 (1946), we affirmed a decree of dissolution under \u00a7 32 (1) <em>(d): </em>\u201cThe conduct of [the defendant] had brought about a situation in which the business could no longer be carried on jointly in the manner contemplated by the articles of co-partnership. The other partners were not required to submit to [the defendant\u2019s] domination or to continue in an atmosphere of non-cooperation, suspicion, and distrust, even though [the plaintiff] was not actually dishonest, and even though substantial profits were being made.\u201d Many of the considerations rendering judicial dissolution of that partnership appropriate would apply to any case where dissension among partners seriously impairs the ability of the partners to conduct the partnership, see <em>Gerard </em>v. <em>Gateau, </em>84 Ill. 121, 124-125 (1876); <em>Fooks </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>120 Md. 436, 441 (1913); <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>40 Wis. 544, 547 (1876); and are applied by other courts in the context of statutory provisions similar to \u00a7 32 (1) (f).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Karber </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>v. <em>Karber, </em>145 Ariz. 293, 295 (Ct. App. 1984); <em>Mayhew </em>v. <em>McGlothlin, </em>269 Ky. 184, 186 (1937); <em>Tiger, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fisher Agro, Inc., </em>301 S.C. 229, 238-239 (1989); H.J. Alperin, Summary of Basic Law \u00a7 14.32, at 73 (2008). See also 48A C.J.S. Joint Ventures \u00a7 20, at 340-341 (2004). Neither a partner\u2019s curmudgeonly disposition, see <em>Gerard </em>v. <em>Gateau, supra </em>at 124, nor a simple difference of opinion in business judgment, see <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>328 Pa. 554, 561-562 (1938), normally will suffice to dissolve a partnership under \u00a7 32 (1) (f). Rather, \u00a7 32 (1) (f) requires that dissension among the partners be so serious, irreconcilable, and permanent that it would be inequitable to require them to continue as partners. H.J. Alperin, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 14.32, at 74. A non-exhaustive list of considerations relevant to an application for dissolution under \u00a7 32 (1) (f) includes: (1) the extent of the dissension<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; (2) the relative fault of the partners in creating and contributing to dissension<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>; (3) the profitability of the partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>notwithstanding partner dissension<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>; (4) the involvement of the partners in the day-to-day operations of the partnership<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>; and (5) whether dissolution would work a substantial financial detriment to the value of the partnership business.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to BPR, see <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hingham, </em>419 Mass. 535, 539 (1995), we conclude that the judge should have denied the defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the counts of BPR\u2019s complaint seeking equitable dissolution. In addition to the disputes concerning Bendetson and Buonato\u2019s other business dealings, there is evidence that the relationship between Bendet-son and Buonato had deteriorated to the point where they no longer could stand to be in a room with one another. By 2000, any confidence between them had been destroyed, and both desired to end their dealings with one another. Moreover, there was some evidence that Buonato monitored the condition of the joint venture properties and that Bendetson ignored Buonato\u2019s concerns about the maintenance and condition of the properties. Factors weighing against dissolution, including the financial success of the joint ventures and the fact that Carver and Dmcker also would suffer any consequences resulting from dissolution even though they do not appear to have contributed significantly, if at all, to the acrimony between Buonato and Bendetson, also should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>considered. The weight given to each factor and the balancing of the relative weight of each factor, however, should ordinarily be determined by a trier of fact. Given the breakdown in communication between Buonato and Bendetson, and Buonato\u2019s involvement in the affairs of the joint venture, we think a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether dissension between BPR\u2019s members and Bendetson justified dissolution of the joint ventures under \u00a7 32 (1) (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">(c) <em>Damages. </em>We address BPR\u2019s contentions concerning damages and prejudgment interest in the event that BPR does not prevail under \u00a7 32 (1) (/) on remand. The judge found that if the defendants elected to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s judgment by refinancing two mortgaged properties belonging to the joint ventures, de-feasance fees might be assessed against the joint ventures under the terms of the preexisting mortgages and the defendants would incur other costs related to refinancing. He made no specific findings concerning those expenses because they had not yet been incurred. The defendants\u2019 counsel subsequently submitted an affidavit from the mortgagee\u2019s attorney stating that the defeasance fees and refinancing costs totaled $352,103.72.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">On appeal BPR asserts that the judge erroneously ordered the deduction of the defeasance fees and costs of refinancing because the defendants voluntarily incurred those costs to satisfy the judgment. We disagree. A review of the mortgage documents<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>indicates that BPR\u2019s commencement of dissolution proceedings constituted a default on the mortgages, and thereby rendered the joint ventures hable for the payment of the balance of both mortgages and certain defeasance fees. See note 25, <em>supra. </em>To the extent BPR argues that the defaults could have gone unnoticed by the mortgagee had the defendants not refinanced the mortgages to satisfy the judgment, the simple fact is that dissolution of the joint ventures rendered the joint ventures liable for the balance of the mortgages as well as any defeasance fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">(d) <em>Prejudgment interest. </em>BPR\u2019s contention that the judge erred in not awarding it prejudgment interest lacks merit. In <em>Anastos </em>v. <em>Sable, </em>443 Mass. 146, 154 (2004), we held that nothing in G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 38 or \u00a7 42, \u201cprovides interest on the buyout amount for the partner who caused a wrongful dissolution and who thereby departs the partnership.\u201d The fact that the judge here ordered the deduction of postdissolution distributions received by BPR from BPR\u2019s judgment does not alter our conclusion that nothing in G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 38, entitles a partner who wrongfully dissolves a partnership to prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">BPR asserts that G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> authorizes an award of prejudgment interest. BPR has cited no authority for this proposition or otherwise argued that equitable circumstances warrant such an award. See, e.g., <em>Shulkin </em>v. <em>Shulkin, </em>301 Mass. 184, 186-187 (1938) (award of interest equitable where two partners withdrew twice as much from business\u2019s account as third partner). It has therefore waived the issue. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). In any event, we seriously doubt that an award of prejudgment interest is appropriate where a partner or joint venturer has wrongfully dissolved a partnership. Cf. <em>Marchand </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 611, 616 (1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>(equities not sufficiently compelling to warrant award of prejudgment interest to partner who breached partnership agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm so much of the judgment that ruled that BPR could not dissolve the joint ventures pursuant to G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(b). </em>We reverse so much of the judgment that dismissed the counts of BPR\u2019s complaint seeking decrees of dissolution under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) (f), and remand that issue for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The parties agree that the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), G.

L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) (c), or \u201c[b]y the expulsion of any partner from the business bona fide in accordance with such a power conferred by the agreement between the partners.\u201d G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 31 (1) <em>(d).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">In a number of cases, mostly involving oral partnership agreements, this court has held that the omission of a certain term of duration renders the partnership at will. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>350 Mass. 294, 298 (1966); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Bateman, </em>315 Mass. 113, 115 (1943); <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>131 Mass. 312, 313 (1881). However, none of the partnership agreements in those cases appears to have set forth the circumstances under which the partnership could be dissolved without breaching the partnership agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The cases relied on by BPR are inapplicable. In <em>Miami Subs Corp. </em>v. <em>Murray Family Trust, </em>142 N.H. 501 (1997), and <em>Girard Bank </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>460 Pa. 237 (1975), the agreements did not contain dissolution terms. <em>Tropeano </em>v. <em>Dorman, </em>441 F.3d 69 (1st Cir. 2006), also is distinguishable. There, the parties executed a partnership agreement for a thirty-year term in 1964. <em>Id. </em>at 70. The agreement was modified in 1987 to include a termination provision stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>that the partnership could \u201cbe terminated by a vote of not less than 60% interest of 100%\u201d and provided that, except as modified, the 1964 agreement was affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 71, 72. Nothing in the 1987 modification altered the thirty-year term. Therefore, the court reasoned, the partnership agreement, as modified by the termination provision, expired in 1994 and the partnership became an at-will endeavor thereafter. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 78. In contrast, the agreements in this case, which do not contain a definite term, specify the circumstances in which the agreements may be dissolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The defendants argue that BPR is estopped from asserting that conflict and discord warranted dissolution under \u00a7 32 (1) <em>(f) </em>because BPR asserted below that Buonato\u2019s \u201clost confidence\u201d in Bendetson made equitable dissolution appropriate. This contention lacks merit. Rather than making a bald assertion that he lacked confidence in Bendetson, Buonato\u2019s deposition testimony (which was before the judge at summary judgment) indicates that Buonato\u2019s lack of confidence in Bendetson originated in the discord and conflict between them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">BPR has not sought dissolution under \u00a7 32 (1) <em>(d), </em>based on any mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>feasance by Bendetson per se; instead, it essentially claims that the relationship between its members and Bendetson is so strained they can no longer continue as partners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b889-6\">See <em>Bertolla </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>774 So. 2d 497, 503 (Ala. 1999) (equitable dissolution proper where \u201c[e]very witness who was asked whether [partners] could continue in partnership with each other answered that they could not.

L. c. 108A, \u00a7 32 (1) <em>(f). </em>The court concludes that the judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing these counts was error because \u201ca genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether dissension between BPR\u2019s members and [Richard] Bendetson justified dissolution of the joint ventures under \u00a7 32 (1) (f).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 869. If these counts were not equitable in nature, I would agree that the existence of a genuine issue of material fact would require the denial of summary judgment. Where, as here, the defendants have moved for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs equitable claims, however, the analysis must differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">When a judge evaluates a claim for equitable relief, the judge does more than find the facts; he also must determine, based on those facts, whether equitable relief would be in the interests of justice. In considering a motion for summary judgment when material facts are in dispute, a judge appropriately may determine that, even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, he still would not conclude that equitable relief was warranted in light of the balance of equities. In such a case, summary judgment would be appropriate despite the existence of disputed material facts, because even were the case to be tried and the plaintiff to establish in his favor all the contested factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>issues, equitable relief still would be denied. Indeed, if the judge has already reached that conclusion on summary judgment, a trial would be a needless waste of time and effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">In the circumstances just described, a reviewing court would simply need to determine, based on the view of the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff, whether it was an abuse of discretion for the judge to have denied the equitable relief sought by the plaintiff. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>428 Mass. 555, 589 (1998), and cases cited. There is nothing in the court\u2019s decision to suggest that, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to BPR, it would have constituted an abuse of discretion for the judge to have denied BPR the equitable relief it sought on summary judgment. Granting BPR the benefit of all disputed facts, there continue to be key undisputed facts that would militate against BPR\u2019s claim for equitable relief: the joint ventures had been profitable, only one of the four equal participants had lost confidence in Bendetson\u2019s management of the joint ventures, and, perhaps most importantly, the commencement of dissolution proceedings constituted a default on the joint ventures\u2019 mortgages, triggering substantial defeasance fees and refinancing costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">I join in the court\u2019s decision to reverse the grant of summary judgment as to BPR\u2019s equitable claims only because it is not plain from the judge\u2019s decision that he considered the question of equitable relief in the factual light most favorable to BPR, and a remand to clarify this matter is not practicable in light of the judge\u2019s retirement from the bench. Without an explicit declaration by the judge that he viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and still concluded that equitable relief would not be just or warranted, it would be inappropriate for this court to conclude that the judge had applied that analytical approach in allowing summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
