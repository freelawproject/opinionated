L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69G and 69S, give the Energy Facilities Siting Board (board) the power to authorize an oil pipeline company to take land by eminent domain for a pipeline that is not \u201cnew,\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>question of first impression in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold, contrary to the decision of the board, that the statutory scheme allows the board to authorize a taking only in connection with the construction of new oil pipelines, not for pipelines already in existence, and does not authorize the board to do so in the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><em>Statutory framework. A </em>brief explanation of the relevant statutory provisions provides the necessary framework. The board is an independent agency established by the Legislature within the Department of Public Utilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H. \u201c[Its] governing mandate ... is to \u2018provide a reliable energy supply for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>448 Mass. 45, 47 (2006), quoting G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 69S, permits \u201c[a]ny company [to] petition the board for the right to exercise the power of eminent domain with respect to oil pipelines specified and contained in the proposed notice of intention submitted in accordance with [G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J,]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if such company is unable to reach agreement with the owners of land for acquisition of any necessary estate or interest in land.\u201d Following notice and a public hearing, \u201c[t]he board may . . . authorize the company to take by eminent domain under [G. L. c. 79] such lands necessary for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>construction of the oil pipeline as required in the public interest, convenience and necessity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The power to authorize a taking by eminent domain provided in \u00a7 69S applies \u201conly to oil pipelines which are [oil<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] facilities as defined in [G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69G].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 69G defines an \u201c[o]il facility,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cany new pipeline for the transportation of oil or refined oil products which is greater than one mile in length except restructuring, rebuilding, or relaying of existing pipelines of the same capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\"><em>Facts and proceedings. </em>The relevant facts are not in dispute. Since 1931, Mobil Pipe Line (Mobil) and its predecessors have owned and operated a common carrier pipeline transporting petroleum products from East Providence, Rhode Island, to Springfield. The present dispute concerns a 120-foot section of the pipeline that passes underneath a railroad bed in Oxford that the Providence and Worcester Railroad (P&amp;W) owns. From the time of the pipeline\u2019s construction, P&amp;W or its predecessors have leased an easement covering this 120-foot strip of land to Mobil or its predecessors, which has allowed for the pipeline\u2019s continued operation. The most recent such lease was entered into between Mobil and P&amp;W in 1977. The lease provided for an initial term of five years, renewable up to five times, each for an additional five-year term, at Mobil\u2019s option. Mobil exercised the last of its renewal options in 2002. The lease was not replaced, and the parties subsequently were unable to reach an agreement on the purchase of a permanent easement over the land that the pipeline occupies. P&amp;W made clear to Mobil its intent to treat Mobil as a trespasser \u2014 and to evict Mobil from P&amp;W\u2019s property \u2014 should the parties ultimately fail to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Shortly before the lease was to expire, Mobil petitioned the board, pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69S, for authorization to take an easement for its pipeline by eminent domain. Mobil also commenced an action in the Superior Court, requesting a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>injunction to prevent P&amp;W from evicting Mobil pending the board\u2019s eminent domain decision. A judge in the Superior Court granted Mobil\u2019s request for injunctive relief, but conditioned the entry of the injunction on Mobil\u2019s filing an application with the board either for an advisory opinion regarding the applicability of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69S, to its dispute with P&amp;W, or for a determination whether the board had jurisdiction over this section of the pipeline.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Mobil subsequently filed a petition for determination of jurisdiction with the board. See 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.08 (2002). The board granted P&amp;W leave to intervene in the proceedings, see 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.05(1) (2002), and P&amp;W filed an opposition to Mobil\u2019s petition for determination of jurisdiction, as well as a motion to dismiss Mobil\u2019s original petition for the exercise of eminent domain. Before considering Mobil\u2019s eminent domain petition and P&amp;W\u2019s corresponding motion to dismiss, the board decided to consider Mobil\u2019s petition for determination of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Both parties submitted arguments, which we discuss later in more detail. Briefly, P&amp;W maintained that the board had no power to authorize the condemnation of an easement because Mobil\u2019s pipeline was not \u201cnew,\u201d as P&amp;W claimed the statute requires. P&amp;W also argued that the board lacked the power to authorize a taking for a section of the pipeline less than one mile in length. Mobil contended that the statute gave the board the power to authorize the taking of land for \u201cexisting pipelines\u201d if they were to be \u201crestructur[ed], rebuil[t], or relay[edj,\u201d and claimed that its pipeline therefore qualified. Following a hearing, a \u201cpresiding officer\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> issued a tentative decision for board approval, agreeing with P&amp;W that the board lacked power to authorize a taking on Mobil\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Mobil submitted comments on the tentative decision, and subsequently another hearing was held before the full board. Follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ing deliberations, the board rejected the tentative decision and directed the presiding officer to prepare a new tentative decision upholding the board\u2019s authority. The hearing officer did so, and the board later voted to adopt this second tentative decision, with minor changes, as its final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In its final decision, the board<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> recognized \u201cthe ordinary meaning of the word \u2018new,\u2019 \u201d but concluded that \u201cthis does not resolve the controversy . . . because the words of a statute, will not be read literally if to do so would be inconsistent with the legislative intent.\u201d It rejected the notion that the Legislature had intentionally denied the board \u201cauthority to grant eminent domain for existing oil pipeline facilities.\u201d Rather, the board suggested that \u201cthe Legislature simply failed to consider th[e] issue but . . . plainly would have provided the [board] the power of eminent domain concerning existing oil facilities.\u201d The board concluded that the Legislature had enacted a \u201ccomprehensive scheme of legislation concerning the siting of energy facilities and the security of the [Commonwealth\u2019s] energy requirements in the future,\u201d and that \u201c[l]ogically this scheme should include [the power to authorize a taking by eminent domain for] both existing and new oil pipelines.\u201d The board decided that an interpretation of the statute that would prevent it from authorizing a taking to preserve an existing pipeline that is vital to the Commonwealth\u2019s energy supply would engender an \u201cabsurd result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">P&amp;W filed a petition for appeal from the board\u2019s final decision to a single justice of this court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, and G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. The single justice allowed Mobil\u2019s motion to intervene, and reserved and reported the case for consideration by the full court. We now reverse the board\u2019s decision for the reasons we shall discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Propriety of appeal. </em>Before considering the merits, we first must determine whether this appeal is properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>before us. Under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (which G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, incorporates by reference), an appeal is permitted only from a \u201cfinal decision, order or ruling\u201d of the board. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 780, 785-786 (1975). Although the board has styled its decision as \u201cfinal,\u201d finality is \u201cdetermined \u2018on the footing of its substance and not of its name.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>394 Mass. 671, 677 (1985), quoting <em>Check </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>280 Mass. 170, 176 (1932). A decision is \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of taking an immediate appeal if it completely adjudicates the rights of the parties, leaving nothing further to be decided. See <em>Pollack </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>372 Mass. 469, 475-476 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Here, the board has not yet decided whether it will authorize a taking of P&amp;W\u2019s property by eminent domain. It has decided only that it has the statutory authority to do so, if it determines (after a later hearing) that the taking is \u201crequired in the public interest, convenience and necessity.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69S. Such a decision is not \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of judicial review under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. P&amp;W\u2019s appeal is therefore premature. Nonetheless, we express our views on the question of law the parties have submitted to us because \u201cthe case has been fully briefed on the merits, . . . there is a public interest in obtaining a prompt answer to the question, and ... the answer ... is reasonably clear.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Guerrier, </em>390 Mass. 631, 632 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">2. <em>The board\u2019s eminent domain authority. </em>Our review of the board\u2019s decision, governed by both G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, and G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, is \u201climited, although not perfunctory.\u201d See <em>Stow Mun. Elec. Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>426 Mass. 341, 344 (1997), quoting <em>Wolf v. Department of Pub. Utils., </em>407 Mass. 363, 367 (1990). We uphold the board\u2019s decision unless \u201cit is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 412 (2001), quoting <em>Stow </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Mun.

L. c. 25, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The issue in this case is the proper interpretation of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69G and 69S. In general, we give \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to an agency\u2019s interpretation of those statutes which it is charged with enforcing. See <em>City Council of Agawam </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>437 Mass. 821, 828 (2002), citing <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). However, where the statute\u2019s meaning is clear and unambiguous, we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005). An incorrect interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency is not entitled to deference. See <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 847 (1990), citing <em>School Comm, of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>362 Mass. 417, 441 n.22 (1972), <em>S.C., </em>365 Mass. 215 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">It is well established that eminent domain statutes must be strictly construed because they concern the power to condemn land in derogation of private property rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Nantucket, </em>449 Mass. 499, 506 (2007), citing <em>Lajoie </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>214 Mass. 8, 9 (1913). See also A.L. Eno &amp; W.V. Hovey, Real Estate Law \u00a7 18.1, at 528 (4th ed. 2004), and cases cited. The power of eminent domain \u201cexists only in case the Legislature has delegated that power in express terms or by necessary implication; it is not to be inferred from vague and doubtful general phrases.\u201d <em>Trustees of Reservations </em>v. <em>Stockbridge, </em>348 Mass. 511, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>514 (1965), quoting <em>Comiskey </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>226 Mass. 210, 212 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Informed by these principles, we consider the statutory text itself, \u201cthe principal source of insight into Legislative purpose.\u201d <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>413 Mass. 482, 485 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>419 Mass. 1003 (1995), quoting <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 (1985). In interpreting the statute, we attempt to give effect and purpose to all of its words, for \u201c[b]arrenness of accomplishment is not lightly to be imputed to the legislative branch of the government.\u201d <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 760 (1985), quoting <em>Selectmen ofTopsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 309, 314 (1949). Where the statutory meaning is unambiguous we are constrained to follow it, unless \u201cfollowing the Legislature\u2019s literal command would lead to an absurd result, or one contrary to the Legislature\u2019s manifest intention.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">By its terms, \u00a7 69G\u2019s definition of \u201coil facilities]\u201d includes only \u201cnew\u201d pipelines. Thus, Mobil\u2019s pipeline, which was completed in 1931, cannot be an \u201coil facility,\u201d because it is not \u201cnew.\u201d The term \u201cnew\u201d is a familiar one, does not invite doubt, and requires no interpretation. It follows that the board is without power under \u00a7 69S to authorize the taking of an easement by eminent domain in this case. Our interpretation is well supported not only by the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cnew,\u201d but also by \u00a7 69S\u2019s limitation of the board\u2019s powers \u201cto oil pipelines <em>specified and contained in the proposed notice of intention </em>submitted in accordance with [\u00a7 69J]\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69S. Under \u00a7 69J, the board must approve an oil company\u2019s notice of intention before the construction of any \u201coil facility\u201d can commence. The notice of intention procedure is relevant only to \u201cnew\u201d oil pipelines. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J. This limitation of the board\u2019s powers to oil pipelines \u201cspecified and contained within a notice of intention\u201d makes no sense if the board may authorize takings for both existing and new oil pipelines. Accordingly, we conclude that eminent domain is available only in the latter circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The board believed that the foregoing interpretation of the statute would lead to an \u201cabsurd result,\u201d which should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>avoided. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 253. To illustrate its point, the board noted that, were Mobil to propose the construction of another pipeline along a different route, the board would have the power to authorize the taking by eminent domain of easements necessary for the new pipeline\u2019s construction. It could discern no reason why it should not also have the power to authorize a taking of P&amp;W\u2019s land in the present case to preserve an existing pipeline. Recognizing its statutory mandate to \u201cprovide a rehable energy supply for the [C]ommonwealth,\u201d see G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H, the board considered it illogical for the Legislature to grant it the power to authorize a taking only for new pipelines, when its mission would equally be facilitated by a grant of such power with respect to existing pipelines. It concluded that a denial of such power could not have been intended by the Legislature.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">However, we do not believe that the distinction \u00a7 69S has drawn between new and existing oil pipelines is so irrational that the Legislature could not have intended it. In drafting earlier statutes that authorize takings on behalf of gas and electric companies, the Legislature granted the power to take land for the maintenance and preservation of existing facilities as well as for the construction of new facilities. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 72 <em>(a) </em>(allowing Department of Public Utilities to \u201cauthorize an electric company ... to take by eminent domain under [G. L. c. 79] such lands . . . necessary for the construction and use or continued use as constructed ... [of electric transmission Unes]\u201d); G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 75C (allowing Department of Public Utilities to \u201cauthorize [petitioning] company to take by eminent domain under [G. L. c. 79] such lands or . . . easements . . . necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, alteration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>removal of [natural gas pipelines]\u201d). We assume that the Legislature was aware of these prior enactments when it drafted \u00a7 69S, see <em>Jancey </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Everett, </em>421 Mass. 482, 496 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 603 (1998), and that \u201c[h]ad the Legislature intended to [empower the board to authorize the taking of land for existing oil pipelines], it knew how to make its intent . . . clear.\u201d See <em>Lavecchia </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>441 Mass. 240, 246 (2004). We also presume that the Legislature was aware of our prior decisions, see <em>supra,. </em>standing for the proposition that statutes that authorize the taking of land by eminent domain are strictly construed. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>408 Mass. 1215, 1222 (1990). Therefore, we conclude that the Legislature made a choice to grant the board the power to authorize the exercise of eminent domain for \u201cnew\u201d oil pipelines. That choice is not irrational, and it is not our role to question the wisdom of this decision. See <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, 369 </em>Mass. 542, 547 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The language of \u00a7 69S provides the board with the power to authorize the taking of land only for \u201cnew\u201d oil pipelines. The board may act only on the basis of express or implied statutory authority. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., </em>414 Mass. 489, 493 (1993). Here, the Legislature has not delegated any such authority with respect to existing pipelines. The reasoning of the board\u2019s decision may be reduced to the proposition that it would have been desirable to have such power. Regardless of whether this belief is correct, it cannot justify the board in claiming power the Legislature did not grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Mobil offers additional arguments in favor of the board\u2019s decision, but we consider them similarly unconvincing. Mobil concedes that the portion of its pipeline at issue is not \u201cnew,\u201d but argues the pipeline is nevertheless an \u201coil facility\u201d under \u00a7 69G, for which the board may take an easement by eminent domain under \u00a7 69S. Relying on the so-called \u201cexcept\u201d clause of the definition, Mobil contends that the word \u201cexcept\u201d as used in the definition of oil facilities does not exclude existing pipelines, but creates an exception to the requirement that a pipeline be \u201cnew.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, Mobil maintains that the definition of \u201coil facility\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u00a7 69G includes not only \u201cnew\u201d pipelines, but also \u201cexisting pipelines of the same capacity\u201d that are \u201crestmctur[ed], rebuil[t], or relay[ed].\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[T]o apply the statute only to newly constructed pipelines,\u201d Mobil argues, would reduce the \u201cexcept\u201d clause to a redundancy, violating the \u201cfundamental principle!] of statutory construction\u201d that no part of a statute be interpreted as superfluous. See <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We are not persuaded. The most plausible purpose of this clause is to clarify that an existing pipeline that has been \u201crestructured], rebuil[t], or relay[ed]\u201d is not an \u201coil facility,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> even though it is \u201cnew\u201d in the sense that its components are fresh, \u201crenovated\u201d or \u201crecreated.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1522 (1993). We think the Legislature clearly intended \u201cnew,\u201d as used in \u00a7 69G, to mean \u201c[a] thing . . . not known [or] manufactured . . . before its advent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Legislature has provided the board with the power to authorize the taking of land for an oil pipeline only if it is \u201cnew.\u201d Mobil must therefore seek its remedy from the Legislature, for neither this court nor the board has the power to \u201cimply language in a statute if the Legislature has not provided it.\u201d <em>New England Power Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Amesbury, </em>389 Mass. 69, 74-75 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>Because G.

L. c. 164, \u00a7 69G.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The Department of Public Utilities became the Department of Telecommunications and Energy with the enactment of St. 1997, c. 164. General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 69G, was amended to reflect this change. St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 201. Subsequently, the Legislature changed the name of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy back to the Department of Public Utilities. See St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 54. However, G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69G, was not amended to reflect this subsequent change of name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The statute refers to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691. That section, however, governs the filing of long-range forecasts, not notices of intention. The parties agree, and we concur, that this reference is a scrivener\u2019s error, caused by the Legislature\u2019s failure to update all the statutory cross references when it enacted St. 1992, c. 141, \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 15, which moved the provisions governing the notice of intention from G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691, to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J. Thus, we read the statute as referring to \u00a7 69J, which specifies the procedure for filing a notice of intention with the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 69G, defines both \u201c[f]acilit[ies]\u201d and \u201c[o]il facilities].\u201d However, a \u201c[fjacility\u201d as defined in \u00a7 69G does not include oil pipelines, because it covers only structures associated with the generation, storage or transmission of electricity or natural gas. Because an \u201c[o]il facility\u201d is the only defined term that includes oil pipelines, we agree with the parties that G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69S, is restricted to \u201coil facilities\u201d as defined in \u00a7 69G.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">It is not necessary to address whether the board\u2019s power to authorize a taking in connection with an existing oil pipeline under \u00a7 69S is \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d The purpose of the judge\u2019s decision was preservation of the status quo pending the final resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute. The case has now been decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The presiding officer is essentially a hearing officer. See <em>980 </em>Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(2) (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Although the board filed a notice of appearance with the single justice, it did not submit a brief or participate in oral argument before the full court. On appeal, Mobil, as intervener, defends the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Because the presiding officer granted P&amp;W intervener status in the proceedings below, a decision which has not been challenged, P&amp;W may seek judicial review under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, as a \u201cparty in interest aggrieved by a decision of the board.\u2019\u2019 Cf. <em>Tofias </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 340, 346 &amp; n.9 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In a footnote to its brief, Mobil suggests that this court lacks jurisdiction to decide this appeal, because G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, limits the scope of our review to whether the board\u2019s decision is erroneous or an abuse of discretion under \u00a7\u00a7 69H-690, while this case concerns a question arising under \u00a7 69S. \u201cArguments relegated to a footnote do not rise to the level of appellate argument.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lydon, </em>413 Mass. 309, 317-318, citing Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Recognizing, however, that subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, it seems that, even if there were no jurisdiction under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, and G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, this court would have jurisdiction to grant relief in the nature of certiorari. See G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">For its part, Mobil suggests this well-settled proposition has been abrogated by <em>Kelo </em>v. <em>New London, </em>545 U.S. 469 (2005). This argument is without merit. The issue in <em>Kelo </em>concerned the authority of the States to take land for \u201cpublic use\u201d under the takings clause of the United States Constitution. See <em>id. </em>at 489-490. The question here, however, is not constitutional in nature, but one of statutory interpretation. <em>Kelo </em>does not mandate that we construe the statutory power to authorize a taking that the Legislature has delegated to the board to be coextensive with the permissible scope of eminent domain under the United States Constitution. See <em>id. </em>at 489.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Mobil makes a similar argument that the interpretation urged by P&amp;W, which we adopt today, is irrational. It contends that it could invoke the board\u2019s power to authorize the exercise of eminent domain under \u00a7 69S merely by replacing the 120-foot section of its pipeline passing under P&amp;W\u2019s property \u201cacross an immediately adjacent, but slightly different route, which would still cross P&amp;W\u2019s property.\u201d It argues that this result is too wasteful to have been intended. This reasoning misses the mark. Such actions would be tantamount to \u201crestructuring, rebuilding, or relaying\u201d of that portion of the pipeline. As explained more fully <em>infra, </em>engaging in these activities with respect to existing pipelines of the same capacity does not create an \u201coil facility\u201d for which the board may authorize the taking of land by eminent domain under \u00a7 69S. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69G.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Mobil made this same argument to the board. The board rejected it in its final decision as inconsistent with its cases and regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Mobil concedes that it has no present intention to rebuild the portion of the pipeline at issue in this case. However, it argues that the pipeline comes within the purported exception for \u201crebuil[t]\u201d existing pipelines because \u201cfrom time to time, the pipeline . . . obviously will need repair and replacement work, including in this 120-foot segment,\u201d and because it is willing to rebuild this segment of the pipeline if doing so is necessary to allow the board to exercise its condemnation power under \u00a7 69S.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Were we to accept the expansive interpretation of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause Mobil urges, see note 13, <em>supra, </em>it is difficult to imagine how any pipeline greater than one mile in length would not be an \u201coil facility,\u201d regardless of whether it were \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cexisting.\u201d That this reading of the clause renders the word \u201cnew\u201d virtually meaningless supplies an additional reason for rejecting Mobil\u2019s interpretation. See <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">We find additional support for this reading of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in the board\u2019s regulations implementing analogous statutory provisions for natural gas and electric \u201cfacilities\u201d under \u00a7 69G. Title 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.04(9) (1993) provides that certain activities involving the rebuilding or replacement of electrical facilities of similar capacity \u201care deemed not to constitute the construction of facilities subject to [the board\u2019s comprehensive review process].\u201d A similar regulation applies to the reconstruction of natural gas facilities. See 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.07(8) (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The interpretation we adopt today makes it unnecessary for us to decide whether the filing of a notice of intention is also a prerequisite under \u00a7 69S, or whether the board may authorize a taking under \u00a7\u00a7 69G and 69S for a portion of a pipeline that is less than one mile in length, even though the over-all length of the pipeline exceeds one mile. We therefore do not address either P&amp;W\u2019s or Mobil\u2019s arguments on these points.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
