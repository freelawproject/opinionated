The capital gains were reported on a Comcast affiliate\u2019s Federal tax return but were not reported on any Massachusetts corporate excise tax return. The commissioner sought the production of documents through an administrative summons pursuant to G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 70.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Comcast responded that some of the documents were protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>doctrine.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commissioner then filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking to compel production of the withheld documents. The commissioner\u2019s request was denied, the judge ruling that the documents at issue in this appeal were protected by the privilege and the work product doctrine. The commissioner moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration. Pursuant to a joint motion of the parties, final judgment entered in the Superior Court. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 58 (a), as amended, 371 Mass. 908 (1977). The commissioner appealed. We conclude that the documents are protected from disclosure by the work product doctrine. We affirm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>The audit examination of Comcast and its affiliates, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>by the Department of Revenue (department) was commenced in June, 2000, three years after the acquisition of Continental Cablevision, Inc. (Continental Cablevision), by US West, Inc. (US West), a predecessor to Comcast. That acquisition gave rise to an antitrust challenge by the United States Department of Justice. We describe briefly the antitrust action and the related corporate transactions before turning to the documents at the center of this litigation. The facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">a. <em>The stock sale. </em>In February, 1996, Colorado-based US West announced plans to purchase Continental Cablevision, a Massachusetts cable television company with headquarters in Boston. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Through a wholly owned subsidiary, Continental Teleport, Inc. (Continental Teleport), Continental Cablevision at the time owned 11.2 per cent of the stock of Teleport Communications Group, Inc. (TCG), a company that, like US West, was a local telecommunications services provider.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Continental Teleport, like its parent Continental Cablevision, was a Massachusetts corporation. The acquisition of Continental Cablevision by US West was completed on November 15, 1996, and Continental Cablevision was immediately merged into MediaOne Group, Inc. (Media-One), a wholly owned subsidiary of US West.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Meanwhile, on November 5, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust action against US West and Continental Cablevision, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18, 25, alleging that the acquisition would lessen competition in the market for dedicated telecommunications services. The Department of Justice, US West, and Continental Cablevision agreed to settle the antitrust claims, and on February 28, 1997, a final judgment entered whose terms required that, to preserve competition in the sale of dedicated communication services in certain markets, US West divest, on or before June 30, 1997, the portion of TCG stock necessary to reduce US West\u2019s ownership interest to less than ten per cent of the outstanding shares of TCG common stock, and to further divest all remaining interest in TCG on or before December 31, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">US West retained the investment firm Lehman Brothers Inc. to assist it with the required sale of the TCG stock. Because the stock sale was anticipated to have significant tax consequences for US West, Thomas Kennedy, executive director of US West\u2019s tax department, turned to Attorney Andrew E. Ottinger, Jr., at the time serving in US West\u2019s Colorado-based law department, for advice regarding options for structuring the stock sale. Ot-tinger was an experienced tax litigator, but was unfamiliar with Massachusetts tax law. Concerned that the Massachusetts Department of Revenue (department) would challenge, in Ottinger\u2019s words, \u201cthe appropriateness of the chosen vehicle\u201d for US West\u2019s sale of the TCG stock, Ottinger sought the advice of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Massachusetts-based partners of Arthur Andersen LLP (Andersen), in circumstances we shall later describe in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">After receiving advice from Andersen, US West caused the following transactions to occur. On February 11, 1997, a new entity, Continental Holding Company (Continental Holding), a Massachusetts corporate trust, G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8, was established by US West. That same day, Continental Teleport was dissolved, and its assets, including its then remaining TCG shares,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were simultaneously transferred to Continental Holding. US West subsequently divested itself of the TCG shares in four separate transactions, culminating with the largest sale on November 30, 1997.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Continental Holding reported a capital gain of $495,733,830 from the sale of the TCG shares on its December 31, 1997, Federal tax return. Claiming an exemption as a Massachusetts corporate trust under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8 (6), it did not file a Massachusetts corporate excise tax return for that same taxable period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Continental Holding was dissolved on February 12, 1999, two years after its creation, and its assets transferred to US West\u2019s successor.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>b. <em>Retention of Arthur Andersen LLP. </em>Prior to US West\u2019s disposition of the TCG stock, its in-house tax counsel Ottinger retained Andersen for advice. Because the circumstances of that retention are central to the legal issues, we recite them in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Ottinger graduated from law school in 1977 and joined the tax department of US West in 1986. In 1987, he transferred to US West\u2019s law department, where he served as State and local tax counsel until 2000, except for a brief period as regulatory counsel in 1995-1996. Ottinger initially became involved with US West\u2019s acquisition of Continental Cablevision while he was serving as regulatory counsel, but it was in his position as State and local tax counsel that he sought Andersen\u2019s advice regarding the impending sale of TCG stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">As State and local tax counsel, Ottinger was US West\u2019s attorney \u201cchiefly responsible\u201d for property tax, State income tax, and sales and use tax matters. He spent approximately forty per cent of his time working on tax-related litigation, handling one-half of those matters himself and retaining outside counsel for the remainder. In connection with his own cases, Ottinger regularly prepared assessments analyzing litigation risks for US West to evaluate the appropriateness of a tax determination. Because US West had, in Ottinger\u2019s words, a \u201csophisticated Tax Department,\u201d he rarely hired outside tax consultants to assist him, although he did so on occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">With respect to the particular matter at issue here \u2014 the sale of the TCG stock compelled by the antitrust consent decree \u2014 Ottinger understood the transaction to have significant tax consequences for US West. Accordingly, he explained, he examined \u201cplanning opportunities\u201d for the transaction himself, but turned to experienced \u201coutside consultants\u201d to help him \u201cinterpret Massachusetts law,\u201d because he himself lacked sufficient understanding of Massachusetts tax law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, Ottinger stated that he considered \u201cvarious ways to set up the transaction, to determine the best, legitimate vehicle by which to deal with the tax consequences from the sale of [TCG] shares, and to assess the risks of litigation associated with the different vehicles.\u201d Ottinger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ultimately retained Michael E. Porter, III, and Edward Gartland, two Massachusetts-based Andersen partners. Both had previously been employed by the department, Porter as a senior attorney at the department.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> During January and February, 1997, Ottinger spoke with Porter and Gartland on several occasions, to discuss the various options for US West to follow relating to the sale of TCG stock, and to assess the risks of and exposure to litigation for any \u201cvehicle\u201d considered. He asked the Andersen partners to prepare a memorandum discussing the \u201cpros and cons of the various planning opportunities and the attendant litigation risks,\u201d which they did. The Andersen memoranda (various drafts of the requested memorandum) are the documents in contention here.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Ottinger stated that he considered all of his communications with the Andersen partners to be attorney-client communications and attorney work product, and, accordingly, \u201ctook all necessary precautions\u201d to ensure that documents received from Andersen remained \u201cconfidential and privileged,\u201d including sending the documents to the segregated, locked files of US West\u2019s law department maintained for privileged documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">c. <em>The challenged documents. </em>Six of the documents withheld by Comcast are at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The six documents are different drafts and the final memorandum prepared by the Andersen partners at the request of Ottinger before the corporate reorganization took place.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Andersen memoranda, each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>addressed \u201cto file,\u201d and some sixteen pages long, single spaced, address the structuring of the required sale of TCG stock. The memoranda contain a detailed analysis of various corporate entities and address various options, and attendant litigation risks, for the TCG stock sale in light of applicable Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">2. <em>Prior proceedings, </em>a. <em>Audit and administrative summons. </em>The department commenced its audit in June, 2000. According to the commissioner, the issue relevant to this appeal is whether US West had what the commissioner terms \u201ca legitimate business purpose\u201d for reorganizing Continental Teleport as a Massachusetts corporate trust (i.e., as Continental Holding) at the time the sale of TCG stock that resulted in the substantial capital gains described above was being contemplated. The commissioner claims that, during the department\u2019s investigation, US West did not identify any independent economic or business purpose for the reorganization; she contends that disclosure of the Andersen memoranda will \u201creveal detailed information about why the transaction was structured as it was.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">During the first four years of the audit, the department issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>three information document requests, seeking information regarding Continental Teleport.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In response to these requests, Comcast produced certain records, which the commissioner deemed \u201cinsufficient.\u201d In May, 2004, the commissioner issued an administrative summons pursuant to G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 70, seeking the production of records relating to the sale of TCG stock, including records dealing with the reorganization of Continental Teleport into Continental Holding. Comcast again produced responsive documents, but withheld others, including the Andersen memo-randa, under claims of attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, all of which were listed in the privilege log prepared by Comcast. See note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">b. <em>Proceedings in the trial court. </em>In May, 2005, five years after the commencement of the audit, the commissioner filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking to compel production of all of the documents listed on the Comcast privilege log as well as unredacted versions of all redacted documents. After a nonevi-dentiary hearing and an in camera review of the documents, a judge in the Superior Court denied the commissioner\u2019s motion, holding, inter alla, that the Andersen memoranda were protected by the attorney-client privilege because they contained \u201ca detailed analysis of Massachusetts tax law\u201d and \u201cprovided in-house counsel with legal information critical to his ability to effectively represent his client.\u201d The judge also concluded that the Andersen memoranda were protected by the work product doctrine as \u201cprepared in anticipation of litigation.\u201d The judge later denied the commissioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration of so much of the order as related to the Andersen memoranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>We first address the standard of review of the judge\u2019s ruling on the commissioner\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The commissioner contends that our review is de nova where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the scope of the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine in a summons enforcement proceeding, as well as the interpretation of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 70, are questions of law. The commissioner also argues that because the evidence before the judge in the Superior Court comprised only affidavits and other documents, we may \u201cassess the evidence anew,\u201d quoting <em>Meschi </em>v. <em>Iverson, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 681-682 n.7 (2004). Comcast responds, that a more deferential standard of review is warranted. Citing <em>Matter of the Reorganization of Elec. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. Ltd. (Bermuda), </em>425 Mass. 419, 421 (1997) <em>(EM-LICO), </em>Comcast argues that decisions regarding the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine raise questions of fact reviewable for clear error. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>424 Mass. 109, 113 (1997) (\u201cexistence of the privilege and the applicability of any exception to the privilege is a question of fact for the judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In general, we uphold discovery rulings \u201cunless the appellant can demonstrate an abuse of discretion that resulted in prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 635, 653 (2003), citing <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., </em>399 Mass. 790, 799 (1987). Where the attorney-client privilege is concerned, however, our review is more textured. On appeal from any decision on a privilege claim, we review the trial judge\u2019s rulings on questions of law de novo.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We generally review a judge\u2019s fact findings, at least after a bench trial, for clear error. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). Where, as here, we are dealing with a motion to compel and the motion judge\u2019s findings are based solely on documentary evidence, we do not accord them any special deference. Cf. <em>Cavallaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir. 2002) (under Federal law findings of motion judge on documentary record reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>for clear error). We review discretionary judgments for abuse of discretion. See <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Investigation, </em>437 Mass. 340, 356 (2002) (evidentiary ruling where privilege at issue). Mixed questions of law and fact, such as whether there has been a waiver, generally receive de nova review. See 2 P.R. Rice, Attorney-Client Privilege in the United States \u00a7 11.36, at 234-236 &amp; nn. 43-46 (2d ed. 1999) (surveying Federal jurisprudence and concluding that appellate courts generally review mixed questions of law and fact de nova).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We turn now to the merits, and consider first whether the Andersen memoranda are protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">a. <em>Attorney-client privilege. </em>The classic formulation of the attorney-client privilege, which we indorse, is found in 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2292 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961): \u201c(1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.\u201d See <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. 444,448 (2007) (privilege protects \u201call confidential communications between a client and its attorney undertaken for the purpose of obtaining legal advice\u201d). See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 502 (a) &amp; (b), at 87-88 (2008-2009). The purpose of the privilege \u201cis to enable clients to make full disclosure .to legal counsel of all relevant facts . . . so that counsel may render fully informed legal advice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 449, with the goal of \u201cpromoting] broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., supra </em>at 448 quoting <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981). That important societal interest is, however, in tension \u201cwith society\u2019s need for full and complete disclosure\u201d in adversary proceedings. <em>Matter of a John Doe Grand Jury Investigation, </em>408 Mass. 480, 482 (1990), quoting <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em>723 F.2d 447, 451 (6th Cir. 1983), cert, denied, 467 U.S. 1246 (1984). In <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Rapo &amp; Jepsen Ins. Servs., Inc., </em>449 Mass. 609, 615-616 (2007), quoting <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, supra, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. 495, 502, cert, denied, 474 U.S. 906 (1985), we recently said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201cThe attorney-client privilege is so highly valued that, while it may appear \u2018to frustrate the investigative or fact-finding process . . . [and] create[] an inherent tension with society\u2019s need for full and complete disclosure of all relevant evidence during implementation of the judicial process,\u2019. . . it is acknowledged that the \u2018social good derived from the proper performance of the functions of lawyers acting for their clients . . . outweigh[s] the harm that may come from the suppression of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">While the tension is unquestionably resolved in favor of recognizing the privilege, we have consistently held that we construe the privilege narrowly, in part to protect the competing societal interest of the full disclosure of relevant evidence. See <em>EMLICO, supra </em>at 421 (attorney-client privilege \u201cordinarily strictly construed\u201d); <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Retardation (No. 1), </em>424 Mass. 430, 457 n.26 (1997) (\u201cWe must, however, construe the privilege narrowly\u201d). A narrow construction of the privilege is particularly appropriate where, as here, information is being withheld from the government in a tax enforcement proceeding. Cf. <em>Caval-laro </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 245, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>465 U.S. 805, 816 (1984) (\u201cthe doctrine of construing the privilege narrowly . . . has particular force in the context of IRS [Internal Revenue Service] investigations given the \u2018congressional policy choice in favor of disclosure of all information relevant to a legitimate IRS inquiry\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">As the party asserting the privilege, Comcast bears the burden of establishing that the attorney-client privilege applies to the Andersen memoranda, a burden that \u201cextends not only to a showing of the existence of the attorney-client relationship but to all other elements involved in the determination of the existence of the privilege, including: (1) the communications were received from a client during the course of the Ghent\u2019s search for legal advice from the attorney in his or her capacity as such; (2) the communications were made in confidence; and (3) the privilege as to these communications has not been waived.\u201d <em>EMLICO, supra </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The commissioner argues that Comcast has not met its burden for three reasons. First, she claims, Comcast submitted no proof that the Andersen memoranda contain confidential communications from the client (US West) to Ottinger. Second, she asserts, the Andersen memoranda do not fall within the \u201cderivative privilege\u201d recognized in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kovel, </em>296 F.2d 918 (2d Cir. 1961) <em>(Kovel). </em>Last, she argues, the Superior Court judge improperly expanded the privilege where a narrow construction is required because Comcast is resisting a statutory demand for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">As to the first point, the commissioner\u2019s argument appears to be based on an incorrect assertion that the privilege applies only where the underlying client information that is the subject of the communication is confidential in the sense that it is not public knowledge. Specifically, the commissioner argues that neither the requirement that US West sell Continental Cablevision\u2019s stake in TCG by the end of 1998 nor that US West was considering restructuring Continental Teleport were confidential. But information contained within a communication need not itself be confidential for the communication to be deemed privileged; rather the communication must be made in confidence \u2014 that is, with the expectation that the communication will not be divulged. See 2 P.R. Rice, Attorney-Client Privilege in the United States \u00a7 6.2, at 9-11 (2d ed. 1999), and cases cited (\u201cThe confidentiality that must be expected by the client relates to the client\u2019s <em>communication </em>with an attorney. ... It is not necessary that the <em>information </em>within the communication be confidential. The communication from the client to the attorney may contain nonconfidential information .... This is not relevant to the point of whether confidentiality can reasonably be expected in the <em>communications </em>that contain that information\u201d [emphases in original]); Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 71 (2000) (\u201cA communication is in confidence ... if, at the time and in the circumstances of the communication, the communicating person reasonably believes that no one will learn the contents of the communication except a privileged person ... or another person with whom communications are protected under a similar privilege\u201d); <em>id. </em>at comment b, at 544 (\u201cThe matter communicated need not itself be secret\u201d). Here there is no question that Ottinger intended to keep the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>munications confidential, and he took steps to ensure that they were. In addition, as Comcast points out, in order to address appropriately the issues that Ottinger had identified, including exposure to litigation, Andersen received from counsel more than the publicly known fact that US West was required to dispose of the TCG stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Second, the commissioner challenges the judge\u2019s conclusion that the Andersen memoranda fall within the so-called derivative attorney-client privilege. Disclosing attorney-client communications to a third party, including an accountant, generally undermines the privilege. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ackert, </em>169 F.3d 136, 139 (2d Cir. 1999) (\u201cthe attorney-client privilege generally applies only to communications between the attorney and the client\u201d). There are exceptions. In Judge Friendly\u2019s landmark opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recognized that the privilege can shield communications of a third party employed to facilitate communication between the attorney and client and thereby assist the attorney in rendering legal advice to the client. <em>Kovel, supra </em>at 921-922. The exception can apply to accountants. <em>Kovel, supra </em>at 922 (\u201cthe presence of an accountant. . . while the client is relating a complicated tax story to the lawyer, ought not destroy the privilege\u201d any more than would that of linguist who \u201ctranslates\u201d when client speaks language different from attorney). The reason, explained Judge Friendly, is because \u201cthe presence of the accountant is necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The privilege does not apply unless the communication with the accountant is made \u201cfor the purpose of [the client] obtaining legal advice from the lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf what is sought is not legal advice but only accounting service ... or if the advice sought is the accountant\u2019s rather than the lawyer\u2019s, no privilege exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Now known as the <em>Kovel </em>doctrine or the derivative attorney-client privilege, see, e.g., 1 Epstein, The Attorney-Client Privilege and the Work-Product Doctrine 217-218 (5th ed. 2007), the doctrine has deep roots in Massachusetts jurisprudence. See <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>12 Pick. 89, 93 (1831) (privilege extends to communications with agents of attorney who are \u201cnecessary to secure and facilitate the communication between attorney and client\u201d).

First, she asserts, the derivative privilege applies only where the accountant\u2019s services are necessary to \u201ctranslate\u201d or \u201cinterpret\u201d so that the attorney is able to understand the client\u2019s situation in order to provide the requested legal advice.

That was the logic of <em>Kovel, </em>and the weight of authority affirms its continuing vitality.

Indeed Comcast is forthright in acknowledging that Andersen was retained \u201cto provide [Ottinger] with information he needed to advise US West in its sale of the [TCG] stock.\u201d As Ottinger explained, he turned to the outside consultants who had experience in Massachusetts tax issues \u201cto help me interpret Massachusetts law.\u201d The Andersen memoranda reveal that an analysis of Massachusetts law is precisely what Ottinger received. We do not doubt, as the motion judge held, that the Andersen memoranda were \u201ccritical to [Ottinger\u2019s] ability to effectively represent his client.\u201d But we agree with those courts holding that the privilege does not apply where the accountant provides \u201cadditional legal advice about complying with the tax code even where doing so would assist the attorney in advising the client.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chevron Texaco Corp., supra </em>at 1072. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ackert, supra </em>at 139 (\u201ca communication between an attorney and a third party does not become shielded by the attorney-client privilege solely because the communication proves important to the attorney\u2019s ability to represent the client\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ackert, supra, </em>is instructive. In that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that conversations between a company\u2019s in-house counsel and an investment banker regarding the details of a transaction proposed by the investment banker, and the transaction\u2019s potential tax consequences, were not covered by the privilege, despite the assertion \u2014 similar to the one made here by Comcast \u2014 that \u201cit was impossible for [counsel] to advise [the company] without these further contacts with [the investment banker].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139. The communications were not privileged, even though the court assumed that counsel\u2019s communications with the investment banker \u201csignificantly assisted the attorney in giving his client legal advice about its tax situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Comcast argues that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ackert, supra, </em>is distinguishable because in that case the investment banker proposed the transaction to the attorney, and \u201cdid not act as an advisor to legal counsel.\u201d While Comcast is correct that the investment banker initiated the discussions, see <em>id. </em>at 138, it misapprehends the nature of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>munications that followed as counsel sought the advice of the investment banker to formulate his own legal views.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In <em>In re G-I Holdings Inc., supra, </em>the court reached a similar result on similar facts. There, as here, the company\u2019s attorneys retained an outside accountant \u201cto explain tax concepts to in-house counsel so that in-house counsel could then render legal advice to [the company\u2019s] senior management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435. The court rejected the argument that the attorney-client privilege should apply, despite the in-house attorney\u2019s assertion that the accountant\u2019s advice was \u201cnecessary in order for us to provide legal advice and counsel to the senior management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the court\u2019s view, neither the company nor its attorneys \u201cneeded [the accountant] to facilitate communications between them. They could communicate competently on their own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436. We reach the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The commissioner\u2019s second argument \u2014 that US West sought tax advice, not legal advice, from Andersen, and is therefore not privileged<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u2014 relies in large part on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adlman, </em>68 F.3d 1495 (2d Cir. 1995) <em>(Adlman I), S.C., </em>134 F.3d 1194 (2d Cir. 1998) <em>(Adlman II). </em>In <em>Adlman I, </em>in-house counsel asked an outside accountant to evaluate the \u201ctax consequences\u201d of a proposed corporate restructuring. <em>Id. </em>at 1497. The accountant produced a memorandum containing a \u201cdetailed legal analysis of likely IRS challenges\u201d and \u201cpossible legal theories or strategies\u201d that could be deployed in response. <em>Adlman II, supra </em>at 1195. Like Ottinger, the <em>Adlman </em>attorney claimed that the accountant\u2019s memorandum was prepared in order to assist him in rendering his advice to the company, and that he considered the memorandum \u201cprivate and confidential.\u201d See <em>Adlman I, supra </em>at 1498. The court nevertheless determined that the <em>Kovel </em>doctrine did not shield the memorandum from disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 1500. While the facts in <em>Adlman I </em>are somewhat different from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the facts here \u2014 as is inevitably the case \u2014 we agree with and adopt the reasoning of the <em>Adlman </em>court in that case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We recognize the difficulty of drawing a line between \u201clegal\u201d advice and \u201ctax or accounting\u201d advice given to a client in order to resolve on which side of the line the Andersen advice to US West fell. Here, whether characterized as \u201caccounting advice\u201d or \u201clegal analysis,\u201d it was advice provided by third parties in circumstances that we have determined are not covered by the privilege, derivative or otherwise, so we need not resolve the point. We reject Comcast\u2019s suggestion that our decision rejecting its claim of privilege for the Andersen memoranda will reduce the attorney-client privilege to a \u201cmeaningless protection.\u201d Colorado-based Ottinger was free to seek advice on Massachusetts tax law from a Massachusetts attorney, where the privilege would apply. Instead, he sought advice on Massachusetts tax law from Massachusetts accountants, where no privilege applies. If his actions left his client potentially at risk, that is \u201cthe inevitable consequence of having to reconcile the absence of a privilege for accountants and the effective operation of the privilege of client and lawyer under conditions where the lawyer needs outside help.\u201d <em>Kovel, supra </em>at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">b. <em>Work product. </em>Because the Andersen memoranda are not protected by the privilege, we now consider whether they are protected from disclosure by the work product doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The work product doctrine, drawn from <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495 (1947), functions \u201cto enhance the vitality of an adversary system of litigation by insulating counsel\u2019s work from intrusions, inferences, or borrowings by other parties.\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>380 Mass. 805, 817 (1980), citing <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 511, and Developments in the Law \u2014 Discovery, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 940, 1028-1029 (1961). The purpose of the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>is to establish a \u201czone of privacy for strategic litigation planning ... to prevent one party from piggybacking on the adversary\u2019s preparation.\u201d <em>Adlman I, supra </em>at 1501. While the attorney-client privilege shields communications between attorney and client (and in some circumstances third parties), the work product doctrine protects an attorney\u2019s written materials and \u201cmental impressions.\u201d <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The commissioner argues that the language of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 70, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>requires that we examine the applicability of the doctrine in this case under the rules of criminal procedure, specifically Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (5), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004), rather than under the broader discovery rule pertaining to civil matters, Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 772 (1974). We decline to do so because the claim has been waived, as we now explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In the Superior Court, the commissioner did not make this argument in her motion to compel or at the hearing before the judge on the motion. She made the argument for the first time in a motion to reconsider the judge\u2019s order filed some fourteen months later. The motion judge ruled that the issue could have been raised in the motion to compel, and was waived. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>409 Mass. 45, 46-47 n.3 (1991) (motion for reconsideration is not \u201cthe appropriate place to raise new arguments inspired by a loss before the motion judge\u201d); <em>Publishers Resource, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walker-Davis Publ., Inc., </em>762 F.2d 557, 561 (7th Cir. 1985) (motion for reconsideration should not serve as occasion to tender new legal theories for first time). It was well within the judge\u2019s discretion not to consider the commissioner\u2019s new argument on the motion for reconsideration. See <em>Liberty Sq. Dev. Trust </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>441 Mass. 605, 611 (2004) (where party filed \u201camended\u201d motion and motion for \u201creconsideration\u201d seven weeks after action on original motion, judge not required to entertain party\u2019s \u201cbelated efforts to improve on its original motion\u201d; no error in denial of motion that \u201cmerely seeks, as this one did, a \u2018second bite at the apple\u2019 \u201d); <em>Clamp-All Corp. </em>v. <em>Foresta, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 795, 807 (2002) (judge did not abuse discretion in denying motion for reconsideration where party was \u201ca sophisticated litigant\u201d and \u201cfailed to offer any substantial reason\u201d why it had not filed affidavit \u201cat the time it filed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>original motion\u201d); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Cornejo, </em>199 F.R.D. 228, 252-253 (N.D. Ill. 2000), and cases cited. See also <em>Int'l Strategies Group, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Greenberg Traurig, LLP, </em>482 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2007) (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration or relief from judgment for abuse of discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The commissioner argues that here, unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, supra, </em>she sought reconsideration of an <em>interlocutory </em>order rather than a final judgment, and waiver therefore does not apply. We do not agree. The commissioner cites no authority supporting her claim. In any event, motions to reconsider an interlocutory order are themselves not \u201cappropriate vehicles to advance . . . new legal theories not argued before the ruling.\u201d <em>Zurich Capital Mkts. Inc. </em>v. <em>Coglianese, </em>383 F. Supp. 2d 1041, 1045 (N.D. Ill. 2005). Certainly a judge may exercise discretion and reconsider an interlocutory order when, for example, all parties and all issues will continue to be litigated. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Cornejo, supra </em>at 253. But flexibility is not necessarily warranted here. The motion judge\u2019s order denying the commissioner\u2019s motion to compel was \u201cinterlocutory\u201d only in the sense that it was not appealable until final judgment entered. The order, however, was a ruling on the only relief sought in the commissioner\u2019s complaint, production of withheld documents. The judge\u2019s order cannot be fairly characterized as an \u201corder that relates to some intermediate matter in the case.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1130 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cinterlocutory order\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We therefore address Comcast\u2019s work product claims under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the rules applicable to civil proceedings, as did the motion judge. The Massachusetts work product doctrine is codified in rule 26 (b) (3).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> By its terms the rule protects a client\u2019s nonlawyer representatives, protecting from discovery documents prepared by a party\u2019s representative \u201cin anticipation of litigation.\u201d The protection is qualified, and can be overcome if the party seeking discovery demonstrates \u201csubstantial need of the materials\u201d and that it is \u201cunable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.\u201d There is a further limitation: the court is to \u201cprotect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.\u201d This so-called \u201copinion\u201d work product is afforded greater protection than \u201cfact\u201d work product. See, e.g., <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>220 F.R.D. 130, 145 (D. Mass. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Courts have disagreed over whether the civil rule protection for opinion work product is \u201cabsolute\u201d or merely \u201cheightened.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>See <em>id. </em>(collecting cases). Even if not absolute, disclosure is appropriate only in rare or \u201cextremely unusual\u201d circumstances. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 545 (LexisNexis 2008) (\u201cdiscovery, except in extremely unusual circumstances, may not be had of an attorney\u2019s mental impressions and similar intellectual work product. This protection applies also to \u2018other representative[s] of a party,\u2019 provided their work relates to litigation\u201d); <em>Adlman II, supra </em>at 1204 (\u201cat a minimum... a highly persuasive showing\u201d is needed to overcome protection for opinion work product); <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em>599 F.2d 1224, 1231 (3d Cir. 1979) (interview memoranda \u201cwill be discoverable only in a \u2018rare situation\u2019 \u201d). We need not decide here whether protection for opinion work product is absolute because we conclude that the commissioner has not made a \u201chighly persuasive\u201d showing that the circumstances in this case are so unusual that protection for opinion work product should be denied on a lower standard. See discussion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Comcast bears the burden of establishing <em>that the </em>Andersen memoranda were prepared in anticipation of litigation. See <em>Colonial Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>144 F.R.D. 600, 605 (D. Mass. 1992). If that burden is met, the burden shifts to the commissioner to demonstrate a substantial need for the memo-randa and that she cannot obtain the substantial equivalent of the memoranda without undue hardship. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Textron Inc. &amp; Subsidiaries, </em>507 F. Supp. 2d 138, 149 (D.R.I. 2007), affd in part, 557 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2009) (\u201cThe burden of establishing \u2018substantial need\u2019 rests on the party seeking to overcome the privilege\u201d). Moreover, if the Andersen memoranda are \u201copinion\u201d work product, the commissioner must make, at a minimum, a \u201cfar stronger showing of necessity and unavailability by other means.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 402 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The commissioner does not contest that the Andersen partners qualify as a \u201cparty\u2019s representative[s]\u201d under rule 26 (b) (3). We therefore must determine the scope of the requirement of rule 26 (b) (3) that the Andersen memoranda be prepared \u201cin anticipation of litigation\u201d in order to qualify for work product protection. Specifically, in this case we must determine whether work product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>protection is applicable \u201cto a litigation analysis prepared by a party or its representative in order to inform a business decision which turns on the party\u2019s assessment of the likely outcome of litigation expected to result from the transaction.\u201d <em>Adlman II, supra </em>at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In <em>Adlman II, supra </em>at 1198, the court noted that the phrase \u201cin anticipation of litigation\u201d has given rise to a range of views by courts and commentators, and that \u201ctwo tests had developed\u201d as to documents that, although prepared because of expected litigation, are intended to inform a business decision influenced by the prospects of the litigation. The court then engaged in a lengthy discussion of the two tests, viz., (1) whether the documents \u201care prepared \u2018primarily or exclusively to assist in litigation\u2019 \u2014 a formulation that would potentially exclude documents containing analysis of expected litigation, if their primary, ultimate, or exclusive purpose is to assist in making the business decision\u201d and (2) whether the documents \u201cwere prepared \u2018because of\u2019 existing or expected litigation \u2014 a formulation that would include such documents, despite the fact that their purpose is not to \u2018assist in\u2019 litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We need not repeat here the court\u2019s exploration of the contours of the two tests. It is sufficient to say that we agree with both the reasoning and the conclusion that the latter formulation (\u201cbecause of\u201d existing or expected litigation) is the correct test.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That test is \u201cconsistent with both the literal terms [of the rule] and the purposes\u201d of the work product doctrine, <em>id., </em>both of which \u201csuggest strongly that work product protection should not be denied to a document that analyzes expected litigation merely because it is prepared to assist in a business decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1199. The \u201cbecause of\u201d test \u201cappropriately focuses on both what should be eligible for the [r]ule\u2019s protection and what should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1203. Thus, a document is within the scope of the rule if, \u201cin light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case, the document can be fairly said to have been prepared <em>because of the, </em>prospect of litigation.\u201d <em>Adlman II, supra </em>at 1202, quoting 8 C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller, &amp; R.L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2024, at 343 (1994) (Wright &amp; Miller).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> That test is consistent with our own jurisprudence. See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>380 Mass. 805, 817 (1980) (preparation for litigation \u201cincludes litigation which, although not already on foot, is to be reasonably anticipated in the near future\u201d).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We now apply the \u201cbecause of\u201d test to the facts in this case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The commissioner argues that the Andersen memoranda do not meet that test because they were prepared to \u201cavoid the prospect of litigation,\u201d citing In re Grand Jury Proceedings, U.S. Dist.

Oct. 3, 2001),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and because, in her view, Ottinger\u2019s \u201cconclusory assertions fall far short of demon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>stating a specific prospect of litigation.\u201d We disagree with the commissioner on both points. As <em>Adlman II, supra </em>at 1197, makes clear, a litigation analysis prepared so that a party can make an informed business decision is afforded the protections of the work product doctrine. In our own review of the circumstances of Andersen\u2019s retention, and on review of the Andersen memoranda, see <em>Adlman II, supra </em>at 1204, we conclude that the documents at issue \u201ccan fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.\u201d Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra. </em>As Ottinger\u2019s affidavit makes clear, his concern focused on the reasonable possibility that the department would challenge any nonpayment of Massachusetts taxes in light of the substantial capital gains realized by US West on the divestment of the TCG shares. Thus, Ottinger requested the Andersen partners to discuss \u201cthe pros and cons of the various planning opportunities and the attendant litigation risks.\u201d What the Andersen partners gave Ottinger was an analysis prepared \u201cin order to inform a business decision which turns on the party\u2019s assessment of the likely outcome of litigation expected to result from the transaction.\u201d <em>Adlman II, supra </em>at 1197.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We have little doubt that US West had \u201cthe prospect of litigation in mind when it directed the preparation of the memorandum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1204.

The memoranda contain the \u201cmental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories\u201d of its authors, and the commissioner does not appear to contend otherwise. Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3). Here, the commissioner has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that these circumstances are so \u201cextremely unusual\u201d that they compel overcoming the greater protection afforded opinion work product. See Reporters\u2019 Notes, Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 545 (LexisNexis 2008). Although the commissioner asserts in conclusory fashion that substantially equivalent information is not available elsewhere, she has not demonstrated that information about the business reasons for the reorganization of Continental Teleport is not available from US West officials. This is not the \u201csingular\u201d instance in which disclosure of opinion work product is warranted. See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Peabody, supra </em>at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For all of these reasons we conclude that the Andersen memoranda are protected from disclosure by the work product doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Because the present Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) is a woman, we shall use the female pronoun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Through a series of mergers not relevant to this appeal, Comcast Corporation (Comcast) is the successor company to AT&amp;T Broadband, which in turn was the successor company to MediaOne Group, Inc.

The commissioner contests here only the judge\u2019s determination that the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine applied to the Andersen memoranda. As for these, there appears to be some confusion as to the number of copies of the Andersen memoranda sought by the commissioner. In her brief and at oral argument, the commissioner referred to four documents. As Comcast makes no claim that any of the Andersen memoranda should be treated differently from the others, our ruling applies to all copies of the memorandum and any drafts thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The six documents are identified as follows.

The step transaction doctrine \u201ctreats a series of formally separate \u2018steps\u2019 as a single transaction if such steps are in substance integrated, interdependent, and focused toward a particular result.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>Penrod </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>88 T.C. 1415, 1428 (1987). \u201cIf an intermediate step has no legitimate business purpose beyond tax avoidance, it may be collapsed for tax purposes under the step transaction doctrine.\u201d <em>General Mills, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra. </em>In contrast, \u201cif each such step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>demonstrates independent economic significance, is not subject to attack as a sham, and was undertaken for valid business purposes and not mere avoidance of taxes,\u201d the step transaction doctrine does not apply. <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Dupee, </em>423 Mass. 617, 624 (1996), quoting Rev.

Accordingly, the commissioner contends, the absence of any legitimate business purpose for the reorganization of Continental Teleport into Continental Holding would be \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the commissioner\u2019s ability to invoke the step transaction doctrine to disregard the form of the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The department issued the first request on July 13, 2001; additional requests were issued on April 24, 2002, and August 12, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Although we have not said so explicitly, we have in effect undertaken a de nova review of, for example, whether the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applied in Massachusetts, see <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>424 Mass. 109, 112-113 (1997), whether the disclosure of a document by an anonymous source constituted a waiver of the privilege, see <em>Matter of the Reorganization of Elec.

The judge\u2019s order denying the commissioner\u2019s motion to compel entered on August 29, 2005. That order granted the commissioner leave to submit a supplemental filing addressing her \u201csubstantial need\u201d for the memoranda and her inability to obtain substantially equivalent information \u201cwithout undue hardship,\u201d the burden-shifting terms contained in Mass.

Some nine months later, on June 9, 2006, Comcast\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure of the commissioner to respond was denied, and the commissioner was granted sixty additional days to respond. When the commissioner belatedly moved, on August 4, 2006, for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s original ruling, her motion did not conform to the Superior Court Rules. On October 25, 2006, nearly <em>fourteen months </em>after the judge ruled that the Andersen memoranda were protected from disclosure by the work product doctrine, the commissioner moved for reconsideration, raising for the first time her claim that the criminal rules apply. Reconsideration by the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>judge was not warranted in these circumstances. See <em>Liberty Sq. Dev.

See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (1), as appearing in 386 Mass. 1247 (1982). The cited authorities were all available at the time the commissioner filed her brief and reply brief; it was an attempt at \u201creargument in the disguise of a supplementary citation\u201d that rule 16 (1) \u201cdoes not authorize.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siano, </em>52 Mass.
