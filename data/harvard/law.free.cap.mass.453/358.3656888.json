L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, for specific injuries he suffered in 1995. See <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>443 Mass. 157 (2004) <em>(Walker I). </em>At issue now is the application of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51 A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the unusual circumstances of this case, in which Walker\u2019s entitlement to compensation for his injuries was established by a reviewing board decision that was subsequently amended by the board itself and then reversed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>this court in one respect. We conclude that the board did not err in ruling that its original decision was the \u201cfinal decision\u201d for \u00a7 51A purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The \u201cstraightforward, undisputed and tragic\u201d facts of this case are more fully set forth in our earlier decision. <em>Walker </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 158. In 1995, Walker, an employee of the town of Barnstable (town), became severely dehydrated while at work, causing injury to his brain. As a result, he has suffered significant brain injury, as well as bodily disfigurement, and the total loss of the use of both his arms and of both his legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In April, 1998, Walker filed a claim seeking compensation from the town, a self-insurer, for these injuries pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, which provides for additional compensation on account of specific physical injuries enumerated in that section. The town disputed Walker\u2019s claim. An administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents denied Walker\u2019s claim, finding that he was entitled to no compensation for his specific injuries because he had not shown that he had achieved \u201cmaximum medical improvement.\u201d See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.07(2)(i) (1993). The administrative judge also ruled that, because Walker\u2019s losses resulted from a brain injury, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> governed his claim and limited any recovery to which he might have been entitled. Walker appealed to the reviewing board (board).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">What happened next was not material to our decision in <em>Walker </em>/, but it is essential to our resolution of Walker\u2019s present arguments under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51 A. On May 15, 2002, the board issued a decision (May 15 decision), the conclusion of which purported to affirm the administrative judge\u2019s decision. It was clear from the reasoning of the May 15 decision, however, that the board agreed with the administrative judge only insofar as she found \u00a7 36A applicable to Walker\u2019s claim. The board disagreed with the administrative judge\u2019s finding that Walker had not achieved maximum medical improvement. Under this reasoning, Walker should have been entitled to some compensation for his specific injuries, albeit only the amount prescribed in \u00a7 36A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>rather than the greater amounts provided for in \u00a7 36. Nevertheless, the May 15 decision failed to order the town to pay such compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">There followed some communication between the parties and the board, the contents of which are not entirely clear on the record before us. On June 4, 2002, the board sent the parties a draft amended decision (June 4 decision) and sought their comments. The June 4 decision made it clear that Walker was indeed entitled to compensation as calculated under \u00a7 36A and that the town would be ordered to pay such compensation. Neither party objected to this aspect of the June 4 decision or, more generally, to the board\u2019s proposal to amend its decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On or about July 1, 2002, the town paid Walker $61,494.30, the compensation due as calculated under \u00a7 36A.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">On July 30, 2002, the board issued its amended decision (July 30 decision), which was in all material respects identical to the June 4 decision. The July 30 decision expressly reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision in part and awarded benefits as calculated under \u00a7 36A. The town did not appeal from the July 30 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Walker did appeal, first to a single justice of the Appeals Court, who affirmed the board\u2019s decision, and then to a panel of that court. We granted Walker\u2019s application for direct appellate review and on December 28, 2004, reversed, holding that \u201cthe limitation on unpaid compensation for specific injuries involving brain injury contained in the second paragraph of \u00a7 36A is operative only on the death of the employee.\u201d <em>Walker I, supra </em>at 170. As such, Walker was entitled to the full amount of compensation provided in \u00a7 36 for his injuries. We remanded the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">On remand, Walker made a new request: that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51 A, be applied to his award of \u00a7 36 compensation. As previously indicated, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 51 A, which concerns the applicable Statewide average weekly wage used to calculate an injured employee\u2019s benefits, provides: \u201cIn any claim in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>no compensation has been paid </em>prior to the <em>final decision </em>on such claim, said final decision shall take into consideration the compensation provided by statute on the date of the decision, rather than the date of the injury\u201d (emphasis added). After review by an administrative judge, the board ruled that \u201cthe \u2018final decision\u2019 for \u00a7 51A purposes is any decision awarding benefits on a claim for which \u2018no compensation has been paid\u2019 previously.\u201d That decision, according to the board, was its decision of May 15, 2002. The board therefore ordered that Walker\u2019s full \u00a7 36 benefits be calculated using the Statewide average weekly wage as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The town appealed, and the Appeals Court, in an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, modified the board\u2019s decision. <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 1106 (2008). The Appeals Court ruled that May 15, 2002, was the date of the \u201cfinal decision\u201d for \u00a7 51A purposes, but only as to the amount up to the limits of \u00a7 36A. As to the difference between that amount and the full amount of \u00a7 36 benefits, the Appeals Court ruled that our December, 2004, decision in <em>Walker I, supra, </em>was the \u201cfinal decision.\u201d Because <em>some </em>compensation had been paid in July, 2002, before the release of <em>Walker I, </em>the Appeals Court ordered that the amount over the \u00a7 36A limit be calculated using the Statewide average weekly wage as of the date of Walker\u2019s injury in 1995. We granted Walker\u2019s application for further appellate review and now affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The sole issue before us is whether the board properly ruled that May 15, 2002, was the \u201cfinal decision\u201d date for \u00a7 51A purposes. \u201cThe interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). \u201cThe party challenging the board\u2019s decision bears a \u2018heavy\u2019 burden of proving that the decision is invalid. <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>448 Mass. 45, 51 (2006), citing <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 412 (2001).\u201d <em>Alves\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 171, 173-174 (2008). Further, the workers\u2019 compensation act \u201cis to be interpreted \u2018so far as may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker I, supra </em>at 160, quoting <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Indus. Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 73 (1995). Accordingly, \u201cwe give this remedial statute a \u2018broad interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker I, supra </em>at 161, quoting <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., supra. </em>With these standards in mind, we consider the purpose of \u00a7 51 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 51 A, prescribes that an employee\u2019s benefits be calculated using the Statewide average weekly wage at the date of the decision, rather than the date of injury, if no compensation has been paid before the date of the final decision. The purposes of \u00a7 51A are \u201cto avoid obsolescence of compensation rates by requiring benefits to be computed in accordance with the statutory rate in effect at the time of the final decision, when no payments have been made during the period the claim has been contested,\u201d <em>McLeod\u2019s Case, </em>389 Mass. 431,435 (1983), and to \u201cencourage insurers to make a prompt determination and payment of undisputed compensation to claimants likely to be facing fiscal problems.\u201d <em>Madariaga\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. <em>477, </em>482-483 n.7 (1985). See L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 18.30, at 103 (3d ed. 2003) (\u00a7 51A \u201cwas added in order to enhance benefits to those employees who had been deprived of compensation during protracted disputes and was intended to discourage insurers from unreasonably withholding payment of benefits until a \u2018final decision\u2019 of the board was issued\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The board\u2019s decision is eminently reasonable in light of these important goals. The board interpreted the term \u201cfinal decision\u201d in \u00a7 51A to mean \u201cany decision awarding benefits on a claim for which \u2018no compensation has been paid\u2019 previously,\u201d that is, the last such decision before the insurer pays compensation on the employee\u2019s claim. Under this ruling, if an insurer fails to pay any compensation until a decision is issued awarding benefits on a claim, the insurer will be required to pay benefits using the average weekly wage on the date of the decision. As this will typically be higher than the average weekly wage on the date of the injury, the board\u2019s ruling encourages insurers to pay promptly. Moreover, here \u2014 in a real sense \u2014 the May 15 decision <em>was </em>the final decision on Walker\u2019s \u00a7 36 claim. It was in the May 15 decision that the board ruled that, contrary to the administrative judge\u2019s view, Walker had reached maximum medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>improvement and thus was entitled to compensation for his specific injuries. The town thereafter paid Walker the benefits as required by that ruling, and the ruling has never been challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The town argues that the \u201cfinal decision\u201d is either the July 30 decision or our decision in <em>Walker I, supra. </em>Neither argument is persuasive in the circumstances of this case, particularly in light of the town\u2019s \u201c \u2018heavy\u2019 burden of proving that the [board\u2019s] decision is invalid.\u201d <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., supra. </em>Because the town did pay some compensation on Walker\u2019s claim before either of these decisions, a ruling that either one was the \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7 51A would require that his benefits be calculated as of the date of injury in 1995, to Walker\u2019s great disadvantage. The town has shown no reason why the board should have been compelled to do so. The board ruled in the May 15 decision that Walker had achieved maximum medical improvement and was entitled to specific injury benefits. The July 30 decision did not alter or add to that ruling. Indeed, nothing new was decided in the July 30 decision. Rather, the board simply corrected the formal inconsistency contained in the May 15 decision by expressly reversing the administrative judge\u2019s decision in part and ordering the town to pay benefits to Walker. We will not permit the town to capitalize on the board\u2019s error. Further, the town made its payment only after the board distributed a draft'amended decision, which made it clear that such an order was imminent. We agree with the Appeals Court that the town, \u201cknowing what the correction would be, cannot avoid the impact of \u00a7 51A by its rush to payment before the [July 30] decision was filed.\u201d The board did not err by declining to treat its July 30 decision as the \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7 51 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Nor do we think the board was compelled to consider our opinion in <em>Walker I, supra, </em>the \u201cfinal decision\u201d for \u00a7 51A purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We did not decide in <em>Walker I </em>that Walker was entitled to compensation for his specific injuries; his entitlement to at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>some compensation had already been established and was not being challenged. The issue before us in <em>Walker I </em>was whether he was entitled to the full <em>amount </em>of compensation prescribed in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, or to a lesser amount as provided in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A. Moreover, treating <em>Walker I </em>as the final decision would not encourage prompt payment, but would reward the town for its delay.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We cannot fault the board for declining to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The town\u2019s payment to Walker was anything but prompt. The town paid Walker no compensation for his specific injuries until after the board decided that he was entitled to such compensation, some four years after Walker filed his \u00a7 36 claim and seven years after he was injured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In these circumstances, to hold, as the town argues, that either the board\u2019s July 30, 2002, decision or our decision in <em>Walker I, </em>on December 28, 2004, was the \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7 51A would require that Walker\u2019s benefits be calculated as of the date of his injury in 1995 merely because the town paid some compensation after it knew it would be ordered to do so, but before the order was formally issued. Such, a result would frustrate the purposes of that statute. The town has not carried its heavy burden of showing that the board\u2019s decision was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>In sum, the board properly ruled that its May 15 decision was the \u201cfinal decision\u201d for \u00a7 51A purposes. Walker is entitled to have his benefits calculated using the average weekly wage as of May 15, 2002. In addition, as the prevailing party, Walker is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs resulting from this appeal. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decision of the board of November 30, 2006, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-14\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 51 A, provides: \u201cIn any claim in which no compensation has been paid prior to the final decision on such claim, said final decision shall take into consideration the compensation provided by statute on the date of the decision, rather than the date of the injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 36A, limits the total benefits available for the injuries specified in \u00a7 36, if they resulted from \u201can injury involving brain damage.\u201d The proper construction of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A, was the issue before us in <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>443 Mass. 157 (2004) <em>(Walker l).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\">In response to the board\u2019s request for comments, Walker asked that the amended decision include an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The town objected. The final decision did not address the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. That issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Walker suggests that <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>443 Mass. 157 (2004) <em>(Walker </em>I), should be deemed the \u201cfinal decision,\u201d but that the payment made by the town in July, 2002, should <em>not </em>be considered to be any compensation on Walker\u2019s \u00a7 36 claim because the payment was made under \u00a7 36A. Under this theory Walker would have his \u00a7 51A benefits calculated as of December, 2004. Assuming this argument is properly before us where Walker did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>cross-appeal from the board\u2019s decision, we disagree. The board ruled that the amounts paid by the town were in fact \u00a7 36 benefits, albeit erroneously capped under \u00a7 36A. It reasoned that \u201c[t]here are no specific losses to be paid to \u00a7 36A beneficiaries other than those set out in \u00a7 36.\u201d Walker has not shown that the board\u2019s interpretation of these statutes is invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Similarly, the Appeals Court\u2019s result paradoxically requires the <em>least </em>promptly paid portion of Walker\u2019s compensation \u2014the portion above the \u00a7 36A cap \u2014 to be calculated using the <em>lowest </em>average weekly wage. This result frustrates the purposes of \u00a7 51 A. It also finds no support in the language of \u00a7 51 A, which does not contemplate dividing an employee\u2019s claim into two or more portions (\u201cany <em>claim </em>in which no compensation has been paid prior to the final decision on such <em>claim\u201d </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\">An appellate court decision, such as our decision in <em>Walker I, supra, </em>presumably could be considered the \u201cfinal decision\u201d for \u00a7 51A purposes if the insurer has paid nothing until after such a decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b386-12\">The town asserts that at various times while Walker\u2019s \u00a7 36 claim was pending, it offered to pay him compensation as calculated under \u00a7 36A. However, the board struck all references to any such offers from the town\u2019s brief. The town has not suggested that this was an abuse of discretion. Moreover, we agree with the board\u2019s reasoning that \u201c[o]ffers to pay compensation are not the equivalent of payment of compensation and are thus irrelevant to the application of \u00a7 51 A. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
