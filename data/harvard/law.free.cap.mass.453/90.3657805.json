He appeals from his conviction and from the denial of his motion for a new trial, arguing that he was entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter based on reasonable provocation induced by the victim\u2019s stalking him for the previous four weeks or so. We conclude that neither the evidence presented at trial nor that submitted in support of the new trial motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>supported a manslaughter instruction in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial. On further review of the entire case, we decline to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant the defendant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>To determine whether a jury instruction on manslaughter based on reasonable provocation was warranted, we consider the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Acevedo, 446 Mass. 435, 442-443 (2006). We therefore summarize the facts relevant to this issue in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">It is undisputed that the defendant killed the victim, Leon Weymouth, on June 23, 2002. On that day, the defendant drove to where Weymouth was living, saw Weymouth standing outside in his front yard, and shot him four times with a shotgun loaded with \u201cbuckshot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">At the time of his death, Weymouth had been married to Monica Hagen (Hagen) for approximately one year. Hagen and the defendant had dated at one point some years before her marriage, and thereafter remained friends. They became more than friends when Hagen began to have marital problems with Weymouth. One month before the shooting incident, on or about May 23, 2002, Hagen asked the defendant to come over to the house where she lived with the victim. He did so and while at the home, he noticed that Hagen had a black eye and appeared to have recently been beaten. While the two were having coffee, Weymouth kicked in the door and began screaming in the defendant\u2019s face, threatening to kill Hagen, Hagen\u2019s family, and the defendant. The defendant feared for his life because he knew that Weymouth was \u201ca black-belt in karate\u201d and believed that he had had \u201cmany run-ins with people.\u201d When Hagen tried to contact the police, Weymouth pulled the telephone out of the wall. Hagen then went into the bedroom, which had a second telephone, and Weymouth left.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Not long after the May 23 incident, Hagen began to keep her pets at the defendant\u2019s house and took steps to sell her home. At some point in late May or June, Hagen moved into the defendant\u2019s trailer with him and stayed there most nights. On at least three occasions, Hagen\u2019s dog, along with the defendant\u2019s dog, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>started barking loudly in the night. On one such occasion, the defendant went outside to investigate and saw what he believed to be someone leaving his property in what he recognized as Weymouth\u2019s Ford Bronco vehicle. The defendant concluded that Weymouth was stalking him and Hagen.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">During the period from approximately May 23 to June 23, 2002, the defendant received a number of telephone calls at his trailer that he believed were from Weymouth, based on the sound of the caller\u2019s voice and the content of the calls.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The calls made the defendant \u201c[v]cry, very uncomfortable.\u201d A few days before the June 23 shooting incident, the defendant stopped at a gasoline station to get gasoline for his car. As he was leaving, Weymouth appeared at his car window and began screaming in the defendant\u2019s face that the defendant should stay away from Hagen, that Wey-mouth was going to kill the defendant, and that \u201c[b]load [was] going to flow.\u201d When asked why he did not get his gun and kill Weymouth directly after this incident, the defendant testified, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t eating me up as bad at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The defendant did not report any of these incidents to the police. He did complain to Hagen\u2019s father, Ovin Hagen, about the telephone calls and the presence of someone on or near his property. The defendant also complained about the dog barking incidents to his neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">On June 23, the defendant left work at about 12:30 p.m. and, after stopping by Ovin Hagen\u2019s home briefly, returned to his trailer. Hagen was at the defendant\u2019s trailer when he arrived. The two proceeded to share three bottles of champagne and the defendant ingested some cocaine. Sometime in the midaftemoon, the defendant and Hagen went to a restaurant where the defendant drank four or five beers and took three Percocet pills. At approximately 4:30 p.m. the defendant and Hagen returned to his trailer. Weymouth was on the defendant\u2019s mind that day: \u201c[A]ll that day it was eating me up, eating me up, all the threats and what he was doing to [Hagen].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">At some point that afternoon, when Hagen went outside to feed the animals, the defendant located the key to his gun safe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>unlocked the safe, and took out his twelve-gouge shotgun. While he was retrieving his gun, the defendant had \u201ca lot of hate in [his] mind\u201d and he was in fear for his life because of \u201call the threats, him stalking me, him stalking [Hagen].\u201d Nonetheless, the defendant agreed that his retrieval of the gun was a deliberate act. The defendant loaded the gun with five shells containing buckshot and he believed that if he pointed the gun at someone and pulled the trigger, the person would be killed. He then went outside to put the gun into his Jeep vehicle, returned to the trailer, and told Hagen that he had \u201cto go somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The defendant drove from his trailer, located in the town of Buzzard\u2019s Bay, to Weymouth\u2019s house, which was in another town, East Wareham. At that point, he was \u201cthinking about scaring [Weymouth] more than anything.\u201d On his drive, the defendant made a decision that if Weymouth were inside his home, the defendant would just drive by and not go in, out of fear that Weymouth would shoot him if he did so. When the defendant pulled into Weymouth\u2019s driveway, however, he saw Weymouth standing in his front yard, barefoot and unarmed, talking to a neighbor. The defendant got out of his Jeep with his gun. At that point the defendant intended to shoot Weymouth, because he was \u201csick of [Weymouth] threatening me all the time\u201d and because \u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t do something, he was going to kill me.\u201d The defendant said to Weymouth, \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you, Leon,\u201d and shot Weymouth in the chest from a distance of approximately twenty to twenty-five feet. Weymouth fell to his knees and the defendant yelled at the neighbor to leave. After moving closer, the defendant shot Wey-mouth three more times. After the fourth shot, the defendant walked back to his Jeep, put the shotgun in it, and drove to the house of Hagen\u2019s brother. When he arrived, he asked for a beer and said it would be the last beer he would be able to have for a long time. The defendant admitted to Hagen\u2019s brother that he had killed Weymouth and agreed that the police should be contacted. The defendant surrendered peacefully when the police arrived. An autopsy of Weymouth revealed forty-seven entrance wounds and twenty-one exit wounds. Eighteen buckshot pellets were recovered from the victim\u2019s body, thirteen from his chest. Weymouth died from the multiple gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">On the day of the killing and after his arrest, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>was advised of his Miranda rights and thereafter spoke to a State trooper while in custody. The defendant told him, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. I don\u2019t want to get into it. But Leon [Weymouth] threatened to kill me a couple of days ago. I know he\u2019s been on my property in the last couple of days. I wanted to make sure he died before I died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, following the close of evidence, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked the judge to include an instruction on manslaughter, based on a theory of excessive use of force in self-defense; the attorney did not request a manslaughter instruction based on reasonable provocation due to stalking. The judge stated that she did not think that the defendant was entitled to any instruction on manslaughter or self-defense and added, \u201cupon reflection I see no mitigating factors or circumstances that would warrant any kind of manslaughter instruction in this case.\u201d* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Following his conviction, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial in this court, based in part on the grounds that the defendant was a victim of stalking and that he was entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter based on reasonable provocation induced by stalking. The motion was remanded to the judge, who denied it without a hearing, explaining her reasons in a comprehensive memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In appealing from his conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial, the defendant raises a single issue: that he was entitled to an instruction on manslaughter, based on the theory of reasonable provocation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We consider this issue first in relation to the trial, and second in connection with the new trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">a. <em>The trial. </em>\u201cA manslaughter instruction must be given if any view of the evidence would permit a verdict of manslaughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>rather than murder . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 220 (2007), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>422 Mass. 574, 578 (1996). The judge may not, however, \u201ccharge on a hypothesis not supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 746 (1975). \u201cA killing is manslaughter if there is \u2018provocation deemed adequate in law to cause the accused to lose his self-control in the heat of passion, and if the killing followed the provocation before sufficient time had elapsed for the accused\u2019s temper to cool.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinton, </em>432 Mass. 180, 189 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>429 Mass. 313, 316 (1999). A manslaughter instruction based on reasonable provocation is not appropriate unless there is evidence that, when considered in the light most favorable to the defendant, is \u201csufficient to create a reasonable doubt in the minds of a rational jury that a defendant\u2019s actions were both objectively and subjectively reasonable. That is, the jury must be able to infer that a reasonable person would have become sufficiently provoked and would not have \u2018cooled off\u2019 by the time of the homicide, and that in fact a defendant was provoked and did not cool off.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagrodny, </em>443 Mass. 93, 106 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Groome, </em>435 Mass. 201, 220 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>441 Mass. 199, 205-206 (2004) (no manslaughter instruction required where no evidence present \u201cthat makes a theory of reasonable provocation or sudden combat tenable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The question whether there is provocation sufficient to warrant a manslaughter instruction depends on a number of critical timing issues. First, provocation occurs only when an action of the victim triggers a <em>sudden </em>loss of self-control in the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>394 Mass. 727, 738, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>474 U.S. 919 (1985) (defining provocation in part as \u201csudden transport of passion or heat of blood\u201d). Second, in cases in which the victim\u2019s last overt act is preceded by other similar or related acts, it is the last act that is significant: \u201cWe consider only whether the incidents immediately preceding the killing constituted reasonable provocation. Any history of prior hostilities between the victim and the defendant can only be viewed as a cause of the incidents preced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ing the killing and not as an element of the provocation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>389 Mass. 184, 188 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass, at 222 (\u201cOnly incidents immediately preceding the shooting can constitute reasonable provocation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, supra </em>at 189, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>370 Mass. 438, 442 (1976) (\u201cWithout evidence of a threat of \u2018immediate and intense offense\u2019 . . . instructions on manslaughter would not be appropriate\u201d). Third, for there to be provocation, the killing must occur before there is sufficient time for the defendant to cool off. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagrodny, </em>443 Mass, at 106. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, </em>383 Mass. 178, 180 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 722 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The defendant argues that if the common law on reasonable provocation is viewed in conjunction with G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 (a), the statute defining the crime of stalking, the defendant was entitled to a manslaughter instruction based on reasonable provocation. General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 43 <em>(a), </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cWhoever (1) willfully and maliciously engages in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person which seriously alarms or annoys that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, and (2) makes a threat with the intent to place the person in imminent fear of death or bodily injury, shall be guilty of the crime of stalking and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than two and one-half years or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The defendant\u2019s contention is that the language of this statute, in combination with the severity of the penalty it provides, supports two claims: (1) Weymouth\u2019s words and conduct constituted reasonable provocation; and (2) because stalking involves by definition repeated acts or a pattern of acts by the stalker, causing substantial emotional distress that builds over time on the part of the person stalked, it was objectively reasonable for a stalked person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances not to have cooled off in the length of time between Weymouth\u2019s provocation and the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Nothing in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 (a), alters our conclusion that the evidence of provocation at the defendant\u2019s trial was insufficient to warrant a provocation instruction. On the assumption that Weymouth\u2019s conduct toward the defendant constituted stalking within the meaning of \u00a7 43 <em>(a), </em>the stalking statute implies only that stalking causes \u201csubstantial emotional distress\u201d and \u201cimminent fear of death or bodily injury,\u201d not the mental state required for provocation, i.e., a moment of heightened passion that overwhelms the capacity for self-control necessary to prevent deadly violence. There is no evidence in this record, expert or otherwise, that stalking causes a reasonable person to experience such a loss of self-control, and certainly no evidence that stalking causes a person to develop an impulse to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">This court has held that no manslaughter instruction is warranted when a defendant acts from a \u201csmoldering\u201d anger, as opposed to the requisite \u201csudden transport of passion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>444 Mass. 563, 569 (2005). The record here contains nothing to suggest that the defendant ever experienced a moment of such sudden passion that his capacity for self-control was eclipsed. The last overt act of stalking occurred several days before the killing, when Weymouth approached the defendant at a gasoline station and threatened to kill him. The defendant experienced no loss of self-control at that time; he testified that he did not get his gun and kill Weymouth then because \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t eating me up as bad at that time.\u201d During the days between the gasoline station incident and the killing, the defendant testified to experiencing emotional distress and fear, but no moment of passion associated with a loss of self-restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">On the day of the killing, the defendant\u2019s actions were deliberate, not passionate. He unlocked a safe, retrieved a gun, loaded it with buckshot, drove to Weymouth\u2019s residence, and shot him four times. This sequence of events is incompatible with provocation. As this court stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>452 Mass. 295, 321 (2008), \u201c[i]n . . . cases in which a provocation instruction has been warranted, the combat was unplanned and the defendant was often the one subject to the first physical attacks that escalated into mutual violence.\u201d We held there that no manslaughter instruction was warranted in light of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that the defendant \u201carmed himself in preparation for a fatal confrontation and, carrying a loaded weapon, went to a location where he knew he would find the victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the defendant in that case \u201cmay have feared the victim[],\u201d he nevertheless \u201csought [him] out\u201d and was for that reason, among others, ineligible for a manslaughter instruction. <em>Id. </em>The same observations may be made about the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The defendant argues that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 <em>(a), </em>should prompt the court to revise the principle that a provocation instruction is warranted only if the killing occurs a short time after the provocation and before the defendant has an opportunity to cool down. The defendant suggests that stalking victims experience distress and fear both during particular stalking incidents and afterward, and that the full impact of a sequence of stalking incidents may not be felt immediately. As a result, he contends, \u201cthe last overt act and the reaction which culminates in a homicide may be longer than usual.\u201d Thus, while it may appear that a stalking victim who kills had ample time to cool down between the last stalking incident and the killing, in fact, the stalking victim may not yet have reached the boiling point for much of that period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We do not need to reach the issue whether, in cases offering evidence that the defendant was a victim of stalking, we should recognize the possibility that the cooling off clock starts at a point that possibly may be quite distant from the last provocative act. Whether the defendant in this case ever \u201cheated up,\u201d he was clearly \u201ccool\u201d during the time just prior to the killing, when he planned, prepared for, and executed his trip to Weymouth\u2019s house armed with a gun. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass, at 221 (provocation instruction not warranted where defendant and victim were separated for at least a few minutes between provocation and killing, and defendant then sought out victim); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>444 Mass, at 568 (defendant had adequate time to cool down where he left scene of provocation and returned to attack victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The defendant in this case may have been a victim of stalking; the record certainly would warrant a jury\u2019s finding that he suffered emotional distress and fear as a result of Weymouth\u2019s conduct and words. Nevertheless, the evidence supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>view that the defendant\u2019s distress and fear did not precipitate a moment so emotional that his capacity for self-control was overborne, and then he killed the victim in a moment of passion. As the trial judge noted, \u201cthis was a cold-blooded, preemptive attack, not the result of. . . [provoked] incitement.\u201d No provocation instruction was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">c. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant filed a motion for a new trial that focused on his claim that he was entitled to an instruction on reasonable provocation. The defendant supported his motion with the facts presented at trial in combination with facts contained in documents he submitted with his motion, including an affidavit from Hagen dated May 1, 2007; an abuse prevention order Hagen had obtained against Weymouth dated May 6, 2002, which was supported by separate affidavits of Hagen; and several journal articles on the effect of stalking on its victims. The defendant argues that based on these facts, a jury could have (1) inferred that there was evidence of objective and subjective provocation; (2) had reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant acted with malice; and (3) had reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant acted out of excessive use of force in self-defense, all justifying a manslaughter conviction. The defendant requested an evidentiary hearing, funds to retain an expert on the effects of stalking, a posthearing reduction of his conviction from murder in the first degree to manslaughter, or the granting of a motion for a new trial. The judge denied the motion without a hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u201cWhether an appeal is from the granting or the denial of a motion for a new trial, an appellate court will examine the motion judge\u2019s conclusion only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion. ... A reviewing court extends special deference to the action of a motion judge who was also the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Grace, 397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). Where the motion for a new trial does not \u201craise a substantial issue,\u201d an evidentiary hearing is not required. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. 596, 608 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The judge did not err in denying the motion for a new trial without holding a hearing because the defendant\u2019s motion did not raise a substantial issue. Hagen was not called as a witness at trial. The judge permissibly could discredit Hagen\u2019s supporting statements in her later affidavit concerning Weymouth\u2019s abuse of her and his alleged stalking, the defendant\u2019s statement to her that he feared that Weymouth was going to kill him, her witnessing of the victim\u2019s presence on the defendant\u2019s property \u201ca week or so before the shooting,\u201d and her witnessing of an incident in which the dogs barked loudly at night. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Goodreau, 442 Mass. 341, 351 (2004). Furthermore, as the judge noted in her memorandum of decision and order denying the motion for a new trial, even if she had credited Hagen\u2019s statements, they were unavailing, in some instances because they were duplicative of facts presented at trial, and in others because they relied on inadmissible hearsay. See <em>id. </em>at 351 n.6. As the judge also concluded, the material the defendant submitted with his motion for a new trial did not fill crucial gaps in the trial record concerning whether the defendant was himself provoked by Weymouth\u2019s stalking, whether a reasonable person subject to stalking would lose the capacity for self-restraint and be prone to kill the stalker, and whether the defendant was, in the judge\u2019s words, \u201cdevoid of any ability to control his feelings\u201d when he killed Weymouth. We have reviewed the record; it is clear that the trial judge neither erred nor abused her discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass, at 608 (judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s motion and affidavit did not raise substantial issue entitled to substantial deference).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We have reviewed the entire record and find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>no reason to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the defendant\u2019s conviction or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The record does not indicate the exact number of telephone calls the defendant received or the dates on which they were received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The judge, however, did instruct the jury that they might consider evidence of mental impairment or intoxication on the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent, and specifically on questions of intent to kill with deliberate premeditation and whether the defendant acted with extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b116-12\">The defendant did request a manslaughter instruction based on the excessive use of force in self-defense, but not based on a theory of reasonable provocation, although the judge appeared to consider, and reject, the possibility of a reasonable provocation instruction.

See note 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\">At the very end of his brief, the defendant states in a footnote that his position before this court is \u201cthat no mental health expert was needed in this case to support a manslaughter instruction,\u201d but that if the court were to conclude otherwise, the defendant would like an opportunity to submit such evidence as part of further review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, or in support of a renewed motion for a new trial. Neither the record nor this single footnote sufficiently develops a claim about what role, if any, an expert witness might play in connection with the defendant\u2019s argument about reasonable provocation induced by stalking. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). We are not in a position to consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
