Everett, brought suit in the Superior Court alleging that his former employer, The 357 Corp. and Trans-Lease Group (collectively, the company), discriminated against him in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq. (2000 ed.), and the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B, when it did not permit him to return to work as a commercial truck driver after his discharge from a psychiatric hospital in 1996. In his complaint and pretrial pleadings, Everett asserted that he was seeking damages for wrongful actions occurring \u201cin February 1997 and thereafter.\u201d As we describe below, on February 14, 1997, in conformity with regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the company\u2019s physician declined to certify Everett as medically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">At trial, Everett changed his theory of liability to cover alleged acts of discrimination occurring only in 1999, expressly and repeatedly waiving all claims of discrimination by the company before 1999.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The company vigorously contested the \u201cwaiver\u201d of the earlier claims at every step. See <em>infra. </em>After the close of evidence, again over the company\u2019s vigorous objection, Everett moved to amend his complaint to conform to the evidence by asserting, among other things, a claim for damages based solely on his 1999 claims. The judge submitted both the 1996-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>1997 claims and the 1999 claims to the jury. The jury found that the company had acted lawfully in connection with Everett\u2019s 1996-1997 termination, but had discriminated against Everett by refusing to reinstate him in 1999. They awarded Everett damages in the amount of $757,701 on the 1999 claims. The trial judge then allowed Everett\u2019s motion to amend, and subsequently awarded Everett fees and costs in the amount of $370,678.58. The company appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Of the several grounds to vacate urged by the company, we consider only the dispositive issue whether the judge erred in permitting Everett\u2019s 1999 claims to go to the jury where, as we shall explain, he did not file a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) related to those claims. We conclude that Everett\u2019s failure to file a predicate complaint with MCAD deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction on the only claims for which the jury awarded Everett damages, his 1999 claims. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 9. The company\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on that ground should have been allowed. We set aside the jury verdict and the award of fees and costs, and remand the case to the Superior Court for the entiy of a judgment of dismissal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>We recite the relevant facts as the jury could have found them and, where relevant, include additional uncontested material. See <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., </em>446 Mass. 1, 3 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">a. <em>The events of 1996 and 1997. </em>This dispute has its origins in 1996. In late January or early February of 1996, Everett, who had been employed as a commercial truck driver by the company since 1986, was suspended for one month for sending an inappropriate letter to a woman coworker. Fearing that his job was in jeopardy, Everett contacted Dr. Lillian Sober-Ain, a clinical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>psychologist, for mental health treatment. Dr. Sober-Ain diagnosed Everett as suffering from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and posttraumatic stress disorder with delayed onset.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Everett returned to work but, as he testified at trial, when he did so, he was \u201cvery nervous,\u201d and \u201cI thought I was being followed by different people, groups of people, whether it be the company, or that girl.\u201d Everett\u2019s mother testified that, when her son returned to work, \u201che started telling us\u201d that the women who were \u201cinvolved in his being suspended were following him to his work places.\u201d Everett\u2019s mother also testified that, in June, 1996, while Everett was visiting his family, she became concerned because \u201che was very upset and yelling about these girls,\u201d saying \u201cthey\u2019re following me again.\u201d He would \u201csometimes\u201d ran outside in the dark, stating that \u201che heard something,\u201d \u201cthought somebody was trying to do something to his car,\u201d and said that he \u201cheard voices.\u201d His mother testified that her son began \u201cto seem a little paranoid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">A physician recommended by Everett\u2019s union was consulted by the family, who were told that Everett \u201ccould be a danger to himself or others and should be in the hospital.\u201d Everett\u2019s family persuaded him to receive treatment at Cape Cod Hospital, and then involuntarily committed him to Bournewood Hospital. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12. Everett remained an inpatient at Boumewood Hospital for two weeks, during which time he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His treating physician at that hospital testified that Everett\u2019s condition was a \u201clifelong\u201d illness. On his discharge on July 9, 1996, Everett was given prescriptions for antipsychotic medications, including Haldol and Cogentin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Following his discharge from Boumewood Hospital, Everett sought to return to work with the company. Consistent with Federal regulations governing the commercial trucking industry, <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the company required Everett to be medically evaluated to determine whether he remained physically and mentally qualified under DOT regulations to drive heavy commercial vehicles on the public roads. Dr. David M. Roston, a psychiatrist at Atlantic Health Group, conducted the evaluation. On July 18, 1996, based on his examination, Dr. Roston refused to issue Everett a medical examination certification of fitness to drive a commercial motor vehicle (DOT certificate) at that time. Dr. Roston also recommended to the company that Everett \u201cundergo an independent psychiatric evaluation.\u201d On September 26, 1996, at the company\u2019s request and expense, Everett was evaluated by psychiatrist Dr. Roy Lubit. Using criteria established by the DOT, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(9), Dr. Lubit concluded that \u201cI cannot certify this individual as healthy to drive.\u201d Dr. Lubit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>stated that he had \u201cdiscussed this issue with Dr. Roston who agrees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Everett then sought an examination by a doctor of his own choosing, Dr. James R. Bieber. On January 25, 1997, Dr. Bieber evaluated Everett to determine whether \u201che is able to return to his job of driving a truck while on medication.\u201d Dr. Bieber concluded that Everett \u201cis able to return to the work of driving a truck,\u201d noting, however, that Everett should be \u201ccarefully\u201d monitored, and that either emotional or physical stress \u201ccould lead to another decompensation.\u201d Dr. Bieber\u2019s report made no reference to DOT qualification requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Dr. Roston reviewed Dr. Bieber\u2019s report and the mental health qualification requirement of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41, and on February 14, 1997, reported to the company that, although Everett was responding well to his medications, \u201che has the risk of future psychotic episodes which could interfere with his ability to safely operate a truck.\u201d In light of the requirements of the DOT regulations, he again declined to issue the DOT certificate. The company refused to permit Everett to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In February, 1997, Everett, through his union, filed a grievance seeking reinstatement. In connection with the grievance, Everett and the company sought a mutually agreed-upon third-party medical evaluation of Everett by an expert, whom Everett\u2019s business agent termed at trial \u201ca neutral third party.\u201d The parties agreed to have Dr. Lubit serve in that role. In a June 26, 1997, report that again cited DOT regulations, Dr. Lubit concluded: \u201cI cannot state that [Everett\u2019s] psychiatric problems will not be a problem. They are a continual risk to his driving and I would be unable to qualify him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">DOT regulations require drivers who wish to overturn adverse medical evaluations to appeal from the decision to the DOT.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the administrative appeal is pending, the driver is deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>not medically qualified to operate commercial motor vehicles. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.47(f) (where driver and motor carrier disagree about medical certification, \u201cthe driver <em>shall be deemed disqualified </em>until such time as the [DOT] makes a determination\u201d [emphasis added]). See <em>Carolina Freight Carriers </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm\u2019n, 99 </em>Pa. Commw. 428, 436 (1986) (\u201cwhere there is a conflict in the medical evidence a driver will remain <em>unqualified </em>until the federal government decides to the contrary\u201d [emphasis in original]). Everett did not file an appeal with the DOT at any time to review the adverse conclusion of the mutually agreed-upon medical specialist, Dr. Lubit. He did, however, through his union, file a request to arbitrate his grievance. The arbitration panel dismissed Everett\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">On July 3, 1997, one week after Dr. Lubit had declined a second time to certify Everett as medically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle, Everett filed a charge of discrimination with the MCAD, which also was filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He asserted, among other things, that in June, 1996, he \u201cwent on a medical leave of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>absence,\u201d that he was \u201cwell enough to return to work in July, 1996 but [the company] refused to allow me to return,\u201d and that the company \u201chas refused to return me to work because of my perceived disability, even though I am capable of performing the essential elements of my driver\u2019s position.\u201d On December 11, 1998, after an investigation, see 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13(7) (1993); G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, the MCAD issued a Lack of Probable Cause (LOPC) determination, and closed its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">At some point \u2014 no appeal date is indicated in the record \u2014 Everett administratively appealed from the LOPC determination; a hearing on his appeal was held on February 9, 1999. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.15(7)(d) (1999). On May 4, 1999, the investigating commissioner affirmed the LOPC determination \u201c[b]ased upon information presented at the appeal hearing and a review of the evidence adduced in investigation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">b. <em>The events of 1999. </em>In the meantime, and notwithstanding that both Dr. Roston and Dr. Lubit had refused to certify him as medically qualified in conformity with DOT regulations to drive commercial motor vehicles, Everett drove heavy commercial trucks for other employers. To obtain these jobs, beginning in 1997, Everett acquired at least five DOT certificates from various physicians. At trial Everett testified that he did not disclose to any of the certifying physicians his previous psychiatric history either during any medical examinations or on the forms required for each examination. To the contrary, when asked directly, he informed each examining physician that he had \u201cno\u201d history of a psychiatric disorder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See note 8, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Before January 12, 1999, the company had no knowledge</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>that Everett had acquired these DOT certificates and was driving commercial vehicles for other employers. On that date Everett initiated a second union grievance against the company, in which he sought \u201c[t]o be put back to work as a driver\u201d with \u201chis seniority and lost wages and benefits since January 12, 1999 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He asserted, through a union representative, that he had \u201cnew\u201d evidence to support his request. The \u201cnew\u201d evidence included, among other things, a personal affidavit, a driver\u2019s road test, a seniority list from the company dated September 9, 1998, that included his name, Dr. Bieber\u2019s evaluation of January 25, 1997, a letter from one employer stating that he had been qualified to serve as a \u201clead driver,\u201d a physical examination form from another employer, several DOT certificates obtained since 1997, and an affidavit from a union doctor attesting that \u201cit appears that Joe Everett is in remission\u201d from his emotional problems and his \u201ccase appears to be one in which any disabilities he incurred are now resolved and he has returned to normal baseline functioning\u201d sufficient to \u201cresume\u201d his duties with the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The company raised as a \u201cpoint of order\u201d to the 1999 grievance that the issue of Everett\u2019s medical qualification had been definitively resolved in the 1997 grievance, and that, based on the 1997 conclusions of Dr. Lubit and Dr. Roston, as upheld in the 1997 grievance proceeding, Everett was not DOT-certified to drive a commercial motor vehicle. The 1999 arbitration panel dismissed Everett\u2019s grievance. See <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Allied Sys., Inc., </em>36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>F. Supp. 2d 515, 522 (N.D.N.Y. 1999), quoting <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp., </em>918 F. Supp. 912, 918 (D. Md. 1996) (motor carrier \u201cnot required to accept the determination of . . . a physician for one of [the motor carrier\u2019s] competitors. \u2018As a matter of law, [the motor carrier] was not bound to accede to determinations made by medical professionals retained by its competitors; [the motor carrier] was entitled to rely on the determinations made by its medical professionals\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">2. <em>Procedural background. </em>We recount the procedural background in some detail, as befits the jurisdictional issue in this case. On February 11, 2000, approximately thirteen months after filing his second grievance and almost three years to the day from Dr. Roston\u2019s final rejection of Everett\u2019s DOT qualifications on February 14, 1997, Everett filed a complaint in the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9 (establishing three-year statute of limitations for filing discrimination claims pursuant to G. L. c. 15IB). The allegations of the complaint are ambiguous. Everett specifically referenced discrimination by the company \u201c[s]ince February 14, 1997,\u201d the date of Dr. Roston\u2019s letter reviewing and rejecting Dr. Bieber\u2019s opinion that Everett was medically certified to drive commercial trucks; it also referred to the MCAD\u2019s LOPC determination of December 11, 1998. The complaint alleged that the company \u201cfailed and refused to re-employ Everett\u201d or to offer him reasonable accommodation \u201ceven in the face of Mr. Everett\u2019s exemplary truck driving record with other companies\u201d since February 14,1997. The Superior Court complaint did not allege that any act of discrimination had occurred in 1999, did not allege that in 1999 Everett had presented the company with \u201cnew\u201d evidence about his mental health, and did not allege that the company had failed to rehire Everett in 1999 in the face of such \u201cnew\u201d evidence or otherwise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The complaint included a generally worded request for damages as a \u201cresult of [the company\u2019s] discriminatory actions.\u201d Fairly read, the complaint alleged that Everett had not been returned to work by the company on February 14, 1997, that his complaints of discrimination had been investigated by the MCAD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>and their basis found lacking in probable cause, and that Everett nevertheless had suffered damages for the alleged wrongs encompassed within the MCAD investigation that had ended in 1998. There was no allegation that the company did or did not do anything on January 12, 1999, or thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On July 31, 2000, the company moved to dismiss the complaint for failing to comply with the applicable statute of limitations, which period, the company argued, commenced in July, 1996, when Everett sought to return to work after his hospitalization. Everett opposed the motion. He argued that, while \u201cit was not clear in July 1996 that [the company\u2019s] refusal to allow Mr. Everett to return to work stemmed from a discriminatory animus,\u201d such animus was evident by February 14, 1997, when the company\u2019s refusal to reemploy him was based on a discriminatory perception that he was still mentally disabled. Thus, Everett continued, he had properly alleged a continuing violation, that \u201csave[d]\u201d what might otherwise have been the time-barred 1996 event. See <em>Cuddyer </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., </em>434 Mass. 521, 531-532 (2001); 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(2) (1999) (describing continuing violation doctrine). Neither party mentioned any events in 1999, either in their memoranda or in their reply memoranda; the entire focus of the motion was whether the 1997 event anchored the 1996 event and brought it within the statute of limitations by way of the continuing violation doctrine. The company\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">After lengthy and acrimonious discovery disputes not material to our decision, in April, 2005, the case proceeded to trial. In the October, 2004, joint pretrial statement of expected evidence, Everett asserted that his theory of liability was that the company\u2019s \u201ccontinuing\u201d refusal to allow him to return to work due to an \u201cunjustified\u201d perception that he still had a disability in \u201cFebruary, 1997 and thereafter\u201d constituted discrimination in violation of the Massachusetts and Federal antidiscrimination statutes. At the commencement of, and continuing throughout, the trial, however, Everett took the position that the <em>only </em>issue for resolution by the jury involved events that had occurred in January, 1999.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> His theory of liability now rested on the fact that in January, 1999, he had submitted to the company (in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>his second grievance) new evidence that he had been working safely as a DOT certified commercial truck driver for other companies since 1997, and that the company refused for discriminatory reasons to recognize his qualifications and to rehire him at that time. The company vigorously contested Everett\u2019s attempts to limit the evidence to events occurring in 1999. The company argued, in the main, that the 1999 claims were unrelated to the 1996-1997 events that formed the basis of Everett\u2019s MCAD complaint, and that, because Everett had not filed a MCAD complaint related to any 1999 action of the company, the 1999 claims should be dismissed. The judge denied Everett\u2019s attempts to limit the evidence to events beginning in January, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">During the trial, the parties submitted proposed jury verdict forms. Everett\u2019s proposed jury verdict form focused exclusively on questions from January, 1999, and going forward. In contrast, the company\u2019s proposed jury verdict form focused exclusively on the company\u2019s refusal to reinstate Everett in July, 1996. The judge\u2019s proposed solution was to \u201ccompromise\u201d to \u201creflect[ ] the different views,\u201d which he found essentially irreconcilable. His proposed jury verdict form included as a separate question the allegations of discrimination that occurred in July, 1996, and as a separate question the allegations of discrimination that occurred on January 12, 1999. The company objected to the judge\u2019s proposed verdict form \u201cbecause January 12, 1999 was never pied in the complaint\u201d and did not appear in \u201cthe [MCAD] charge of discrimination,\u201d and that \u201c[w]e only heard about 1999 two weeks ago when this trial began.\u201d Everett in turn objected to the judge\u2019s \u201ccompromise\u201d on the grounds that the questions would be confusing because \u201c[w]e\u2019re not making any claims for any damages that have occurred prior to January 12, [1999],\u201d and \u201cyou are placing a burden on the plaintiff to produce evidence . . . about claims that the plaintiff is not making.\u201d The judge refused to modify his proposed verdict form.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Everett\u2019s final, and most direct, attempt to refocus the trial on his claim that liability rested solely on events that occurred in January, 1999, took place the day the jury began their deliberations. That morning, Everett submitted a motion to amend the complaint to conform to the evidence. In his motion, Everett \u201cwaived <em>all </em>claims for damages <em>prior </em>to [January 12, 1999]\u201d (emphasis added). In his proposed amended complaint he claimed damages only for the \u201c[company\u2019s] discriminatory actions <em>on and after </em>January 12, 1999\u201d (emphasis added). Everett\u2019s counsel conceded that the move was a tactical one. He told the judge, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to make an argument for something we feel we may have difficulty proving. . . . Now, they don\u2019t like our theory of the case, and they don\u2019t like the fact that we\u2019ve switched.\u201d The company\u2019s counsel vigorously objected to the motion and stated that the company would press its argument that the 1999 claims were not before the MCAD in a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The judge reserved decision on Everett\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, and sent the case to the jury. In his closing argument, Everett\u2019s counsel made clear to the jury that \u201cMr. Everett is not making any claims whatsoever for any damages for events that occurred before January 12, 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The verdict form ultimately submitted to the jury required the jury to determine separately whether the company discriminated against Everett from \u201cJuly 1996 to January 1999,\u201d and separately whether the company discriminated against Everett in \u201cJanuary 1999.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As to the 1996-1997 claims, the jury found that the company \u201cterminate^]\u201d Everett in 1996 \u201cdue to a reasonable probability of substantial harm to the employee or others\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>(question 3A), i.e., the termination was lawful. They found that Everett was \u201cqualified to be a commercial truck driver\u201d in 1999 (question 2), and that the company\u2019s \u201cfailure to rehire\u201d him in 1999 was not for valid reasons (question 3B). The jury awarded Everett $757,701 for lost wages, insurance costs, and lost pension for the company\u2019s failure to allow him to return to work as a truck driver \u201cas of January 12, 1999\u201d (question 4). Stated differently, the jury found the company liable for its \u201cfailure to rehire\u201d Everett \u201cas of January 12, 1999\u201d only, and awarded damages to Everett on that basis alone. After the jury returned their verdict, the judge allowed Everett\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, to which the company again objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The following day, the company made good on its promise to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As one of the grounds for its motion, the company asserted that Everett could not pursue claims in the Superior Court based on events occurring in 1999 because Everett had neither filed a separate complaint with the MCAD pertaining to any 1999 conduct nor amended his earlier MCAD complaint to include allegations pertaining to 1999 events.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On June 1, 2005, the judge denied the company\u2019s motion. He subsequently allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Everett\u2019s motions for fees and costs in an amount of $370,678.58 and for entry of final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Against this factual and procedural background, we proceed to the issues for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict presents questions of law that we review under the same standard used by the trial judge. This requires us to construe the evidence in its light most favorable to the nonmoving party, here Everett, and to disregard that favorable to the moving party, here the company. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>449 Mass. 377, 383 (2007), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">a. <em>Statutory scheme. </em>We begin with a brief summary of the statutory scheme governing the scope of discrimination claims filed in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 151B and the ADA.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The MCAD has been charged by the Legislature with addressing certain types of discrimination in the Commonwealth, including handicap discrimination. See <em>Lynn Teachers Union, Local 1037 </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass. 515, 523 (1990). See also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (same for EEOC). To effectuate the statute\u2019s broad remedial purpose, G. L. c. 151B provides that, before a complaint may be filed in the Superior Court, a plaintiff must first file with the MCAD \u201ca verified complaint in writing,\u201d which shall \u201cset forth the particulars thereof and contain such other information as may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>be required by the commission.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. See G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 9; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (same for ADA claims). The purpose of the administrative filing is \u201c(1) to provide the MCAD with an opportunity to investigate and conciliate the claim of discrimination; and (2) to provide notice to the defendant of potential liability.\u201d <em>Cuddyer </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., </em>434 Mass. 521, 531 (2001). See <em>Galambos </em>v. <em>Fairbanks Scales, </em>144 F. Supp. 2d 1112, 1124-1125 (E.D. Mo. 2000) (to exhaust administrative remedies entitling claimant to bring action under ADA, claimant must give notice of claims of discrimination in administrative complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The predicate of administrative filing is mandatory to filing a civil suit. It may not be waived.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Without the predicate filing in MCAD, the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the claim of discrimination. See <em>Cuddyer </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., </em>434 Mass. 521, 531 n.ll (2001) (\u201cA claim cannot be brought alleging discrimination under G. L. c. 15IB, unless it is preceded by the filing of a complaint of unlawful discrimination with the MCAD within six months of the alleged act or acts of discrimination\u201d); <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., 417 </em>Mass. 580, 585 (1994) (Legislature intended \u201cto subject all discrimination claims [under G. L. c. 151B] to some administrative scrutiny\u201d); <em>Fant </em>v. <em>New England Power Serv. Co., </em>239 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2001) (\u201cA party who wants to file a civil action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>charging discrimination in employment under Chapter 151B must first file the charge with the MCAD\u201d). See also <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 557-558 (1996) (procedural requirements of G. L. c. 15 IB may not be evaded by attempting to recast c. 15 IB claims under other statutory provisions; court will not create new common-law remedies to evade c. 15IB procedural requirements). Cf. <em>National R.R. Passenger Corp. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002) (pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5, party must file a charge \u201cor lose the ability to recover for it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The mandatory administrative filing does not require a plaintiff to await a determination by the MCAD prior to filing a civil suit. General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 9, permits a plaintiff to remove the case to the Superior Court on \u201cthe expiration of ninety days after the filing of a complaint with the [MCAD], or sooner if a commissioner assents in writing.\u201d This requirement permits the MCAD to determine whether the public interest in enforcing antidiscrimination laws would be served by bringing a civil administrative proceeding under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. See <em>Cuddyer </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., supra </em>at 531; <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Waffle House, Inc., </em>534 U.S. 279, 292 (2002) (same for EEOC).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Where, as here, an MCAD investigation is completed, the plaintiff\u2019s administrative complaint establishes the nature of the specific charges of discrimination and the alleged factual underpinnings of those charges. The complainant may bring additional charges within the scope of the investigation by amending his MCAD complaint to \u201callege[] additional acts constituting unlawful discriminatory practices related to or arising out of the subject matter of the original complaint.\u201d 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(5) (1993).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Such amendments are made by \u201cleave of the Commissioner,\u201d and \u201crelate back to the original filing date.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>Ianetta </em>v. <em>Putnam Invs. Inc., </em>142 F. Supp. 2d 131, 134-135 (D. Mass. 2001) (new claims raised in plaintiff\u2019s rebuttal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>filed with MCAD are properly within scope of MCAD complaint). The administrative investigation, as originally set or as expanded during its course, then forms the factual platform for the finding of probable cause or lack of probable cause. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.15(7)(a)(b) (2008). Cf. <em>Lattimore </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., 99 </em>F.3d 456, 464-465 (1st Cir. 1996) (\u201cAn [administrative] investigation is a systematic inquiry into a particular matter. . . . [T]he direction and scope of the investigation are guided by the allegations contained in the charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Once a LOPC determination issues, the administrative investigation is closed. See 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13(7) (1993), currently codified at 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.15(7) (2008). An investigation that concludes with a finding of lack of probable cause may be appealed administratively at a preliminary hearing presided over by the commissioner who investigated the underlying complaint (or designee). <em>Id. </em>At the prehminary hearing on appeal, the complainant is permitted to \u201cpresent orally or in writing reasons why the Lack of Probable Cause determination is in error and to present such evidence in support of their argument as the Investigating Commissioner or . . . designee deems appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">b. <em>Scope of the Superior Court action. </em>In general, the MCAD complaint establishes the claims and factual allegations for the subsequent filing in Superior Court. \u201cThis generally means that a plaintiff cannot add additional claims . . . that are outside the scope of the MCAD charge . . . .\u201d S.C. Moriearty, J.F. Adkins, L.F. Rubin &amp; D.J. Jackson, Employment Law \u00a7 8.57, at 563-564 (2d ed. 2003). The purposes of G. L. c. 15 IB \u201cwould be frustrated if the claimant were permitted to allege one thing in the MCAD complaint only to allege something entirely different in the ensuing civil action.\u201d <em>Windross </em>v. <em>Village Automotive Group, Inc., </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 861, 864 (2008). See <em>Fantini </em>v. <em>Salem State College, </em>557 F.3d 22, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2009) (for cases filed with EEOC, \u201cthe scope of the civil complaint\u201d limited \u201cto the charge filed with the EEOC and the investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of that charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The general mie, however, does not mean that the administra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>five complaint sets a rigid \u201cblueprint\u201d for the civil action. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Grinnell Corp., </em>915 F.2d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 1990). Under what is often termed the \u201cscope of the investigation\u201d rule, \u201ca claim that is not explicitly stated in the administrative complaint may be asserted in the subsequent Superior Court action so long as it is based on the acts of discrimination that the MCAD investigation could reasonably be expected to uncover.\u201d <em>Windross </em>v. <em>Village Automotive Group, Inc., supra </em>at 864-865. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Grinnell Corp., supra </em>at 39, quoting <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Standard Brands, Inc., </em>431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970) (\u201cthe critical question is whether the claims set forth in the civil complaint come within the \u2018scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination\u2019 \u201d). Retaliation claims typically fall within the scope of investigation rule. See, e.g., <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>445 Mass. 611, 618 (2005) (retaliation for filing complaint with MCAD \u201csubsumed within the original charge\u201d). See also <em>Clockedile </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>245 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2001) (retaliation claims preserved so long as retaliation \u201creasonably related to and grows out of\u201d discrimination complained of to agency, e.g., \u201cretaliation is for filing the agency complaint itself\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Our general overview now brings us to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">c. <em>The 1999 claims. </em>On appeal, Everett invokes the scope of the investigation rule, asserting that his 1999 claims were \u201cencompassed\u201d by the MCAD filing, \u201creasonably related\u201d to his 1997 MCAD complaint, and within the scope of claims that the MCAD \u201ccould reasonably be expected to uncover.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">As a preliminary matter, we reject Everett\u2019s argument that the 1996-1997 claims were \u201cpending\u201d at the MCAD when the company refused to employ him in January, 1999.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The LOPC determination issued, and thus the investigation was completed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>in December 1998. Everett contends that his 1999 claims were in fact raised in the preliminary appeal from the LOPC determination, which was held before the MCAD investigating commissioner on February 9, 1999, approximately one month after the date of Everett\u2019s second union grievance filed on January 12, 1999. He has not, however, cited to any authority for the proposition that the MCAD preliminary appeals process permits the introduction of new allegations based on new facts not encompassed in the already completed administrative investigation being appealed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is a \u201cstretch\u201d to describe acts that occurred after the agency\u2019s investigation has ended as \u201c \u2018within\u2019 the scope of the agency investigation.\u201d <em>Clockedile </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dep\u2019t of Corrections, supra </em>at 5. Moreover, although the record contains a copy of the complaint filed with the MCAD, which was marked for identification but not introduced in evidence at trial, the record on appeal contains no evidence that Everett\u2019s 1999 grievance was part of the \u201cinformation presented\u201d at the preliminary appeal from the LOPC determination. The MCAD investigation closed on December 11, 1998, and the record reveals nothing that suggests that Everett sought to reopen the evidence, to amend his complaint, or to ask that \u201cnew\u201d facts be investigated, considered with, or encompassed within the 1996-1997 claims.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The 1999 claims manifestly were not \u201cpending\u201d when the MCAD investigation closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Nor can the 1999 claims fairly be said to be \u201creasonably related\u201d to the 1996-1997 claims or within the scope of the allegations the MCAD complaint could reasonably be expected to uncover.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Fatal to this argument, in the first instance, is Everett\u2019s extraordinary and often repeated concession during the trial that the company did not actionably discriminate against him in 1996 or 1997. This strategic choice on Everett\u2019s part effectively severed the connection between the 1996-1997 claims, which were the subject of the MCAD complaint, and the 1999 claims, which were not. If there was no discrimination in 1996-1997, then there was no discrimination to \u201crelate back\u201d to, or to come \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d in 1999. Because no discriminatory nexus connected the 1996-1997 and the 1999 events, the 1999 events became the only events that Everett alleged to be discriminatory; they were free-standing. Everett\u2019s civil suit on the 1999 claims was accordingly not preceded by a predicate MCAD complaint, and the case fails for want of jurisdiction. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. See <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Brink\u2019s, Inc., </em>414 F.3d 222, 229-230 (1st Cir. 2005) (under G. L. c. 151B, without an adverse discriminatory decision within the limitations period, \u201cdiscrimination inquiry simply stops\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Everett nonetheless invokes the scope of investigation rule, which applies, he argues, because his case is not about termination. Rather, he states, it turns on the company\u2019s discriminatory refusal to return him to work from a medical leave of absence, beginning in 1996-1997 (as alleged in the MCAD complaint) and continuing through and after January, 1999. The most obvious answer to this argument is that the jury found that Everett was \u201cterminated\u201d in 1996. See note 17, <em>supra. </em>On appeal Everett has not objected to the judge\u2019s terminology. In any event, given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>absence of any evidence in the record that Everett was paid by the company after July, 1996, and the introduction of considerable evidence that beginning at least by January, 1997, he was working for numerous other employers, we cannot say that a reasonable jury would have been precluded from finding, as they did, that Everett\u2019s employment relationship with the company ended (terminated) in 1996.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Everett also gains no benefit by claiming that the 1996-1997 events, which were the subject of the MCAD complaint, and the 1999 events, which were not, are \u201creasonably related\u201d because both claims \u201cstated the same cause of action and the same discriminatory conduct.\u201d The claims are readily distinguishable. The issue in 1996-1997 was whether Everett, newly discharged from a psychiatric hospital and on several antipsychotic medications, was DOT certifiable. This issue was resolved against him in his first grievance by the evaluation of the independent expert, Dr. Lubit, which the company and Everett himself selected. These conclusions permitted the company to terminate (or to refuse to reinstate) him for the lawful reason that he would likely be a danger to himself or others on the road, a point the jury specifically found, and that we discuss at greater length below. In 1999, on the other hand, the issue was whether the company refused for discriminatory reasons to accept Everett\u2019s bona tides as a DOT-certified driver who had a clean driving record, had passed numerous physical examinations for other employers, and who claimed he had been in remission since at least 1997. In sum, each claim was supported by distinct factual allegations.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Everett\u2019s difficulties on appeal are doctrinal as well as factual. Ordinarily, the decision to terminate or the failure to rehire an employee is considered a discrete, separate act that does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>draw other allegedly discriminatory acts into its scope, either prospectively or retrospectively. See <em>Marrero </em>v. <em>Goya of P.R., Inc., </em>304 F.3d 7, 18 (1st Cir. 2002), quoting <em>National Passenger Corp. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 109 (2002) (distinguishing hostile work environment claims, which are created by \u201crepeated conduct \u2014 a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice\u201d from discrimination claims, that \u201coccurred,\u201d for limitations purposes, \u201con the day that it happened\u201d). See also <em>DeFazio </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>849 F. Supp. 98, 102 (D. Mass. 1994), quoting <em>Daughtry </em>v. <em>King\u2019s Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., </em>608 F.2d 906, 909-910 (1st Cir. 1979) (defendant\u2019s termination of employment \u201cis a completed, one-time violation .... It was a one-time violation which had a continuing effect on plaintiff\u2019s life, but is not a continuing violation of Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In this case, that the 1999 refusal to employ Everett was discrete from, and unconnected to, the 1996-1997 events assumes a definitive cast by virtue of the jury\u2019s finding that the company\u2019s decision to terminate Everett in July, 1996, \u201cwas due to a reasonable probability of substantial harm to the employee or to others.\u201d In other words, the jury found that the initial termination of Everett was lawful. An employer may lawfully \u201cterminate or not hire a handicapped individual\u201d by proving \u201cthat there is a \u2018reasonable probability of substantial harm\u2019 to the employee or others.\u201d Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination Guidelines: Employment Discrimination on the Basis of Handicap \u00a7 X.C.3 (2007). Similarly, the ADA permits employers to require that an individual not \u201cpose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12113(b) (2006). Where an initial termination is lawful, an employee is not entitled, solely by virtue of his previous employment, to be rehired on request once he has corrected the grounds of the lawful termination. Rather, he must prove that the employer had a contractual obligation to rehire him, <em>Benima </em>v. <em>Smithsonian Inst., </em>471 F. Supp. 62, 65 (D. Mass. 1979) (presence of continuing \u201ccontractual duty\u201d to rehire may, in some instances \u201cjustify the finding of a continuing violation\u201d), or that he was discriminated against in the rehiring process by being treated differently from other applicants, particularly those who were previously lawfully discharged. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>e.g., <em>Loper </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>582 F.2d 956, 958 (5th Cir. 1978) (where plaintiffs\u2019 separation from service was lawful, airline bore \u201cno obligation\u201d to rehire employee or to grant plaintiffs seniority credit for prior employment).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Everett did not plead that the company violated contractual obligations to him in failing to employ him in 1999; indeed, the arbitration panel hearing this claim found that the collective bargaining agreement did not require that the company hire him in 1999. Nor did Everett show that the failure to hire him in 1999 applied to similarly situated prospective hirees of the company. Everett has claimed in his complaint only that he was entitled \u201cto be put back to work as a truck driver.\u201d Because the jury found that the company\u2019s 1996-1997 termination was lawful, Everett\u2019s reapplication in 1999, standing alone, became an insufficient ground to support a discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In sum, because the 1999 claims were unmoored from the 1996-1997 claims, both factually and as a matter of law, Everett\u2019s 1999 claims were not properly before the court; it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear them. The company\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been allowed on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">4. <em>Primary jurisdiction. </em>For the first time on appeal the company raises the issue of primary jurisdiction. In view of our ruling on the company\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, it is not necessary to address the point. We do so for two reasons: to clarify the considerable confusion surrounding the doctrine and because proper application of the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>demonstrates that this case should not have proceeded to trial in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Primary jurisdiction is a doctrine \u201cspecifically applicable to claims properly cognizable in court that contain some issue within the special competence of an administrative agency. It requires the court to enable a \u2018referral\u2019 to the agency, staying further proceedings so as to give the parties reasonable opportunity to seek an administrative ruling.\u201d <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>507 U.S. 258, 268 (1993). See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220-222 (1979). Like subject matter jurisdiction, primary jurisdiction is not waived by the failure of the parties to raise the issue; it may be raised by a court sua sponte. See <em>Distrigas of Mass. Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>693 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir. 1982) (well established that doctrine of primary jurisdiction \u201cis not waived by the failure of the parties to present it in the trial court or on appeal, since the doctrine exists for the proper distribution of power between judicial and administrative bodies and not for the convenience of the parties\u201d). See also <em>United States Pub. Interest Research Group </em>v. <em>Atlantic Salmon of Me., LLC, </em>339 F.3d 23, 34 (1st Cir. 2003) (interests served by doctrine of primary jurisdiction \u201care such that a court may choose to invoke it on its own even if neither side raises the concern\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Although we conclude there is no merit in the company\u2019s assertions regarding the effect of primary jurisdiction on the Superior Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, see note 34, <em>infra, </em>we agree with the company that primary jurisdiction applied throughout this case. See, e.g., <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp., </em>918 F. Supp. 912, 919 (D. Md. 1996) (where driver attempts to litigate his DOT qualifications in court rather than DOT, circumstances \u201cmilitate strongly in favor\u201d of application of primary jurisdiction). Because DOT had exclusive authority over the qualification issue, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>the judge was required to refer the issue to the agency. J. L. Mashaw, R. A. Merrill, &amp; EM. Shane, Administrative Law 1275-1278 (5th ed. 2003) (if agency has exclusive authority over issue before court, then referral to regulatory agency required). The company should have moved to stay the discrimination action, and the judge could have issued a stay sua sponte, to enable the parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>seek an administrative determination by the DOT concerning Everett\u2019s medical qualification to drive commercial motor vehicles.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Everett\u2019s first challenge in establishing his prima facie case was to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was qualified to perform the job he sought from the company.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Once Everett and the company\u2019s doctors disagreed whether Everett was qualified to perform his commercial driving duties, Federal law designated him as presumptively unqualified, a status that could only be reversed through an administrative appeal to the DOT. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>The question of his qualifications for his job \u2014 a dispositive prong of his prima facie case \u2014 was not for the jury, or for the judge, but for the DOT, subject to review by the United States Court of Appeals. See, e.g., <em>Bay </em>v. <em>Cassens Transp. Co., </em>212 F.3d 969, 974 (7th Cir. 2000) (driver\u2019s failure to obtain DOT certification \u201cfatal to his ADA claim\u201d); King vs. Mrs. Grissom\u2019s Salads, Inc., U.S. Ct.

See note 9, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>Seldom does an appeal present itself to us in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>posture that requires us to nullify an entire, completed civil jury trial. We recognize that considerable resources were expended by the parties and by the court, and that a judgment of dismissal notwithstanding the verdict is a drastic remedy. However, a fundamental tenet of law is that lack of subject matter jurisdiction is fatal to a plaintiff\u2019s claims. See, e.g., <em>ROPT Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Katin, </em>431 Mass. 601, 605 (2000) (where court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, \u201cthe judgment is void\u201d). We are constrained in the circumstances to add the following observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">First, Everett was represented by counsel before the MCAD and throughout this action. \u201cWhen a plaintiff retains an attorney during the limitations period, he or she is charged with constructive knowledge of all procedural requirements.\u201d <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>758 F. Supp. 54, 60 (D. Mass. 1991), and cases cited. There is no suggestion that Everett or his counsel were unable to file an MCAD complaint related to events that transpired in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Second, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction over the 1999 claims was a live issue in this case from its inception. See generally part 2, <em>supra. </em>Neither Everett nor his counsel reasonably could be surprised by the appearance of the jurisdictional issue on appeal. Finally, we note the effort by MCAD, both in its amicus brief and in a postargument letter to which there has been no objection by Everett, to voice its objection to Everett\u2019s position that the 1999 claims were before the MCAD. We give great deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its rules and authority. See <em>Cuddyer </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., </em>434 Mass. 521, 534 (2001), quoting <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 206 (1982) (\u201cprimary responsibility\u201d to determine scope of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, \u201chas been entrusted to the MCAD, not to the courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">For the reasons stated above, the motion for judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>notwithstanding the verdict should have been allowed. We set aside the jury verdict and the award of fees and costs, and remand the case to the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\">See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.1 (1991) (regulation promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of the United States Department of Transportation [DOT] describing rules establishing \u201cminimum qualifications for persons who drive motor vehicles\u201d for motor carriers, and \u201cminimum duties of motor carriers with respect to the qualifications of their drivers\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-11\">We designate Everett\u2019s allegations of discriminatory action by the company concerning events that occurred in 1996 and 1997 as the \u201c1996-1997 claims,\u201d and allegations of discriminatory action by the company concerning events that occurred in 1999 and thereafter as the \u201c1999 claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) in support of the company, and the brief submitted by the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race &amp; Justice, the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law of the Boston Bar Association, Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, Greater Boston Legal Services on behalf of the Chelsea Collaborative, Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action, Massachusetts Employment Lawyers Association, and Massachusetts Law Reform Institute in support of Everett.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">At trial, Dr. Lillian Sober-Ain testified that she arrived at the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder based on traumatic experiences Everett related involving a former girl friend.

It is not clear to what extent his psychiatrist or psychotherapist are in agreement with his plans, it seems the patient is refusing treatment at this time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b611-12\">As the driver of a commercial motor vehicle, Everett was subject to certain regulations promulgated by the DOT pursuant to congressional authority. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31102(a) (2006 ed.). The regulations prohibit motor carriers from employing as a commercial truck driver any individual who does not have a DOT certificate attesting to his physical and mental fitness to drive.

See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.43 (1996). To obtain a DOT certificate, DOT regulations explicitly state that a driver have \u201cno mental . . . disease or psychiatric disorder likely to interfere with his/her ability to drive a commercial motor vehicle safely.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(9) (1996).

It is counsel\u2019s obligation to include in the record appendix any document on which he relies: \u201cWhen a party fails to include a document in the record appendix, an appellate court is not required to look beyond that appendix to consider the missing document.\u201d <em>Chokel </em>v. <em>Genzyme Corp., </em>449 Mass. 272, 279 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In a postargument letter filed by the MCAD, it stated that the records from the preliminary appeal had long since been destroyed in accordance with the Secretary of the Commonwealth\u2019s record retention policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Everett does not claim that the refusal to employ him in 1999 was in retaliation for his filing an MCAD complaint in 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Everett did submit at trial a union seniority list from the company on which his name appeared. The list was dated September 9, 1998, before the 1999 claims arose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In his Superior Court complaint, Everett also claimed that the company refused to make reasonable accommodation for his perceived disability. See <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>553 F.3d 121, 125 (1st Cir. 2009) (\u201cUnder both the ADA and Chapter 15IB, employers are required to assist an otherwise qualified employee who has a disability by providing reasonable accommodations that would enable him to perform his job. 42U.S.C. \u00a7 12112[b][5][A]; [G. L. c.] 151B, \u00a7 4 [16]\u201d). At a bench conference Everett\u2019s counsel expressly waived the reasonable accommodation claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Even when a past termination is discriminatory, if a terminated employee does not file a charge of discrimination within the statutory period, the employer is \u201centitled to treat [the termination] as lawful.\u201d <em>United Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977) (\u201cA discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a timely charge ... is merely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences\u201d). See <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Level 3 Communications, LLC, </em>456 F.3d 1215, 1226 (10th Cir. 2006), quoting <em>United Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, supra </em>(where \u201cpresent [timely] employment decision was \u2018neutral in its operation,\u2019 the past discriminatory policy could not be the basis\u201d of employee\u2019s claim because an employer is \u201c \u2018entitled to treat that past act as lawful\u2019 when [an employee] fail[s] to file a timely charge of discrimination\u201d); <em>Croy </em>v. <em>Cobe Lab., Inc., </em>345 F.3d 1199, 1203 (10th Cir. 2003) (\u201cAn employer\u2019s refusal to undo a discriminatory decision is not a fresh act of discrimination\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\">A determination that primary jurisdiction over an issue in a civil case resides with an administrative agency requires that the case be stayed or dismissed to permit the administrative agency the opportunity to issue its determination. A court \u201chas discretion either to retain jurisdiction\u201d over the claim by issuing a stay, \u201cor, if the parties would not be unfairly disadvantaged, to dismiss the case without prejudice.\u201d <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>507 U.S. 258, 268-269 (1993). See <em>J. &amp; J. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Martignetti, </em>369 Mass. 535, 540 (1976) (when \u201cdismissal may give rise to serious problems in the application of the statute of limitations,\u201d in such cases \u201cthe proper course may be to stay the action instead of dismissing it\u201d). Here, where we have found that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the 1999 claims, we will not speculate on subsequent events had the parties or the judge invoked the doctrine of primary jurisdiction at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\u201cTo state a prima facie claim of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) he was disabled within the meaning of the Act; (2) he was a qualified individual, i.e. able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he was discharged because of his disability.\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Health Research Inst., Inc., </em>209 F.3d 29, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2000). \u201cTo establish a prima facie case for employment discrimination on the basis of handicap [under G.

A discrimination claim may be brought in State or Federal court even where one aspect of the claim \u2014 in this case commercial driver qualifications \u2014 requires agency resolution. But DOT, which has no authority to address Everett\u2019s allegations of discrimination, could provide no remedy that could be exhausted. See <em>Austin Lakes Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Avon Utils., Inc., </em>648 N.E.2d 641, 646 &amp; n.5 (Ind. 1995) (\u201cWhere at least one of the issues or claims is a matter for judicial determination or resolution, the court is not ousted of subject matter jurisdiction by the presence in the case of one or more issues which arguably are within the jurisdiction of an administrative or regulatory agency\u201d). The exhaustion doctrine is \u201cinapplicable\u201d where an agency has \u201cno power to decree . . . relief.\u201d <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>507 U.S. 258, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>269 (1993). The company\u2019s conflation of administrative exhaustion and primary jurisdiction \u201creflects a mistaken understanding of primary jurisdiction,\u201d which applies to claims that are already \u201cproperly cognizable in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268. \u201c[D]ismissing a case\u201d for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \u201cin order to get an agency opinion on one issue,\u201d rather than applying primary jurisdiction to stay or dismiss the case (see note 32, <em>supra), </em>\u201cis tantamount to confusing primary jurisdiction with the exhaustion doctrine.\u201d J.L.
