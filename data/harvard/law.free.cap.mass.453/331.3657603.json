A jury rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he was not criminally responsible under the standards set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967), and convicted him of murder in the first degree (of Valli) by reason of deliberate premeditation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the jury convicted the defendant of armed assault with intent to murder Pelletier and assault and battery of Pelletier by means of a dangerous weapon. Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues error in the exclusion of evidence, in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, and in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. We affirm all of the convictions, and discern no basis to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\"><em>The trial. </em>Based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the jury could have found the following facts. On September 13, 2001, Valli and Pelletier, who had long known each other and had been dating since the previous April, invited some friends, including the defendant, to see their new apartment in Newburyport. Valli was twenty-one years of age; Pelletier was nineteen years of age; and the defendant was twenty years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Pelletier had been a close friend of the defendant for a couple of years. One or two years before she and Valli began living together, Pelletier had the \u201cbeginning of a romantic relationship\u201d with the defendant, which involved some kissing. The romance went no further, and the two remained good friends. The defendant and Valli also were good friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>At around 8 p.m. on September 13, the defendant arrived at the victims\u2019 apartment with his friend James Arnold. They joined the guests and spent the evening talking, listening to music, and drinking. There were no arguments or disagreements, and everyone at the gathering was \u201cin good spirits.\u201d The group engaged in some discussion about the events of September 11, and the defendant expressed concern that his brother, a Marine, would be deployed to Afghanistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">At about 10:30 p.m., after most of the other guests had left, Arnold decided to leave; the defendant was the only guest remaining. Pelletier invited the defendant to stay the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">A little later, Valli went to bed. There was no bedroom in the apartment, which was similar to a studio apartment. Pelletier and Valli slept on a mattress in a hallway area; during the day, they propped the mattress up against a hallway wall. That evening, Valli slept on the left edge of the mattress, which was near a wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The defendant and Pelletier stayed up and talked. The defendant relayed that he and his girl friend intended to \u201cget their own place.\u201d They discussed the recent terrorist attacks, and the defendant became \u201cemotional about his brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">At 1:30 a.m., September 14, Pelletier went to bed and told the defendant that he could sleep on the mattress with her and Valli. Pelletier positioned herself in the middle of the mattress, and the defendant lay down beside her.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">A few minutes later, Valli got up to get some cereal. Five or ten minutes after that, the defendant also arose and left the hallway area. Pelletier moved toward the wall, keeping her left ear on the mattress. Because she had difficulty hearing out of her right ear, sleeping that way helped her sleep better. About ten minutes later, Pelletier had the \u201csensation\u201d of someone returning to the mattress.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">At approximately 3 a.m., the defendant took a large knife from the kitchen, went over to Valli, who was sleeping on the mattress, and stabbed him. Valli stood up and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The defendant threw him against a wall and stabbed him again. The defendant then threw Valli back down on the mattress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Valli suffered multiple stab and incised wounds in the area of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>left upper arm, back, and chest. One of the stab wounds to Val-li\u2019s chest penetrated his left lung and heart, and by itself would have been fatal. The knife used by the defendant broke. Valli died as a result of his wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The defendant went into the kitchen area and retrieved a second knife that was shorter and wider, similar to a cleaver. Using this, he attacked Pelletier. Pelletier woke up to find the defendant at the foot of the mattress, stabbing her in the shoulder. She screamed, and the defendant cut her hand as she tried to stand up. Once she stood up, the defendant stopped and retreated to the bathroom. He then left the apartment. Pelletier suffered stab wounds on her face, right hand, shoulder, arm, and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Pelletier screamed to the defendant to dial 911. The defendant returned to the apartment and dialed 911. With a flat affect, he told the operator, \u201cI just stabbed two people,\u201d and provided the address of the apartment. A few minutes later, the defendant contacted the 911 operator again. In an angry voice, he stated, \u201cI just fucking called and I stabbed two people.\u201d The defendant asked why help had not arrived. In response to questions from the operator, he provided his name and the names of the victims. The defendant also stated that he was \u201cgoing insane,\u201d that he believed that [Valli] was dead, and that \u201cthere\u2019s blood everywhere.\u201d The defendant sounded upset. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m fucked up man,\u201d \u201cI cannot believe I did this,\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s fucking dead dude, hurry up.\u201d Seconds later, the defendant yelled, \u201cHe\u2019s fucking dead!\u201d A few seconds later, the defendant, in an angry voice asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they here man?\u201d The operator stated that help was there and directed the defendant to \u201cbuzz the door.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cThey\u2019re not even fucking here,\u201d and was agitated about having to \u201cbuzz the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Sergeant Richard McCarthy of the Newburyport police department responded to the scene a few minutes later. He encountered the defendant outside the apartment. The defendant was not wearing a shirt, and his arms and pants were covered in blood. The defendant loudly asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the ambulance? Where\u2019s the ambulance?\u201d He then told Sergeant McCarthy, \u201cI\u2019m the one that did it. I\u2019m the one that stabbed them.\u201d Another officer, Ronald <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Senter, handcuffed the defendant and put him in the back of his police cruiser. Inside the apartment, Valli was lying facedown on the mattress and was covered in blood. On the walls near the mattress, there were cast off bloodstains<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and medium velocity impact spatter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">An ambulance arrived. Sergeant McCarthy asked the defendant if he needed medical attention. The defendant replied that he did not. He also stated, \u201cI\u2019m crazy. I\u2019m off my medication. I just went berserk.\u201d The defendant then asked, \u201cAre they alright: I think [Valli\u2019s] dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">At the police station, the defendant was given Miranda warnings and, at about 4:45 a.m., gave a statement to police. He appeared to be sober and was not slurring his words. In his statement, the defendant recounted the following. He lived with his parents and younger sister, worked at a local restaurant, and had not graduated from high school due to a long-standing problem he had with depression. He had been diagnosed with having depression five years before. He was taking a prescription medication for his depression, Celexa, and his daily dose was recently doubled to forty milligrams. The defendant acknowledged that, while taking this medication, he should not consume alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The defendant further told the police that he had been a friend of the victims for many years. At their apartment, he drank about six bottles of \u201cMike\u2019s Hard Lemonade\u201d and four \u201ctwisted teas.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After going to bed on the mattress with the victims, he woke up and heard voices inside his head. The voices told him \u201cto take them out.\u201d He went to the kitchen area of the apartment and retrieved a knife. He lay on the mattress and \u201cwas there for about five minutes and [was] thinking of where I should put it first.\u201d He then repeatedly stabbed Valli, who woke up, stood up, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Because the knife with which he had stabbed Valli broke, the defendant went back to the kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to get another knife. He then stabbed Pelletier, who was sleeping on the mattress. When Pelletier yelled, \u201cWhat are you doing? Call 911,\u201d \u201csomething snapped,\u201d and the defendant \u201creturned to normal.\u201d The defendant stated that he and Pelletier were no more than friends, and that there was no reason for his actions. He further remarked that the victims \u201cwere just at the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d and that he was \u201csorry\u201d for \u201cwhat [he] did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We now summarize the defense case. The defendant did not testify. Through cross-examination of the prosecutor\u2019s witnesses, the defendant maintained that the police had not properly investigated the case insofar as they failed to pursue the defendant\u2019s claim of hearing voices.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Several lay witnesses testified for the defense, including the defendant\u2019s mother, father, and sister. The defendant was one of five children. Commencing in his youth, he had consistent nightmares. When he was in first grade, it was discovered that he had learning disabilities and he was provided with special education services. He continuously received special education services until he dropped out of high school during his senior year.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Sometime around or after the defendant completed the eighth grade, his mood changed and he became reclusive. This condition became more severe when he turned sixteen years of age. The defendant broke a lot of household rules and had repeated conflicts with his parents. He moved out of the house for a while and lived with a friend. After his father brought him back home to live, the defendant attempted to commit suicide by ingesting numerous pills, and was hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">When the defendant came home, he appeared to be even more depressed. He started to see a psychologist, and later started taking Prozac, an antidepressant medication. He seemed to be nicer to others when he was on his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The defendant\u2019s depression did not thereafter improve. In May or June of 2001, he told his younger sister that he was hearing angry voices that were telling him to do bad things. She told him that if he had problems with the voices, he could page her and she would come and get him. Thereafter, and through September 14, 2001, the defendant would page his younger sister about three times per week. He appeared to be very depressed and emotionless during the summer of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>On August 15, 2001, the defendant went to an appointment with a different health care professional, Anita Freeman. At that appointment, his antidepressant medication, now Celexa, was doubled from twenty milligrams to forty milligrams. After this appointment, he was agitated. He told his mother that he was hearing angry voices that were telling him to do bad things.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He was crying and stated that he could not stand the pain in his head any longer. The defendant\u2019s mother made him an appointment for August 28, at a different health care facility that they had not previously visited.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">At that appointment, the defendant saw Dr. Thomas Mc-Donough, a psychologist. The defendant indicated that he did not believe that his current medication, Celexa, was working, that he was depressed and not sleeping well. He stated that ideas of suicide came and went, and that he felt some \u201cweird stuff.\u201d He also acknowledged \u201cexcessive\u201d alcohol consumption a few times per week, as well as previous drag use. After speaking with the defendant, Dr. McDonough was satisfied that the defendant could work through his issues and make it to the next appointment without harming himself or others. Dr. McDonough diagnosed him as suffering from alcohol abuse and dysthymic depression.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant did not tell Dr. McDonough that he was hearing or had heard voices.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Following his arrest, forensic psychologist Dr. Lorraine Sel-sor was assigned to evaluate the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Dr. Selsor interviewed the defendant on September 14, 2001. He appeared depressed, withdrawn, and sad. He was not very verbal, and made little eye contact with her. He told Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Selsor that he had been experiencing auditory hallucinations since he was a teenager, and that he had been hearing voices when he stabbed the victims. Dr. Selsor recommended that the defendant undergo further evaluation to determine competency and criminal responsibility. She also advised that he be placed on \u201csuicide precautions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The defendant also presented the testimony of two experts, psychologist Robert H. Joss and forensic psychiatrist Montgomery C. Brower, to support his claim that he was not criminally responsible under the standards set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). Both had evaluated the defendant prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Based on his review of records, interviews with the defendant, interviews with the defendant\u2019s parents, and psychological testing, Dr. Joss concluded that, at the time of the stabbings, the defendant suffered from a mental disease, namely, major depression with an overlay of a schizotypal personality disorder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Dr. Joss opined that the defendant had some degree of brain dysfunction, which was supported by the fact that he required special education services and had large discrepancies between verbal and performance intelligence test scores (suggesting a left hemisphere brain problem). Dr. Joss expressed the opinion that, at the time of the stabbings, the defendant was suffering from a mental disease (and possibly mental defect) that deprived him of the substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and interfered with his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Dr. Brower rendered his opinion based on his review of materials that Dr. Joss consulted, as well as photographs of the defendant taken shortly after his arrest, and certain tests that he ordered, including an MRI brain scan and an electroencephalogram, which traces electrical activity in the brain, both of which came back \u201cnormal.\u201d He also interviewed the defendant, as well as the defendant\u2019s parents and people who knew the defendant socially. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Dr. Brower concluded that, at the time of the stabbings, the defendant was mentally ill and was experiencing psychotic symptoms (but was not psychotic). Dr. Brower explained that the defendant\u2019s psychotic symptoms could have resulted from his schizotypal personality disorder, his history of alcohol and drug use, and temporal lobe dysfunction. Dr. Brower concluded that, at the time of the stabbings, the defendant\u2019s psychotic symptoms interfered with his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. He also expressed his opinion that, if the defendant had had a seizure on account of temporal lobe epilepsy, then that would have deprived him of the substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. Both Dr. Joss and Dr. Brower rejected any malingering by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">To rebut the defendant\u2019s expert evidence, the Commonwealth called two expert witnesses, Dr. Ira K. Packer, a psychologist, and Dr. Malcolm P. Rogers, a psychiatrist. Dr. Packer, the director of forensic service in psychology at Bridgewater State Hospital, evaluated the defendant to determine competency and criminal responsibility. He reviewed police reports, Dr. Selsor\u2019s report, and other materials, and conducted three different psychological tests. He also interviewed the defendant on five separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Dr. Packer testified that the psychological test results \u201cwere not really consistent with somebody having a real mental illness,\u201d and showed that although the defendant experienced depression, he was not psychotic. Dr. Packer explained that a person having a genuine psychotic disorder would ordinarily hear voices coming from outside his head, not from within his head, which is what the defendant reported. The defendant\u2019s account that he was lying on the mattress for five minutes thinking of where to stab Valli was inconsistent with someone who is compelled to respond to command auditory hallucinations, because a person experiencing such hallucinations does not reflect. The defendant\u2019s lack of remorse also suggested that he lacked a genuine psychotic disorder. Dr. Packer explained that it is very unusual to have a psychotic break for only as long as the crime lasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">According to Dr. Packer, the defendant did not meet the criteria for having a schizotypal personality disorder. Although he had a history of depression, the defendant\u2019s depression was not severe on the day of the stabbings. Dr. Packer expressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>opinion that the defendant had the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Significant to his conclusion were the facts that the defendant, by his own account, was able to think for five minutes about where to stab Valli, and was able to retrieve a second knife after the first broke.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Based on his review of records and reports, the defendant\u2019s telephone calls to 911, and an interview with the defendant, Dr. Rogers also expressed the opinion that the defendant was criminally responsible when he stabbed Valli and Pelletier. Dr. Rogers testified that the defendant did not have a schizotypal personality disorder. He explained that, although the defendant suffered from depression, it did not reach \u201cpsychotic proportions\u201d and he was not experiencing a psychotic episode at the time of the stabbings. Significant to Dr. Rogers\u2019s determination were the following factors: the defendant heard voices only inside his head (not outside); the defendant experienced no delusions (a false belief that is clearly improbable and not logical); psychosis is not brief, and usually lasts hours, a day, and more typically weeks and months, not minutes; and psychosis occurs and ends gradually, not abruptly. Dr. Rogers added that neither the defendant\u2019s failure to take Celexa, nor his failure to heed the warning to avoid drinking while taking Celexa, would trigger a psychotic event. Dr. Rogers rejected the suggestion that the defendant suffered temporal lobe seizures. He came to this conclusion based on a lack of evidence that the defendant engaged in some kind of repetitive behaviors indicative of seizure activity, such as odd movements, lip smacking, or hand wringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Evidentiary issues. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in excluding the testimony of two friends who would have testified that the defendant told them that he had heard voices in the past.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The issue was first raised prior to opening statements when defense counsel represented that he intended to call witnesses who would testify that the defendant told them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>he heard or was hearing voices, to prove that the defendant was in fact hearing voices. The judge ruled that the statements were hearsay, but might be admissible to prove the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the relevant time under the exception for statements of present condition, citing Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (3). The judge further opined that to be admissible under this exception the statements must have been made close to September 14 and must reflect the defendant\u2019s then present state of mind \u2014 and not, for example, be statements of the defendant that he had heard voices in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The issue next arose after defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of one of the investigating State troopers. During that cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony that the trooper did not ask any of the defendant\u2019s family or friends whether the defendant had told them that he heard voices. This questioning was part of the defendant\u2019s effort to establish that the police had conducted an inadequate investigation and purposefully avoided gathering evidence that might have confirmed the defendant\u2019s story that he heard voices telling him to stab the victims. In response, the prosecutor elicited testimony from several witnesses called to testify about the defendant and the party on September 13, to the effect that the defendant never told them he heard voices. There was no objection to these questions. However, after their testimony, defense counsel argued that the prosecutor had \u201copened the door\u201d to testimony by persons whom the defendant had told about hearing voices, and that he should be entitled to \u201cput it all on\u201d in rebuttal. The judge disagreed that any door had been opened, and held to his prior ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The next day, at the beginning of the defense case, defense counsel again raised the issue, arguing that the statements were not being offered for their truth (i.e., that the defendant was actually hearing voices), but as \u201csymptoms of the mental illness.\u201d In revisiting the issue, the judge rejected this argument and affirmed his prior ruling that the statements were being offered for \u201cthe truth of the matter that [the defendant was] hearing voices,\u201d but that they were probably admissible under the hearsay \u201cexception of declaration of mental condition.\u201d He then ruled that defense witnesses would be able to testify that the defendant told them he was hearing voices, even if those conversations occurred months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>before September 14, so long as the statements were to the effect that the defendant was then hearing voices, and not statements about hearing voices sometime in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">As noted above, a number of defense witnesses, including the defendant\u2019s mother; his younger sister; and two friends, Rebecca Provencher and Joshua Marshall, proceeded to testify about statements the defendant made to them about hearing voices in the months leading up to September 14. Two other witnesses, Katelyn Frothingham and Kyle Harris, friends of the defendant, were not permitted to testify on this subject because the judge concluded, after a voir dire, that the statements made to them were statements about hearing voices in the past, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>and the judge ruled that they did not fall within the exception for statements of present mental condition (or state of mind).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">There was no error. The statements were plainly offered for their truth, that is, that the defendant was hearing voices (a symptom of mental illness),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the exception for statements of a declarant\u2019s present state of mind was inapplicable. The judge\u2019s ruling that the statements made to Frothingham and Harris fell outside of the exception because they were statements concerning the defendant\u2019s past rather than his present state of mind was a reasonable application of the rule. The defendant\u2019s argument, if accepted, would in effect allow the exception to swallow the rule. Moreover, in the context of the entire trial, it is unlikely that the statements of Frothingham and Harris would have had any effect on the verdict. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). The proffered statements were cumulative of other admitted evidence from the defendant\u2019s family and friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the testimony of Frothingham and Harris was admissible rebuttal evidence. \u201cA judge has broad discretion to permit rebuttal testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>433 Mass. 45, 51 (2000). \u201cRebuttal is legitimate when it responds to the opponent\u2019s case; ... the judge . . . has nearly unreversible discretion to allow [or refuse to allow] it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 89 (1996). The defendant overlooks that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>testimony of the prosecution witnesses was elicited in response to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of one of the police officers. The prosecutor\u2019s questioning of these witnesses showed that police failure to inquire about the defendant hearing voices had not hindered the police investigation and, essentially, was of no consequence because the defendant had not told them anything with regard to the subject. This line of questioning was proper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 42, 50-51 (2000) (prosecutor may rebut defendant\u2019s theory of defense). The judge acted within his considerable discretion to exclude the testimony of Frothingham and Harris as further \u201crebuttal\u201d evidence because, in the context of trial, the testimony of Frothing-ham and Harris did not rebut the testimony of the witnesses that the defendant did not tell them that he heard voices. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">2. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument contained an improper comment on motive that lacked support in the evidence and improperly spoke to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Remarks made during closing arguments are considered in the context of the whole argument, the evidence admitted at trial, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>432 Mass. 657, 659 (2000), and cases cited. Before closing arguments commenced, the judge instructed the jury that the closing arguments of counsel do not constitute evidence. In his final charge, the judge told the jury that what the lawyers say is not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">a. We first take up the defendant\u2019s contention that several portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument regarding motive were unsupported by evidence. The five challenged passages are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">(i) \u201cThese were two friends of his in their house that night. I suggest to you, something probably happened to trigger [the stabbings]. . . . Who knows what was going through [the defendant\u2019s] mind when he and [Pelletier] are sitting there for two hours talking on the couch that night. Some innocent comment could have been in his mind after that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">(ii) \u201cNow, did he do something without a motive, ladies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>and gentlemen? No, he didn\u2019t. He had a motive. Was it a good motive? Was it an irrational motive? Was it something that made sense? Was it something \u2014 no. No. I don\u2019t know.

Because the defendant objected to this line of argument, we review to determine whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they were harmless. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Obershaw, </em>435 Mass. 794, 805 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cProsecutors must limit the scope of their closing arguments to facts in evidence and the fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>441 Mass. 96, 110 (2004). \u201cArguments based on testimony submitted at trial and its logical conclusions are proper . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 224-225, cert, denied, 128 S. Ct. 810 (2007). \u201cAn inference drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; it need not be necessary or inescapable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>452 Mass. 133, 136 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>427 Mass. 26, 30 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The remarks in (i) were permissible. By the defendant\u2019s own account in his statement to the police, he and Pelletier had stayed up talking by themselves for a while before they joined Valli on the mattress. During this time, the defendant got \u201cemotional about his brother\u201d possibly being deployed to Afghanistan. This evidence, considered with Dr. Packer\u2019s testimony that there is no such thing as no motivation<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 testimony specifically referred to by the prosecutor in his closing \u2014 supported the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and reflected reasonable inferences that could have been drawn from the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>427 Mass. 620, 624-625 (1998) (no requirement that evidence of motive be conclusive to be admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Based on Dr. Packer\u2019s testimony concerning motivation, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in (ii) and (iii), at least as they relate to motive, also were permissible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The remarks in (iv) were proper. That the defendant violently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>attacked the victims was supported by the number and nature of stab wounds to the victims. One of the wounds to Valli was so deep that it penetrated his lung and heart; the defendant used such force on Valli that he broke the knife and went back to obtain another, which he then used to stab Pelletier; and among other places, the defendant slashed both Valli and Pelletier in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The remarks in (v) were also permissible. In addition to Dr. Packer\u2019s testimony on motive, there was evidence that the defendant had conflict with his parents, that the defendant had attempted suicide after his father made him return home to live, that the victims were happy, that the defendant was depressed, and that the attack against the victims was violent and brutal. This evidence, and reasonable inferences therefrom, supported the challenged remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We add that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel forcefully argued that the lack of motive in the case supported the fact that the defendant suffered mental illness and that he could not be criminally responsible for the stabbings. The prosecutor was entitled to respond to this argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 286 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">b. The defendant also asserts that the prosecutor improperly commented on his failure to testify by twice remarking, \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t tell us [his motive for the stabbings].\u201d (See [ii] and [iii] quoted <em>supra.) </em>These remarks, the defendant maintains, deprived him of his constitutional right to remain silent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because there was no objection, we review any improper remarks to determine whether they created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>440 Mass. 536, 550-551 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>There is no question that the phrase, \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell us,\u201d considered by itself, appears to be a direct comment on the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected right not to testify at trial, and there is also no question that the prosecutor\u2019s choice of this phrase, and repetition of it, were unfortunate. But the phrases must be read in the context in which they were stated; we quote the full text of this portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement in the margin.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As reflected there, the prosecutor immediately followed his first reference to \u201che didn\u2019t tell us\u201d by mentioning the portions of the defendant\u2019s statements to the police after his arrest in which the defendant said that he heard a voice telling him \u201cto take them out,\u201d and that he sat there and thought about it. We think that in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s surrounding argument \u2014 including his specific mention of the defendant\u2019s giving a statement to the police a little earlier \u2014 it would have been reasonably clear to the jury that the prosecutor was referring to the fact that the defendant, in his statement to police, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>state a reason for stabbing the victims. We also think that the jury would have understood the second reference to \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell us\u201d as a repetition of the first, that is, another reference to the defendant\u2019s statement to the police, followed by a reference to his conversations with the psychological and psychiatric experts (\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell them\u201d). In this regard, we note that defense counsel, who interrupted the prosecutor\u2019s argument on several occasions to object, did not do so in connection with these statements. Nor did defense counsel mention these statements in the objections he lodged against the prosecutor\u2019s closing at its completion. The absence of objection, while not dispositive, may suggest that the manner and tone of the argument were not unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">A prosecutor is entitled to comment on a defendant\u2019s statement to police and omissions therefrom. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, supra </em>at 551; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>412 Mass. 267, 282-284 &amp; n.11 (1992). And in this case, as has been stated, the prosecutor was entitled to meet the argument advanced by defense counsel that the absence of affirmative motive evidence demonstrated the defendant\u2019s mental illness and lack of criminal responsibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>(prosecutor entitled to respond to argument made by defendant\u2019s trial counsel). Assuming the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks constituted error, we conclude that when they are viewed in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument as a whole and the judge\u2019s instructions, they did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant contends that, in three respects, the judge gave an incomplete and erroneous instruction on the role of voluntary intoxication in determining criminal responsibility. The judge instructed the jury, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201cLack of criminal responsibility is not present when a defendant with a mental disease or defect knows or, in the circumstances, has reason to know, that his consumption of a substance will cause him to be substantially incapable of either appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct or conforming his conduct to the requirement of the law or both. In deciding what the defendant had reason to know about the consequences of his consumption of a substance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>you should consider the question solely from the defendant\u2019s point of view, including his mental capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">During deliberations, the jury asked the judge for \u201cmore guidance on substance abuse, alcohol/drug, with respect to law of criminal responsibility.\u201d The judge responded by explaining (without objection): \u201cIntoxication caused by the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs cannot be the basis for concluding that the defendant lacked criminal responsibility. Alcoholism or drug addiction is not a mental disease or defect within the meaning of the test for lack of criminal responsibility.\u201d The judge then repeated his initial instruction quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">a. The defendant claims that the charge was incomplete because it did not contain language similar to what is commonly referred to as a \u201cHerd\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Herd, </em>413 Mass. 834, 839 (1992). He objected to the charge on this ground. The defendant contends that the instruction was warranted because there was evidence that alcohol consumption could have \u201ctriggered\u201d his mental illness. There was no such evidence. The defendant points to the testimony of Dr. Brower, who stated that Rebecca Provencher (a friend of the defendant\u2019s sister) informed him that the defendant had reported hearing voices to her while he was intoxicated in October or November of 2000. That testimony, however, was hearsay and was admitted only to demonstrate the basis for the doctor\u2019s opinion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>449 Mass. 747, 768-769 (2007). Provencher\u2019s account of that incident clarified that the defendant had been drinking, but had \u201cnot overly drank.\u201d Evidence that the defendant heard voices after consuming some alcohol, however, is not the equivalent of evidence that alcohol consumption actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ally triggered the defendant\u2019s mental illness. The defendant offered no expert evidence on the issue. While Dr. Rogers testified that heavy drinking may render the defendant\u2019s antidepressant, Celexa, ineffective, there was no evidence that heavy drinking, while taking Celexa, would result in anything other than depression. Significantly, there was no evidence contradicting Dr. Rogers\u2019s testimony that drinking while taking Celexa would not trigger a psychotic event. There was no error in declining to give the requested instruction because the evidence did not support it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>381 Mass. 340, 351 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">b. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument, made for the first time on appeal, that the judge\u2019s instruction created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because it omitted the terms \u201cof itself\u201d or \u201csolely\u201d from the part of the instruction that explained that voluntary intoxication \u201ccannot be the basis for concluding that the defendant lacked criminal responsibility.\u201d The judge\u2019s instruction, read in its entirety, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>414 Mass. 595, 607 (1993), correctly relayed that alcoholism resulting from voluntary consumption cannot be the basis for concluding that the defendant lacked criminal responsibility because such a condition does not qualify as a mental disease or defect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Herd, supra. </em>That said, there are circumstances in which a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication can be a basis for concluding that a defendant lacked criminal responsibility, namely, when it \u201cactivated\u201d a latent mental disease or defect as more thoroughly explained in the <em>Herd </em>decision. See <em>id. </em>at 843-844. However, because there was no evidence that the defendant\u2019s voluntary consumption of alcohol activated his mental illness, the omissions complained of are of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">c. We agree with the defendant that the \u201creason to know\u201d portion of the charge was not warranted by the evidence. Because the defendant did not object to the instruction on that basis below, we consider whether the instruction created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>445 Mass. 837, 842 (2006). We conclude that it did not. The instruction itself was correct. Because there was no evidence that the defendant knew that alcohol consumption would exacerbate his mental condition, the instruction, in essence, was superfluous. The charge as a whole, particularly with the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>directive that it was the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove that the defendant was criminally responsible, fairly instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">4. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have carefully reviewed the entire record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. While it is apparent that this is a tragic case for all of the parties and their families, we conclude that there is not a basis on which to order a new trial or to direct entry of a lesser degree of guilt on the murder conviction. Although the defendant had a history of depression, two expert witnesses for the Commonwealth gave their opinions that he was criminally responsible for the stabbings, and there was evidence to support premeditation on the defendant\u2019s part. We decline to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict on the murder indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The Commonwealth had proceeded also under a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, which the jury rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The evidence of what occurred between Valli and the defendant came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>principally through the defendant\u2019s statements to the police, which were admitted in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">A cast off bloodstain is a bloodstain \u201cproduced from a bloody object that [is] in motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Medium velocity impact spatter is blood spatter generated by a medium force that is applied to a blood source.

There was evidence that the defendant had stated to Dr. Packer that after Valli got up from the mattress and the defendant got up as well, the two may have spoken. There was also evidence that, when he made his statement to police following his arrest, the defendant did not include the information that he and Valli may have exchanged words before he stabbed Valli.
