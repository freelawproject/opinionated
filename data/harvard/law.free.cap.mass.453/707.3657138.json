Among the measures described in \u00a7 58A is pretrial detention. The pretrial detention regime in \u00a7 58A \u201cis explicitly \u2018predictive\u2019 and \u2018seek[s] systematically to identify those who may present a danger to society and to incapacitate them before that danger may be realized.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1201, 1219 (1996).

The hearing \u201cshall be held immediately upon the person\u2019s first appearance before the court unless that person, or the attorney for the commonwealth, seeks a continuance.\u201d \u00a7 58A (4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pretrial detention may be ordered only if the judge, after considering a number of statutorily prescribed factors to assess an individual\u2019s dangerousness,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> finds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Commonwealth has established by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cno conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community.\u201d \u00a7 58A (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">An individual detained under \u00a7 58A \u201cshall be brought to a trial as soon as reasonably possible, but in absence of good cause, the person so held shall not be detained for a period exceeding ninety days excluding any period of delay as defined in Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 36 (b) (2) [378 Mass. 909 (1979)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>An individual ordered detained by a judge in the District Court may petition the Superior Court for review of that order. \u00a7 58A (7). Review of a Superior Court pretrial detention decision may be had by application to a single justice of this court. <em>Mendonza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth initially contends that the judge in the Superior Court erred in Rodrigues\u2019s case in concluding that \u201cpossession without more does not establish clear and convincing evidence of dangerousness\u201d because he conflated the predicate offense inquiry, see \u00a7 58A (1), with the individualized dangerousness determination under \u00a7 58A (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The threshold question in every case is whether the defendant has committed a predicate offense under \u00a7 58A (1), thereby triggering the Commonwealth\u2019s right to move for a \u00a7 58A hearing. See \u00a7 58A (4) (\u201cWhen a person is held under arrest for an offense listed in subsection [1] and upon a motion by the commonwealth, the judge shall hold a hearing . . .\u201d). We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>with the Commonwealth that \u00a7 58A requires a categorical approach to determining whether a felony is a predicate offense, independent of the particular facts giving rise to a complaint or indictment. The statute\u2019s plain language directs courts to focus on whether a felony offense, if not one of the specifically listed crimes, \u201chas as <em>an element of the offense </em>the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d or <em>\u201cby its nature </em>involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may result\u201d (emphasis added). \u00a7 58A (1). These statutory alternatives demonstrate that the predicate offense inquiry focuses on the elements of the crime, rather than the particular facts underlying a complaint or indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">This approach comports with the analysis utilized under the Federal Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142 (2000). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>182 F.3d 7, 10-12 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (offenses eligible for pretrial detention hearing categorically ascertainable by \u201creference to their elements\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>432 F.3d 518, 521 (3d Cir. 2005) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>399 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir. 2005) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>371 F.3d 1225, 1228 n.5 (10th Cir. 2004) (same).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, an individualized dangerousness determination based on, inter alia, the factual predicate giving rise to the complaint or indictment, see \u00a7 58A (5), is appropriate only if the predicate offense hurdle has been cleared. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>969 F.2d 106, 109-110 (5th Cir. 1992) (defendant could not be detained unless accused of predicate offense despite dangerousness); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ploof </em>851 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1988) (\u201cwhere detention is based on dangerousness grounds, it can be ordered only in cases involving one of the circumstances set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(1)]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>To the extent the judge merged the predicate offense inquiry, see \u00a7 58A (1), and the particularized dangerousness determination under \u00a7 58A (5), this was error, but does not affect the resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Turning to the heart of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, we consider whether the residual clause making a predicate offense \u201cany other felony that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may result\u201d encompasses unlicensed possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We begin with the language of the statute itself and \u201cpresume, as we must, that the Legislature intended what the words of the statute say.\u201d <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 687 (1986). See 2A N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46:1, at 150-151 (7th ed. 2007) (legislative intent gleaned from what is said, not from what Legislature might have intended to say). We interpret statutes \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). \u201c[W]ords in a statute must be considered in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the other words surrounding them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>366 Mass. 423, 428 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Neither defendant nor the Commonwealth disputes that the words \u201cany other felony\u201d mean a felony that does <em>not </em>have as an element of the offense the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another. They disagree, however, as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cby its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may result.\u201d \u00a7 58A (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The statute does not define the term \u201csubstantial risk.\u201d \u201cSubstantial\u201d is defined as \u201cconsiderable in amount, value, or worth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 106 (2005), quoting Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2280 (1993) (Webster\u2019s). \u201cRisk\u201d refers to \u201cthe possibility of loss, injury, disadvantage or destruction.\u201d Webster\u2019s, <em>supra </em>at 1961. Thus, to constitute a predicate offense under the residual clause, an unenumerated felony by its nature must involve a considerable possibility that physical force against another may result.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Unlicensed possession of a firearm does not, <em>by its nature, </em>involve a substantial risk that physical force against another may result. That a person possesses a firearm without a valid license does not itself pose a substantial risk that physical force against another may result. Rather, it is the unlawful <em>use </em>of a firearm that involves a substantial risk that physical force against another may result.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">While we are cognizant that unlicensed possessors of firearms may use firearms unlawfully, unlicensed possession of a firearm itself is a regulatory crime. It is passive and victimless. It does not even require proof that a defendant knowingly failed to acquire or maintain a license, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 917 (1976), and thus may occur regardless whether an individual has acquired a firearm for an illicit or lawful purpose, or simply allowed a license to lapse. Because the motive of an unlicensed possessor of a firearm is totally irrelevant to criminal liability, we discern no principled legal distinction between the risk of physical force posed by licensed and unlicensed possessors of firearms. While a licensed individual may have knowledge of the proper safety practices for using, handling, and storing firearms, the acquisition of a license does not guarantee that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the licensee will abide by those safety practices or refrain from using the firearm for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The Commonwealth urges us to equate the words \u201cby its nature\u201d with the \u201cmajority of factual scenarios\u201d in which the felony occurs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Unlicensed possessors of firearms, it argues, typically shirk licensing requirements because they intend to use the firearm for unlawful purposes. However, inquiry into the \u201cnature\u201d of the felony examines the legal elements comprising the felony, not the factual predicate giving rise to a complaint or indictment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>182 F.3d 7, 10-12 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The elements of unlicensed possession of a firearm, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>do not require proof that a defendant purposefully evaded firearm licencing requirements, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>let alone proof that a defendant\u2019s failure to obtain a license was motivated by a desire to use the firearm for an illicit purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Consideration of the crimes specifically enumerated in \u00a7 58A (1) bolsters our conclusion that unlicensed possession of a firearm is not a predicate offense. We previously have characterized the enumerated crimes as plainly presenting \u201cthe menace of dangerousness.\u201d <em>Mendonza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 771, 787 (1996). For example, \u00a7 58A (1) expressly includes \u201cburglary and arson whether or not a person has been placed at risk [of physical force].\u201d Although these are crimes against property, a foreseeable risk of harm to others inheres in both crimes in that an unsuspecting person may happen upon the criminal conduct, and may be either injured by the conduct itself, as in the case of arson, or become ensnared in a confrontation with the perpetrator as in the case of burglary. A review of the other crimes qualifying as predicate offenses leads us to the firm conclusion that a felony constitutes a predicate offense under the residual clause if its commission evinces a disregard for the safety and well-being of others. For instance, the Commonwealth may seek pretrial deten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>tion if an individual has been arrested and charged with a violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, that could result in a third or subsequent conviction of operating while under the influence or reckless driving. \u00a7 58A (1). This reference implicitly suggests that the modicum of dangerousness inferable from the commission of any of the other specifically enumerated offenses (or an offense involving the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force) is absent until an individual has been arrested and charged with a violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, that could result in a third or subsequent conviction of that offense. Similarly, violations of certain orders under statutes proscribing domestic abuse present a substantial risk of physical harm to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">For the reasons discussed <em>supra, </em>unlicensed possession of a firearm does not manifest a disregard for the safety and well-being of others, and therefore lacks the \u201cmenace of dangerousness\u201d inherent in the crimes specifically included in \u00a7 58A (1). <em>Mendonza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\"><em>4. Conclusion. </em>In holding that unlicensed possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>firearm is not a predicate offense for purposes of \u00a7 5 8A, we are not unmindful of the dangers relating to unlicensed possession of firearms. Nevertheless, in the absence of clear legislative intent to the contrary, we cannot rewrite or torture the statute\u2019s language to include this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the order allowing Rodrigues\u2019s petition for review of the District Court\u2019s decision to detain him pending trial and the order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a \u00a7 58A hearing in Young\u2019s case are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-18\">We acknowledge the amicus curiae brief submitted by the Committee for Public Counsel Services on behalf of the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>the defendants were charged with other possessory firearm offenses under G.

L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>383 Mass. 750, 753 (1981). The Commonwealth need not prove that the defendant knew that a license was necessary to lawfully possess the firearm. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 917. The Commonwealth also need not show that the defendant has not obtained a license or FID card. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 406 (1977). If the defendant has a license or an FID card, then the burden is on the defendant to come forward with such evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">As mentioned in note 3, <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth does not urge any distinction between unlicensed possession of a firearm, see G.

L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h), </em>and unlicensed possession of a large capacity firearm or large capacity feeding device, see G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (m). Because the elements of these possessory crimes differ only in the instrumentality possessed, for purposes of the present discussion and ease of reference, we refer to these crimes genetically as unlicensed possession of a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">This argument is somewhat inconsistent with the Commonwealth\u2019s position that a categorical approach be used to determine whether an offense qualifies as a predicate offense. We think the dissent is similarly mistaken. Where the elements of a felony do not require proof that the defendant actually disregarded the safety and well-being of others, any determination concerning the substantiality of the connection between the felony and the risk of physical force against another properly lies with the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The Commonwealth argues that the words \u201cmay result,\u201d by way of contrast with the Federal cognate residual clause, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3142(f), 3156(a)(4)(B) (2000), do not require a direct causal connection between the risk of physical force against another and the felony itself. We disagree. The statute unambiguously requires that a felony <em>\u201cby its nature </em>involve[] a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may result\u201d (emphasis added). Because the felony \u201cby its nature\u201d must involve the requisite risk, the risk must directly arise out of the felony itself. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the risk of harm to another does not stem directly from unlicensed possession of a firearm, but rather from unlawful use of the firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">We note that this case does not require us to decide whether the possession of a pipe bomb, silencer, sawed off shotgun, or other instrumentality that is generally associated with violence and has little socially useful value constitutes a predicate offense. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>846 F. Supp. 181, 184 (D. Conn. 1994) (silencer and pipe bomb inherently dangerous weapons for which there is no peaceful use, and thus, their possession is predicate offense under Federal pretrial detention statute). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>252 F.3d 905, 907 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201cSome firearms, it is true \u2014 for- example sawed-off shotguns \u2014 have no significant lawful use, and so their possession by felons may well constitute a crime of violence . . .\u201d). Cf. <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 497-498 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 931 (1982) (sentence of from forty to fifty years for unlawful possession of machine gun not unconstitutionally disproportionate because Legislature could infer from \u201ccommon knowledge that the unlicensed possession of machine guns is almost always associated with the commission of violent crimes with the potential for mass killing\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b739-7\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acl\">(dissenting). The court informs us today that possession of an unlicensed firearm does not \u201cby its nature involve[] a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may result,\u201d and that therefore that crime does not constitute a \u201cpredicate offense\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A (which authorizes pretrial detention based on the \u201cdangerousness\u201d of the defendant). This conclusion may well come as a surprise to those escalating numbers who are victimized, or who have observed others victimized, by the use of unlawfully possessed firearms, as well as to those whose reading of the daily newspaper communicates the stunning social costs of our failure to address seriously the problems associated with the alarmingly increasing use of such weapons. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">I agree with the court that the statutory power to detain without bail a person charged with particular felonies on the ground of dangerousness is limited to those occasions in which commission of a defined felony has been claimed. <em>Ante </em>at 711-712. I also agree with the court that application of the statute to a given felony must be determined in the abstract based on the character of that felony without reference to the specifics of the individual case or the individual defendant. Those considerations become relevant only after a conclusion that the statute applies to the felony charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">I part ways with the court in the following respect. The definition of an eligible felony in \u00a7 58A appears to be the result of a legislative effort to expand the concept of dangerousness beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>those felonies in which violence actually occurs or is threatened. Such felonies are obviously included as eligible for pretrial detention (Commonwealth may seek order of pretrial detention or release on conditions \u201cfor a felony offense that has as an element of the offense the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d). But the definition does not stop there; the statute goes on to refer to \u201cany <em>other </em>felony that by its nature involves <em>a substantial risk </em>that physical force against the person of another may result\u201d (emphasis supplied). Thus, it is plain that the Legislature sought to include within the scope of those charges for which dangerousness hearings are available offenses that, while not violent themselves, create a substantial risk that physical force against a person will follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Try as I might, I cannot understand how possession of a firearm in violation of applicable licensing law can constitute anything <em>other </em>than a substantial risk that the firearm will be used to effect \u201cphysical force against the person of another.\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A. When a handgun or automatic weapon is involved, the purpose of the firearm is to injure or kill; there is no other reason for that weapon\u2019s existence. We have recognized in various contexts that firearms are, by nature and design, dangerous instrumentalities. See, e.g., <em>Jupin </em>v. <em>Kask, </em>447 Mass. 141, 151 (2006), in which we acknowledged the existence of a heightened duty of care on the part of gun owners because of the nature of firearms. Similarly, legislation has often been adopted because of the obvious dangers posed by the availability of firearms. The Legislature has increased the minimum sentence to five years\u2019 imprisonment for the mere possession of a firearm during the commission or attempted commission of a felony. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18B, as amended through St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 56<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>449 Mass. 183, 187-189 (2007). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 766, 768-769 (1986) (possession of firearm in armed robbery \u201cas aggravating a circumstance as actual use\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The risks associated with the possession of any firearm quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>clearly are increased when those firearms are unlicensed. It is generally understood in the Commonwealth that there are licensing requirements applicable to firearms, and that it is unlawful to violate them. That the owner or user of an inherently dangerous instrumentality subject to licensure chooses not to abide by licensing requirements suggests powerfully that that person has obtained the weapon for an unlawful purpose that involves violence or the threat thereof. This is nothing more than common sense. We have stated that \u201cthe Legislature might infer from common knowledge . . . that a large proportion of those who use guns in violent crimes in this Commonwealth are unlicensed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 911 (1976). The fact that some otherwise law-abiding individuals may possess unlicensed firearms due to neglect or mistake does not alter the basic nature of the act in most situations or reduce the danger of death or serious personal injury that accompanies the use of the great majority of firearms that have not satisfied licensing requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The court does not address effectively either the obvious relationship between unlicensed firearms and their use in violent behavior or the alarming proliferation of such weapons and their use in antisocial activity. Instead, the court resorts to a most subtle distinction between <em>possession </em>of an unlicensed firearm and the <em>use </em>of that firearm. <em>Ante </em>at 714. Reduced to its minimum, that is simply a reiteration of the tired slogan that \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people do.\u201d We know this to be a dangerous oversimplification. The fact is that people kill people <em>with guns, </em>and in a substantial number of cases those guns are unlicensed. I have little doubt that a distinction between the existence of an unlicensed weapon and its use never entered into the collective legislative mind when the language of \u00a7 58A regarding felonies involving \u201ca substantial risk [of] physical force\u201d was adopted. Creation of the distinction by judicial construction essentially amends the statute and is inconsistent with its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The court uses interpretive expedients to support its conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>that we need not concern ourselves with the risks posed by the possession of unlicensed weapons. The statement that \u201cwe discern no principled legal distinction between the risk of physical force posed by licensed and unlicensed possessors of firearms,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 714, simply ignores reality. Similarly, the court emphasizes that disregard of the safety of others is not an element of the offense of unlicensed possession of a firearm in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), ante </em>at 716 n.12. But the exercise in which we are presently engaged is not a determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to convict under that statute. While the motive of an unlicensed possessor is irrelevant to the offense of possession without a license, it is not that statute that we consider. Rather, it is an entirely different statute, i.e., G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A, which is based on the concept of substantial risk of physical force against the person of another. If that is the consideration, the differences in likely behavior of licensed as opposed to unlicensed possessors of weapons becomes obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Use of the doctrine of ejusdem generis, <em>ante </em>at 713-714, is misplaced and distorts the legislative purpose. As the court states, we are guided in our interpretation by \u201cthe intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Here, the Legislature\u2019s purpose is revealed by the scope of the felonies to which \u00a7 58A applies (i.e., not only those in which physical force is an element, but also those to which a substantial <em>risk </em>of physical force attaches). Later references to other offenses such as burglary, arson, and violation of abuse orders <em>expand </em>the definition so that it will govern activities that might not otherwise be covered. Such references have not been included in the statute to limit its intended scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">At the end of an opinion devoted largely to explaining why unlicensed firearms do not create the type of physical force that justifies a dangerousness hearing under \u00a7 58A, the court states that \u201cwe are not unmindful of the dangers relating to unlicensed possession of firearms.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 717. Neither is the Legislature. We should allow the statute to operate as that body intended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>specifically, that the remedy is available where there is a substantial relationship between the felony charged and the risk of violence. That does not mean that the remedy will be imposed in all, or even most, cases. A considerable burden of proof remains on the Commonwealth to establish that, applying carefully defined factors, \u201cno conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community.\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A (3). But a fair reading of the statute would reject the pretense that a firearm is some neutral piece of equipment that is harmless in and of itself, and would recognize at a minimum the deadly sequence that so often follows on the possession of an unlicensed firearm. I would reverse the orders of the Superior Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In this respect, the Legislature has apparently accepted the proposition that people who possess guns are likely to fire them, an inference that seems to escape the court. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In the event of the \u201cinnocent\" failure to secure a proper license, the nature of the offense would become apparent at the hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A, where the Commonwealth must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cno conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community.\" G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
