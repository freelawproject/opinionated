L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, to prevent it from lapsing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>The plaintiff, Paul Cornell, owns a fourteen-acre lot in Dracut. He proposed a plan to divide the property into two parcels, with the intention of erecting a home on the smaller of the two parcels. Because the frontage on that parcel was twenty-five feet less than the minimum frontage required by the Dracut zoning bylaws, a variance was necessary. On March 7, 2002, the board of appeals of Dracut granted Cornell a variance. The certificate granting Cornell a variance contained an advisement stating that G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, provides that the variance shall not take effect until it is recorded in the registry of deeds for the county and district in which the land is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Cornell belatedly set out to obtain approvals from the planning board, the board of health, and the conservation commission, all of which were prerequisites for a building permit. To this end, Cornell hired a registered land surveyor to prepare an \u201capproval not required\u201d plan (ANR), see G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, which subsequently was filed with the planning board, and approved and indorsed on August 14, 2002. Cornell then retained Norse Environmental Services, Inc. (Norse), to prepare septic and wetlands delineation plans. Norse began testing the soil in November, 2002, and submitted a septic plan to the board of health on February 14, 2003. At some point in early 2003, Cornell applied for an order of conditions from the conservation commission. By March 7, 2003, the anniversary of the issuance of his variance, the board of health and the conservation commission continued proceedings concerning Cornell\u2019s applications several times, and had not issued any decision concerning Cornell\u2019s applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">On May 7, 2003, the conservation commission issued an order of conditions, and on June 12 the board of health approved Cornell\u2019s septic plan. By this time, Cornell had expended more than $15,000 in seeking all three approvals. In the same month, Cornell applied for a building permit, but was told by the defendant, Frank Polak, a building inspector, that his application would be denied on the ground that the variance had lapsed due to Cornell\u2019s failure to apply for a building permit within one year of the grant of the variance. Polak told Cornell that he either had to seek an extension of the variance or reapply for the variance in order to obtain a building permit. On June 16, 2003, Cornell requested an extension from the board of appeals, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>denied as untimely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cornell then reapplied for a variance. His application was denied on November 13. In December, Cornell commenced the present action in the Land Court seeking, inter alia,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a declaratory judgment that the original variance never had lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Cornell recorded the variance, which allegedly had lapsed, on January 16, 2004, in the Middlesex County northern district registry of deeds. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">On Cornell\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a judge in the Land Court ruled that the variance did never \u201ctake effect,\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, fifth par., because it was not timely recorded. Consequently, he reasoned, the variance could not be exercised under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, to prevent it from lapsing. The judge further concluded that, in any event, Cornell had failed to demonstrate that he exercised the variance by March, 2003, because he had neither acquired a building permit nor conveyed one of the lots in reliance on the variance. After judgment entered for the defendants, Cornell moved to alter or amend the judgment, arguing, among other things, that G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, did not require a variance holder to record the variance in order to exercise it under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. That motion was denied, and Cornell appealed. The Appeals Court affirmed. See <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dracut, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 390 (2008). We granted Cornell\u2019s application for further appellate review and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">We conclude that Cornell did not exercise his variance under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, within one year of its issuance. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 10, provides, in relevant part: \u201cIf the rights authorized by a variance are not exercised within one year of the date of grant of such variance, such rights shall lapse . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This section, intended \u201cto eliminate to some degree the current confusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>regarding status of land within municipalities,\u201d 1973 House Doc. No. 6200, at 20; see <em>Hunters Brook Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Bourne, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 81-83 (1982) (outlining legislative history of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10), ensures the prompt utilization of duly granted variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The statute does not define \u201cexercised.\u201d Where a statute does not define a particular word, \u201cthe natural import of words according to the ordinary and approved usage of the language when applied to the subject matter of the act, is to be considered as expressing the intention of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R. </em>v. <em>Billerica, </em>262 Mass. 439, 444 (1928). \u201cExercise\u201d means \u201cto bring into play: make effective in action . . . bring to bear.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 795 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">We agree with the Land Court judge that under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, fifth par., which is set out in relevant part in the margin, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a variance does not \u201ctake effect\u201d until it is recorded and that the recording of a variance within one year of its grant is necessary to \u201cexercise\u201d it. The ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201ctake effect\u201d is \u201cto become operative.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 2331. Thus, the variance could not become operative, and by implication, could not be exercised, until it was recorded. Here, despite the advisement on the certificate granting him a variance, Cornell failed to record the variance within one year of its grant, and thereby caused the variance to lapse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Even if the variance had been recorded timely, we would nonetheless conclude that Cornell\u2019s actions fell short of \u201cexercising\u201d the variance. We agree with the Land Court judge and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Appeals Court, that at the very least, in addition to recording the variance, Cornell needed to obtain a building permit or convey one of the lots in reliance on the variance. <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dracut, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 393 (2008), citing <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 399, 404 (1985). Without a building permit or a conveyance of one of the lots, Cornell did not utilize the variance, or \u201cmake [it] effective in action,\u201d because he did not undertake any action on the lot necessitating the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Cornell contends that because the variance was a prerequisite for the ANR indorsement,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he \u201cexercised\u201d the variance. We disagree. The ANR indorsement conferred no right on Cornell to use the variance. The ANR indorsement serves merely to permit the plan to be recorded, see <em>Cricones </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Dracut, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 264, 268 (1995), and is not an attestation of compliance with zoning requirements. See <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Beverly, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 386, 389 (1993); <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 603 (1980). An ANR indorsement, like an approval from a board of health, conservation commission, or similar entity, is, in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>case, essentially preliminary to the issuance of a building permit or a conveyance. Cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>366 Mass. 197, 201 (1974) (not every expenditure of time, effort, and money is enough to qualify as construction for purposes of exercising special permit). A building permit, in contrast, authorizes a variance holder, such as Cornell, to build on the nonconforming lot and thus is the culmination of the permitting process that allows him to utilize that lot in a way that otherwise does not conform with the applicable zoning provisions. Our conclusion gains support from the fact that a building permit is needed to grandfather this variance against a subsequent zoning change. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, first par. With respect to a conveyance of less than the original parcel, i.e., a conveyance of one of these lots, an ANR indorsed plan is a prerequisite to recording a deed. See G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 6A. Therefore, it was necessary for Cornell to have obtained a building permit or convey one of the lots to realize the benefits of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Circumstances beyond a variance holder\u2019s control may make obtaining a building permit within one year of the grant of a variance impossible and thus warrant equitable tolling of the one-year period. However, reasonably avoidable impediments to obtaining a building permit will preclude equitable tolling. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, supra </em>at 202 (statutory six-month period to begin construction not tolled where owner who ultimately abandoned special permit could have resolved litigation over special permit earlier). In order to demonstrate that equitable tolling is warranted, a variance holder must show that the holder has timely sought an extension of the variance, see G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, third par., and that delays clearly attributable to others have hampered the holder\u2019s efforts to obtain a building permit. Cf. <em>Belfer </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>363 Mass. 439, 444 (1973) (two-year period in which variance had to be used under zoning code tolled where appeal from granting of variance created \u201creal practical impediments to use of a [variance]\u201d). Cf. also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, supra </em>at 201 (\u201creal practical impediments\u201d caused by litigation may toll six-month statutory period to begin construction pursuant to special permit).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Cornell has not demonstrated that equitable tolling would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>appropriate in this case. Cornell did not seek an extension of the variance until several months after the expiration of the one-year period. He has also failed to establish that the delays in obtaining the approvals necessary for a building permit were not reasonably avoidable. Although the board of health and the conservation commission continued proceedings concerning Cornell\u2019s applications several times, nothing in the record on appeal explains why Cornell waited until <em>after </em>he received the ANR indorsement in August, 2002, to hire Norse to prepare a septic plan and a wetlands delineation plan. Nothing prevented Cornell from simultaneously seeking all three approvals immediately after, and in some cases before, the variance was granted. Furthermore, while it is unclear when Cornell submitted his request for an order of conditions to the conservation commission in 2003, he did not submit the septic plan to the board of health until February 14, 2003. He could not have reasonably expected the board of health to review and approve his application in a mere three weeks\u2019 time. In these circumstances, Cornell\u2019s expenditures in seeking the requisite approvals for a building permit do not offset his unexplained delay in seeking those approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In sum, at the very least, Cornell should have recorded the variance and obtained a building permit within one year of being granted the variance to prevent it from lapsing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We recognize that delays in fulfilling the prerequisites for a building permit may occur notwithstanding a variance holder\u2019s diligence. In those circumstances, the one-year period in which a variance holder must \u201cexercise\u201d the variance may be equitably tolled if, in addition to establishing that such delays were not reasonably avoidable, the variance holder seeks an extension of the variance in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>timely fashion. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, third par. However, variances are generally disfavored, see <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Nantucket, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 738 (1983), and where, as here, a variance holder has not timely applied for an extension of the variance and failed to provide a reason for not diligently pursuing the approvals necessary for a building permit, the one-year period is not tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-18\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted in support of the defendants by the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Planning Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b912-8\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 10, third par., authorizes the board of appeals, in its discretion, to extend by not more than six months the time in which to exercise a variance, provided the application therefor is filed before the expiration of one year from the date the variance was granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">Comell also sought review of the denial of his second application for a variance, see G.

Cf. <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Melrose, 59 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 457 (2003) (failure to record special permit not fatal where plaintiff substantially used special permit). Here, Cornell did not substantially rely on the variance because he did not sell either lot or engage in construction on the lot for which the variance was granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b914-6\">An \u201capproval not required\u201d (ANR) indorsement \u201cshall not be withheld unless such plan shows a subdivision.\u201d G.

For example, a \u201cuse\u201d variance may not require any construction or excavation, and a building permit may not be necessary to exercise such a variance. Evidence of \u201cuse\u201d within one year of issuance of the variance may be sufficient to exercise such a variance. Here, construction of a house on a nonconforming lot was sought, hence the need for a building permit. Cf. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, fourteenth par. (relating to special permits). We note that unlike G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, fourteenth par., which\u2019 requires the commencement of construction to prevent a special permit from lapsing, the Legislature has not required commencement of construction as a prerequisite for \u201cexercise\u201d of a variance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
