L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in the county court, seeking reversal of an order of a judge in the Superior Court. The order, made in response to a discovery motion filed by the defendant, required the Commonwealth to reveal whether a person, identified as C.G., was acting as an agent or at the direction of the Commonwealth and whether she was provided with any consideration in exchange for her alleged assistance. The motion judge ordered disclosure of the requested information on the ground that it was material to an entrapment defense raised by the defendant. A single justice affirmed in relevant part the motion judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>disclosure order, and the Commonwealth appeals. We vacate the order of the Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendant stands indicted on three charges of unlawful possession with intent to distribute a class B substance, oxycodone, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (c); one charge of trafficking in oxycodone, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c); and one charge of unlawful possession of a class C substance, lorazepam, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. On August 23, 2007, the defendant filed her motion seeking disclosure whether C.G. was working as a government agent and whether the government had provided C.G. with any promises, rewards, or benefits. The defendant argued in the motion that she had a right to this information because it was material to a viable entrapment defense. In the affidavit she filed in support of the motion, the defendant stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201c[C.G.], an acquaintance of mine, continually told me she had someone she wanted me to meet named Ryan. I told her I had health issues and didn\u2019t want to get involved with anybody at that time. She called me again and urged me to reconsider meeting Ryan. I finally agreed to do so. At the first meeting on December 2, 2006, Ryan requested a pain killer to ease his back pain. [C.G.j said she didn\u2019t have any and asked if I would give him one, which I did. I handed it to [C.G.] and she gave it to Ryan. [C.G.] promised to give me one back. Ryan then called me on December 13, 2006, and begged me to help him out as he could not get in to see his doctor. I told him to see his friends [C.G.] and Shawn to help him out. He said he couldn\u2019t get a hold of them and that he would give me back the meds he borrowed after he saw his doctor. I met him at Eagles and gave him two pills of [O]xycontin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\u201cThe pressure continued until my arrest. On December 16, 2006, Ryan called me to meet him again. I said I was too sick to do so. He was not happy. He called a second time and pleaded with me to help him out. On December 20, 2006, he again called me twice. I turned him down again but he pleaded even more strongly that he was in pain and needed the pill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">There is no dispute that the \u201cRyan\u201d referred to in the affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>was an undercover police officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">On September 25, 2007, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure; the Commonwealth moved for reconsideration. On December 7, 2007, the judge denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to reconsider, ruling that disclosure was appropriate, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>449 Mass. 702 (2007) <em>(Madigan). </em>The Commonwealth then filed its petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in the county court, and thereafter filed a timely appeal in this court from the order of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe government\u2019s privilege not to disclose the identity of an informant has long been recognized in this Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>451 Mass. 463, 468 (2008) , citing <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Scribner, </em>109 Mass. 487, 488 (1872). The privilege serves a \u201csubstantial, worthwhile purpose in assisting the police in obtaining evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Madigan, </em>449 Mass, at 706, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douzanis, </em>384 Mass. 434, 441 (1981). It has also been recognized that there are limits on the scope of this privilege, defined by the \u201cfundamental requirements of fairness\u201d to the defendant and her right to prepare a defense. <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 60 (1957). See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 509(a)(2), at 116-119 (2008-2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Where a defendant seeks disclosure of otherwise privileged information to support an entrapment defense, the question is whether the defense has been \u201cappropriately raised ... by the introduction of some evidence of inducement by a government agent or one acting at his direction.\u201d <em>Madigan, </em>449 Mass, at 707, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 651-652 (1972).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 509(a)(2), at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">The Commonwealth concedes that the defendant\u2019s affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>contains enough information about Ryan\u2019s \u201ccoercive, repeated, and sympathy filled requests to purchase narcotics from the defendant\u201d to meet the threshold test for showing \u201cinducement\u201d and indeed \u201cwould likely qualify for an entrapment instruction at trial.\u201d The Commonwealth argues, however, that the affidavit\u2019s description of C.G. presents a different story. With respect to C.G.\u2019s request that the defendant meet Ryan, the Commonwealth notes that the affidavit does not state that C.G. asked the defendant to meet Ryan for some illegal purpose. As for C.G.\u2019s request that the defendant give Ryan a painkiller, the Commonwealth argues that this was \u201cmere solicitation\u201d and that \u201cno entrapment exists \u2018if the accused is ready and willing to commit the crime whenever the opportunity might be afforded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass, at 651, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Groessel, </em>440 F.2d 602, 605 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 403 U.S. 933 (1971). The Commonwealth concludes that the defendant has not shown that C.G.\u2019s conduct possessed \u201cindicia of inducement\u201d as required by <em>Madigan. </em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The defendant counters that the Commonwealth errs in focusing on the allegations concerning C.G.\u2019s conduct in isolation from the allegations concerning the conduct of Ryan, whom the Commonwealth has conceded is an agent of the government. The defendant argues in particular that the contents of her affidavit demonstrate that the conduct of C.G. and Ryan must be viewed together as intertwined parts of one whole. She further claims that because the Commonwealth does not deny that Ryan\u2019s actions are sufficient to posit inducement by the government, discovery about C.G.\u2019s cooperative role in this government inducement effort is required. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The defendant\u2019s affidavit begins with a description of C.G.\u2019s efforts to persuade the defendant to meet Ryan. These efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>are described as persistent, but there is no suggestion that C.G. ever told the defendant that she wanted the defendant to meet Ryan in order to sell him drugs or commit any other kind of crime. Repeated efforts to persuade a defendant to meet someone who is an undercover police officer, without more, does not amount to the kind of inducement necessary for a claim of entrapment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Madigan, </em>449 Mass, at 708 (defendant\u2019s affidavit supporting request for discovery concerning government informant stated informant had been \u201ccultivating [him] as a potential [drug] seller\u201d to undercover officer for some time, and persistently requested that defendant sell drugs to officer even after introduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The affidavit also places C.G. at the first meeting between the defendant and Ryan. At that meeting, however, C.G. simply \u201casked\u201d the defendant to give Ryan a painkiller, and promised to \u201cgive [the defendant] one back.\u201d Asking the defendant to sell or give drugs to someone else, without more, also fails to indicate inducement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>416 Mass. 528, 536 (1993) (\u201cThe threshold for a defendant to raise the entrapment issue is low, but the defendant must show more than mere solicitation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>382 Mass. 379, 385-386 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass, at 651-652. Moreover, even if we were to consider in tandem the conduct of C.G. and Ryan at that December 2 meeting, doing so proves little, because the defendant has not been charged with committing any offense on December 2, 2006.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, the charged offenses are alleged to have occurred on December 13, 16, and 20, 2006, a week-long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>period that began eleven days after December 2. The defendant\u2019s affidavit describes interactions between the defendant and Ryan on these three later dates, but it does not mention C.G. as a participant in or even present at any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The. defendant must produce some evidence that C.G. induced her to commit the crimes charged, or that C.G. participated in Ryan\u2019s inducement of those charged crimes, if C.G.\u2019s conduct is to play a role in her entrapment defense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass, at 651-652. She failed to do so; the temporal gap between C.G.\u2019s involvement in the alleged inducement of the defendant and the dates of the charged offenses, and the extremely limited nature of that involvement to begin with, defeat her claim. We therefore conclude that there is no basis to disregard the government\u2019s privilege against disclosure of C.G.\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment in the county court denying the Commonwealth\u2019s G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition is vacated. A new judgment is to enter allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, vacating the order in the Superior court compelling the requested discovery, and denying the defendant\u2019s discovery motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-11\">In its brief, the Commonwealth includes factual statements for which it gives no record references, and that we could not locate in the record. These statements appear to dispute in some respects the contents of the defendant\u2019s affidavit. It is not appropriate to allege facts that are not in the record on appeal, and we have not considered the Commonwealth\u2019s statements. We have confined ourselves to the defendant\u2019s affidavit, which is in the record, and we accept it as true for purposes of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-12\">The focus, for disclosure purposes, is solely on inducement. The question whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime is not in issue, because \u201c[w]hen evidence of inducement has been entered [at trial], the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>burden rests upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the predisposition of the defendant to commit the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 652 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>391 Mass. 345, 352 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\"> \u201cThe types of conduct that possess the indicia of inducement include \u2018aggressive persuasion, coercive encouragement, lengthy negotiations, pleading or arguing with the defendant, repeated or persistent solicitation, persuasion, importuning, and playing on sympathy or other emotion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>449 Mass. 702, 708 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>416 Mass. 528, 536 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Courts generally hold that merely introducing a defendant to a government agent is not relevant or material to the defense of entrapment. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>935 F.2d 1212, 1217 (11th Cir. 1991); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Toro, </em>840 F.2d 1221, 1232 (5th Cir. 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>804 F.2d 1161, 1166-1167 (10th Cir. 1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Petta, </em>729 So. 2d 29, 31 (La. Ct. App. 1999), cert, denied, 528 U.S. 1125 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The defendant may be suggesting that the Commonwealth declined to charge her with any crime related to the events of December 2, 2006, to avoid being required to disclose C.G.\u2019s identity, and that in doing so, the Commonwealth has acted improperly. The suggestion is without merit. It is true that if the defendant were charged with a crime relating to the alleged distribution of a \u201cpainkiller\u201d on December 2, the Commonwealth would probably be required to disclose C.G.\u2019s identity as a percipient witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 501, 502-503 (1973). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>406 Mass. 565, 572 (1990). But there is of course no obligation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>the government\u2019s part to charge a person with every possible crime that he or she may have committed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koulouris, </em>406 Mass. 281, 281-285 (1989) (defendant engaged in three drug transactions on different dates with undercover government agent allegedly engaged in inducing defendant\u2019s participation; indictments pertained only to two later transactions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
