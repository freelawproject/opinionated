Fagan and Anna M. Fagan (Fagans), that was approved by the planning board of Ipswich (board). The plaintiffs, Elizabeth E. Krafchuk and Joseph A. Brear, Jr., each own property abutting the Fagans\u2019 parcel of land, which is the subject of the plan. Because we conclude that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the board\u2019s approval of the Fagans\u2019 definitive plan, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; that the Fagans\u2019 land continued to be entitled to the protection of the process freeze of the zoning bylaw provided by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at the time when, following the board\u2019s rescission of constructive approval of the plan, they submitted an amended plan; that the board did not exceed its authority in granting waivers from its rules and regulations pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ; and that the board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>approval vote was not valid where board members did not attend the hearings on the plan as required, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The Fagans own a twenty-three and one-half acre parcel of land that has frontage along Heartbreak Road in Ipswich. In October, 2001, the Fagans, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81S, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> submitted to the board a preliminary subdivision plan that depicted seven proposed lots, including several lots of approximately one acre in size. The lots were shown on the plan as having frontage along Blue Spruce Drive, a proposed cul-de-sac that would provide access to Heartbreak Road via a T-shaped intersection. Later that month, Ipswich amended its zoning bylaw, increasing the minimum lot size for the district where the Fagans\u2019 land is located from one acre to two acres. In March, 2002, the board disapproved the Fagans\u2019 preliminary plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Fagans submitted a definitive subdivision plan to the board in May, 2002, fewer than seven months after the submission of their preliminary plan. The board held a public hearing to consider the plan beginning in June, 2002, and continuing throughout the year. The Fagans submitted amended plans in November, 2002, and again in December, 2002. Several board members were not present at all of the sessions when the defendants\u2019 application was considered. At a session held in January, 2003, the board, with all members present, voted to disapprove the most recent amendment to the plan, and to grant, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R, waivers from strict compliance with several of its rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The plaintiffs timely filed an appeal in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s decision to grant waivers to the Fagans. The Fagans did not file their own appeal, but instead asserted to the board that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>their application had already been constructively approved prior to the board\u2019s decision, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> due to the board\u2019s failure to take final action or to file with the town clerk either a certificate or notice of an agreed extension, within ninety days after the May, 2002, filing of the definitive plan. The board, which had undergone a change in membership following the January, 2003, hearing, held a hearing in March, 2003, to consider the Fagans\u2019 assertion of constructive approval. The hearing was continued to May, 2003, when the board voted to rescind the constructive approval pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81W,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, without hearing any new substantive evidence, to readopt its January, 2003, decision disapproving the definitive plan and granting waivers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The plaintiffs again filed a G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, appeal in the Superior Court, seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s decision to readopt its January, 2003, decision granting waivers. The Fagans separately filed an appeal in the Land Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s decision to rescind the constructive approval and to readopt the disapproval decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In August, 2003, the Fagans submitted a request to the board to revoke the disapproval and to approve their amended plan. The board, after another change in membership, held a public hearing on the Fagans\u2019 request beginning in September, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>and continuing throughout the year. The Fagans submitted an amended definitive subdivision plan in October, 2003. Not all of the board members were present at all of the sessions during which the Fagans\u2019 amended plan was considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The board voted on the amended plan at a hearing held in December, 2003. With four of the board\u2019s five members voting, the board unanimously rescinded the disapproval and approved the definitive subdivision plan as amended \u2014 adopting, in its decision, the twelve waivers that had been granted in the January, 2003, decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiffs filed a third appeal in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, seeking judicial review of the approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">A bench trial was held on the plaintiffs\u2019 three consolidated Superior Court actions. On the threshold jurisdictional issue of standing, the judge ruled that both plaintiffs were persons aggrieved pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, and could challenge the board\u2019s decisions. Turning to the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals, the judge concluded that the board\u2019s act approving the plan was invalid for three reasons. First, the judge ruled that the Fa-gans\u2019 plan had been constructively approved, but that the board\u2019s May, 2003, decision rescinding the constructive approval had extinguished the zoning freeze provided by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par. On that basis, the judge concluded that the two-acre minimum lot size provision of the bylaw, as amended in October, 2001, applied to the Fagans\u2019 amended plan that they submitted in October, 2003. The judge ruled that the board\u2019s December, 2003, approval of the amended plan was therefore invalid because the one-acre lots depicted on the plan did not conform to the applicable provisions of the bylaw. The judge further concluded that the approval was invalid because the board\u2019s decision incorporated two waivers of compliance with the board\u2019s subdivision rules and regulations that the judge found to have been erroneously granted. The judge also ruled that the board\u2019s December, 2003, decision was not valid where the members of the board who voted to approve the plan had not been present at all of the public hearings when the plan was considered. See <em>Mullin </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brewster, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 139 (1983) (in case of adjudicatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>proceedings before planning board, members required to attend hearing to be entitled to vote). Having found that the board acted in excess of its authority, the judge directed entry of a judgment annulling the board\u2019s approval decision, remanding the matter to the board, and dismissing the remaining counts. The Fagans appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment. <em>Krafchuk </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Ipswich, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 484 (2007). We granted the Fagans\u2019 application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standing. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, only persons who are aggrieved by a planning board\u2019s decision concerning a definitive subdivision plan may appeal to the Superior Court or the Land Court. A person aggrieved within the meaning of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, must assert \u201ca plausible claim of a definite violation of a private right, a private property interest, or a private legal interest.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 27 (2006), quoting <em>Harvard Sq. Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 493 (1989).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The asserted basis for the claim also must be one that the statute intends to protect. See <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, supra </em>at 27-28. \u201cThe injury must be more than speculative . . . but the term \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 should not be read narrowly\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 721 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Abutters entitled to notice of planning board hearings, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81T, enjoy a rebuttable presumption that they are persons aggrieved. See <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, supra </em>at 33. To rebut the presumption, a party challenging the standing of an abutter \u201cmust offer evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u2018warranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, quoting <em>Marinelli </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoughton, </em>440 Mass. 255, 258 (2003). \u201cOnce the presumption is rebutted, the burden rests with the plaintiff to prove standing, which requires that the plaintiff \u2018establish \u2014 by direct facts and not by speculative personal opinion \u2014 that his injury is special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, supra </em>at 33, quoting <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 132 (1992). A party challenging a board\u2019s decision need not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her claim of particularized injury is true. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 441. (2005). \u201cRather, the plaintiff must put forth credible evidence to substantiate his allegations. In this context, standing becomes, then, essentially a question of fact for the trial judge.\u201d <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, supra </em>at 721. The judge\u2019s finding as to whether a person is aggrieved will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 722. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Fagans argue that both plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the board\u2019s decision. We disagree. The judge concluded that Krafchuk had established her standing as a person aggrieved on the basis of two of her claims of harm. We focus here only on the judge\u2019s finding that the proposed subdivision would likely cause increased runoff into the wetlands that surround and comprise part of Krafchuk\u2019s property, and that the resulting increase in saturation of her land threatened harm to her septic system and water well.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It is not disputed that the expert testimony of the Fagans\u2019 engineer rebutted Krafchuk\u2019s presumed standing. Nor is it disputed that, at the very least, Krafchuk\u2019s claim that her property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>would likely be harmed by potential runoff and flooding due to the subdivision constituted the type of injury that the subdivision control law was intended to protect against. G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M (planning board shall exercise powers under subdivision control law with due regard for, among other things, securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, and drainage). The judge properly concluded that the potential harm to Krafchuk\u2019s property, posed by the likelihood of increased runoff and flooding, was special and different from any threatened injury to the community at large. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 554 (1999); <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The judge\u2019s finding that Krafchuk met her burden by putting forth credible evidence to substantiate her claim was not clearly erroneous. Although the plaintiffs presented expert testimony, the testimony did not directly address the manner in which Kraf-chuk\u2019s own property would be affected by flooding as a result of the proposed subdivision. Instead, the expert\u2019s testimony concerning certain aspects of the drainage system shown on the plan, including the infiltration basins discussed <em>infra, </em>tended to show that storm water would likely flood the proposed intersection of Blue Spruce Drive and Heartbreak Road and run into the wetlands surrounding Krafchuk\u2019s property in the case of a ten year or more intense storm event. The extent to which the judge relied on this expert testimony for the flooding issue is not entirely clear, and the judge apparently concluded that expert testimony was not required in the circumstances here. What is clear, however, is that the judge relied on the testimony given by lay witnesses, i.e., Krafchuk and several of her neighbors, as well as photographic evidence showing flooding due to storm water at the location of the proposed intersection. Based on this evidence, the judge found that Heartbreak Road lacks a storm sewer, that Heartbreak Road residents rely on septic systems and wells, and that the area includes extensive wetlands. The judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that expert testimony was not required in these circumstances. On this record, it was reasonable for the judge to rely on lay witness testimony to conclude that increased runoff and flooding from the site of the proposed subdivision would likely harm Krafchuk\u2019s septic system and well. Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>we agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the evidence Krafchuk put forth was more than unfounded speculation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">b. <em>Zoning freeze. </em>The Fagans contend that the judge erred in concluding that their land was no longer entitled to the protection of the zoning freeze provided by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., at the time the board approved their amended definitive plan in December, 2003. We conclude that their land continued to be protected by the process freeze provision of \u00a7 6 at the time of the board\u2019s decision in December, 2003, and remains so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We begin with a discussion of the applicable statutory provisions. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., a provision of the Zoning Act, protects landowners from having to comply with amendments to the zoning bylaw or ordinance that are adopted after the landowner has submitted a subdivision plan to a planning board, \u201cby (1) freezing the applicable bylaws governing the land shown on the subdivision plan as of the time when the plan is first submitted to the planning board and while the plan is being processed under the subdivision control law (the process freeze); and (2) freezing those same zoning bylaws for eight years from the date of the endorsement of final approval of a definitive plan [the eight-year freeze].\u201d <em>Kitras </em>v. <em>Zoning Adm\u2019r of Aquinnah, ante </em>245, 252 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Under the provisions of the subdivision control law, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, provides that a definitive plan is deemed approved where the planning board fails \u201ceither to take final action or to file with the . . . town clerk a certificate of such action on the definitive plan within ninety days after such submission, or such further time as may be agreed upon at the written request of the applicant.\u201d See <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Agawam, </em>358 Mass. 709, 713-714 (1971). If a plan has been constructively approved pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, the constructive approval becomes final, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V, after the expiration of twenty days without notice of appeal, or if an appeal has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>been taken, when the town clerk receives a certified record of the court indicating that the constructive approval has become final.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Kitras </em>v. <em>Zoning Adm\u2019r of Aquinnah, supra </em>at 253. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V. Once the constructive approval has become final, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V, requires the town clerk to \u201cissue a certificate stating the date of the submission of the plan for approval, the fact that the planning board failed to take final action and that the approval resulting from such failure has become final.\u201d See <em>Kay-Vee Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Ludlow, </em>355 Mass. 165, 169 (1969). The town clerk\u2019s act of issuing the certificate memorializes that the constructive approval has become final, but does not, itself, confer finality. <em>Kitras </em>v. <em>Zoning Adm\u2019r of Aquinnah, supra </em>at 254-255. The certificate issued by the town clerk in the case of a constructive approval is the functional equivalent of a written endorsement of the planning board\u2019s approval on a plan, and therefore triggers the eight-year zoning freeze under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. <em>Id. </em>at 254. It is important to note, however, that G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81W, empowers a planning board to modify, amend, or rescind its approval of a plan. <em>Kay-Vee Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Ludlow, supra </em>at 169-170 (planning board empowered under \u00a7 81W to modify, amend, or rescind constructive approval where board \u201cblunder[ed] its way into a position where plan became constructively approved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Here, the Fagans\u2019 land became entitled to the protection of the process freeze provided by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, when they filed their preliminary plan in October, 2001. Their land continued to be entitled to the protection of the process freeze when they submitted their definitive plan in May, 2002, within seven months following the submission of their preliminary plan. We agree with the judge that the board\u2019s failure to take final action, or to file a certificate of its action or notice of an agreed-on extension of time with the town clerk within ninety days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>filing of the definitive plan, resulted in constructive approval of the plan, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, fifth par. The constructive approval became final when the twenty-day appeal period expired. See <em>Kitras </em>v. <em>Zoning Adm\u2019r of Aquinnah, supra </em>at 252-253. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V. The eight-year zoning freeze pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., did not commence, however, because the town clerk did not issue a certificate memorializing final approval of the definitive plan. See <em>Kitras </em>v. <em>Zoning Adm\u2019r of Aquinnah, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the Fagans\u2019 entitlement to the protection of the process freeze ended when the planning board acted, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81W, to rescind the constructive approval,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that the two-acre minimum lot size provision of the bylaw, as amended in October, 2001, applied to the amended plan the Fagans submitted in October, 2003, because it was filed more than seven months after the preliminary plan. The board\u2019s actions, i.e., rescinding the constructive approval and readopting the decision disapproving the plan, reinstated the process and, necessarily, the process freeze as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81U, second par., provides that \u201c[i]n the event of disapproval, the planning board shall state in detail wherein the plan does not conform to the rules and regulations of the planning board . . . and shall revoke its disapproval and approve a plan which, as amended conforms to such rules and regulations . . . .\u2019\u2019By its plain language, this provision contemplates situations where, if the board disapproves a definitive plan, the process nevertheless continues where the applicant submits, within a reasonable time, an amended plan that addresses the reasons for the disapproval, and ultimately obtains approval by the board. This provision is consistent with G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., which provides that the process freeze ends and the eight-year freeze applies \u201cif such [a] definitive plan <em>or an amendment thereof is finally </em>approved\u201d (emphasis added). \u201c[W]here two or more statutes relate to the same subject matter, they should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>FMR Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>441 Mass. 810, 819 (2004), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975). Preservation of the process freeze following disapproval of a timely submitted definitive plan is not automatic, however. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 6, seventh par., adds the requirement that, in order to preserve the process freeze, an appeal must be taken from the disapproval decision.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, where the deliberative process between a planning board and an applicant regarding a timely filed definitive plan results in a disapproval decision, but progresses in a continuous fashion, wherein the applicant (1) timely files an appeal from the board\u2019s decision; and (2) submits within a reasonable time an amended plan that addresses the reasons for disapproval; the process freeze provision of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., continues to apply to the land that is the subject of the plan.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Here, although the board acted, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81W, to rescind the constructive approval, it contemporaneously acted to readopt its January, 2003, disapproval decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The Fagans filed an appeal from that decision.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The process freeze continued for a reasonable period of time to allow the Fagans to submit an amended plan that addressed the reasons for disapproval. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, second par. When the Fagans submitted their amended plan in October, 2003, the land shown on the plan continued to be entitled to the process freeze. Accordingly, their land remains governed by the applicable provisions of the bylaw that were in effect at the time they submitted their preliminary plan in October, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">c. <em>Waivers. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R, a planning board enjoys broad discretion to waive strict compliance with its rules and regulations where the waiver is in the public interest and is not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law. See <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Millbury, </em>404 Mass. 489, 491 (1989); <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Winchester, </em>352 Mass. 209, 213-214 (1967); <em>Musto </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Medfield, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 831, 837 (2002). The board is not required to set forth findings on which it bases its determination. See <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 435, 439 n.8 (1979). \u201cA planning board\u2019s decision to grant or deny a waiver will be upheld unless premised upon \u2018a legally untenable ground, or is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Musto </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Medfield, supra </em>at 837, quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Chatham, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 355 (2001). The board\u2019s determination whether a particular waiver is in \u201cthe public interest\u201d involves a large measure of discretion, and if \u201creasonable minds might in good faith differ, without doubting the reasonableness of the opposing view, the conclusion reached by the planning board should be sustained on judicial review. For it is the board, not the court, to whom the statute delegates the discretion, and the role of the court is merely to ascertain whether the board exceeded its authority.\u201d <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 809 (1981). In reviewing a waiver granted by a board, the court determines whether there is substantial derogation from the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The Fagans argue that the judge erred in concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>board abused its discretion by waiving strict compliance with its subdivision rules and regulations, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 SIR, as to (1) the 325-foot minimum line of sight distance required for the intersection of the proposed Blue Spruce Drive with Heartbreak Road; and (2) the required minimum two-foot soil depth between the bottom of an infiltration basin and the level of the seasonal high water table. They also argue that the judge erred in concluding that their plan was not entitled to approval where the board did not expressly waive the required minimum handling capacity for storm water of a one hundred year storm event. We consider each, in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The judge found that the line of sight distance that would exist at the intersection looking north to Heartbreak Road would be 222 feet, rather than the 252-foot distance that the board found and considered to be \u201cminimally adequate.\u201d Relying on the guidelines established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the judge found that a 222-foot sight distance was adequate for vehicles traveling thirty-two miles per hour. The judge also found that, despite the posted speed limit on Heartbreak Road of twenty-five miles per hour, most vehicles traveling on the road exceeded thirty-two miles per hour. On that basis, the judge concluded that the board acted arbitrarily by accepting the 252-foot distance.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">On the record before us, we cannot say that the board abused its discretion in determining that the waiver was in the public interest and consistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law. The board\u2019s decision required posting of \u201cappropriate signage\u201d as a condition for waiving the required minimum sight distance. It stated that the 252-foot sight distance it found would exist at the intersection was sufficient for a speed in excess of the posted speed limit of twenty-five miles per hour. Given the judge\u2019s findings that there would be a 222-foot sight distance at the intersection, a distance some thirty feet less than that found by the board, and that the 222-foot distance would nevertheless be adequate for a speed of thirty-two miles per hour according to the AASHTO guidelines relied on by the judge, the record establishes that there was a reasonable basis to conclude that the waiver was in the public interest. When the judge determined that the board\u2019s \u201cproposed mitigation measure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>erecting two intersection signs and one additional speed limit sign [was] highly unlikely to bring drivers\u2019 speeds down to the thirty-two miles per hour level,\u201d he improperly substituted his own judgment for that of the board. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of </em>Chatham, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 355-357 &amp; n.11 (2001) (judicial review of board\u2019s decision based on de nova fact finding, but deference owed to decisions reflecting intimate knowledge, experience, and judgment of local officials); <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, supra. </em>The board conditioned the waiver on the installation of traffic signs, indicating that the board arrived at an engineering solution with the Fagans that would, given the speed limit of twenty-five miles per hour, provide substantially the same level of safety and convenience to the public as would strict adherence to the board\u2019s own rules and regulations. Accordingly, it was in the public interest to allow the Fagans to develop their land. Nor can we say that, in light of the board\u2019s conditions of the waiver, the difference of approximately one hundred feet between the 325-foot distance required by the board\u2019s regulations and the 222-foot line of sight found to exist by the judge amounted to a substantial derogation from the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law. Contrast <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 443-444 (1979) (waiver granted by planning board inconsistent with intent and purpose of subdivision control law where board did not require the installation of basic utilities in subdivision).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The judge also concluded that the board\u2019s waiver of its requirement that two feet of soil separate the bottom of infiltration basins from the seasonal high water table was contrary to the public interest and to public safety. He found that one of the proposed infiltration basins would be separated from the seasonal high water table by only nine and one-half inches of soil, and that another basin would have only twelve inches of separation. Although the board required, as a condition for its waiver, that pretreatment devices be installed inside the two basins, the judge found that the waiver was arbitrary because the pretreatment devices neither served the same functions as soil nor performed as effectively as soil. We cannot say that the board abused its discretion in determining that the waiver was in the public interest. The board stated that the purpose of the requirement was to protect the aquifer. It concluded that the pretreatment devices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>provided adequate mitigation, justifying waiving the two-foot soil depth requirement. Here, again, we conclude that requiring the installation of pretreatment filters inside the two infiltration basins in lieu of the amount of soil required by the subdivision rules and regulations, as a condition for the waiver, based on the board\u2019s finding that the Fagans\u2019 engineering solution would provide substantially the same level of safety and convenience to the public as would strict adherence to the board\u2019s own rules and regulations, was not an abuse of the board\u2019s discretion. Nor can we say that the installation of a pretreatment device, where the soil depth beneath one of the infiltration basins was less than half the required amount, constituted a substantial derogation from the intent and purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We agree with the judge, however, that the board erred in approving the plan without granting an express waiver of \u00a7 6.14.2 of its rules and regulations, requiring that storm water basins handle a minimum capacity of a one hundred year storm event. Pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R, the planning board is required to indorse any conditions either on the plan itself or as they appear in a separate instrument incorporated by reference on the plan. In directing entry of an order of remand to the board, the judge shall require that the board consider whether to waive the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">d. <em>Composition of the board. </em>The Fagans argue that the judge erred in ruling that the board\u2019s December, 2003, approval was not valid because the members of the board who voted to approve the plan had not been present at all of the public hearings when the plan was considered. See <em>Mullin </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of </em>Brewster, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 139 (1983). We agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">A public hearing held by a planning board to consider a definitive subdivision plan is quasi judicial in nature. <em>McElderry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>431 Mass. 722, 726 (2000). Action by a planning board to approve a definitive subdivision plan requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the board. <em>Id. </em>at 727. All members of the board who are to join in the decision must have attended the hearing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Mullin </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brewster, supra </em>at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Here, the judge found that, prior to the January, 2003, decision disapproving the plan and granting waivers, several board members missed meetings. The judge also found that much of the substantive information that the board relied on in its January, 2003, decision disapproving the plan and granting waivers was not considered by the board again prior to the May, 2003, decision, when the board readopted the waivers granted by the January, 2003, decision. The judge further found that board members missed meetings before the December, 2003, approval, and that the approval incorporated the same waivers granted by the January, 2003, decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In considering the judge\u2019s application of the so-called <em>Mullin </em>rule to these facts, we take into account the recent legislative enactment amending the open meeting law. See note 20, <em>supra. </em>Although it became effective after the proceedings in this case occurred and thus does not control here, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23D, now provides that, where a municipality has accepted the statutory section, a planning board member who misses a single session of a hearing where testimony or evidence is presented may nonetheless vote on the matter so long as the member certifies in writing that he or she has examined all the evidence presented at the missed session, including a recording or a transcript of the session.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Here, the record is clear that several board members who voted on the December, 2003, approval decision missed sessions at which the amended plan was considered. There is no dispute that some of the members were not even on the board prior to the January, 2003, decision when all of the evidence relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>waivers was presented. Furthermore, the judge found that a planning board member \u201cwho [was] not at the hearing would not [have] gain[ed] a great deal of knowledge regarding the substance of the hearing by reviewing the minutes,\u201d which were, as the judge found, \u201cnecessarily sketchy as to the substance of information presented.\u201d The judge concluded that the composition of the board \u201cseriously undermined the validity of an adjudicatory hearing on this subdivision.\u201d We agree.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>This matter is to be remanded for further proceedings consistent with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">\u201cAny person, whether or not previously a party to the proceedings . . . aggrieved by . . . any decision of a planning board concerning a plan of a subdivision of land, or by the failure of such a board to take final action concerning such a plan within the required time, may appeal to the superior court ... or to the land court ....
