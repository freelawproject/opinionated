We conclude that the sheriff lawfully terminated the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><em>Background. </em>The material, undisputed facts are as follows. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to March, 2000, the sheriff issued a request for proposal (RFP) inviting offers to lease a minimum of 5,000 square feet of office space near the West Roxbury District Court Flouse for use as a community corrections facility to be operated by the sheriff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The RFP provides that it would be \u201chighly advantageous\u201d if the lease term was for ten or more years. Under Part 1 of the RFP, entitled \u201cRFP General Information, Bid Submission Requirements and Other Terms and Conditions,\u201d the RFP incorporates by reference the city of Boston (city) standard contract (known as Form CM 10), and general conditions (known as Form CM 11). The RFP declares that these forms are provided in \u201cAttachment C,\u201d but the RFP provided to Morton Street did not include the attachment. The RFP, however, names William Sweeney as the \u201cProcurement Team Leader,\u201d and provides his contact information, including his telephone number, \u201cin the event this RFP is incomplete or the Proposer is having trouble obtaining any required attachments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The general conditions in Form CM 11 provide that the contract is \u201csubject to the availability of an appropriation therefor,\u201d and includes a termination provision in \u00a7 8.4 that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cThis Contract may be terminated at any time for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>convenience of the City at the option of the Official by delivering or mailing to the Contractor at the Contractor\u2019s business address a written notice of termination setting forth the date, not less than seven (7) days after the date of such delivery or mailing, when such termination shall be effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The RFP recognizes the possibility of a conflict between its express terms and the forms it incorporated (Forms CM 10 and 11), as well as amendments to the RFP and \u201cProposer Response Content,\u201d and specifies how any such conflicts should be resolved. Under this contractual order of preference, the RFP terms took precedence, followed by Form CM 11, and then by Form CM 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In response to the RFP, Morton Street tendered a proposal on March 9, 2000, offering to lease space in an office building at 113-123 Morton Street in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston. Morton Street and the sheriff then engaged in negotiations for the lease of office space in these premises, which resulted in the execution of a lease on June 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Under the lease, the sheriff agreed to lease the office space for ten years, commencing on the delivery of the premises to the sheriff when Morton Street\u2019s required improvements were substantially completed. The lease does not include any provision giving the sheriff or the city the right to terminate the lease with seven days\u2019 notice \u201cfor the convenience of the City.\u201d Indeed, the lease provides that, if the sheriff were to fail to pay the required fixed or additional rent, Morton Street, after giving the sheriff written notice and thirty days to cure its default, was entitled to repossess the premises and to be indemnified by the sheriff for any loss of rent it may suffer during the remaining term of the lease. The lease, however, expressly states: \u201cThis Lease is subject to the City of Boston and its Law Department\u2019s approval of the contract between the City of Boston and Landlord, which approval Tenant shall seek to secure as promptly as reasonably possible.\u201d The lease further provides that, if the tenant, despite its diligent efforts, were unable to obtain the city\u2019s approval, \u201cthe obligations of each party hereto will terminate and be of no further force or effect.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>On June 19, 2000, the sheriff wrote to the mayor of Boston asking him to approve the lease. On June 26, 2000, Sweeney sent a note to Morton Street requesting that its manager, Charles Sullivan, sign the city\u2019s standard contract (Form CM 10), with the general conditions contained in Form CM 11. Sullivan recognized that Form CM 11 included a termination provision that had not been contained in the lease, and told Sweeney by telephone that he would not sign it because it contradicted the lease.*<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sweeney explained that the execution of the form was an administrative requirement that had to be satisfied if any checks were to be paid to Morton Street for the lease payments. Sullivan told Sweeney, \u201cI will sign it and send it back, but only if we agree that basically this form is meaningless, that the numbers are inaccurate and the lease is the controlling document.\u201d Sweeney agreed, and Sullivan returned the executed standard contract on June 28, 2000, with a cover letter confirming \u201cour conversation that the terms of the lease will control over any inconsistent provision of the Standard Contract.\u201d Neither Sweeney, nor anyone else on behalf of the sheriff, responded to Sullivan\u2019s letter, or otherwise indicated to Morton Street that they disagreed with its contents. On July 14, 2000, the auditor for the city signed Form CM 10, approving the availability of an appropriation for the rent. Thomas Yotts, the chief financial officer for the sheriff, also signed the form as the \u201cawarding authority/official,\u201d but did not affix a date. On July 26, 2000, the mayor approved the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The sheriff occupied the leased premises for three years. During that time period, the entire cost of the lease was paid from funds provided by the Administrative Office of the Trial Court\u2019s office of community corrections (OCC). However, OCC was not able to continue to fund the lease into the fourth lease year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>which commenced at the same time as the new fiscal year on July 1, 2003. Having lost the OCC funding and faced now with the prospect of having to find the funds to pay the lease from its own budget, the sheriff decided to terminate the lease.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On July 2, 2003, the sheriff sent a letter of termination to Morton Street, declaring that, pursuant to the termination clause in Form CM 11, the lease was being terminated \u201cfor the convenience of the City.\u201d Morton Street responded by commencing suit in January, 2004, alleging that the termination was in breach of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Morton Street filed a motion for partial summary judgment, contending that the lease provided for a ten-year term and did not permit early termination. The sheriff filed a cross motion for summary judgment asserting that (1) the lease was void under \u00a7 12 (b) of the Uniform Procurement Act (Act), G. L. c. 30B, because it exceeded three years in duration without the requisite authorization by a majority of the county commissioners<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; (2) the lease could be terminated under G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 12 (a), because OCC terminated its funding for the lease and adequate funds were not available in the sheriffs budget to make the lease payments<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; and (3) early termination of the lease was permissible under Form CM ll\u2019s termination provision. In a carefully considered opinion, a Superior Court judge agreed with the sheriffs two arguments under G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 12 <em>(a) </em>and <em>(b), </em>and granted summary judgment for the sheriff. A judgment entered dismissing the complaint, and Morton Street appealed. We transferred the case here on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>We affirm the judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment, but on different grounds, namely, that under general contract principles, the sheriff was entitled to terminate the lease in accordance with Form CM 11 \u2019s unambiguous termination provision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because we affirm on this ground, we do not consider whether the sheriff would also be entitled to summary judgment on either or both of the grounds relied on by the Superior Court judge. Nor do we consider whether the sheriff is a \u201cgovernmental body\u201d under the Act, whose contracts for the procurement of supplies or real estate are governed by the Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor do we consider whether, if the sheriff\u2019s contracts were governed by the Act, its leasing of real estate would be governed solely by the provisions of G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 16, rather than the bidding requirements and limitations in G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Morton Street was given fair warning in the RFP that it would need to accept the general conditions in Form CM 11 as part of any contractual agreement with the sheriff if its proposal were accepted. Morton Street contends that it had no fair warning because it was not provided with a copy of Form CM 10 or Form CM 11 as \u201cAttachment C\u201d to the RFP. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>While Form CM 11 (and Form CM 10) should have been provided as the promised \u201cAttachment C\u201d to the RFP, the RFP invited those submitting proposals to contact the procurement team leader, whose name and contact information were provided, \u201cin the event this RFP is incomplete or the Proposer is having trouble obtaining any required attachments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Contrary to Morton Street\u2019s argument, the ten-year lease term requested in the RFP is not in conflict with the termination provision in Form CM 11, so the RFP need not take precedence as to termination. While the RFP seeks at least a ten-year lease term, it does not speak of termination. When read together with Form CM 11, which the RFP expressly incorporates and which sets forth an unambiguous termination provision, the RFP seeks a lease for at least ten years that would be terminable with seven days\u2019 notice by the designated official \u201cfor the convenience of the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The lease later negotiated between the sheriff and Morton Street, while it did not initially incorporate the general conditions in Form CM 11, provided that the lease was null and void without the city\u2019s approval. It was soon made clear to Morton Street that the city\u2019s approval was conditioned on Morton Street\u2019s execution of Forms CM 10 and 11, which gave the sheriff a right of termination on seven days\u2019 notice that had not been provided in the lease and which declared that the lease was \u201csubject to the availability of an appropriation therefor.\u201d Morton Street executed Form CM 10, with the general conditions as stated in Form CM 11, knowing that the terms of the general conditions of this standard contract modified the lease provision regarding termination. Morton Street, however, understood that its oral agreement with Sweeney, later memorialized in writing by Sullivan\u2019s cover letter, made Form CM 11 effectively \u201cmeaningless.\u201d Morton Street contends that this prior oral agreement with the sheriff\u2019s procurement team leader supersedes the plain language of the written standard contract it later executed and that, essentially, the sheriff should be estopped from enforcing a termination provision that her agent orally agreed would not be binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">We have been \u201creluctant to apply principles of estoppel to public entities where to do so would negate requirements of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>intended to protect the public interest.\u201d <em>Phipps Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>387 Mass. 687, 693 (1982), and cases cited. This traditional reluctance had been justified by the need to protect the public from improper collusion by public officials, deference to legislative policy, concern about the public fisc, and administrative efficiency. <em>McAndrew </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Cambridge, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 356, 360 (1985). The rule against applying estoppel to the government has applied \u201cwhere a government official acts, or makes representations, contrary to a statute or regulation designed to prevent favoritism, secure honest bidding, or ensure some other legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361. Consequently, when a public authority failed to follow statutory bidding procedures, we allowed the public authority to renege on an agreement to sell public property, even while recognizing that the public authority\u2019s conduct \u201cwould hardly qualify it for a \u2018sportsmanship\u2019 award,\u201d that the private party reasonably may conclude \u201cthat it was treated most unfairly,\u201d and that we \u201cwould extend little sympathy to a private citizen who acted similarly in a private transaction.\u201d <em>Phipps Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 693, 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Here, the oral agreement made by Sweeney was not contrary to any statute or regulation, but it was contrary to a written agreement soon to be entered into by the sheriff, Morton Street, and the city. The application of estoppel principles would be equally inappropriate here. To permit a private party, through a prior oral agreement with a government official, to nullify a subsequent written contract with a governmental entity would invite confusion and uncertainty in public contracting and endanger the public fisc. See <em>Stadium Manor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Division of Admin. Law Appeals, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 958, 962 (1987), quoting <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Community Health Servs. of Crawford County, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 51, 63 (1984) (\u201cProtection of the public fisc requires that those who seek public funds act with scrupulous regard for the requirements of law .... This is consistent with the general rule that those who deal with the [gjovemment are expected to know the law and may not rely on the conduct of [gjovemment agents contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u201cThe reliance of the party seeking the benefit of estoppel must have been reasonable.\u201d <em>O\u2019Blenes </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>of Lynn, </em>397 Mass. 555, 558 (1986). See <em>Franklin County Realty Trust </em>v. <em>Assessors of Greenfield, </em>391 Mass. 1018, 1018-1019 (1984); <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Rogovin, </em>289 Mass. 549, 552 (1935); <em>Calnan </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Lynn, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 384, 390 (2005). In the circumstances of this case, where the lease states that it was subject to the city\u2019s approval, we conclude, as a matter of law, that it was not reasonable for Morton Street to rely on a representation by Sweeney that the city\u2019s standard contract and general conditions (Forms CM 10 and 11) would be meaningless even after the standard contract was executed. Form CM 11 granted a right of termination that had not been provided in the lease. It was unreasonable for Morton Street to assume that the right it had granted in a written contract with the sheriff and the city would not exist or never be enforced based on Sweeney\u2019s oral representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Nor do the facts of this case equitably cry out for this court to overcome its historic reluctance to apply principles of estoppel to public entities. Morton Street executed a standard contract with the city knowing that the city required the contract to be executed before it would issue checks for the monthly lease payments. Under the oral agreement it made with Sweeney, the city would have continued to issue these checks, believing that Morton Street, by signing the standard contract, had accepted the general conditions when, in fact, Morton Street had rejected the termination provision of those general conditions. To grant estoppel here would mean enforcing an oral agreement whose sole purpose was to mislead the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Morton Street further contends that the sheriff could not terminate the lease pursuant to the termination clause because that clause permits termination only \u201cfor the convenience of the City,\u201d and not for the convenience of the sheriff. Morton Street ignores the language that follows that phrase, which provides that termination is permissible \u201cat any time for the convenience of the City <em>at the option of the </em>Official\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cOfficial\u201d is a defined term in Form CM 11, meaning \u201cthe awarding authority/officer acting on behalf of the City in the execution of the Contract.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The chief financial officer for the sheriff executed Form CM 10 as the \u201cawarding authority/official.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Morton Street argues that the phrase \u201cfor the convenience of the City\u201d used in the termination clause of Form CM 11 should not be interpreted to allow termination of the lease at will and without regard to the needs of the city (as opposed to the sheriff). As defined in the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 411 (3d ed. 1996), the word \u201cconvenience\u201d means the \u201cquality of being suitable to one\u2019s comfort, purposes, or needs.\u201d Implicitly, when termination is permitted \u201cfor the convenience of the City,\u201d the city (here, the sheriff, acting for the city) may terminate the lease when continuing it would become inconvenient for the city. Here, Form CM 11 provided clear notice that the lease could be terminated if its funding dried up when it declared that \u201c[t]his Contract is subject to the availability of an appropriation therefor.\u201d We need not determine the full extent of the sheriff\u2019s discretion to terminate a contract \u201cfor the convenience of the City,\u201d because, pursuant to the general conditions, losing the funding for the lease is plainly an inconvenience justifying termination. Having lost the funding from the OCC that had previously paid the entire annual cost of the lease, the sheriff now had to determine whether to find money within her own budget to pay for the lease. Because she was already faced with a considerable deficit, funding this lease would have meant reducing or eliminating the funding devoted to other obligations or programs. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>The decision to close the community corrections facility and terminate the lease is among the many challenging decisions that public officials with considerable obligations and limited resources often need to make, especially during difficult fiscal times, in order to allocate available resources more suitably to the sheriff\u2019s purposes or needs. In these circumstances, we conclude that the sheriff acted in accordance with Form CM 11 when she terminated the lease \u201cfor the convenience of the City,\u201d and did not commit a breach of the lease by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Debbie, LLC, is the current owner of the premises subject to the lease, and is the successor to Morton Street LLC\u2019s interest in the lease.

See <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Quincy Food Serv. Employees Ass\u2019n &amp; Hosp., Library &amp; Pub. Employees </em>Union, 407 Mass. 601, 603 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The community corrections facility was intended to be (and was) used as a women\u2019s resource center, \u201ca nonresidential, administrative custody program for female offenders [providing] educational, employment and counseling services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\">In connection with the sheriff\u2019s request for proposal (RFP), the city of Boston (city) and Suffolk County issued a separate RFP for the benefit of the sheriff \u201cfor [the provision of] goods and services and performing . . . work.\u201d This separate RFP is not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\">While the city apparently provides only approximately five per cent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>sheriff\u2019s funding, with the balance coming from State funds and grants, all checks written on behalf of the sheriff to vendors or contractors are issued by the city. Therefore, all contracts entered into by the sheriff had to be approved by the city and its law department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Charles Sullivan also noted that the total amount of rent to be paid over the ten-year term of the lease was in error on the standard contract, because the lease provided for the annual rent to be adjusted at the beginning of each successive lease year based on changes in the consumer price index, but the amount stated in the standard contract assumed no adjustments during the ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\">At the time, the sheriff was grappling with difficult budgetary issues, including a $5.4 million deficit for fiscal year 2003, with fiscal year 2004 looting equally bleak. The $5.4 million deficit for fiscal year 2003 derived in part from the settlement of a large Federal tort action against the sheriff. Payment in accordance with the settlement had been due since November, 2002, interest was accruing, and the settlement had not been fully funded by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">General Laws c. 30B, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>provides in part: \u201cUnless authorized by majority vote [here, of the county commissioners], a procurement officer shall not award a contract for a term exceeding three years . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">General Laws c. 30B, \u00a7 12 (a), provides in part: \u201cThe procurement officer shall not enter into a contract unless funds are available for the first fiscal year at the time of contracting.

Although the lease in the <em>Bradston </em>decision became effective only on the execution of the city\u2019s standard contract and general conditions (Forms CM 10 and 11), the sheriff never sought to terminate the lease based on the termination provision in Form CM 11. <em>Id. </em>at 276 &amp; n.2. Therefore, the termination provision that proves decisive here was never addressed in <em>Bradston.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">A \u201c[glovemmental body\u201d under the Uniform Procurement Act is defined as \u201ca city, town, district, regional school district, county, or agency, board, commission, authority, department or instrumentality of a city, town, district, regional school district or county.\u201d G.
