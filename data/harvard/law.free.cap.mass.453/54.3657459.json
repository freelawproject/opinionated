Morgan (Morgan), received a telephone call from Louis Heinold. Heinold threatened to harm Morgan\u2019s son, Dana John Morgan (who is known as Dane), if Dane did not take the blame for drug possession charges recently filed against Dane and Heinold. That evening, Heinold was stabbed to death in his room. Two years later, Morgan confessed to killing Heinold, a confession he recanted at trial. On October 22, 2003, a jury convicted Morgan of murder in the first degree on the theory of deliberate premeditation and of committing perjury before the grand jury that had originally investigated Heinold\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">On appeal from his convictions and from the denial of his motions for postconviction discovery and a new trial, Morgan claims that (1) his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to seek the assistance of independent experts to challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s blood evidence and opinion testimony regarding the nature of the weapon that inflicted the fatal wounds; and (2) the trial judge committed error by denying his motion for the postconviction appointment of expert witnesses, and by denying his new trial motion without an evidentiary hearing. We affirm the convictions and the order denying postconviction discovery and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">1. <em>Trial. </em>The Commonwealth presented the following evidence, which the jury could have concluded was credible. In January, 2000, Morgan was forty-seven years old and lived on the second floor of a rooming house with his twenty-one year old son, Dane. The rooming house was a three-story structure consisting of private rooms separated by common hallways with common bathrooms. Heinold lived directly above Morgan and Dane in a room on the third floor. Mark Padovano and Pam Johnson (Heinold\u2019s former girl friend) were sharing a different room on the third floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Dane and Heinold engaged in intravenous drug use together. This relationship angered Morgan, who had repeatedly asked Heinold (who was much older than Dane) not to involve Dane in his drug activity. However, on January 7, 2000, Dane and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Heinold drove to Worcester where they were arrested after Heinold purchased heroin. Dane was charged with knowingly being present where heroin was kept, and Heinold was charged with possession of heroin and trespassing. At the time, Heinold was on probation, and, as a result of the arrest, was facing a probation surrender hearing scheduled for March 31, 2000. Morgan\u2019s anger at the negative influence Heinold was having on his son erupted at one point after the arrest and about five weeks prior to Heinold\u2019s death, Morgan knocked on the door of Heinold\u2019s room and, when Heinold opened it, punched him four or five times in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">On March 8, 2000, Morgan worked his regular 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. shift as a cook at a delicatessen. While at work, Morgan received a telephone call from Heinold informing him that Hei-nold intended to do serious harm to Dane, which Morgan took to mean administering a lethal overdose of heroin, if Dane did not take the blame for the drug possession charges filed against him in January. This threatening telephone call threw Morgan into a \u201ctizzy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In the early morning hours of March 9, Johnson, while doing laundry at the rooming house, walked passed Heinold\u2019s room and noticed the door was ajar. She entered the room and came out hysterical, screaming, \u201cLouie\u2019s dead.\u201d Officers from the Framingham police department responded to the scene and found Heinold slumped over in a chair with a large \u201ccutting wound\u201d to his throat. Detective Paul O\u2019Connell canvassed the building and spoke with Morgan, who denied having any knowledge about the killing. O\u2019Connell observed a bandage on Morgan\u2019s lower right cheek and on his right index finger. Morgan explained that he had cut himself the previous day (March 8) while at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The crime scene was processed for forensic evidence by the State police. Dane\u2019s fingerprints were found on a piece of paper on the floor near Heinold\u2019s feet. Morgan\u2019s fingerprints were not found in the room. Blood was found in and around Heinold\u2019s room and collected for later deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing by Cellmark Diagnostics. At trial, defense counsel stipulated to certain DNA test results, including that: Morgan\u2019s blood was not found in Heinold\u2019s room; a drop of blood found in the hallway outside Heinold\u2019s room was determined to be Morgan\u2019s; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>an additional bloodstain found in the hallway outside a neighboring room on the third floor was not attributable to either Morgan or Heinold, but was from the same person whose blood was found on a pillow sham in the building\u2019s laundry room. The pillow sham belonged to Padovano.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On May 4, 2000, Morgan testified before the grand jury. According to his grand jury testimony, which was admitted in evidence at trial, Morgan did not visit Heinold\u2019s room on March 8 or March 9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, on returning home from work sometime after 9 p.m. on the evening of March 8, he walked up to the third floor to borrow a beer from Padovano. He also told the grand jury that he had cut his finger and his face while at work earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In January, 2001, Morgan moved to Austin, Texas, and Dane followed about two months later. On April 1, 2002, Dane spoke to detectives of the Austin police department. Based on this conversation, one of the detectives telephoned the Framingham police department and subsequently arrested Morgan on an outstanding motor vehicle warrant. Morgan was brought to the Austin police department, and after waiving his Miranda rights, was questioned by detectives about Heinold\u2019s murder. Morgan asked if he could speak with Dane who was brought into the interview room and left alone with Morgan. Their conversation was recorded by the Austin police department. In that conversation, Morgan told Dane that he had killed Heinold because he \u201chad to do something\u201d to protect Dane because \u201c[Heinold] was going to hurt you, set you up,\u201d and that \u201c[b]eating [Heinold] up didn\u2019t do any fucking good.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the detective reentered the interview room, Morgan confessed that he had murdered Heinold, and thereafter signed a statement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">On April 12, Framingham police Detective Mike Hill and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Massachusetts State Trooper Peter Sennott traveled to Austin to speak with Morgan. After receiving Miranda warnings, Morgan gave them the following account of Heinold\u2019s killing. On March 8, 2000, he returned home from work, grabbed a \u201cweird\u201d knife with a six-inch \u201cdouble-edged\u201d blade from his room, and went upstairs by himself to confront Heinold. He banged on Hei-nold\u2019s door, when Heinold opened the door, Morgan \u201clost [his] temper\u201d and stabbed him in the right chest area. Heinold retreated from the door to the love seat, with Morgan following him. While Heinold was seated on the love seat, near death, Morgan cut his throat. Morgan then cut the telephone line in Heinold\u2019s room and left, walking down the back stairs to a second-floor bathroom. As Morgan was washing up, Dane and Padovano entered the bathroom. Morgan gave his shirt and the knife to Dane and told him to dispose of the items. Dane and Padovano left the rooming house, and Morgan returned to his room.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">At trial, Padovano testified that on the evening of March 8, he witnessed Morgan with a large knife headed up to Heinold\u2019s apartment, with Dane, to confront Heinold. A short while later, when he and Dane were about to leave the rooming house to drive to Padovano\u2019s sister\u2019s home, Morgan came out of the bathroom and gave Dane something wrapped in paper towels, which Dane then disposed of in a dumpster along the way. Padovano also admitted that at the time of the murder he was an alcoholic, drinking thirty to forty beers a day, always looking for money, and having been arrested \u201c[pjrobably a hundred times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Also at trial, Dr. Faryl Sandler, a forensic pathologist employed by the medical examiner\u2019s office, testified about the results of the autopsy she performed on Heinold. Dr. Sandler concluded that the cause of Heinold\u2019s death was multiple stab wounds to the neck, chest, and abdomen, three of which would have been fatal. During direct examination, Dr. Sandler stated that determining whether or not wounds were caused by a single-edged or a double-edged knife is \u201cnot an exact science.\u201d On cross-examination, however, Dr. Sandler testified that Heinold\u2019s wounds were consistent with a single-edged blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Morgan was the only witness called by the defense. He testified that his confessions to murdering Heinold were false, and that he had given them because he had made a pact with Dane to \u201ctake the heat\u201d for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In his closing argument, defense counsel argued that the absence of Morgan\u2019s blood in Heinold\u2019s room and the information gleaned from the autopsy indicating that a single-edged knife probably inflicted the murderous wounds, were significant inconsistencies between Morgan\u2019s confessions and the evidence found at the murder scene, corroborating Morgan\u2019s testimony that his confessions were false. While acknowledging that the single drop of blood found in the hallway outside of Heinold\u2019s room was Morgan\u2019s, defense counsel argued that its presence there was explained by the cut Morgan had sustained at work that day. Defense counsel also implied that it was Padovano who likely committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>Morgan alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in his motion for a new trial. The judge denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. We consider his claim to determine whether there exists a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, a standard more favorable to a defendant than the constitutional standard for determining the ineffectiveness of counsel. <em>Commonwealth v. Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). Thus, we consider whether there was error during the course of the trial, and, if so, whether the error was \u201clikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We consider a defendant\u2019s claim even if the action by defense counsel does not \u201cconstitute conduct falling \u2018measurably below\u2019 that of \u2018an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 517 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). A strategic decision by an attorney, however, constitutes error \u201conly if it was manifestly unreasonable when made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 827 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth, </em>v. <em>Martin, 427 </em>Mass. 816, 822 (1998). \u201c[Strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable [only] to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Baker, </em>440 Mass. 519, 529 (2003), quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690-691 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Morgan\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based on defense counsel\u2019s failure to seek the assistance of independent experts to challenge the blood evidence and the medical examiner\u2019s testimony regarding the nature of the stab wounds and the weapon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>that inflicted them. Contrary to Morgan\u2019s contentions, defense counsel had no incentive to hire independent experts to challenge the blood and wound evidence, and the record reflects that defense counsel made effective use of both to support Morgan\u2019s defense that he falsely confessed to murdering Heinold.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">a. <em>The blood evidence. </em>Morgan contends that his counsel should not have stipulated that the drop of blood found in the third-floor hallway was Morgan\u2019s without retaining his own expert to test it, and that the failure meaningfully to investigate the validity of the blood sample crippled the defense\u2019s ability to buttress Morgan\u2019s recantation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s stipulation to the blood evidence was a strategic decision that advanced Morgan\u2019s theory of the case. First, the DNA evidence showed that Morgan\u2019s blood was not found inside Heinold\u2019s room. Second, the drop of Morgan\u2019s blood found outside of Heinold\u2019s room was consistent with Morgan\u2019s grand jury testimony that he had sustained cuts while at work,* <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and on returning home, had gone up to the third floor to see Padovano. Third, other blood found in the third-floor hallway and on the pillow sham found in the laundry room could be linked to Padovano, who defense counsel established was an alcoholic who knew that Heinold had drugs and money in his room, and who might have had his own motive for killing Heinold.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Moreover, the DNA testing had been done at a reputable independent laboratory, and there was no reason to suspect that its findings were in error. The consistency of the test results combined with the defense offered made defense counsel\u2019s decision not to hire his own independent expert to perform further DNA testing a reasonable professional judgment that we will not second-guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">b. <em>The wound evidence. </em>Morgan confessed to using a \u201cweird\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>knife with a six-inch double-edged blade to stab Heinold and cut his throat. Dr. Sandler identified five stab wounds on Hei-nold\u2019s body<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and testified that some of the wounds had a \u201cblunt\u201d edge. On direct examination, Dr. Sandler testified that a knife wound with a blunt edge \u201cusually signifies\u201d a blunt edge to the knife, such as a single-edge knife, but that this \u201cdoesn\u2019t always hold for a variety of reasons,\u201d and is not an \u201cexact science.\u201d One of the reasons for this lack of scientific certainty is that \u201csome knives are double-edged for a portion of the knife and then they become single-edged farther back on the knife, particularly large knives sometimes do that. It\u2019s double-edged halfway up and then it becomes a blunt end on the top\u201d of the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Morgan argues that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to seek the assistance of an independent pathologist to help oppose or cross-examine Dr. Sandler\u2019s testimony concerning the knife wounds. However, on cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony that four of the wounds, including the three fatal ones, had a \u201csharp lateral aspect and a blunt medial aspect,\u201d which Dr. Sandler testified were consistent with a single-edged blade. Later, in his closing summation, defense counsel made use of that testimony to argue that the jury should \u201c[ljook at what the doctor said. As much as she tried to discuss the possibility \u2014 not probability, the possibility, of a double-edged blade, in her autopsy report in four or five of the wounds the language always was a sharp aspect and a dull aspect, indicating a knife with one blade.\u201d This, he noted, was an important inconsistency between Morgan\u2019s confession and the forensic evidence, further supporting Morgan\u2019s claim that he falsely confessed to murdering Heinold. In the face of the testimony at trial, Morgan has failed to show how an independent pathologist could have aided defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Sandler, or shed further light on whether a single-edged or double-edged knife caused Heinold\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">3. <em>Postconviction discovery. </em>Morgan claims that the judge erred by denying his motion for the postconviction appointment of expert witnesses to review the DNA and wound evidence presented at trial. In requesting postconviction discovery, a defen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>dont \u201cmust make a sufficient showing that the discovery is reasonably likely to uncover evidence that might warrant granting a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>445 Mass. 392, 407 (2005). To satisfy the standard for discovery under a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, \u201ca defendant must make specific, not speculative or conclusory, allegations that the newly discovered evidence would have \u2018materially aid[ed] the defense against the pending charges,\u2019 . . . and that this evidence if explored further through discovery, could yield evidence that might have \u2018played an important role in the jury\u2019s deliberations and conclusions, even though it is not certain that the evidence would have produced a verdict of not guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 405, 414 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In support of his motion, Morgan filed an affidavit of trial counsel. In the affidavit, trial counsel admitted that he had not sought either independent verification of the DNA evidence implicating Morgan or an independent pathologist to help in opposing or cross-examining the Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist concerning the knife wounds. Morgan claims that defense counsel\u2019s affidavit unequivocally establishes neglect to investigate the DNA and wound evidence meaningfully \u2014 the essence of Morgan\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. As such, Morgan claims that his motion for the appointment of postconviction experts is essential to establish the material harm of the failure to investigate and, therefore, should have been allowed. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that the affidavit does not make a sufficient showing that the requested discovery is reasonably likely to uncover evidence that might warrant granting a new trial. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Morgan presents two primary reasons why the blood DNA evidence introduced by the Commonwealth at trial is likely to be found inaccurate if tested by an independent expert. First, Morgan argues that the alleged disarray of the State crime laboratory provides a basis for believing that the DNA evidence presented at trial was inaccurate. However, as the judge noted, the DNA evidence was not tested by the State crime laboratory, but was tested by Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratories. Second, Morgan contends that DNA evidence generally is subject to multiple credibility challenges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He has not, however, demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>with any specificity how any of these DNA \u201ccredibility\u201d issues might have had an impact on the DNA evidence admitted at this trial. Rather, he merely asserts that if experts review the DNA sample found by Cellmark Diagnostics to match his blood, they might discover that it in fact does not match his blood, in which case, the newly discovered evidence will warrant granting a new trial based on ineffective assistance of defense counsel. Mere speculation is insufficient to support a request for postconviction appointment of an expert to review the DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Morgan has similarly failed to establish that a review of the wound evidence by a postconviction expert is reasonably likely to uncover evidence that might warrant granting a new trial. Morgan claims that, because defense counsel failed to retain his own wound pathologist, his cross-examination was based on no more than Dr. Sandler\u2019s pathology report and her direct examination. Assuming, arguendo, that Morgan\u2019s claim regarding defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Sandler is correct, he still has made no specific showing that any new evidence concerning the stab wounds would likely be discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Last, Morgan claims that under G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, he is entitled to the postconviction appointment of experts. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statute is intended to provide for the payment of certain fees and costs incurred by an indigent party in litigation. General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 27 A, includes \u201cexpert assistance\u201d in its defin\u00ed - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>tian of \u201c[e]xtra fees and costs,\u201d which may be paid under G. L. 261, \u00a7 27C (4), if such services the judge finds are \u201creasonably necessary to assure the applicant as effective a . . . defense or appeal as he would have if he were financially able to pay.\u201d While the statute is meant to cover the expenses of expert assistance, it does not entitle the defendant to the appointment of such assistance, where, as here, the defendant has failed to make a sufficient showing that such assistance is \u201creasonably likely to uncover evidence that might warrant a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Daniels, </em>445 Mass. 392, 407 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">4. <em>Evidentiary hearing. </em>Finally, Morgan claims that the judge erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing on his motion for a new trial. Whether to hold a hearing on a motion for a new trial is within the judge\u2019s discretion, see Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), and the judge may \u201cdecide a motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing where no substantial issue is raised by the motion or affidavits.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Wallis, </em>440 Mass. 589, 596 (2003), citing Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (3), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). When the motion judge is also the trial judge, as in this case, she may use her \u201cknowledge and evaluation of the evidence at trial in determining whether to decide the motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Wallis, supra. </em>We give substantial deference to a judge\u2019s conclusion in this regard. <em>Id. </em>Evaluation of whether \u201cthe motion and supporting materials suffice to raise a \u2018substantial issue\u2019 involves consideration of the seriousness of the issue itself and the adequacy of the showing that has been made with respect to that issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 348 (2004). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Morgan\u2019s motion and counsel\u2019s affidavit do not raise a substantial issue with respect to his claim of ineffective assistance. Counsel\u2019s tactical decision not to challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s DNA evidence was not manifestly unreasonable, and Morgan has not shown how the services of an expert to challenge Dr. Sandler\u2019s testimony would have aided the defense beyond what defense counsel was able to accomplish through cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We have examined the record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to determine whether there is any basis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>set aside or reduce the murder verdict, regardless whether such grounds were raised on appeal. We conclude that the evidence supported Morgan\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree, by reason of deliberate premeditation, and that there is no basis on which to reduce that verdict or order a new trial. We also conclude that the evidence supported Morgan\u2019s conviction of perjury before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>Order denying motions for a new trial and postconviction discovery affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">This was the defendant\u2019s second trial.
