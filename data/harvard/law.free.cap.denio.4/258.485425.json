On the first day of August, 1845, the sheriff of Columbia county, by his deputy, sold certain lands belonging to Philo G. Shumway, by virtue of two judgments and executions against him, to John H. Mesick. Within the tune allowed to judgment creditors to acquire the right of the purchaser, Martin Yan Dusen, as the attorney of Isaac Shumway, paid to the sheriff the amount of the bid of Mesick, with interest thereon, and delivered to him certified copies of the docket of a judgment in favor of I. Shumway, from a clerk\u2019s office of this court and from the clerk of the county of Columbia, where the judgment had been docketed pursuant to the act of 1840. From these copies of the docket it appeared that M. Yan Dusen was the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the judgment. Yan Dusen, on behalf of I. Shumway, at the same time delivered to the sheriff his own affidavit stating the sum due on the judgment at the time of claiming the right to redeem. After the title of the suit, this affidavit commenced as follows: \u201c Columbia county, ss. <em>Martin Van Dusen, the attorney of the above named plaintiff, </em>being duly sworn, saith,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">The sheriff conveyed the premises to Mesick, as purchaser.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-9\"><em>H.

S. </em>373, \u00a7 60.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b259-5\"><em>By the </em>Court, Jewett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsJ\">The purchase by Shumway of the title of the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale was duly made, provided the affidavit of the true amount due on Shumway\u2019s judgment was sufficient. This is required to be made by the <em>creditor or by his attorney or agent. </em>(2 <em>R. S. </em>373, \u00a7 6, <em>sub. </em>3.) The objection that the fact of Van Dusen being the attorney is not directly sworn to, is answered by the suggestion that his name appeared as plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the copies of the docket. But I. am of opinion that the attorney for the plaintiff on the record cannot, by virtue of that character alone, make the affidavit. The words \u201c attorney\u201d or <em>\u201c </em>agent\u201d appear to have been used by the legislature as synonymous, and were intended to designate the person employed by the creditor in the business of making the redemption. The authority of the attorney in the suit generally expires with the perfecting of judgment, although he has certain powers which may be exercised after that event, such as issuing execution, receiving payment and acknowledging satisfaction. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>8 <em>John. </em>361; <em>Kellogg </em>v. Gilbert, 10 <em>id. </em>220; <em>Gorham </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>7 <em>Cowen, </em>739; <em>Simonton </em>v. <em>Barrell, </em>21 <em>Wend. </em>362; <em>Corning </em>v. <em>Southland, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>552; 2 <em>R. S. </em>362, \u00a7 24.) Van Dusen being unauthorized under his retainer in the suit in which the judgment was recovered to make the affidavit, it was essential that his character as the attorney of the creditor in the special proceeding should be directly sworn to in the affidavit. It was so held where the affidavit was made by one claiming to be the <em>agent </em>of the creditor. <em>(Ex parte The Bank of Monroe, </em>7 <em>Hill, </em>177.) In that case as in the present, he was named as the agent, but this was held' to be merely <em>discriptio personae. </em>The principle there decided must govern this case; and the motion for a mandamus must consequently be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Motion denied.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\"><em> </em>This motion was decided in December, 1846.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
