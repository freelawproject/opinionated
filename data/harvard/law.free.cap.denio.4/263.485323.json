But the defendant knew before the trial that the plaintiff claimed an estate in fee. On the trial the plaintiff proved a title in fee, and the jury found in his favor that he was entitled to an estate in fee in the premises. The defendant objected to evidence showing a title in fee, because no such claim was made in the declaration; but the judge overruled the objection, and the defendant excepted. A bill of exceptions had been settled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-7\">\n<em>D.
