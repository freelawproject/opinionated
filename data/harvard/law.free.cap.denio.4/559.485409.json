Parley Howlett.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8R\">The cause was tried before a referee. It was proved that the firm referred to in the letter consisted of Daniel Peck, S. R. Howlett, and Ezra Foster. Peck died shortly before the date of the guaranty, whereby the firm became dissolved. Before that event the plaintiff had been in the habit of endorsing the paper of the firm; and on the occasion of each endorsement, they had given him their note for a corresponding amount, endorsed by the defendant. The guaranty in question was given at the instance of the plaintiff, who suggested that it would be a more convenient method of transacting the business. When the guaranty was given there were notes outstanding against the firm which were endorsed by the plaintiff to an amount equal to the two notes hereinafter mentioned; and upon receiving the guaranty the plaintiff gave up the notes he held by way of indemnity, bearing the defendant\u2019s endorsement. On the 25th July, 1842, S. R. Howlett made a note for $400, payable to the order of H. T. Meech, at the Albany City Bank, ninety days after date; and on the 10th September, following, he mad\u00e9 another note for $2150, payable to the order of the plaintiff, sixty-three days after date, at the same bank. Both these notes were signed \u201cS. R. Howlett, for the late firm of Peck, Howlett &amp; Fosterand were endorsed by the plaintiff; the one last mentioned having been also endorsed by the payee; and both were discounted at the bank at which they were made payable, in renewal of notes held by the bank which were made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>by the firm of Peck, Hewlett &amp; Foster, and endorsed by the plaintiff. When the notes so discounted in renewal of the former ones became payable, they were respectively protested for non-payment, and the plaintiff was charged as endorser; and he, before the commencement of the suit, paid the notes to the holders, to the amount of $2564,72. This sum the referee reported to be due to the plaintiff, provided the supreme court should be of the opinion that the notes were such as the guaranty contemplated, and provided the guaranty was a valid undertaking within the statute of frauds. The cause was twice argued, for the reason stated in the opinion of the chief justice.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-5\"><em>M. T.

(26 <em>Wend. </em>341; 5 <em>Barn. &amp; Adolph. </em>1109; 1 <em>Crompt. &amp; J. </em>461.) 2. No consideration is alluded to for the past endorsements which the plaintiff had made. As to those it is clearly void, and the promise being an entire one, no part of it can be enforced. (1 <em>Perry &amp; Davison, </em>477; <em>Chitty on Cont. </em>519; 5 <em>Cow. </em>162; 15 <em>Pick </em>159; 1 <em>Bing. N.

(2 <em>R. S. </em>135, \u00a7 2.) This agreement, by its terms, is plainly intended to bind the defendant to answer as well for a debt theretofore contracted, by Peck, Hewlett &amp; Foster, and protected by the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement, as for subsequent engagements of that firm which he should endorse. It is, therefore, such an agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>as the statute, declares void, unless the- consideration- be. expressed: therein. (3 <em>Kent's Com. </em>87, \u00a7 44, 1st <em>ed.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The' next- inquiry is, whether the consideration of the agreement is sufficiently expressed therein. Previous, to the revised statutes, the rule, although at times doubted, was well settled in this state and- in England, that to render a memorandum' or agreement in writing valid- under the statute of frauds, it was required that the consideration for the promise, as well as the promise itself, should be expressed therein. That the word agreement, required by the statute to be in writing, comprehended the consideration as well as the promise, and that the omission could not be supplied by parol proof. <em>(Sears </em>v. <em>Brink, </em>3 <em>John. R. </em>209; <em>Leonard </em>v. Vredenburgh, 8 <em>id. </em>29; <em>Bailey &amp; Bogert </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>11 <em>id. </em>221; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Dubois, </em>13 <em>id. </em>175; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Kneeland, </em>10 <em>Wend. </em>219 ; <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters, </em>5 <em>East, </em>10; <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>4 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>Ald. </em>595; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>6 <em>Moore, </em>86; <em>Chit. on Cont. </em>517, <em>ed. </em>1842.) Under this rule, the question arose, what amounted to an expression of the consideration,.upon the face of the writing <em>1 </em>Mr. Justice Nelson, in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Kneeland, </em>reviewed some of the leading English cases on this question, and came to the conclusion that \u201ca consideration implied or inferred from the-terms of the instrument, is as effectual as if expressly appearing on its face.It is a general principle,\u201d he said, <em>\u201c </em>applicable to all instruments or agreements, that whatever may be fairly -implied from the terms or language of an instrument,- is, in judgment of law, contained in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In the case of <em>Bewley </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>(1 <em>Hayes\u2019 Irish Exch. R. </em>356,) Joy, Ch. Baron, after a full'review of the cases as they-stood in 1832, came to this result\u2014\u201c that the consideration, must clearly appear upon the guaranty itself, either by express-statement or necessary implication.\u201d This question was considered in the case of. <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>(15 <em>Wend. </em>343,) which .arose since the. revised statutes. The. defendant, with' a view-to gain time for. the makers of two' existing, notes held by the plaintiff, and which were past due, signed a guaranty endorsed upon each of them in .these, words,- <em>\u201cI </em>guaranty the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>payment of the within note in six months.\u201d In a suit on the guaranty, Chief Justice Savage, after noticing the construction which had been given to the former statute of frauds, and the doctrine that a consideration might be made out by inference, came to the following conclusion : \u201c It was thought by the revisers and the legislature that the most proper way for courts to find out the consideration of an agreement was, not to infer or imply or spell out the consideration; but after the passing the revised statutes, the party should express the consideration. It is argued by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the revised statutes have not altered the rule in this respect; and it may be conceded that the only difference is between the words express and imply, but that is a very material one in the present case. I consider the statute cannot be misunderstood; the consideration must be expressly contained in the agreement. The consideration is an important part of every agreement, and necessary to its validity; and the legislatura intended that it should plainly appear upon the face of the instrument.\u201d The same question again came under consideration in <em>Douglass v. </em>Howland, (24 <em>Wend. </em>35.) The action was upon a guaranty, <em>\u25a0tinder seal, </em>and expressed to b\u00e9 \u201c for value received.\u201d The opinion\" of the court was delivered by the late Mr.\"Justice Cow\u00e9n, who held that the statute had no application to instruments under seal. He was also of opinion that the words \u201cfor value received\u201d were a sufficient expression of a consideration. Upon the particular point now under consideration, he said, \u201c The diff\u00e9rence between the old and new statute, as mentioned by the revisers in their note, is \u2018the requiring the consideration of the agreement to be specified.\u2019 (3 <em>R. S. </em>656, <em>2d ed.) </em>The marginal note to <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>is, that the agreement was holden void, because the consideration was not stated. Whether we say it must be expressed as in the statute, specified as in the notes, or stated as in East, it appears to me the intent must be the same. The principle is, that the consideration, being an\" important part of the agreement; should be made apparent in wilting, as well as the promise.\u201d And again; \u201c Whatever then, may be fairly implied from the language, is expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>It strikes me that the words <em>expressed, specified </em>and <em>stated, </em>convey the same idea, and that although one is used in the statute, another in the revisers\u2019 notes, and the third in Bast, no argument can arise from this diversity of language <em>to show </em>that courts are at liberty to <em>infer, imply, </em>or <em>spell out </em>the consideration of a promise. It would seem to be immaterial whether we say that the consideration must be expressed, specified or stated\u2014as the use of either word conveys the same idea, of something being represented or set down, declared or designated in writing; and whenever a written simple guaranty to answer for the debt or default of another is presented, the court is not now, if it was before the revised statutes, at liberty to infer or imply any thing to exist between the parties to it, not expressed, specified or stated therein. I do not know that I correctly comprehend the idea advanced, that \u201c whatever may be fairly implied from the language used, is expressed.\u201d If it is that what the court may conjecture to have been in the minds of the parties, may be said to be expressed in the instrument, I cannot assent to the proposition. I do not think that because one thing may be inferred by fair implication from the existence of another, that it can be therefore said to be expressed. I agree with the learned judge, that <em>\u201c </em>The principle is, that the consideration being an important part of the agreement, should be made apparent in writing, as well as the promise,\u201d and that the statute does not require that either should be expressed in any particular form of language\u2014so long as both promise and consideration are expressed in the writing. The statute does not, in my judgment, uphold such promise when the consideration is not visible by the writing evidencing the promise. It is said that to imply a consideration in such a case as the guaranty in <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>above referred to, \u201c requires the merest straining of the fancy,\u201d and yet in the case of <em>Shortrede </em>v. <em>Cheek, (1 Adol. &amp; Ellis, 57,) </em>it seems to have been thought that the-consideration in that guaranty could be quite\u201deasily implied. I am not able to see the supposed advantage the latter case has over the former in supplying the guaranty with a consideration by implication. In the first of these cases we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>have seen that the plaintiff held a promissory note which was past due, and a third person (the defendant) wrote and signed an undertaking to pay the amount in six months. The consideration of this promise is not expressed in the writing. But in the other case, the plaintiff held the note of the defendant\u2019s son, and a further indebtedness against the son, evidenced by a memorandum. The defendant wrote to the plaintiff as follows: \u201cSir\u2014You will be so good as to withdraw the promissory note, and I will see you at Christmas, when you shall receive from me the amount of it, together with the memorandum of my son\u2019s, making in the whole \u00a345.\u201d In this case it was held that the consideration was sufficiently expressed. A man of business and ordinary intelligence, on being presented with the note and guaranty referred to in the first mentioned suit, and observing that the latter bore date after the note had become due, would, I think, very readily conjecture that the guaranty was signed to obtain delay for the maker. But the same person being presented with the letter in the other case, without the parol proof to connect the note and letter, and asked to guess what note the letter referred to, I apprehend would not find the language sufficiently expressive on that point to enable him to infer that it related to the note of the defendant\u2019s son ; and yet the court, in that case, with the aid of the parol proof, held that a sufficient consideration was stated within the statute ; while in the former it was held, and I think correctly, that the guaranty was void for want of the expression of a consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">It is plain that there is no consideration expressed, stated or specified in the writing upon which this suit is brought, for the promise contained in it; and if it be conceded that the statute would be satisfied if the consideration could be fairly implied from the language of the writing, I do not see any certainty of hitting on the true one, if an attempt should be made. There are several considerations which, without much ingenuity, might be conjectured. In <em>Cole </em>v. Dyer, (1 <em>Cromp. &amp; Jer. </em>461,) Lord Lyndhurst is reported to have said, that when \u201c two distinct considerations may, with equal probability, be inferred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>as the inducement for the engagement, the .wilting is not laxen out of the operation of the statute of frauds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">I see no ground upon which this action can be sustained.</p>\n<author id=\"b566-5\">Beardsley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">It admits of no doubt that after the decease of Daniel Peck, by which the firm of Peck, Howlett &amp; Foster was dissolved, the surviving members might, if they thought proper so to do, continue to transact business in the name of the late firm. They were at liberty to adopt this or any other name, in carrying on a joint business, whether general in its character, or limited to the winding up of that of the late firm; and if this name had been so adopted by Samuel R. Howlett and Ezra Foster, contracts duly executed by either for such new firm, would be obligatory on both. The usual form of executing copartnership contracts, as bills and notes, is by signing the copartnership name alone. But it is not indispensable that the execution should be in that form; for all the members of a firm may be bound by the name of one of their number, when signed for all, that being expressed on the face of the writing. (3 <em>Kent, </em>41, <em>5th ed.; Coll. on Partnership, </em>228; <em>Story on Agency, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 37, 154, 155; <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>56, 59,10th <em>Am. ed.) </em>In this case the notes of July 28th and September 10th, may have been given, and such indeed seems to have been the fact, in the course of winding up the business of the late firm of Peck, Howlett &amp; Foster, and although signed by <em>\"S. R. Howlett, for the late firm of Peck, Howlett </em>Foster,\u201d they may have bound both the surviving members of that firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Qne of the questions submitted by the referee is, whether the notes above mentioned, <em>\u201c </em>are such notes as are described in the\u201d agreement executed by the defendant to the plaintiff, and upon which this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The referee has found that these notes were executed by S. R. Howlett, in the form in which they appear, with the assent and concurrence of Foster, and were used in the process of winding up the business of the late firm of Peck, Howlett &amp; Foster, having been endorsed by the plaintiff for that purpose at the request of the surviving members, Hewlett and Foster. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Such being the facts, the notes and endorsements were, as I think, precisely such as were contemplated by one branch of the defendant\u2019s agreement. That agreement, it will be ob served, -was executed after the death of Peck, and when the late firm of which he was a member had ceased to exist. The firm is referred to in the agreement as the <em>late </em>firm; its dissolution was therefore known to the defendant when the agreement was executed. One branch of this agreement undertakes to provide for endorsements previously made for that firm, and while it had an existence; but the other, and now the only material branch of the contract, has reference to endorsements thereafter to be made, and which are described in the contract as endorsements the plaintiff might thereafter make 11 for the late firm of Peck, Howlett &amp; Foster.\u201d It would be absurd to understand this literally as written; for in the nature of things it was impossible endorsements could thereafter be made/or a\u201e <em>firm </em>which had already ceased to exist. Some meaning must be given to the clause, and I cannot doubt that all parties intended by the words used, to indicate such endorsements as might be made for the surviving <em>members of </em>the late firm in bringing its concerns to a close. In common parlance these would be made for the late firm; and in that sense it is very clear, as I think, the defendant intended his engagement should be understood. It has been acted on in that sense by all parties, and in that sense it should be construed and enforced against the defendant, unless his promise is made void by the statute of frauds. I proceed to a consideration of that, which is the only important question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">This action is founded on a <em>\u201c </em>special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of\u201d the two surviving members of the late firm of Peck, Howlett &amp; Foster, and unless the agreement including and expressing the consideration is in writing, it is void. (2 <em>R. S. </em>135, \u00a7 2.) Excluding so much of the defendant\u2019s engagement as refers to past endorsements, and which is not material in this case, the residue of his agreement, as written, was in substance and effect, that if the plaintiff would endorse notes for S. R. Howlett and E. Foster, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>used in closing the business of the late firm of Peck, Howlett &amp; Foster, the defendant would indemnify him \u201c for any such endorsements\u201d not exceeding three thousand dollars. This promise is certainly explicit in its terms, and, as I think, is founded on a consideration clearly expressed in the writing. It is the endorsement by the plaintiff, of one or more notes, thereafter to be made by the surviving members of the late firm, not exceeding three thousand dollars in amount, which constitutes that consideration; the agreement as written, says, <em>\u201c </em>for <em>any </em>such endorsement\u201d I will \u201c hold you harmless.\u201d This is very explicit and can hardly be mistaken. Each endorsement within the prescribed amount, is expressed and declared to be a consideration for the special promise to hold the plaintiff harmless; and\" the whole number of such endorsements constitutes the entire consideration which upholds the promise to indemnify the plaintiff. The promise is not absolute, but con tingent, depending upon what might be done by the plaintiff. He must endorse before any liability would attach to the defendant; but an endorsement being made, the promise becomes absolute. Endorsing notes for a third person is undoubtedly a sufficient consideration for a promise of indemnity; and this consideration is here expressed in the writing. It is therefore, as it seems to me, a full compliance with this requisition of the statute, and the promise is binding upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">I refer to the opinion of the late Mr. Justice Cowen, in <em>Douglass </em>v. Howland, (24 <em>Wend. </em>35,) as containing a correct summary of the law applicable to such a case as this. He has shown very conclusively,' as it seems to me, that although the present statute <em>expressly </em>requires the consideration of <em>\u201c </em>every special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person\u201d to be expressed in the written contract, still this is only what was virtually required by the former statute of this state, as well as by the English statute, on the same subject. Neither provision could be satisfied with anything short of <em>expressing </em>the consideration in the written agreement. The difference, and the whole difference, as far as I see, rs that by one the requisition is <em>expressly </em>made, and in the others it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>is necessarily <em>implied. </em>The requirement is imperative in eacn and as to this point these statutes are in legal effect identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">I think the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the report</p>\n<author id=\"b569-6\">Bronson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsU\">As my brethren differed in opinion, and I was not in court on the first argument, the case could. not be decided. We have now had a second argument, and I fully concur in the opinion of my brother Beardsley, that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. In relation to agreements of this kind, the present statute of frauds only says <em>in terms, </em>what the former statute said <em>in legal effect, </em>that there must be a writing <em>\u201c </em>expressing the consideration.\u201d As to past endorsements, I agree that no consideration appears on the face of the instrument; but as to future endorsements, the consideration is so plainly expressed that no one can fail to see it. The defendant writes to the <em>plaintiff\u2014\u201c </em>I hereby obligate myself to hold you harmless for any endorsements you may make for the late firm of Peck, Howlett &lt;fc Foster.\u201d This is fully equivalent to saying, \u201c if you will endorse, I obligate myself to hold you harmless.\u201d The plaintiff \u2019s endorsement is the consideration for the defendant\u2019s undertaking. The question is not about the motive or inducement for the promise as between the defendant on the one side, and Howlett &amp; Foster on the other. It is a matter of no importance whether Howlett &amp; Foster gave the defendant a sum of money for this letter of credit, or whether, as between them, the undertaking .was wholly gratuitous. The question is about a consideration as between the parties to the written agreement; and as to that, the defendant says, <em>\u201c if </em>you will endorse, I will hold you harmless.\u201d That endorsing is a good and sufficient consideration for the promise has not been questioned by any one; and that the consideration is plainly expressed, appears to me to be equally undeniable. It is the ordinary case of a commercial guaranty. A writes to B., <em>\u201c If </em>you will lend C. a sum of money, or sell him goods on credit, I will see you paidor, \u201c I will pay, or see you paid, for any money you may loan, or goods you may sell to 0. on credit or, \u201cI will <em>hold you harmless </em>for any credit for money or goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>which you may give to 0.\u201d In each and all of these cases the consideration as between A. and B. is apparent. Whether there was, or was not, a valuable consideration as between A. and 0. is a matter of no moment. If this contract should be held void, it would overthrow most of the guaranties and letters of credit which now enter so largely into the transactions of the commercial world.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
