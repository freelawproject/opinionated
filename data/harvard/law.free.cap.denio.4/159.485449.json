On the trial the plaintiff gave in evidence an agreement, signed by the defendants, bearing date October 12, 1839, by which, for value received, they jointly and severally promised to pay to the plaintiff, by his name or order, \u00a7250, with interest, payable one half in two years and the other half in three years from the day of said agreement, <em>\u201c </em>out of the net proceeds, after paying the costs and expenses of ore to be raised and sold from the bed on the lot this day conveyed by Edward Madden to Edwin Dodge, which bed is to be opened and the ore disposed of as soon as conveniently may be.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">On reading the agreement the plaintiff rested, and the defendants moved for a nonsuit, as the plaintiff had not shown that the defendants had received enough from the ore to pay the note, nor had they shown any default or negligence on their part. The judge held that the plaintiff could not recover without proving that the defendants had received funds from the ore to enable them to pay, or had neglected to work the ore bed, and directed a nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-10\"><em>A.

A promissory note must be payable absolutely, and not upon any contingency as to time or event. (3 <em>Kent, 5th ed. p. </em>74; <em>Smit</em>h <em>on Merc. Law. </em>113, 116; <em>Story on Prom.

Here was a contingency; the fund might turn out to be inadequate, in which case there would be no obligation to pay at any time. It was not a promise to pay <em>\u201c </em>absolutely and at all events,\u201d as a promissory note always is.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
