Under the agreement, the plaintiff claimed' to- recover the last quarter\u2019s rent, from February first to May first, 1843. The declaration contained a count on the agreement to pay rent, and a count for use and occupation. The defence was bankruptcy. The defendant\u2019s petition in bankruptcy was filed December 12, 1842; oh the 11th of March following he was declared- a bankrupt, and on the 7th of August thereafter he was discharged. The court decided that the discharge, was not a bar to the action. Exception. Verdict for the last quarter\u2019s rent with interest, and judgment for the plaintiff.

The term, he said, vested in the assignee by operation of law, and if any one was liable to the plaintiff for the quarter\u2019s rent claimed it was the assignee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-6\"><em>W.

That the rent claimed having accrued subsequently to the presentation of the petition in bankruptcy, was not provable; 2.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahh\">The discharge only goes to such debts as the defendant owed at the time of presenting his petition, and the rent which the plaintiff seeks to recover accrued subsequent to that time. Although the agreement to pay rent was made prior to the bankruptcy, it is settled, that the discharge does not bar an action on the agreement, for rent accruing subsequent to the bankruptcy. <em>(Lansing </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>9 <em>John. </em>127, <em>and cases there cited.) </em>The defendant\u2019s assignee never took possession of the demised premises, nor does it appear in any other way that he ever elected to take the term. He was not obliged to accept the leasehold estate, charged with the payment of rent. <em>(Copeland </em>v. <em>Stephens, 1 B. &amp; Ald. </em>593; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>6 <em>Law Reporter, </em>317, <em>per Ware, J.) </em>If the assignee had entered under the assignment, a different question would have been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">It is settled, as we have seen, that the plaintiff does not belong to the class of creditors mentioned in the fifth section of the bankrupt act, <em>\u201c </em>whose debts are not due and payable until a future day.\u201d And clearly he does not belong to the other class of persons mentioned in that section, to wit, \u201c annuitants, holders of bottomry and respondentia bonds, holders of policies of insurances, sureties, endorsers, bail, or other persons having uncertain or contingent demands.\u201d That clause was not framed for a case of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">If the case is not plainly within the statute, there is no good reason why the defendant should not pay this debt. It arises from a consideration which he has received since the bankuptcy,</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
