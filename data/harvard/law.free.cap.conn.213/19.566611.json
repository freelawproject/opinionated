The issue presented is whether the taxpayers can carry over and deduct a capital loss to calculate net gain on their Connecticut capital gains and dividends tax return when they reported no carryover loss on their federal income tax return for the same taxable year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">The commissioner disallowed the capital loss carryover, assessed a tax deficiency against the taxpayers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and denied the taxpayers\u2019 appeal of the assessment. Thereafter, the taxpayers appealed to the Superior Court, which decided the case on the basis of stipulated facts. That court set aside the commissioner\u2019s assessment. The commissioner appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the matter to this court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The stipulation reveals the following facts. The taxpayers moved to Connecticut in April, 1981. On their 1981 federal income tax return they reported capital gains totaling $32,799 and capital losses totaling $13,822 for a net gain of $18,977. Since the taxpayers realized the capital gains prior to April, they only reported the $13,822 capital loss on their 1981 Connecticut capital gains and dividends tax return.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In 1983, the taxpayers realized capital gains of $41,746, of which $21,276 was included in their adjusted gross income on their federal income tax return. They did not report any capital loss carryover from prior years. In contrast, on their Connecticut tax return, they reduced the $21,276 net taxable gain by $13,644, the unused capital loss carryover from 1981. The taxpayers reported a net gain of $7632 on their Connecticut tax return.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The commissioner disallowed the capital loss carryover claiming that General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7\u00a7 12-505<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and 12-506<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> only allow a loss carryover for Connecticut purposes when it is used in the computation of net gain on the taxpayers\u2019 federal income tax return. The taxpayers disagree with the commissioner\u2019s assessment and argue that General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-505 incorporates federal tax law and requires the taxpayers to utilize the federal tax system for calculating capital gain. Accordingly, they argue, the taxpayers could offset the capital loss carryover against capital gains in 1983 in accordance with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Our well established principles of statutory construction are designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>of the legislature. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 589, 522 A.2d 771 (1987). \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment [and] to the legislative policy it was designed to implement . . . . \u201d Id.; <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 128, 527 A.2d 672 (1987); <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 502-503, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">This court pays considerable deference to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of tax statutes and regulations. <em>Clinton Nurseries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>205 Conn. 761, 765, 535 A.2d 361 (1988). Where, however, the issue has not previously been the subject of judicial scrutiny, has not been the subject of a legislatively approved regulation and is not a time-tested interpretation of the statute, the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute is not entitled to special deference. <em>Dine Out Tonight Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>210 Conn. 567, 570 n.3, 556 A.2d 580 (1989). While statutes that provide an exemption or deduction from taxation must be strictly construed in favor of the taxing authority; <em>Clinton Nurseries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner ofRev-enue Services, </em>supra, <em>764; Skaarup Shipping Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>199 Conn. 346, 352, 507 A.2d 988 (1986); \u201c[i]t is also true . . . that such strict construction neither requires nor permits the contravention of the true intent and purpose of the statute as expressed in the language used.\u201d <em>Jewett City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization, </em>116 Conn. 172, 185, 164 A. 643 (1933); <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 129; <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>160 Conn. 370, 375, 279 A.2d 561 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-506 (a) (2) imposes a capital gains tax upon \u201call net gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets.\u201d General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>utes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-505 (A) defines \u201cgains from the sale or exchange of capital assets\u201d as the \u201cnet gain as determined for federal income tax purposes, after due allowance for losses and holding periods ... (2) from transactions or events taxable to the taxpayer as such sales or exchanges, and being the net amount includable in the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income, with respect to all such sales, exchanges, transactions, or events, under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code in effect for the taxable year.\u201d Section 12-505 provides further that, \u201c \u2018adjusted gross income\u2019 means adjusted gross income for federal income tax purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The commissioner\u2019s argument focuses upon the language that defines \u201cnet gain\u201d as being the \u201cnet amount includable in the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income . . . under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code in effect for the taxable year.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-505 (A) (2). The commissioner urges us to construe \u201cnet gain\u201d to mean the net amount included in the taxpayers\u2019 adjusted gross income on their federal income tax return for that particular year. Accordingly, the commissioner argues, since the taxpayers did not deduct a capital loss carryover against capital gains to arrive at their adjusted gross income for federal purposes for 1983, they could not deduct a capital loss carryover for state purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, the \u201cnet gain\u201d for state tax purposes must be exactly the same number as \u201cnet gain\u201d for federal tax purposes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In seeking to discern the intent of the legislature, we look to the words of the statute as a whole to offer guidance. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-505 (A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>states that taxable net gains are those defined for federal income tax purposes \u201cafter due allowance for losses and holding periods.\u201d The legislature clearly intended that losses be accounted for when \u201cnet gain\u201d is computed. The only guidance the legislature gives on <em>how </em>to account for losses is through its reference to federal tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u201cThis court has consistently held that when our tax statutes refer to the federal tax code, \u2018federal tax concepts are incorporated into state law.\u2019 <em>The B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 7, 490 A.2d 991 (1985); <em>Yaeger </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>188 Conn. 206, 210, 211-12, 449 A.2d 144 (1982); <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>185 Conn. 186, 191, 440 A.2d 854 (1981); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>163 Conn. 520, 525, 313 A.2d 49 (1972); <em>Kellems v. Brown, </em>[supra, 518-19]; <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>142 Conn. 483, 489-93, 115 A.2d 455 (1955), appeal dismissed, 350 U.S. 927, 76 S. Ct. 305, 100 L. Ed. 811 (1956); <em>McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>130 Conn. 460, 461-64, 35 A.2d 865 (1944).\u201d <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>199 Conn. 133, 139, 506 A.2d 93 (1986); <em>Skaarup Shipping Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra, 351. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-505 makes repeated references to the federal tax code. Specifically, the statute refers to \u201cnet gain as determined for <em>federal income tax purposes . . . </em>and being the net amount includable in the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income . . . under the <em>provisions of the Internal Revenue Code </em>in effect for the taxable year.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-505 (A) (2). Both the language of the statute and long-standing precedents of this court support the conclusion that \u00a7 12-505 incorporates the federal tax system of taxing capital gain income. <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 139; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 525; <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 515. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>statute explicitly refers to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and not simply to an amount calculated on the federal tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">There is no dispute that, under the federal tax code, capital losses can be carried over to succeeding tax years to offset capital gains. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1212 (b) (1) and 1222. Since \u00a7 12-505 makes no express provision for the treatment of capital losses except by way of reference to federal law, the legislature evidently intended to incorporate the federal method of treating capital loss carryovers.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Our conclusion is based upon our holding in <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>that is, that the intent of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 12-505 was to incorporate federal tax law. In <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, this court construed the term \u201cnet gain\u201d in order to determine whether \u00a7 12-505 allowed a deduction for long term capital gains equivalent to that allowed under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202 of the federal tax code. Despite the fact that \u00a7 12-505 did not make a specific reference to the \u00a7 1202 deduction, this court construed the statute to incorporate the deduction. Id., 510-17. We emphasized that (1) the statute makes repeated references to federal income tax law, and (2) \u00a7 12-505 defines net gains as they are defined for federal income tax purposes \u201cafter due allowance for losses and holding periods.\u201d Id., 512. The reference to \u201cholding periods\u201d indicated that the legislature intended to afford different treatment for long term as opposed to short term capital gains. This distinction would only make sense if the long term capital gains preference was allowed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The commissioner maintains that \u00a7 12-506 allows a deduction only for losses incurred in the current taxable year. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-506 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA tax is hereby imposed on . . . all net gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets which have been earned, received in fact or constructively, accrued or credited to the taxpayer during his taxable year . . . . \u201d The commissioner argues that \u201ctaxable year\u201d means the current tax year and therefore, by definition, cannot incorporate a tax loss carryover. The difficulty with this reasoning, however, is that General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7\u00a7 12-505 and 12-506 do provide for capital loss carryovers.* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In fact, the commissioner concedes as much. According to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the only time a taxpayer would not be allowed to carry over a loss would be in a situation such as the current case where the taxable year for Connecticut tax purposes is shorter than the taxable year for federal income tax purposes. We are unpersuaded that this is the proper reading of the statute. We conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 12-505 and 12-506 allow the taxpayer to apply federal tax principles, regardless of the length of the taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the general purpose of loss carryover deductions. \u201cSuch deductions counteract the inequity that may result from breaking up taxable activity into relatively <em>short </em>periods of time and taxing a discrete income producing period without regard to a preceding period of loss.\u201d <em>The B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 9. In summary, \u00a7 12-505 allows the taxpayers to deduct their capital loss car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ryover on their 1983 return even though the capital loss occurred in 1981 because they would otherwise be deprived of a benefit that the statute affords them simply because their taxable year for Connecticut tax purposes in 1981 was shorter than the calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-11\"> The taxpayers\u2019 brief also claims that the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute violates the equal protection clause of both the United States and Connecticut constitutions. As the taxpayers conceded at oral argument, however, the constitutional claim was not raised and ruled upon by the trial court and therefore was not an issue properly before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> The commissioner does not, nor can he, dispute the propriety of the taxpayers\u2019 treatment of the capital gains on their 1981 Connecticut tax return. General Statutes \u00a7 12-505 defines taxable year as, \u201cthe same accounting period as the taxpayer\u2019s taxable year for federal income tax purposes or that portion of such year as either commences when the taxpayer becomes a resident or ends when the taxpayer ceases to be a resident of this state . . . . \u201d Accordingly, the taxpayers were not required to report the capital gains realized prior to their relocation to Connecticut in their Connecticut tax return in 1981. For federal tax purposes, however, the capital losses were netted against the capital gains.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\"> At oral argument, the question was posed from the bench whether, under federal tax law, the taxpayers properly calculated the amount of capital gain that should be included in their adjusted gross income. It appears that the taxpayers deducted the capital loss carryover from the net gain <em>after </em>the computation of the net capital gains deduction, allowed pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>26 U.S.C. (Rev. to 1982) \u00a7 1202. Instead, the taxpayers should have subtracted the capital loss from capital gains before the \u00a7 1202 deduction as required by federal tax law. See 26 U.S.C. (Rev. to 1982) \u00a7\u00a7 1202 (a), 1212 (b) (1) and 1222.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1983)] Sec. 12-505. definitions.
