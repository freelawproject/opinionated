Mahoney, individually'and in his capacity as administrator of his son\u2019s estate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Barbara <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Mahoney, individually, brought an action against the commissioners of mental health, state police and mental retardation* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> upon the death of their son while a patient at Norwich Hospital.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the Appellate Court set aside the judgment of dismissal insofar as the plaintiffs had alleged a violation of \u00a7 17-206c but upheld the dismissal with respect to the alleged violation of \u00a7 17-206b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>17 Conn. App. 130, 550 A.2d 1088 (1988). We granted both the defendants\u2019 petition for certification; <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>210 Conn. 806, 554 A.2d 742 (1989); and the plaintiffs\u2019 cross petition for certification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>210 Conn. 806, 554 A.2d 743 (1989). We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 17-206k as a waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity, but conclude that the administrative and public history of the patients\u2019 bill of rights; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-206a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>through 17-206k; compels a broader construction of the statutory causes of action thereby created. Accordingly, we now reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion reveals the following factual and procedural history derived from the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The plaintiffs\u2019 son, Richard Mahoney, Jr., \u201cwas killed when he jumped from an oil tank reserve located on the grounds of [Norwich] hospital.\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 132. The decedent was a \u201cvoluntary admission patient\u201d at Norwich Hospital; id.; alleged to be suffering \u201cfrom a mental illness that included suicidal tendencies.\u201d Id., 138. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants\u2019 failure \u201cto provide proper counseling, medication, supervision or suicide precautions, so as to prevent the decedent from acting on his suicidal tendencies\u201d; id., 138-39; amounted to \u201cnegligent, wanton, and willful misconduct\u201d which caused the death of their son. Id., 132. Count ten of the amended complaint, to which this appeal is limited,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> claims that this alleged misconduct violated both \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c, but it fails to specify what factual allegations are applicable to either statute. Id., 137-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Asserting that the doctrine of sovereign-immunity barred the plaintiffs from bringing this action against the state or its commissioners, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Id., 132. Because any statutory waiver of sovereign immunity must be narrowly construed, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>argued that \u00a7 17-206k\u2019s provision for \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved\u201d to \u201cbring a civil action for damages\u201d does not constitute the type of express authorization that signals legislative abrogation of sovereign immunity. Persuaded by this argument, the trial court concluded that \u201c\u00a7 1.7-206k does not constitute legislative consent to a suit for damages against the state or its commissioners,\u201d and granted the motion to dismiss. Id., 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendants did not contest the proposition that patients in state mental health facilities are entitled to the substantive rights afforded by \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c. The defendants argued, however, that whatever remedial rights might be afforded to patients in private mental hospitals, patients in state hospitals could pursue their statutory remedies only through recourse to the claims commissioner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 135. The Appellate Court rejected this distinction. Having determined that patients in state mental health facilities are included among the class of individuals potentially aggrieved by violations of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c, the Appellate Court construed \u00a7 17-206k in light of the rights for which it provides remedies. Id., 135-36. Because \u00a7 17-206k does not distinguish between remedies available to state facility patients and private facility patients, the Appellate Court concluded that the legislature intended \u00a7 17-206k to authorize direct civil actions against the state or its commissioners by patients of state mental health facilities aggrieved by violations of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c. Id., 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The Appellate Court went on to hold, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to allege a cause of action under \u00a7 17-206b. Id., 138. The Appellate Court opined that \u00a7 17-206b guarantees only that hospitalization or treatment in a mental health facility cannot be used as justification for depriving a patient of a right that a patient otherwise enjoys. Id., 137-38. Because the claimed rights to proper counseling, medication, and suicide precautions are not rights held absent hospitalization, but instead arise, if at all,, as a result of hospitalization, the Appellate Court found no error in the judgment of dismissal with respect to the alleged violations of \u00a7 17-206b. Id., 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The Appellate Court came to a different conclusion with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations pursuant to \u00a7 17-206c. Id., 140-41. Unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 assertion that the guarantee of humane and dignified treatment contemplates only the protection of personal dignity and privacy, such as the right to refuse medication; id., 138; the Appellate Court held that \u00a7 17-206c accords a patient a positive right to treatment. Id. The Appellate Court also rejected the defendants\u2019 contention that, because a merely negligent failure to afford proper treatment does not constitute a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \u00a7 17-206c similarly requires allegations rising above negligence. Id., 139-40. Noting that the federal due process clause is the source for the right to treatment recognized by the federal courts; id.; the Appellate Court reasoned that a right to humane and dignified treatment conferred by statute; General Statutes \u00a7 17-206c; does not necessarily embody federal constraints on an actionable right to treatment. Id., 140. The Appellate Court thus concluded that \u201c[sjection 17-206c creates a new tort liability based upon a specified course of conduct that is not dependent upon common law negligence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The present appeal requires us to resolve three issues. On the defendants\u2019 appeal, we must decide whether the Appellate Court erred in construing \u00a7 17-206k as an abrogation of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity, and in construing \u00a7 17-206c to encompass the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. On the plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal, we must determine whether their complaint properly invokes the rights conferred upon the decedent by \u00a7 17-206b. We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s ruling on the appeal, and reverse its ruling on the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We turn first to the jurisdictional issue, whether \u00a7 17-206k, in providing a statutory remedy for those persons aggrieved by violations of any specific provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights, \u00a7\u00a7 17-206a through 17-206k, constitutes an abrogation of sovereign immunity so as to authorize a voluntary patient in a state mental facility to sue the state or its commissioners.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cIt is settled law in Connecticut that the state is immune from suit unless, by appropriate legislation, it authorizes or consents to suit.\u201d <em>Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Assn. of America </em>v. <em>State, </em>209 Conn. 679, 684, 553 A.2d 1104 (1989). A legislative decision to waive sovereign immunity must be manifested either \u201c \u2018 \u201cby the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Struckman v. Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 558, 534 A.2d 888 (1987), quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>151 Conn. 259, 262-63, 196 A.2d 596 (1963). Moreover, because such statutes are in derogation of the common law, \u201c \u2018[a]ny statutory waiver of immunity must be narrowly construed\u2019; <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra; and its scope must be confined strictly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>extent the statute provides. <em>Berger, Lehman Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>178 Conn. 352, 356, 422 A.2d 268 (1979). . . <em>Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Assn. of America </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In reliance on these accepted principles, the defendants assert that the Appellate Court erred in construing \u00a7 17-206k to abrogate the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. The defendants maintain that the use of such generalized language as \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d in \u00a7 17-206k evinces neither an express intention nor the force of implication necessary to constitute a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. The defendants further argue that the absence of any meaningful legislative history bolsters their claim that this generalized statute does not abrogate the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">On its face, the provision in \u00a7 17-206k that <em>\u201c[a]ny person aggrieved . . . </em>may bring a civil action for damages\u201d (emphasis added) does not expressly waive sovereign immunity. A statute must be considered, however, as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render an overall reasonable interpretation. <em>Shortt </em>v. <em>New Milford Police Department, </em>212 Conn. 294, 305, 562 A.2d 7 (1989); <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). The determinative question, therefore, is whether a contrary implication necessarily flows from the juxtaposition of this section with the remaining provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Several provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights illuminate the breadth of the legislative concern for the fair treatment of mental patients. Because the patients\u2019 bill of rights is remedial in nature, its provisions should be liberally construed in favor of the class sought to be benefited. See <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 728, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980). Notably, \u00a7 17-206b <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>mandates that \u201c[n]o patient<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> . . . treated in any <em>public </em>or private <em>facility </em>for the treatment of the mentally disordered shall* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> be deprived of any personal, property or civil rights . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, \u00a7 17-206c entitles <em>\u201c[e]very patient</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>treated in <em>any facility </em>[to] receive humane and dignified treatment . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) As the Appellate Court properly noted and the defendants concede, patients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>in state mental health facilities are clearly included among the class of individuals potentially aggrieved by violations of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Having established that the substantive provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights encompass state mental health facilities as well as private institutions, we must determine what implications necessarily follow for the remedial scope of \u00a7 17-206k. Like the Appellate Court, we view statutory rights that encompass \u201cany public . . . facility\u201d to provide a remedy against the state, wherever and whenever the state or a municipality operates treatment facilities for the mentally disordered. Despite the defendants\u2019 contentions to the contrary, we conclude that it is a necessary implication<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the purposes sought to be served by the enactment of the patients\u2019 bill of rights that the legislature intended to provide a direct cause of action against the state and thus to waive its sovereign immunity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 274 n.8, 528 A.2d 760 (1987); <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 221, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982). Other state courts have similarly construed analogous statutes to permit an action for damages against the state for mistreatment of a patient within a state mental health facility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brosseau, </em>124 N.H. 184, 191, 470 A.2d 869 (1983); <em>Chasse </em>v. <em>Banas, </em>119 N.H. 93, 97, 399 A.2d 608 (1979); see <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Plante, </em>691 F.2d 634, 638 (3d Cir. 1982); <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>Carter, </em>64 N. J. 382, 391-92, 316 A.2d 449 (1974); <em>E. H. </em>v. <em>Matin, </em>284 S.E.2d 232, 237 (W. Ya. 1981); but see <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hospital, </em>384 Mass. 38, 43, 423 N.E.2d 782 (1981); <em>Caronia </em>v. <em>Greenfeder, </em>30 Pa. Commw. 337, 374 A.2d 741, 742-43 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Our conclusion finds support, furthermore, in the history attending the enactment of the patients\u2019 bill of rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Examination of the committee hearings on the senate bill that was eventually codified as \u00a7 17-206a et seq. reveals that the act was intended to remedy the then prevailing conditions at state mental health facilities. The principal testimony was that of Walter Yoight, who had been employed for four and one-half years at two of the state\u2019s mental health hospitals.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First observing that \u201cmy employment experience in Connecticut\u2019s Mental Hospitals consistently lend[s] credence to the notions that mental hospital patients are regularly exposed to various institutional policies and practices which deprive them of their basic human rights and which have a demoralizing and dehumaniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ing effect on the individual,\u201d Voight then articulated the nexus between \u201cthese [the state\u2019s] practices and procedures . . . [and] those which [Senate Bill No.] 592 seeks to modify and control.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2,1971 Sess., p. 673. The most interesting revelation in Voight\u2019s testimony, however, is his reference to a report concerning an investigation at Fairfield Hills Hospital, a state mental health facility. General Statutes \u00a7 17-207b (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In 1969, in response to numerous letters from patients in state mental hospitals, and families,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Governor John N. Dempsey had ordered an investigation of Fairfield Hills Hospital. Thereafter, the state board of mental health appointed a task force to review the administrative and professional programs of Fairfield Hills Hospital. The report of the Task Force Study of Fairfield Hills Hospital was issued on May 15,1970.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>It documented, in detail, the extent to which then prevailing practices at Fairfield Hills Hospital departed from the standards set by the American Psychiatric Association, and described the factors that it found to have contributed to \u201cthe development and maintenance of a system which <em>inherently must result in violations and limitations of both human and civil </em>rights,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 4. Having noted that \u201c[t]he listed complaints have by now become classic legal problems in mental hospitals in many states, [that have been successfully resolved] by enactment of new legislation in New York and California\u201d; id.; the task force report recommended that the legislature enact a patient\u2019s bill of rights to resolve problems that \u201cmay be generic to all the State hospitals in Connecticut.\u201d Id., p. 22; see generally comment, \u201cThe Mentally 111 in Connecticut\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>A Survey,\u201d 6 Conn. L. Rev. 303, 340-48 (1973-74).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The close temporal relationship between the release of the Task Force Study of Fairfield Hills Hospital and the adoption of the substantive provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights necessarily leads us to conclude that the legislature intended in enacting \u00a7 17-206k to abrogate the state\u2019s sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Appellate Court was correct in holding that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The defendants\u2019 second claim of error challenges the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sufficiently states a cause of action for deprivation of the right to \u201chumane and dignified treatment\u201d that \u00a7 17-206c guarantees to \u201cevery patient\u201d in state mental hospitals. The defendants do not challenge the Appellate Court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 17-206c creates a new statutory tort action. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 140. They maintain, however, that, in the absence of relevant legislative history, the legislature must be presumed to have intended only a narrowly circumscribed guarantee of compassionate care. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>In enacting \u00a7 17-206c, the legislature created a statutory cause of action that established a new tort liability, unknown to the common law, and therefore independent of common law negligence. See <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>196 Conn 341, 348-49, 493 A.2d 184 (1985); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Albanese, </em>144 Conn. 241, 249, 129 A.2d 606, appeal dismissed, 355 U.S. 15, 78 S. Ct. 36, 2 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1957). We must determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint falls within the conduct that the statute makes actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Section 17-206c provides in pertinent part that \u201cfejvery patient treated in any facility for the treatment of the mentally disordered shall receive humane and dignified treatment at all times, with full respect for his personal dignity and right to privacy.\u201d The statute also provides that \u201c[ejach patient shall be treated in accordance with a specialized treatment plan suited to his disorder.\u201d Since the legislature chose not to attach a statutory definition to the phrase \u201chumane and dignified treatment,\u201d we must interpret this language in light of the established canons of statutory construction. Our objective is to construe \u00a7 17-206c so as to \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>Capalbo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>208 Conn. 480, 486, 547 A.2d 528 (1988) . . . .\u201d <em>Shortt </em>v. <em>New Milford Police Department, </em>supra, 300-301. Because of the inherent ambiguity in the text of \u00a7 17-206c, we look to the purpose the statute is to serve as revealed by its legislative history and the circumstances surrounding its enactment. <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 54-55, 523 A.2d 477 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Appellate Court concluded that the language of \u00a7 17-206c indicates generally that \u201ca patient has a positive right to treatment, rather than simply a negative right to refuse it\u201d; <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 138; and specifically that \u201ca patient is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>to a specialized treatment plan tailored to his particular disorder.\u201d Id. The defendants take issue with this construction as too expansive. Contending that there is no relevant legislative history, the defendants maintain that the scope of this new statutory cause of action should be limited to \u201cabstinence from procedures \u2014 such as strip searches, beatings, or deprivation of food\u2014 that would obviously fall short of the ideal.\u201d In support of this narrow construction, they remind us that the legislature would have recognized the difficulties that necessarily inhere in the decisions made by mental health professionals and would not have intended to subject such judgments to extensive oversight by lay judges and juries. <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 323, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 73 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1982). Accordingly, the defendants urge us to confine the statutory guarantee of \u201chumane and dignified treatment\u201d to deprivations that arise out of procedures that implicate sentient needs and feelings alone. Our analysis of the circumstances leading to the enactment of \u00a7 17-206c persuades us, however, that the Appellate Court\u2019s construction was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The findings and recommendations of the Task Force Study of Fairfield Hills Hospital contain a cogent frame of reference for the construction of \u00a7 17-206c. In the section entitled \u201cTreatment and Patient Care,\u201d the task force report reveals the antitherapeutic nature of the clinical environment prevalent at state mental health facilities: \u201cThe impression is one of a treatment atmosphere too rigid, and impoverished by restrictions placed on those who could provide vitality. Again the picture emerges of control from the top of sufficient degree as to influence the staff to behave in a fashion fostering administrative practices which create a life within the institution strikingly similar to that which may contribute to the origin of the patients\u2019 illnesses: A climate characterized by authoritarianism, loneliness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>alienation and depersonalization. Such goals as cleanliness seem often to have higher priority than involvement with patients in active interpersonal therapeutic relationships.\u201d Id., pp. 18-19. The thrust of these findings is that \"the primary function of any psychiatric facility is to diagnose, treat and to restore mentally disturbed persons to an optimal level of functioning . . . . \u201d Id., p. 18. The task force expressly, and the legislature by necessary implication, eschewed the custodial orientation implicit in the defendants\u2019 contention that the statutory guidelines should be limited to providing sentient care. In its adoption of a statutory right to humane and dignified treatment, the legislature intended to afford patients a meaningful right to treatment, consistent with the requirements of good medical practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In searching for the tenets of good medical practice, we can turn to the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s definition of the right to treatment as a comprehensive approach including \u201c \u2018active intervention of a psychological, biological, physical, chemical, educational or social nature where application of the individualized treatment plan is felt to have a reasonable expectation of improving the patient\u2019s condition.\u201d R. Sadoff, Legal Issues in the Care of Psychiatric Patients: A Guide for the Mental Health Professional (1982) p. 32. Meaningful treatment thus requires not only basic custodial care but also an individualized effort to help each patient by formulating, administering and monitoring a \"specialized treatment plan\u201d as expressly mandated by \u00a7 17-206c. See generally <em>Rouse </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>373 F.2d 451 (D.C. Cir. 1966); T. Gutheil &amp; P. Appelbaum, Psychiatry and the Law (1982) p. 108; D. Bazelon, Introduction, The Right To Treatment (D. Burris ed. 1969) p. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The statutory responsibility for the formulation and subsequent monitoring of an appropriate treatment plan for each patient does not, however, encompass a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>guarantee that the treatment plan will invariably produce the desired results. A poor outcome may occur despite the best possible medical practice. See generally S. Halleck, Law in the Practice of Psychiatry: A Handbook For Clinicians (1980) p. 14; R. Schwitzge-bel, \u201cThe Right to Effective Mental Treatment,\" 62 Calif. L. Rev. 936 (1974). The standard for determining whether the provisions of \u00a7 17-206c have been violated thus cannot depend on the outcome of treatment. For similar reasons, the standard does not sound in negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">To recover for a violation of the statute, a plaintiff must prove, as the statute prescribes; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 349; <em>London &amp; Lancashire Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Duryea, </em>143 Conn. 53, 59, 119 A.2d 325 (1955); that the conditions of his hospitalization were statutorily deficient. The plaintiff must allege and prove that the hospital failed initially to provide, or thereafter appropriately to monitor, an individualized treatment suitable to his psychiatric circumstances.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In assessing whether the plaintiff has met his burden of proof, the trier of fact must inquire not whether the hospital has made the best decision possible but rather whether its treatment plan was permissible and reasonable in view of the relevant information available and within a broad range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>discretion.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Tribby </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>379 F.2d 104, 105 (D.C. Cir. 1967). The issue, under \u00a7 17-206c, is whether the hospital made good faith efforts to improve the patient\u2019s mental health and not whether it succeeded in fulfillment of this goal. See <em>Rouse </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>supra, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">From this perspective, we concur in the determination of the Appellate Court that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in this case states a cause of action for violation of \u00a7 17-206c. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 140-41. In undertaking this determination, as the defendants note, we are \u201climited to the facts alleged in the plaintiff[s\u2019] complaint.\u201d <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Godou, </em>209 Conn. 273, 278, 550 A.2d 1073 (1988). While it is true that the complaint does not expressly charge the defendants with a failure to formulate or monitor an individualized treatment plan, it does include allegations that the defendants wrongfully \u201cfailed to provide proper counseling, medication, supervision or suicide precautions, so as to prevent the decedent from acting on his suicidal tendencies.\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 138-39. Bearing in mind our responsibility to construe the complaint \u201c \u2018in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency\u2019 <em>Warner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>v. <em>Konover, </em>210 Conn. 150, 156, 553 A.2d 1138 (1989); <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Wawruck, </em>209 Conn. 407, 408, 551 A.2d 738 (1988); we conclude that the complaint sufficiently invokes \u00a7 17-206c.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We turn, finally, to the plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal, which challenges the validity of the Appellate Court\u2019s ruling that their complaint fails to state a cause of action under \u00a7 17-206b. The plaintiffs assert that \u00a7 17-206b was intended to secure for mental hospital patients a state statutory remedy for the violation of substantive liberty interests similar to that provided by federal law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. These substantive liberty interests encompass, according to the plaintiffs, a right to treatment and personal security. The Appellate Court rejected this interpretation, holding instead that the due process guarantee contained in \u00a7 17-206b protects only those rights \u201cthat a patient may have held absent hospitalization or treatment\u201d; <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 137-38; such as the right to vote, contract or hold property. We agree with the plaintiffs that the Appellate Court construed \u00a7 17-206b too narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Proper construction of \u00a7 17-206b must begin with an examination of its text, which states, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o patient hospitalized or treated in any public or private facility for the treatment of the mentally disordered shall be deprived of any personal, property or civil rights, including the right to vote, hold or convey property, and contract, except in accordance with due process of law . . . .\u201d The defendants contend that, on its face, the statutory linkage between \u201cpersonal, property or civil rights\u201d and \u201cthe right to vote, hold or convey property, and contract\u201d demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intention to restrict the scope of \u00a7 17-206b to those expressly enumerated rights. They rely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>proposition that, in the absence of contrary indication, statutory itemization demonstrates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive. <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 63, 566 A.2d 670 (1989); <em>The B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 6, 490 A.2d 991 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Because the statutory itemization in \u00a7 17-206b speaks of \u201cpersonal, property or civil rights, <em>including </em>the right to vote, hold or convey property, or contract,\u201d (emphasis added) the defendants\u2019 contention is unpersuasive. The legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cincluding\u201d rather than the commonly utilized expression, \u201cshall include,\u201d evinces an intention to provide an expansive interpretation of the rights protected by \u00a7 17-206b. As we have recognized in the past, the word \u201cinclude\u201d may be considered a word of enlargement as well as a word of limitation. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 422-23, 528 A.2d 811 (1987); <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>161 Conn. 145, 150, 285 A.2d 352 (1971). Since the most likely common use of the term \u201cshall include\u201d is one of limitation; <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra; the statutory omission of the word \u201cshall\u201d is telling. Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary states that the word \u201cinclude\u201d \u201csuggests the containment of something as a constituent, component, or subordinate part of a larger whole.\u201d The legislative choice of \u201cincluding\u201d is more likely, as a matter of common sense, to connote that the legislature intended, in \u00a7 17-206b, that the listed rights be a vehicle for enlargement rather than limitation. See <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 196, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Furthermore, an expansive construction of \u201cpersonal, property or civil rights\u201d is consistent with the usage and interpretation of similarly phrased rights guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The scope of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is derived, in turn, from the mandates of the due process clause of the United States constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>and includes not only those rights recognized by the Appellate Court that a patient holds absent hospitalization but more expansively encompasses a right to treatment that results because of hospitalization. Interpreting \u00a7 17-206b in conformity with such constitutional requirements is fully consistent with the well established principle of statutory construction that \u201c \u2018a court is justified in holding that a statute was intended to be subject to constitutional requirements, and that those requirements are to be considered as embodied in the statute, if its terms do not exclude such requirements.\u2019 <em>Grega </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>178 Conn. 207, 210, 423 A.2d 873 (1979).\u201d <em>Bridgeport.Bowl-O-Rama, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>195 Conn. 276, 283, 487 A.2d 559 (1985). We are therefore persuaded that the freedom from deprivation of \u201cany personal, property or civil rights\u201d provided in \u00a7 17-206b includes not only those statutory rights expressly enumerated, but necessarily incorporates as well the freedom from deprivation of \u201cany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution\u201d as guaranteed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Although the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not allege a violation of the rights specifically enumerated in \u00a7 17-206b, that court had no occasion to consider whether the complaint might pass muster under the more expansive construction of \u00a7 17-206b as encompassing constitutionally protected liberty interests. The relevant portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint allege that the decedent was entitled as a patient in a state mental health facility to such substantive services as \u201cproper counseling, medication, supervision [and] suicide precautions.\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 138-39. As a general matter, the state has no constitutional duty to provide such substantive services for those within its borders. <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>supra, 317; <em>see Maher </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>432 U.S. 464, 469, 97 S. Ct. 2376, 53 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>2d 484 (1977) (medical treatment). When a person has been institutionalized within a state mental health facility, however, the state voluntarily assumes a duty to provide treatment; <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>supra; under conditions of reasonable care and safety; id., 324; and the patient acquires, by virtue of his hospitalization, a constitutionally protected liberty interest under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in these obligatory services. Moreover, \u201c[o]nce the State assumes responsibility for a patient by admitting him to a State mental hospital that is operating under State authority, the State is acting under color of law. See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>422 U.S. 563, 95 S. Ct. 2486, 45 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1975) . . . <em>\" Seide </em>v. <em>Prevost, </em>536 F. Sup. 1121, 1136 (S.D.N.Y. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Regardless of whether a patient\u2019s admission status is voluntary or involuntary, the state may not subject any citizen \u201cto the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; <em>Seide </em>v. <em>Prevost, </em>supra. While some cases have held that the constitutionally protected interest in the right to treatment and a safe environment available under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 actions is limited to patients who are confined by the state involuntarily; <em>Wyatt </em>v. <em>Aderholt, </em>503 F.2d 1305, 1312 (5th Cir. 1974); or to voluntary patients who allege a sufficient degree of helplessness; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Cserr, </em>544 F.2d 1121, 1123 (1st Cir. 1976); these refinements are not relevant to the construction of \u00a7 17-206b. Our statute does not purport to distinguish the rights afforded to mental health patients according to their admission status. We are persuaded, therefore, that the federally recognized right to treatment and to a safe environment applies to all patients within state mental health facilities without regard to the voluntary or involuntary nature of their confinement. This construction finds support in a comparable ruling by the Supreme Court of West Yir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>ginia. <em>E. H. </em>v. <em>Matin, </em>284 S.E.2d 232, 237 (W. Ya. 1981); see also <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Parwatikar, </em>570 F.2d 801, 804 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>Seide </em>v. <em>Prevost, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Incorporation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 standards into \u00a7 17-206b does not automatically resolve the question of the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The United States Supreme Court has held, in the context of \u00a7 1983 actions, that acts of mere negligence do not violate an individual\u2019s rights under the due process clause of the United States constitution; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 346-47, 106 S. Ct. 668, 88 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1986); <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330-33, 106 S. Ct. 662, 88 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1986). We must therefore ascertain whether the allegations of this complaint rise above negligence. Reading the complaint as we must in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we conclude that it sufficiently states a cause of action under \u00a7 17-206b. As the Appellate Court appropriately noted, \u201cfacts similar to these alleged here by the plaintiff[s], that is, failure to restrict or control a patient so as to prevent suicide, have been held to be sufficient to allege such a degree of wanton neglect so as to state a cause of action for violation of a patient\u2019s rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 140 n.5; see <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Cserr, </em>supra, 1124; cf. <em>Guglielmoni </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>583 F. Sup. 821, 827 (D. Conn. 1984) (complaint that alleged prisoner\u2019s civil rights were violated when inadequate supervision and treatment provided during his incarceration resulted in suicide stated a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim, despite contention that eighth amendment does not reach instances of deliberate self-injury). Since we hold that \u00a7 17-206b necessarily incorporates those rights afforded under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, it would be inconsistent to find the complaint insufficient for purposes of alleging a violation of \u00a7 17-206b at this preliminary stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Accordingly, on the appeal, there is no error; on the cross appeal, there is error, the judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed in part and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-206k provides: \u201cAny person aggrieved by a violation of sections 17-206a to 17-206j, inclusive, may petition the superior court within whose jurisdiction the person is or resides for appropriate relief, including temporary and permanent injunctions, or may bring a civil action for damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 17-206b provides: \u201cNo patient hospitalized or treated in any public or private facility for the treatment of the mentally disordered shall be deprived of any personal, property or civil rights, including the right to vote, hold or convey property, and contract, except in accordance with due process of law, and unless he has been declared incompetent pursuant to chapter 779.

Dempsey's files labelled \u201cState Departments and Agencies\u201d in the folder entitled \u201cFairfield Hills Hospital.\u201d These letters bear eloquent witness to the deplorable conditions at Fairfield Hills Hospital. \u201cMy husband was a patient there for five months last year. For several months he was confined to a ward and never went outdoors for a breath of air. The only walk he got was from the dining room back to his <em>room </em>.... If I didn\u2019t get him out when I did I\u2019m afraid he would be a vegetable by now.\u201d \u201cI was a patient at Fairfield Hills and the [newspaper reports] are true. Signed, A Dehumanized Patient.\u201d \u201cAs a former patient at Fairfield Hills Hospital, I would like to relate my experiences there. When I entered the hospital . . . because I was very upset, I was placed in isolation. This consisted of being in a small room by yourself. The treatment I received there was as follows. I was stripped naked with no bed to lie on. I was then locked in. This went on for eight whole days. All this time without the use of a toilet. Therefore the floor took its place. The room had a small pane of safety glass. By which anyone going by could gaze in at me. Here by being on almost public display. When I got a little better and was placed on an open ward ... I still saw and heard much of the same that I myself had been subjected to. . . . At night I went to sleep to the sounds of 3C [the isolation ward]. So I couldn\u2019t really get away from my own personal remembrance of the agony I went through there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> This administrative report may be found in the Connecticut State Library, Box 11 of Governor John N.

There is evidence of neglect, verbal abuse and dehumanization, without specific measures taken at higher levels to prevent these. Nurses, aides, and other personnel in direct contact with patients reported violations of patients\u2019 rights to toilet facilities, appropriate clothing, and privacy. While such violations might be ostensibly represented as a means of behavioral control, they seem also to be thinly disguised punitive measures promoting humiliation and denigrating individuality and individual needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\u201cComplaints, again both from sources without as well as within the Fair-field Hills Hospital, pointed to limitations of privileges of visitation, access to mail, and others. The effects of these are difficult to view as other than punitive.\u201d Task Force Study of Fairfield Hills Hospital pp. 3-4.

Appelbaum, Psychiatry and the Law (1982). \u201cSince hospital treatment of major mental illness is often a long-term process inducing a generally slow rate of change, there exists a danger that treatment processes will be instituted on the basis of admission symptomatology, and that this treatment will proceed unaltered and hence unresponsive to subtle (or even gross) improvement (or deterioration) in the patient\u2019s clinical state. This danger may be largely avoided by regular review of the treatment plan, addressing in particular whether or not the specific goals of the interventions have been achieved. This means, quite simply, deciding what is not working, and changing or stopping it; and deciding what is working and continuing that.\u201d Id., p. 109.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b587-6\"> First credited with legal recognition of a right to treatment; see <em>Rouse </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>373 F.2d 451 (D.C. Cir. 1966); Chief Judge David Bazelon made the following statement in Ms introduction to a symposium on the subject: \u201cTo perform this task the judge need not be or even pretend to be a psychiatrist. His role is not to make independent judgments concerning treatment but rather to scrutinize the record to ensure that an expert more qualified than he has made a responsible exercise of his professional judgment. Courts have long fulfilled this role in supervising administrative agencies. Every regulatory agency is charged with the enforcement of a broad statute or statutes which require highly specialized training and knowledge; the legislature provides a broad standard, the administrator develops workable rules and procedures, and the court ensures that the standard and rules are evenhandedly applied to individuals. The role of the court in reviewing determinations of a mental health administrator should be similar to its role in any administrative review.\u2019\u2019 D.
