J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhQ\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the legislature intended judges of the Superior Court to come within the jurisdictional confines of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u00a7 31-275 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the death of her husband, the Honorable Frank J. Kinney, Jr., the plaintiff, Joan A. Kinney, filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against the state alleging that the decedent\u2019s fatal heart condition was causally related to work-induced stress. Ruling that the decedent was an \u201cemployee\u201d for the purposes of workers\u2019 compensation as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (5) and that his death arose out of and in the course of his employment, the commissioner for the third district awarded the plaintiff the maximum allowable spousal survivorship benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 (b). In response to the defendant\u2019s appeal, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301, the compensation review division, on its own motion, invoked the procedure authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 31-324,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to reserve to the Appellate Court the threshold jurisdictional issue of whether a Superior Court judge is an employee as defined by \u00a7 31-275 (5). We transferred this reservation to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We answer no.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The plaintiff sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the theory that the chronic stress connected with her husband\u2019s employment with the defendant contributed to his death. After the defendant contested her claim pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b), the commissioner conducted a formal hearing as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 31-298.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result of that hearing, the commissioner made the following findings of fact, which are not contested in this appeal. The decedent was first appointed to the state bench in 1972. At the time of his death, he had undertaken various administrative assignments in addition to his judicial responsibilities for the adjudication of criminal cases. The decedent was serving as the presiding criminal and administrative judge for the judicial district of New Haven, the chief administrative judge of the criminal division for the entire state and also as the chairman of the Commission to Study Alternate Sentences. The defendant at all times controlled, supervised and regulated the decedent's administrative duties. The decedent, by accepting and performing judicial and administrative duties in return for fair compensation, had entered into an employment relationship with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>defendant. The unusual work pressures<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> associated with the decedent\u2019s excessive administrative workload resulted in chronic stress that contributed to the development of coronary artery disease and exacerbated his preexisting myocardial atherosclerosis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The myocardial infarction that resulted in his death was precipitated in part by the chronic stress associated with his prodigious judicial duties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">On the basis of these findings of fact, the commissioner concluded that the decedent\u2019s employment relationship with the defendant constituted a contract of employment for the purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (5); and that the decedent\u2019s death arose out of and in the course of his employment. Accordingly, the commissioner awarded the plaintiff the maximum allowable spousal survivor-ship benefits under \u00a7 31-306 (b) (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>In its appeal to the compensation review division, the defendant challenged the validity of the commissioner\u2019s determination that the instant case falls within the jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The defendant maintained then, as it does now, that a judge of the Superior Court is not an employee for the purposes of workers\u2019 compensation, and does not have an employer-employee relationship with the defendant. The review division decided to seek guidance on these questions of law, and propounded the reservation that is presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We must decide in this case whether the legislature intended the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to confer jurisdiction upon the commissioner to award benefits to the plaintiff. Even though the plaintiff has presented a factual record that warrants sympathetic consideration of her claims, her entitlement to relief cannot transcend the jurisdictional limits of the statute under which she seeks recovery. Once an issue of subject matter jurisdiction is raised,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court must dispose of this legal question as a threshold matter. <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>204 Conn. 551, 556-57, 529 A.2d 666 (1987); <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 238, 502 A.2d 410 (1985). \u201c \u2018 \u201c[Wjhenever a court discovers that it has no jurisdiction, it is bound to dismiss the case, without regard to previous rulings.\u201d \u2019 <em>Chzrislonk </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>101 Conn. 356, 358, 125 A. 874 (1924).\u201d <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra; <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 351, 542 A.2d 672 (1988). The applicability of these principles is no less compelling in the instant case where the limited and statutory jurisdiction at issue is the legislative will as expressed in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Although the Workers\u2019 Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>pensation Act \u201cshould be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose\u201d; <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 117, 411 A.2d 924 (1979); <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 541, 494 A.2d 555 (1985); its remedial purpose cannot transcend its statutorily defined jurisdictional boundaries. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 435, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>supra, 541-42; <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>99 Conn. 236, 238, 121 A. 470 (1923). \u201cThe act is not triggered by a claimant until he brings himself within its statutory ambit.\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The plaintiff would have us resolve the jurisdictional issue in this case by deferring to the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact. This we cannot do. We recognize that the commissioner found that the decedent\u2019s judicial duties amounted to a contractual relationship with the defendant such that he was an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation as defined by \u00a7 31-275 (5). While it is correct that \u201c[bjecause only employees are entitled to compensation under the act . . . coverage must arise from a contract of employment, either express or implied\u201d; <em>Blancato v. Feldspar Corporation, </em>203 Conn. 34, 38, 522 A.2d 1235 (1987); <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>State, </em>89 Conn. 682, 686-87, 96 A. 161 (1915); our jurisdictional inquiry is not limited to the commissioner\u2019s factual finding of the decedent\u2019s contract of employment with the defendant. The elements of subject matter jurisdiction are <em>\u201cdependent upon </em>both <em>law </em>and fact.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 433. Although the plaintiff correctly asserts that the power and duty of determining facts rests on the commissioner as the trier of facts; <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988); the conclusions drawn by the commissioner cannot stand when they result from an incorrect application of the law. <em>Id.; Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/NordenDivision, </em>supra, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The commissioner exercises jurisdiction only \u201c \u2018under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u2019 <em>Heiser </em>v. <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., </em>150 Conn. 563, 565, 192 A.2d 44 (1963).\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 427-28.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The parties cannot confer jurisdiction upon the commissioner by agreement, waiver or conduct. Id., 430; <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 238. The plaintiff may invoke the remedy provided under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act only if her decedent, as a matter of law, satisfies the requisite jurisdictional standard of \u201cemployee\u201d as defined by the legislature in \u00a7 31-275 (5).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The legal question before us, therefore, is whether the legislature intended to include judges of the Superior Court within \u00a7 31-275 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We begin our examination of the scope of \u00a7 31-275 (5) by recourse to the accepted rules of statutory construction. We look first to the text of \u00a7 31-275 (5) itself. Because \u00a7 31-275 (5) consists of a functional definition with expressly delineated exceptions, for purposes of clarity, we will focus first on the operative meaning before integrating the exceptions into our analysis. Section 31-275 (5) defines \u201cemployee\u201d in relevant part as \u201cany person who has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer . . . . \u201d This language, on its face, expresses no clear legislative intent as to whether a member of the judi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>iary is a covered \u201cemployee.\u201d In ascertaining legislative intent, however, the legislature is presumed to know the history of a statute as judicially construed. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 202 n.8, 550 A.2d 309 (1988); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 71, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). Our decisions concerning the eligibility of individuals working in the public sector for workers\u2019 compensation benefits have long distinguished between public officers and public employees, and have held that public officers not expressly included within the definition provided by \u00a7 31-275 (5) are not \u201cemployees\u201d for the purposes of the act. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>94 Conn. 403, 417-18, 109 A. 176 (1920); <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">It is undisputed that judges of the Superior Court meet the three part test that determines the existence of a public office: \u201c \u2018(1) an authority conferred by law, (2) a fixed tenure of office, and (3) the power to exercise some portion of the sovereign functions of government. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>111 Conn. 667, 671, 151 A. 268 [1930]; Mechem, Public Officers \u00a7 1.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 198, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985). The Connecticut constitution so provides. With respect to the first and third prongs, article second of the Connecticut constitution, in dividing the broad powers of government into three distinct branches, confers \u201ca separate [judicial] magistracy\u201d upon a \u201cdistinct department,\u201d the judiciary; <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 679, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984); <em>Heiberger </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>148 Conn. 177, 185, 169 A.2d 652 (1961); while article fifth, \u00a7 1 describes its organizational structure and reiterates that its powers and jurisdiction shall be defined by law. With respect to the second prong, article fifth, \u00a7 2 provides in relevant part: \u201cThey shall hold their offices for the term of eight years . . . .\u201d Moreover, the judiciary\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to compensation as public officers falls clearly within the distinction contemplated in <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 685, where this court denied workers\u2019 compensation benefits to a sheriff because, as a public officer, his right to compensation \u201c \u2018belongs to him not by force of any contract, but because the law attaches it to the office.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., quoting F. Mechem, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 855 and 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The distinction between public employees and public officers, for the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation, finds textual recognition in the jurisdictional definitions contained in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 31-275 (5) expressly includes some public officers, but not judges, within the class of those eligible for workers\u2019 compensation by defining \u201cemployee\u201d in relevant part to \u201cinclude any person elected to serve as a member of the general assembly of this state and . . . any salaried officer or paid member of any police department or fire department and any elected or appointed official or agent of any city, town or borough, upon vote of the proper authority of such city, town or borough. . . . \u201d This enumeration would have been wholly unnecessary had these public officials constituted employees under the analysis of <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra. Because, for purposes of statutory construction, we presume a purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment; <em>Peek </em>v. <em>Jac-quemin, </em>supra, 66; we must attach significance to the legislature\u2019s intention to grant workers\u2019 compensation only to those public officers expressly described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u00a7 31-275 (5). Statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive. <em>The B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 6, 490 A.2d 991 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The legislative history of the evolution of the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act supports our conclusion that the legislature intended the express inclusions enumerated in \u00a7 31-275 (5) to be exclusive. Until 1921, the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d necessary to invoke workers\u2019 compensation had been limited to \u201cany person who has entered into or works under any contract . . . .\u201d General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5388. When we construed this contractual language to deny benefits to a member of a municipal fire department in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 417-18, however, the legislature expressly amended the definition to bypass the decisional law for a specific category of public positions. See General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5388, as amended by chapter 306, \u00a7 11 of the Public Acts of 1921. Each subsequent addition to the category of public positions evinces an intention on the part of the legislature carefully to circumscribe the expansion of named beneficiaries.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The telling omission of judges of the Superior Court from this exclusive list of expressly included exceptions is persuasive evidence that the legislature did not intend the scope of \u00a7 31-275 (5) to embrace the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Our conclusion that the distinction between employment and public office is firmly embedded in our law of workers\u2019 compensation does not conflict with the proposition that, in other circumstances, a public official may be considered an employee. \u201c[A] municipal position, for certain purposes, may constitute a \u2018public office\u2019 and, for others, mere employment.\u201d <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, supra, 200; <em>State ex rel. Sloane </em>v. <em>Reidy, </em>152 Conn. 419, 426, 209 A.2d 674 (1965). With respect to judges of the Superior Court, and the Probate Court administrator, the legislature has determined, as General Statutes \u00a7 45-29u<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> indicates, that they have the same entitlement to group life and health insurance as is expressly afforded to other state employees and members of the General Assembly by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-257<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and 5-259<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of the State Personnel Act. Workers\u2019 compensation is not among the benefits enumerated in \u00a7 45-29u.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It bears noting, finally, that the legislature has enacted comprehensive provisions concerning benefits specifically for judges. General Statutes, chapter 872. These statutes not only provide annual salaries; General Statutes \u00a7 51-47;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but include specific entitlements to disability retirement; General Statutes \u00a7 51-49; retirement salary and allowance to surviving spouses; General Statutes \u00a7 51-49f; and pensions for surviving spouses and children. General Statutes \u00a7 51-51. The legislature conspicuously failed to include workers\u2019 compensation within the benefits conferred upon judges by chapter 872. Since the legislature is presumed to exercise its statutory authority with knowledge of existing statutes and with the intention of creating one consistent body of law; <em>Shortt </em>v. <em>New Milford Police Department, </em>212 Conn. 294, 302, 562 A.2d 7 (1989); <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>204 Conn. 609, 621, 529 A.2d 692 (1987); it is reasonable to infer that the legislature would not have intended, sub silentio, to confer such a benefit upon the judiciary. The more rational explanation for the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>lature\u2019s silence is that the legislature concluded that it would be duplicative to provide both disability benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits to these public officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">To construe \u00a7 31-275 (5) to include members of the judiciary within the class of those entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits would constitute a radical departure from established policy. We will not infer that the legislature intended to enact a significant change in existing law without an unequivocally expressed manifestation of legislative intent. <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>209 Conn. 219, 222, 550 A.2d 640 (1988); <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 667, 103 A.2d 535 (1954). Were this court to award compensation benefits to the spouse of a deceased judge, we \u201cwould be legislating by adding a new class to the coverage of this act which proclaims its limited scope.\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 435. This we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In response to the reservation from the compensation review division, whether a judge of the Superior Court is an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation as defined by \u00a7 31-275 (5), we answer no.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-5\"> The compensation review division originally reserved two questions for the advice of this court: (1) Is a judge of the Superior Court of Connecticut an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (5)? (2) Does the widow of such a judge making a claim on her own and her children\u2019s behalf for survivor dependency benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 satisfy the prerequisite jurisdictional elements necessary to effect entitlement pursuant to General Statutes, chapter 568? Counsel for both parties stipulated at oral argument that, because the existence of an employee-employer relationship is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an award of compensation benefits, the first question presents a threshold issue dispositive of this appeal. We therefore do not reach the second question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-324 states in relevant part: \u201cWhen, in any case arising under the provisions of this chapter, the compensation review division is of the opinion that the .decision involves principles of law which are not free from reasonable doubt and which public interest requires shall be determined by the appellate court, in order that a definite rule be established applicable to future cases, said compensation review division may, on its own motion and without any agreement or act of the parties or their counsel, reserve such case for the opinion of the appellate court. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\"> Procedurally, we have transferred this reservation to ourselves on two separate occasions.

On April 6,1989, the compensation review division denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss for a procedural defect because, as a threshold matter, the review division could not exercise its competence over the claim until resolution of the jurisdictional challenge.

In response to an inquiry whether a Superior Court judge, suspended from service by the Judicial Department pending disposition of a criminal charge against him, is entitled to his regular salary, the attorney general stated that \u201c[a] Judge of the Superior Court is one who holds an office,\u201d and that his \u201cright to a salary depends upon the legal title to the office and not upon the performance of the work.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b83-6\"> For example, the legislature expanded the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d to include members of the General Assembly in 1972. The legislative history of the debate surrounding passage of that legislation is particularly instructive on the point that the legislature was aware that state officers do not receive their salary as a matter of contract of service and would thus need a special amendment bypassing decisional law in order to qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.
