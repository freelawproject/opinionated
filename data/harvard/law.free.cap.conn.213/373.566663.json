Simon S. Cohen, </em>exercising the powers of the Superior Court. Pursuant to the dissolution, the plaintiff was awarded custody of the couple\u2019s two children and the defendant was ordered to make periodic payments toward the children\u2019s support. On March 30, 1988, the state, on behalf of the plaintiff, filed a motion to modify support, alleging that the plaintiff was a recipient of \u201cIV-D\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> services and requesting an increase in the amount of the support payments being made by the defendant. The defendant subsequently filed his own motion to modify support, seeking a reduction in the amount of his required payments. After these motions had been referred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the court, <em>Freed, J., </em>evidence in support of both motions was heard by <em>Katherine Y. Hutchinson, </em>a family support magistrate, whose findings of fact and recommendation for an increase in the amount of the defendant\u2019s support payments were approved by the court, <em>Kline, J., </em>on January 12,1989. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the case to our docket pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In his appeal, the defendant makes a wholesale constitutional attack on the validity of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4), a portion of the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 et seq., and also takes issue with the legal and factual basis of the order increasing the amount of his support payments. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The defendant makes three separate constitutional arguments challenging the validity of the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act. The defendant asserts that \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4): (1) violates the equal protection guarantees contained in article first, \u00a7 20 of the Connecticut constitution and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by making an irrational distinction between the child support modification procedures followed in IV-D and non IY-D cases; (2) violates the judicial selection provisions of article fifth, \u00a7 2 of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> since motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>for modification of child support orders in IV-D cases are \u201cdecided\u201d by a family support magistrate; and (3) for the same reason, constitutes an infringement upon the power of the judiciary, in violation of article second and article fifth, \u00a7 1 of the Connecticut constitution and article III, \u00a7 1 of the United States constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We decline to review the defendant\u2019s equal protection claim and conclude that the statutory procedure followed in this case did not violate any provision of our state constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no valid federal constitutional claim raised, however, since article III, \u00a7 1 is inapplicable to state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The defendant\u2019s constitutional claims were neither presented to nor considered by either the family support magistrate or the trial court. \u201cThe supreme court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4185. We would ordinarily, therefore, decline to address any of the defendant\u2019s various constitutional arguments. <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>188 Conn. 98, 106, 448 A.2d 822 (1982), cert. denied, 459 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>U.S. 1148, 103 S. Ct. 792, 74 L. Ed. 2d 997 (1983); <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 369, 377, 439 A.2d 396 (1981). \u201cA recognized exception to this rule[, however,] is that a challenge to the jurisdiction of a court to render a judgment may be raised at any time, because the lack of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. <em>LaBow </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>171 Conn. 433, 440, 370 A.2d 990 (1976); <em>Connecticut Steel Co. </em>v. <em>National Amusements, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 255, 262-63, 348 A.2d 658 (1974).\u201d <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 499, 508 A.2d 415 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Of the three separate claims set forth in the defendant\u2019s statement of the issues, only two, those addressing the appointment of judges and the power of the judiciary, bring into question \u201cthe authority of the adjudicative agency whose action was essential to rendition of the judgment.\u201d Id. For this reason, we decline to address the equal protection portion of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims of error and turn our attention to the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding judicial power and selection. Those claims are predicated upon the defendant\u2019s assertion that the plaintiff\u2019s motion for modification was heard and ruled upon in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our review of the record, however, leads us to conclude that the motion in question was heard and ruled upon pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> since the matter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201creferred to the family support magistrate division for a finding of fact and report to the court.\u201d With the record in this posture we leave for another time a determination of the constitutionality of \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4) when a family support magistrate exercises greater authority, and conclude, primarily on the basis of our prior holdings in <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, and <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979), that \u00a7 46b-86 (c) is not violative of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Before we address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims, it is appropriate for us to detail both the statutory scheme under consideration, as well as the specific proceedings before the family support magistrate and the trial court. The record and transcript in this case reveal that both the parties and the trial court were somewhat daunted by the intertwining nature of \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4) of the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act, and \u00a7 46b-86, entitled \u201cModification of alimony or support orders and judgments.\u201d A thorough dissection of the various statutory provisions regarding modification of child support orders reveals that there existed, at the time the parties\u2019 motions were considered, three distinct procedures for hearing such motions. The particular procedure to be followed was dependent upon the status of the parties and the nature of the original support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">First, \u00a7 46b-86 (a)* *****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that, unless modification is otherwise precluded, any final order for the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of child support may be \u201caltered or modified <em>by said court </em>upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Second, \u00a7 46b-86 (c) provides that when one of the parties is receiving or has received aid from the state, as provided in title IV-A or IV-E of the Social Security Act, or has \u201capplied\u201d for IV-D services, a motion for modification of support payments \u201cshall be referred to the family support magistrate division for a <em>finding offact and report to the court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Finally, \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4) provides that motions for modification of support orders \u201centered by the superior court <em>in IV-D </em>cases<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> shall be brought in the family support magistrate division and <em>decided by a family support magistrate.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, in order to determine which procedure should be utilized in a particular case, the following relevant inquiries must be made: (1) whether the original support order was entered by the Superior Court in a IV-D case; and (2) whether either of the parties to the original order has received or applied for services as provided in \u00a7 46b-86 (c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The record shows that the original support order in this case was entered on April 14,1983, and was modified on June 23,1983, by the Superior Court, <em>Daly, J., </em>to allow a reduction in the defendant\u2019s support payments while the children stayed with him during the summer. From these facts, we conclude that the original support order was certainly not entered in a IV-D case, since the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act did not come into existence until the enactment of No. 86-359 of the 1986 Public Acts. In answer to the second question posed above, it is undisputed that the plaintiff applied for and subsequently received services provided by the Connecticut child support enforcement bureau. See General Statutes \u00a7 17-31i (h). Thus, because \u00a7 46b-86 (c) is applicable and \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4) is not, the motions of both parties for modification should have been brought in the Superior Court and referred to a family support magistrate \u201cfor a finding of fact and report to the court.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (c). Our task now is to determine whether this procedure was indeed followed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The record reveals that the plaintiff\u2019s motion was originally directed to the family support magistrate session of the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain, and, in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 479A,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>captioned as a family support magistrate matter. On April 26, 1988, a hearing was held by the Superior Court, <em>Freed, J., </em>because of a potential conflict between the defendant\u2019s counsel and the family support magistrate who was to have conducted the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion. At this hearing, the plaintiff received a copy of the defendant\u2019s motion for modification and requested that her motion for modification be referred to a different magistrate, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4). The transcript of this hearing reveals, however, that the referral to the magistrate was intended to be for factfinding and a report to the court, the procedure set forth in \u00a7 46b-86 (c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion for modification was kept on the calender in the Superior Court, although it too was later brought before the family support magistrate when the plaintiff\u2019s motion was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Hearings on both motions were conducted before magistrate Hutchinson on July 12, August 22, and September 29,1988. At the conclusion of the presentation of testimony, the magistrate made it clear that \u201cthis being a modification of a Connecticut dissolution action, I have to do a finding of fact and report, which will contain a recommendation that goes to the Superior Court judge . . . .\u201d The magistrate\u2019s report, entitled \u201cFAMILY SUPPORT MAGISTRATE\u2019S FINDING OF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>FACT AND REPORT PURSUANT TO CGS SEC. 46B-86 (c) . . . ,\u201d recommended that the plaintiffs motion be granted and that the defendant\u2019s motion be denied. After this report was filed in the Superior Court, the defendant, \u201cpursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. 46b-231 (n) (2) and Practice Book Section 4009,\u201d moved for reargument and/or a rehearing before the family support magistrate. The plaintiff opposed this motion, arguing that since the magistrate had the duty to find facts and make a report to the court, the defendant\u2019s proper course of action was to file objections to the report of the magistrate. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 428 through 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Having heard argument by both parties, the Superior Court, <em>Kline, J., </em>denied the motion for reargument and approved the findings made by the magistrate. The court then informed the defendant: \u201cYou can take an appeal from the decision to approve the findings, or you can make your motion for a rehearing, in accordance with the statute, based upon the decision of the Court.\u201d Thereafter, the defendant, relying upon \u00a7 46b-231 (n) (l),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> filed an appeal to the Superior Court as well as a motion to reargue. The plaintiff filed an objection, claiming that the defendant\u2019s proper rem-. edy was an appeal to the Appellate rather than the Superior Court. Thereafter, Judge Kline heard argument by the defendant in support of his contention that \u00a7 46b-231 (n) allowed him to appeal the decision of the magistrate to the Superior Court. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to reargue, concluding that \u201cthe Appellate Court [could] worry about how to interpret all these various sections of the statute. There\u2019s a lot of confusion.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>On the basis of this record, we conclude that the defendant lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4) of the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act since the decision modifying the amount of his support payments was neither heard nor determined pursuant to that particular statute. \u201cAccording to well-established principles, a [party] who challenges the constitutionality of a statute must prove that the statute has adversely affected a constitutionally protected right \u2018under the facts of his particular case and not merely under some possible or hypothetical set of facts not proven to exist.\u2019 <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 471, 217 A.2d 698 (1966). . . <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>185 Conn. 495, 501, 441 A.2d 142 (1981). \u201c \u2018[J]udicial power is to be exercised to strike down legislation, whether state or federal, only at the instance of one who is himself immediately harmed, or immediately threatened with harm, by the challenged action.\u2019 <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Ullman, </em>[367 U.S. 497, 504, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1961)] . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 106, 503 A.2d 136 (1985). In this case, we conclude that the motions to modify the defendant\u2019s support payments were heard and decided on the basis of the procedure set forth in \u00a7 46b-86 (c), and that the defendant, therefore, has not proved any adverse effect imposed upon him by the operation of \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (4) of the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Assuming, in the alternative, that the defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments are applicable to the procedure under \u00a7 46b-86 (c), which was actually followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>in this case, we conclude that those arguments are without merit. In <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 501, we concluded that attorney referees, charged with the duty of finding facts and rendering a report to a judge of the Superior Court, were not judges of the Supreme or Superior Court, and therefore need not be appointed in accordance with the provisions of article fifth, \u00a7 2 of our state constitution. As applied to the facts of this case, we conclude that that holding is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim, since the magistrate here performed duties identical to those performed by the attorney referee in <em>Seal Audio, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Finally, the defendant claims that the duties performed by the family support magistrate were an unconstitutional intrusion upon the independent power of the judiciary. Applying our conclusion that the magistrate in this case was performing duties identical to those of an attorney referee, we note that \u201c[t]he state referee system, as a special tribunal, does not encroach upon, and does not unconstitutionally compete with, other constitutional courts. On the contrary, as we noted in <em>Florida Hill Road Corporation </em>[v. <em>Commissioner, </em>164 Conn. 360, 367, 321 A.2d 856 (1973)], state referees \u2018serve the very practical purpose of relieving the court\u2019s crowded dockets.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>supra, 180; <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra. To be unconstitutional in the context of the separation of powers provided for in article second of our state constitution, \u201ca statute must not only deal with subject-matter which is within the judicial power, but it must operate in an area which lies exclusively under the control of the courts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>166 Conn. 501, 510-11, 353 A.2d 723 (1974). On the facts of this case, we accordingly find no merit to the defendant\u2019s separation of powers challenge to the actions of the family support magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Regarding the merits of the modification order, the defendant first argues that he is entitled to a reversal of the trial court\u2019s approval of the findings and recommendations of the family support magistrate since those findings and recommendations were reached by utilization of an improper legal standard. The magistrate found that there had been <em>\u201ca </em>substantial change of circumstances of the parties since the child support order was entered.\u201d The defendant\u2019s claim is predicated upon the fact that the magistrate failed to conclude explicitly that this substantial change had been uncontemplated at the time of the entry of the original support order. See <em>Grinold </em>v. <em>Grinold, </em>172 Conn. 192, 195, 374 A.2d 172 (1976).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u201cThe correctness of a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary. We do not presume error. The burden is on the appellant to prove harmful error.\u201d <em>Brook-field v. Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 7, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986). In the absence of a motion for articulation; see Practice Book \u00a7 4051; \u201cit would be sheer speculation for this court to assume that the trial court applied the incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumpton, </em>202 Conn. 224, 232, 520 A.2d 226 (1987). Since there was ample evidence from which the magistrate could have concluded that the substantial change she found in the circumstances of the parties was uncontemplated at the time of the dissolution decree, we presume that the trial court applied the correct legal standard and conclude that the defendant has not met his burden of proving harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The report of the family support magistrate, as adopted by the trial court, recommended that the defendant\u2019s support payments be increased from $62.50 per child per week to $115 per child per week, and that the defendant pay the expenses of a \u201ctutor and/or a special reading program\u201d for his son, not to exceed $1000 per year. The factual findings of the magistrate indicate that subsequent to the 1983 dissolution order: (1) the defendant\u2019s financial situation had improved from a weekly deficit of $102 to a weekly deficit of $64; (2) the defendant\u2019s expenses included \u201cone-half of the mortgage payments and taxes on a home owned by his present wife and one-half of the taxes on a house owned by the defendant and his brother[,]\u201d the defendant\u2019s share of which he estimated to be worth $115,000; (3) the needs of the children could not be met with the plaintiff\u2019s disposable income combined with the original support payments; and (4) the defendant\u2019s son had a reading disability that could be \u201caddressed with the help of a tutor and/or a special reading program.\u201d With this evidence before the family support magistrate, we conclude that the trial court could reasonably have found that the changes noted were uncontemplated at the time of the 1983 dissolution order. See <em>Kelepecz </em>v. <em>Kelepecz, </em>187 Conn. 537, 538-40, 447 A.2d 8 (1982); <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>187 Conn. 380, 383, 446 A.2d 796 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Finally, the defendant challenges the factual findings made by the family support magistrate, claiming that issues of credibility were ignored and that the evidence presented concerning his son\u2019s reading disability was insufficient to justify the order requiring the defendant to contribute $1000 per year toward a remedial reading program. Our review of these claims \u201cis limited to deciding whether the trial court has abused its legal discretion. As we have repeatedly noted, \u2018trial courts have a distinct advantage over an appellate court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>dealing with domestic relations, where all of the surrounding circumstances and the appearance and attitude of the parties are so significant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hardisty </em>v. <em>Hardisty, </em>183 Conn. 253, 260, 439 A.2d 307 (1981), quoting <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 262, 413 A.2d 854 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">From our review of the report of the family support magistrate, we conclude that there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the issue of credibility was ignored. The report carefully outlines the evidence presented in support of both parties\u2019 motions for modification, and concludes, based on the evidence outlined above, that the needs of the children, coupled with the financial status of both parties, justified an increase in the amount of the defendant\u2019s support payments. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in adopting the findings and recommendations of the family support magistrate regarding the increase in the defendant\u2019s support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the defendant contribute to the cost of a remedial reading program for his son. Unlike the issue of the cost of private secondary education, which we addressed in <em>Hardisty </em>v. <em>Hardisty, </em>supra, in this case there was evidence presented to the family support magistrate that would constitute <em>\u201ca </em>showing of special need or some other compelling justification, for increasing the support obligation of the noncustodial parent who genuinely doubts the value of the program that he is being asked to underwrite.\u201d Id., 265. The magistrate heard evidence regarding the son\u2019s reading disability, as well as the fact that the school system in which he was enrolled did not have a program that could adequately address his needs. Consequently, the magistrate concluded that the problem should \u201cbe addressed with the help of a tutor and/or a special read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ing program.\u201d We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the defendant share in the cost of that program.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> As used throughout this opinion, the shorthand phrase IV-D refers to the statutory scheme set forth in 42 U.S.C. chapter 7 (\u201cSocial Security\u201d), subchapter IV (\u201cGrants to States for Aid and Services to Needy Families with Children and for Child-Welfare Services\u201d), part IV-D (\u201cChild Support and Establishment of Paternity\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> Article first, \u00a7 20 of our state constitution provides in part: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\"> Article fifth, \u00a7 2 of our state constitution provides: \u201cThe judges of the supreme court and of the superior court shall, upon nomination by the governor, be appointed by the general assembly in such manner as shall by law be prescribed.
