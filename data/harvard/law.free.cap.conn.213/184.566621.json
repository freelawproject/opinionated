That court dismissed the appeal, and this appeal ensued. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Since 1979, A. Gallo Distributing Company (Gallo) has been the designated distributor in Fairfield county for certain beer products of the plaintiff, All Brand Importers, Inc. (All Brand), an out-of-state shipper. On December 31,1986, Gallo merged with Star Distributors, Inc. (Star). Gallo was the terminating corporation and Star was the surviving corporation. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 33-284 (o), 33-364. The surviving corporation retained the name Star Distributors, Inc. Both Gallo and Star held wholesaler permits issued by the department, which, on the merger, required that one of the two permits be surrendered. See General Statutes \u00a7 30-62; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 30-6-A4 (a). Gallo surrendered its wholesaler permit. By letter dated January 20,1987, Star wrote the department requesting its advice on whether Star, as the surviving corporation, would be required to obtain reappointment letters from out-of-state shippers because of the merger. Star\u2019s letter opined, referring specifically to General Statutes \u00a7 33-369 (c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that if the Connecticut statutes on merger were applicable, it would appear that such reappointments would not be necessary. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>department, by letter dated February 5,1987, replied that it would \u201crequire re-appointment of manufacturers in connection with the merger of [Gallo] into [Star].\u201d Although tending to agree that \u00a7 33-369 (c) appeared applicable, the department, citing certain statutes and a regulation, said, inter alia, that reappointment in Star\u2019s name under its permit should be obtained from all of the manufacturers and suppliers of Gallo for whom Star sought to distribute alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Thereafter, by letter dated February 20,1987, Star wrote All Brand requesting that All Brand reappoint Star as a distributor of the All Brand lines previously distributed by Gallo. With this letter, Star enclosed copies of Gallo\u2019s \u201cproposed\u201d release of \u201call assigned distribution rights\u201d of All Brand, a letter from Star \u201cpurporting\u201d to accept appointment from All Brand as an exclusive distributor in Fairfield county and a request that All Brand forward a letter of the appointment of Star. All Brand refused to give an appointment letter to Star and attempted to appoint Burt\u2019s Beverage Co., Inc. (Burt\u2019s), as a distributor in Fairfield county. Star then wrote to the department on March 25,1987, and requested a declaratory ruling as to whether, as a result of the merger, it succeeded to the distribution rights of Gallo under General Statutes \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Thereafter, the department issued a \u201cNotice of Declaratory Ruling Hearing\u201d to decide the following question: \u201cWhether C.G.S. Sec. 33-369 (c) automatically vests Star Distributors, Inc. with the distribution rights to All Brand products previously distributed by A. Gallo Distributing Company, which distribution rights are thereupon protected by C.G.S. Sec. 30-17 (a) (2)?\u201d On April 9, 1987, the department held a hearing at which testimony was taken and exhibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>admitted into evidence. All Brand, Star and Burt\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were present at that hearing and each was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">On May 5, 1987, the department issued a written decision in which it ruled that \u201cConnecticut General Statutes, Sec. 33-369 (c) automatically vests STAR DISTRIBUTORS, INC. with the distribution rights to ALL BRAND products previously distributed by A. GALLO DISTRIBUTING COMPANY, which distribution rights are thereupon protected by C.G.S. Sec. 30-17 (a) (2).\u201d In so ruling, the department determined, inter alia, that after reviewing the Liquor Control Act (title 30 of the General Statutes), it could not find any indication that \u00a7 33-369 (c) was \u201cmodified or affected by any statute in [title 30]\u201d and that there was no incompatability \u201cbetween the corporate merger law and the Liquor Control Act.\u201d Although the department decided that a merger transfers the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises of each of the merging corporations (Gallo and Star), it emphasized that they were still required to obtain the approval of the department under its regulations. Gallo and Star had each requested prior approval of the department before the merger. Moreover, it also said that the inapplicability of \u00a7 33-369 (c) to this case would result in \u201cadverse consequences\u201d not only to Connecticut wholesalers but also to the department\u2019s power.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The department emphasized and developed the distinctions between a permit granted by the department and the appointment agreements that distributors have with manufacturers and out-of-state shippers. Stressing that permits and distribution rights \u201care both sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ject to the pervasive regulatory control of the [department],\u201d it pointed to our recent decision in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>194 Conn. 165, 479 A.2d 1191 (1984), which, it opined, upheld \u201c[t jhe power to regulate virtually every aspect of the liquor and beer industry,\u201d including \u201cpermits and distributorships.\u201d Pointing out that this power has resulted in extensive legislation regulating manufacturers or out-of-state shippers, it stated that it was \u201capparent that <em>Connecticut intends to and does control the supplying out-of-state shipper . . . to make certain that the owner of the brand name, out-of-state shipper, cannot dominate or control the Connecticut wholesalers,\u2019 \u201d </em>(emphasis added) citing D. Brennan, \u201cLiquor Control,\u201d 54 Conn. B.J. 611, 613-14 (1980). Further, it found that it was immaterial whether a distribution agreement was a \u201cfranchise\u201d under the language of \u00a7 33-369 (c) granting a surviving corporation \u201call the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises\u201d of the merging corporations because, even if a distribution agreement were \u201cfound not to be a franchise per se,\u201d it would fall within the \u201call rights and privileges\u201d language of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The department then turned to All Brand\u2019s argument referring to marketing plans and product mix. All Brand argued that \u201cit does not want its product to be marketed with the other brands in the Star house\u201d and, therefore, All Brand contends that it should have the right to terminate the appointment because of the merger. The answer to that argument, the department said, was \u201cthe use of the provisions of the \u2018just and sufficient cause hearing\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 30-17 (b). It concluded that a \u201c \u2018merger\u2019 <em>in and of itself, </em>does not create \u2018just and sufficient cause\u2019 for termination of a distributorship.\u201d (Emphasis added.) All Brand and Burt\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>appealed the department\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. The court dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The trial court found that All Brand had established aggrievement. In deciding that \u00a7 33-369 (c) applied, the trial court not only pointed out that that statute contained no exceptions or policing mechanisms, but also concluded that the merger statute and the liquor control statutes were \u201creadily reconciled, rational and consistent.\u201d It also indicated that the effect of the merger was to lump together all of the assets and liabilities of the \u201cconstituent organizations\u201d into the surviving corporation under \u00a7 33-369 (c), including the appointment and distribution rights of Gallo from All Brand. Just as the trial court could not engraft an exception into \u00a7 33-369 (c), as All Brand appeared to urge, the trial court stated that it could not remake the contract All Brand had entered into with Gallo. The contract was, the court said, not altered because the merger \u201cautomatically vested\u201d all rights in Star, the surviving corporation, without any \u201cfurther act or deed (such as a formal assignment).\u201d Additionally, it rejected All Brand\u2019s claim that its 1979 appointment of Gallo as its distributor was a nonassignable personal* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> service contract which survived the merger and that All Brand was being \u201cforced\u201d into a contract with Star. In that regard, the trial court took pains to point out that All Brand was not without recourse as it might, in a different proceeding, challenge performance by Star in a \u201cjust and sufficient cause\u201d hearing under \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The trial court also stressed that permits and distribution (appointment) rights were significantly different in origin and consequence, with the former being granted solely by the state and the latter being a private arrangement between the distributor and the manufacturer or out-of-state shipper, although it did recognize that distribution rights were subject to \u201csome oversight\u201d by the department. Further, the trial court underscored the extensive regulation of the liquor industry as it extends to out-of-state shippers and their relationship to Connecticut wholesalers. The purpose of that regulation, it indicated, is to prevent domination of the industry by out-of-state suppliers and consequently, there were limitations on such shippers\u2019 ability to end a distributorship even where, as in this case, \u201cthe precipitating act was the act of the wholesaler in merging.\u201d Observing that All Brand had to be aware of the \u201climiting regulatory scheme\u201d on that industry, it noted that \u201cspecial rules\u201d for contracts within the industry were permitted within constitutional limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">All Brand has appealed. It claims that the trial court erred in (1) its interpretation of \u00a7 33-369 (c) as applying to liquor permits, licenses and appointments, (2) its interpretation of \u00a7 33-369 (c) as applying to All Brand in that it violated its right to substantive and procedural due process including its rights under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), and (3) its findings, \u201cincluding but not limited to its conclusions, concerning the effect on All Brand of the merger of Gallo and Star and [its] holding [concerning] \u00a7 30-17,\u201d which was either plain error or clearly erroneous. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">An appeal from a declaratory ruling of an agency, where a hearing is held, is taken to the Superior Court pursuant to the UAPA. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176, 4-183. On appeal, \u201c[i]t is not the function of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>to retry the case.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>175 Conn. 409, 414, 399 A.2d 834 (1978). \u201c[Credibility of witnesses and the determination of issues of fact are matters within the province of the administrative agency.\u201d Id. Nor is the question \u201cwhether the trial court would have reached the same conclusion but [the question is] whether the record bef\u00f3te the commission supports the action taken.\u201d Id.; <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>143 Conn. 488, 492, 123 A.2d 747 (1956). \u201c \u2018Judicial review of the conclusions of law reached administratively is also limited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986). The court\u2019s \u201c \u2018ultimate duty is only to decide whether', in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 3, 509 A.2d 489 (1986); see <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 322, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 438,- 441, 423 A.2d 87 (1979); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 707-708, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977). The legal conclusions reached by the agency must stand, therefore, \u201cif the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 774, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We turn now to All Brand\u2019s claim that the department erred in its interpretation of \u00a7 33-369 (c). Initially, it claims that this statute does not apply to mergers of liquor permittees: While conceding the pervasiveness of the regulatory control of the liquor industry as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>well as the fact that a distributor needs a permit and an appointment before it can distribute a supplier\u2019s line, it disagrees with the department and Star on the effect of a merger in the liquor industry. It contends that the pervasiveness of regulatory control precludes the interpretation of \u00a7 33-369 (c) made by the department. Further, while maintaining that there is no dispute that Gallo \u201ccannot transfer its permit\u201d without department approval and that the department \u201cmust approve all appointments [of distributors] before they become effective,\u201d it argues that its appointment of Gallo as a distributor cannot be transferred by operation of law because of the merger for several reasons. The reasons advanced are: (1) the appointment by All Brand of Gallo as its distributor \u201cceased to exist when Gallo merged with Star\u201d; (2) no authority was given Star by All Brand; (3) the appointment of Gallo by All Brand was \u201creleased\u201d by Gallo when it surrendered its permit; and (4) the department never approved the appointment as it was requested to do. All Brand argues that the view of the department and Star as to the role of the department in a merger reduces the department\u2019s role \u201cto a few perfunctory record-keeping requirements,\u201d and that that view would also render the liquor control statutes \u201csuperfluous,\u201d a result that the legislature never conceivably intended. Moreover, the concept of \u201cautomatic vesting,\u201d All Brand contends, is inconsistent with the licensing and approval procedures mandated by the statutes and regulations governing the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in this state and would \u201cemasculate\u201d the department\u2019s authority to regulate the distribution of liquor. The literal incorporation of \u201cautomatic vesting\u201d into the liquor control statutes, it asserts, would defeat the policy of the liquor statute \u201c \u2018and make its . . . provisions hopelessly inconsistent.\u2019 \u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>On this phase of the matter, the department and Star maintain, inter alia, that the plain language of \u00a7 33-369 (c) automatically vests Star with the distribution rights held by Gallo prior to the merger. They argue that neither state law nor the law of contracts operates to allow the merger to extinguish the contested distribution rights. Furthermore, they claim that All Brand\u2019s refusal to appoint Star is no bar to vesting Gallo's premerger distribution rights in Star and that their interpretation of \u00a7 33-369 (c) does not create any incompatibility between the Liquor Control Act and our corporate merger statute. They also contend that liquor distribution appointments are not exempt from the purview of \u00a7 33-369 (c) and that the automatic vesting rule of \u00a7 33-369 (c) is not inconsistent with the department\u2019s strict control of the liquor business in this state. Both the department and Star deny that there is, as claimed, any denial of All Brand\u2019s substantive and procedural due process rights or any of its rights under the UAPA. Both the department and Star emphasize that All Brand still retains its rights to seek to terminate the distribution rights of Star, as the surviving corporation in this merger, by proceeding in \u201ca just and sufficient cause\u201d hearing as permitted by \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">It is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>178 Conn. 634, 637-38, 425 A.2d 128 (1979); <em>Sillman </em>v. <em>Sillman, </em>168 Conn. 144, 147, 358 A.2d 150 (1975); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 45.05. \u201cIt is well settled that a statute must be applied as its words direct.\u201d <em>New Haven v. United Illuminating Co., </em>168 Conn. 478, 485, 362 A.2d 785 (1975). Words in a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning and be interpreted in their natural and usual meaning unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended. Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 1-1a; <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 570, 440 A.2d 767 (1981). It is the court\u2019s duty to \u201cinterpret statutes as they are written.\u201d <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980). \u201c \u2018Courts cannot, by construction, read into statutes provisions which are not clearly stated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>209 Conn. 175, 179, 550 A.2d 8 (1988); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Guman, </em>163 Conn. 439, 444, 311 A.2d 57 (1972). \u201c[I]f the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>supra; <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 141, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986). \u201c[T]he intent of the legislature is to be found not in what it meant to say but in what it did say.\u201d <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 549-50, 494 A.2d 564 (1985); <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975); <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, 571. Where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intent of the legislature and there is no need for statutory construction or a review of the legislative history. <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The Connecticut Stock Corporation Act (act), which includes \u00a7 33-369 (c), became effective on January 1, 1961.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See Public Acts 1959, No. 618. The act defines \u201cmerger\u201d as \u201cthe combination of one or more domestic or foreign corporations with another which continues its corporate existence. All corporations party to the merger are \u2018merging corporations\u2019; the merging corporation that upon the merger continues its existence is the \u2018surviving corporation\u2019; the other merging corporations are \u2018terminating corporations.\u2019 \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 33-284 (o). The Connecticut statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>on the effect of merger or consolidation was based on the ABA-ALI Model Business Corporation Act (1969) \u00a7 76,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and certain language was also taken from North Carolina General Statutes \u00a7 55-110 (1965). S. Cross, Corporation Law in Connecticut (1972) p. 419 n.56.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">All Brand claims that the merger statute does not apply to give Star, as the surviving corporation, Gallo\u2019s appointment by All Brand as a distributor. It is important to note that All Brand does not point to any other part of the Connecticut Stock Corporation Act to argue that its contention finds support in that act; the act, it emphasizes, just does not apply. We are persuaded that the act, and specifically \u00a7 33-369 (c), does apply. Section 33-283 of the act, which comprises chapter 599 of the General Statutes, is entitled \u201cConstruction of chapter\u201d and provides in relevant part: \u201cThis chapter shall be so construed as to provide for a general corporate form for the conduct of lawful business with such variations and modifications from the form so provided as the interested parties may agree upon, subject to the interests of the state and third parties.\u201d This is language of general application providing \u201ca general corporate form for the conduct of lawful business.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Certainly Gallo and Star were Connecticut corporations conducting a lawful business in this state \u2014 although they were doing so in the heavily regulated liquor industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>All Brand does not point to any Connecticut statute that either provides or even suggests that the Stock Corporation Act in chapter 599 does not apply because the \u201ccorporate form\u201d is employed by an entity engaged in the liquor industry. The Liquor Control Act has been part of our statutes since 1933, more than twenty-five years prior to the enactment of the Stock Corporation Act. This history offers additional support for the conclusion that the act, including \u00a7 33-369 (c), applies to the conduct of lawful business in the stock corporation form because, as we have repeatedly stated, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.

We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>We have recognized the pervasiveness of the state\u2019s control over the liquor business. \u201cBecause of the danger to the public health and welfare inherent in the liquor traffic, the police power to regulate and control it runs broad and deep, much more so than the power to curb and direct ordinary business activity.\u201d <em>Ruppert </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>138 Conn. 669, 674, 88 A.2d 388 (1952) (affirming the denial of a renewal application for an out-of-state shipper\u2019s permit); <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>191 Conn. 528, 533,469 A.2d 382 (1983). We have acknowledged the broader than usual power of the state over this traffic when we said: \u201cA state has far broader power and latitude to regulate and restrict the use, distribution or consumption of liquor than the power to regulate or restrict ordinary business because of its effect on the health and welfare of the public.\u201d <em>Dupont </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 213, 219, 240 A.2d 899 (1968).

If control of this industry is to be meaningful, then not only must liquor control statutes be applied but also any statute outside that statutory scheme that permissibly effectuates such con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>trol must also be applied unless there is a clear indication to the contrary. No such contrary indication has been shown. Corporations abound in the liquor industry and they may merge.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">There is no dispute that All Brand\u2019s appointment of Gallo as a distributor created a contract. The law, however, is that \u201cstatutes existing at the time a contract is made become a part of it and must be read into it just as if an express provision to that effect were inserted therein, except where the contract discloses a contrary intention.\u201d <em>Ciarleglio </em>v. <em>Benedict &amp; Co., </em>127 Conn. 291, 293, 16 A.2d 593 (1940); <em>Hatcho Corporation </em>v. <em>Della Pietra, </em>195 Conn. 18, 21, 485 A.2d 1285 (1985). There is no contrary intention disclosed in this contract. Long ago, the United States Supreme Court added emphasis to the principle that the law subsisting at the time the contract is made governs as if expressly referred to in the agreement when it held that \u201c[t]his principle embraces alike those which affect its validity, construction, discharge, and enforcement.\u201d <em>Von Hoffman </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 535, 550, 18 L. Ed. 403 (1866); see <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 645, 652, 405 A.2d 84 (1978). All Brand, doing business in Connecticut, is subject to this principle. Therefore, our stock corporation statute, particularly \u00a7 33-369 (c), applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We perceive nothing incompatible in the department\u2019s control of the industry under the Liquor Control Act in combination with our stock corporation law, where applicable. Despite All Brand\u2019s claims, we are not dealing with a nonassignable personal service contract<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on this appeal. We are concerned with a contract between two corporations, All Brand and Gallo, that has become automatically vested in Star under \u00a7 33-369 (c) because of the merger. Section 33-369 (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>provides in part that \u201c[u]pon the effectiveness of a merger . . . (c) The surviving or new corporation shall thereupon and thereafter . . . possess all the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises, as well of a public as of a private nature, of each of the merging . . . corporations; and all property, real, personal and mixed . . . and all other choses in action, and all and every other interest ... of or belonging . . . to each of the corporations so merged . . . shall be taken and transferred to and vested in such single corporation without further act or deed . . . .\u2019\u2019Thislan-guage is to be construed broadly.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such a construction finds support in the Model Business Corporation Act. Section 11.06 (a) (2) of the Model Act provides that when a merger takes effect, \u201cthe title to all real estate and other property owned by each corporation party to the merger is <em>vested </em>in the surviving corporation without reversion or impairment . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) 3 Model Business Corporation Act Annotated (3d Ed.) pp. 1286-86.1. The annotation to this section of the act includes the following: \u201cThe language of section 11.06 (a) should be construed broadly; for example, the reference to \u2018all real estate and other property\u2019 in section 11.06 (a) (2) is intended to include the property referred to in all of the following clauses in section 76 of the 1969 Model Act: \u2018all the rights, privileges, immunities, and franchises, of a public as well as of a private nature,\u2019 and \u2018all property, real, personal, and mixed . . . and all other choses in action, and all and every other interest of or belonging to or due to\u2019 the corporations party to the merger.\u201d Id., pp. 1288-89. The general rule appears to be that, under merger statutes, the rights, powers, privileges and immunities of the terminating corporations pass to the surviving cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>porations, unless there is some provision to the contrary by constitutional or statutory provision or some limitation in the charter of the surviving corporation or in the agreement of consolidation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or merger.

Sup. 176, 189, 233 A.2d 5 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The plain language of \u00a7 33-369 (c) serves to provide that All Brand\u2019s 1979 appointment of Gallo as a distributor passed to Star as the surviving corporation upon the merger. It passed to Star not by the voluntary action of the parties but by virtue of the merger under this statute. In a word, Star acquired it by operation of law. \u201c \u2018Operation of law\u2019 is a generic term or phrase commonly used to express the manner in which rights (and/or liabilities) attach to a person by the \u2018mere application to the particular transaction of the established rules of law, without the act or cooperation\u2019 of that person. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4 ed).\u201d <em>Pioneer National Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Child, Inc., </em>401 A.2d 68, 70 (Del. 1979). \u201cRunning through all of the definitions and cases on the subject is a common thread that operation of law means the practical effect of what the law is intended to be on the subject.\u201d <em>American Bitumuls &amp; Asphalt Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>146 F. Sup. 703, 714 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(Customs Court 1956). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seattle-First National Bank, </em>321 U.S. 583, 587-88, 64 S. Ct. 713, 88 L. Ed. 944 (1944), the court said: \u201cWe must look only to the immediate mechanism by which the transfer is made effective. If that mechanism is entirely statutory, effecting an automatic transfer without any voluntary action by the parties, then the transfer may truly be said to be \u2018wholly by operation of law.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Seattle-First National Bank, </em>the court, construing the federal banking statute, therefore held that the transfer of securities from a state bank to a consolidated bank occurred automatically by reason of the consolidation and was, accordingly, by \u201coperation of law.\u201d The \u201coperation\u201d or impact of \u00a7 33-369 (c) upon the merger in this case passed Gallo\u2019s distribution rights to Star as the surviving corporation. Nothing more was necessary because, upon merger, that right was <em>\u201ctaken </em>and <em>transferred </em>to and <em>vested </em>in [Star] . . . without further act or deed . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 33-369 (c). Applicable here is the normal sense of the term \u201cvest,\u201d which indicates a present and immediate interest as distinguished from one which is contingent. 92 C.J.S. 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Pursuant to the statutory command of \u00a7 33-369 (c), the merger, by operation of law, vested in Star the rights that Gallo had previously enjoyed as All Brand\u2019s distributor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That appointment of Gallo did not, as All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Brand claims, cease to exist upon the merger.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No authority from All Brand was required, as claimed, to appoint Star as distributor because the merger statute vested Star with the distribution rights of Gallo.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Again, it is important to remember that All Brand is not without recourse in its argument that it never selected Star as a distributor, but rather had chosen Gallo. All Brand still has the statutory right to seek to terminate a distributorship or diminish its geographic territory by prevailing in a hearing conducted by the department where it demonstrates that \u201cjust and sufficient cause exists\u201d for doing so. General Statutes \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2). It is true that the department, in its declaratory ruling, did say \u201ca \u2018merger\u2019 <em>in and of itself, </em>does not create \u2018just and sufficient cause\u2019 for a termination of a distributorship\u201d and that the trial court indicated that merger did not establish \u201cjust and sufficient cause.\u201d We do not, however, understand either statement as having been intended to preclude All Brand, quite apart from the merger, from proceeding in a \u201cjust and sufficient cause\u201d hearing under \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2). In other words, just because the merger itself was not \u201cjust and sufficient cause\u201d under \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2), that is not to say that other circumstances might not constitute \u201cjust and sufficient cause\u201d in favor of All Brand. We note that \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2) provides that \u201c[f]or the purposes of this section, \u2018just and sufficient cause\u2019 means the existence of circumstances which, in the opinion of a reasonable person considering all of the equities of both the wholesaler and the manufacturer or out-of-state shipper warrants a termination or a diminishment of a distributorship as the case may be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">All Brand further claims that, as the result of \u201cautomatic vesting,\u201d its substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment have been violated. It asserts that the interpretation of \u00a7 33-369 (c), as applied to All Brand, forces it into a new contract with a distributor, i.e., Star, that it had not selected. This result, All Brand contends, is in violation of the fourteenth amendment, which protects the right to contract from \u201carbitrary or irrational legislative actions.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Long ago, in discussing business rights ip an economic context, the United States Supreme Court noted that \u201csubject only to constitutional restraint the private right must yield to the public need . . .

We acknowledge that All Brand\u2019s appointment contract with Gallo is a property right. All Brand, nevertheless, must acknowledge that it is also well settled that the state may, in the exercise of its powers, limit the freedom to contract where the health, safety, morals and well-being of those subject to its jurisdiction require and \u201c \u2018neither the \u201ccontract\u201d clause nor the \u201cdue process\u201d clause has the effect of overriding the power of the state to establish all regulations that are reasonably necessary to secure the health, safety, good order, comfort, or general welfare of the community . . . and that all contract and property rights are held subject to its fair exercise.\u2019 <em>Atlantic Coast Line R.

Moreover, much of the activity in this \u201cheavily regulated business\u201d is conducted by corporations, domestic or foreign, and our statutes specifically provide for mergers of corporations. It is evident that the department is constantly dealing with corporations in its regulation of the industry and this invokes the law of stock corporations, including their creation, continuance and termination, as that law appears in chapter 599 of the General Statutes. The statute that governs merger of stock corporations is found in \u00a7 33-369 of that chapter and it is to that statute that the department had to turn in this case. The merger statute and the Stock Corporation Act in chapter 599 contain no exemption for stock corporations that are engaged in the liquor business. In this case the department was required to interpret and apply this statute, concededly outside the Liquor Control Act. That merger statute directly affects its regulation of the industry where the principal actors have chosen, as here, to do business in the corporate form. The department\u2019s interpretation and application of \u00a7 33-369 (c), with which we agree, was not unreasonable, arbitrary or irrational. In \u00a7 33-369 (c), the legislature has decided to permit the surviving corporation, by operation of law, to acquire the contract appointment of Gallo by All Brand as we have already pointed out. This permits the orderly flow of business in this industry where the corporate form is widely used. It does not emasculate the statutory scheme under the Liquor Control Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>as All Brand claims; the department\u2019s pervasive control, especially over whom it grants permits, enables it fully to maintain its power to regulate and carry out the legislative intent. The department\u2019s action in this matter thus had a rational basis in advancing the state\u2019s legitimate interest in controlling the industry as the legislature intended. We, therefore, conclude that All Brand\u2019s substantive due process rights were not violated as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Next, All Brand claims that its procedural due process rights were violated. In doing so, it claims that procedural due process in administrative proceedings may stem from two possible sources: the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution or the UAPA (General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.). In this regard, it maintains that if the department correctly interpreted \u00a7 33-369 (c), then its appointment contract with Gallo became automatically vested in Star without giving All Brand any notice or opportunity to be heard. This \u201cforced\u201d it into a contractual relationship with Star that All Brand had never intended. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u201cFor more than a century the central meaning of procedural due process has been clear: \u2018Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified.' ... It is equally fundamental that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard \u2018must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 [85 S.

It cannot be overlooked, however, that \u201c[procedural due process is not invoked by every government action affecting private interests.\u201d <em>Cervoni </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, </em>581 F.2d 1010, 1017 (1st Cir. 1978). In the circumstances of this case, All Brand has not proven that its appointment contract with Gallo, although a property right, is such as to invoke the procedural due process protections of the fourteenth amendment. Our reasoning above finding no constitutional infringement of All Brand\u2019s right to contract applies equally here. In addition, as noted earlier, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he Twenty-first Amendment grants the States virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.\u201d <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.

Sup. 476, 487 (D. Del. 1988). All Brand had no cognizable federal due process right to expect to be free from the operation and effect of our merger laws. See <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Greater Valley Terminal Corporation, </em>78 N.J. Super. 42,187 A.2d 374 (1963), affd, 83 N.J. Super. 120, 199 A.2d 48 (1964). It has even been said: \u201cOf course, the state, in the reasonable exercise of its police power, may frustrate even expectations that rise to the level of a property interest. See <em>Prune Yard Shopping Center </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>447 U.S. 74, 82, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 2041, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1980) . . . <em>Family Division Trial Lawyers </em>v. <em>Moultrie, </em>725 F.2d 695,706 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see <em>Schieffelin </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 181-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The liquor control department, operating as it does on corporations as well as individuals, was called upon, in this case, to review and approve or disapprove a stock transfer in the proposed merger between Gallo and Star. This obviously invoked the impact of our merger statute. It did this in a context where the department had the authority to review the stock transfer proposed and approve or disapprove the merger. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 30-6-A4 (a). No hearing was necessary on the merger itself and none was had, although a hearing seeking a declaratory ruling was later held on April 9, 1987. All Brand could not harbor any reasonable expectation to be free from mergers in this industry. One court has said: \u201cRather obviously, the facility of corporate mergers . . . provided by applicable statutes would be completely thwarted if the benefit of a merging corporation\u2019s . . . contracts were denied to the surviving corporation.\u201d <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Greater Valley Terminal Corporation, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>47. It is fair to say that the liquor control laws are to be enforced for the benefit of the public and not for the economic benefit of the plaintiff. See <em>Schieffelin </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 182-86; <em>Hartford Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>177 Conn. 616, 621-22, 419 A.2d 346 (1979). All Brand was not denied procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In addition, All Brand was not deprived of any procedural due process rights under the UAPA. On this branch of the claim, All Brand argues that when the department \u201capproved\u201d Star as an All Brand appointee it acted on a \u201clicense,\u201d as that is defined under the UAPA, General Statutes \u00a7 4-166, and, therefore, if the department correctly interpreted \u00a7 33-369 (c), All Brand was entitled to notice of the pending merger and an opportunity to be heard prior to the approval of the merger. The result of the merger, it goes on, was that its appointee and distribution network in Fairfield county were changed, its contract rights were accordingly affected and, therefore, it was entitled to notice of and a hearing on the proposed merger. It maintains that the rules for \u201ccontested cases\u201d under the UAPA apply to the hearing to which it alleges that it is entitled. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The provisions of the UAPA apply to the department of liquor control as it is an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of that term under the UAPA statute. General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (l).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> An \u201cagency\u201d is defined for the purposes of the UAPA as \u201ceach state board, commission, department or officer . . . authorized by law to make regulations or to determine contested cases . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (1). The UAPA requires that, in a \u201ccontested case, all parties shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-177 (a). The UAPA provides that a \u201c \u2018[contested case\u2019 means a proceeding, including but not restricted to rate-making, price fixing and licensing, in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2); <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Division of Special Revenue, </em>193 Conn. 379, 382, 477 A.2d 119 (1984); <em>Rybin-ski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 472-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">To qualify a proceeding as a \u201ccontested case\u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (2) and, thus, to be entitled to a \u201chearing,\u201d a party must have a statutory or regulatory right to be heard by the agency. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Division of Special Revenue, </em>supra, 383. There is no requirement that the department hold a hearing prior to a merger. All Brand had no statutory or regulatory right to a hearing prior to the merger as the proceeding was not a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the UAPA. This is so despite All Brand\u2019s argument that a \u201chearing\u201d was required because the department acted on a \u201clicense\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4-166 of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In advancing its \u201clicense\u201d claim, as the predicate to being entitled to a \u201chearing,\u201d All Brand specifically refers first to \u00a7 4-182 of the UAPA, which is entitled \u201cMatters involving licenses.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That section provides in part that \u201c[w]hen the grant, denial or renewal of a license is required to be preceded by notice and oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tunity for hearing, the provisions [of the UAPA] concerning contested cases apply.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (a). All Brand then turns to \u00a7 4-166 (3), which provides that the term \u201clicense\u201d includes \u201cthe whole or part of any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, or similar form of permission required by law . . . .\u201d Then, referring to General Statutes \u00a7 30-63 and the term \u201capproval\u201d in \u00a7 4-166 (3), it contends that because \u201c[a]ll appointments [of wholesale distributors] must be approved by the [department],\u201d such appointments are \u201clicenses\u201d and therefore a \u201chearing\u201d is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">An examination of \u00a7 30-63,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> however, discloses that it provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No holder of any manufacturer, wholesaler or out-of-state shipper\u2019s permit shall ship, transport or deliver within this state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>or sell or offer for sale, any alcoholic liquors unless . . . the name and address of each wholesaler per-mittee who is authorized by the manufacturer or his authorized representative to sell such alcoholic liquors are <em>registered </em>with the department of liquor control and until such brand, trade name or other distinctive characteristic has been <em>approved </em>by the department. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) This section requires, inter alia, that, in order to \u201cship, transport or deliver [alcoholic liquors] within this state\u201d a manufacturer or out-of-state shipper must authorize a wholesale permit-tee in Connecticut to sell the liquor it is shipping, transporting or delivering. This section further requires that the names and addresses of these wholesale permittees be \u201cregistered\u201d with the department; other matters such as brands, trade names, etc., have to be \u201capproved\u201d by the department. There is no requirement that appointment of a Connecticut wholesaler, designated as a distributor by a manufacturer or an out-of-state shipper, must be \u201capproved\u201d by the department as All Brand claims. The appointment of a Connecticut wholesaler as a distributor is not the subject of an \u201cagency permit, certificate, approval, registration\u201d issued by the department; it is a private contractual arrangement between the manufacturer or out-of-state shipper and a Connecticut wholesaler. The department, we were told at oral argument, apparently has very little to do with the creation of that relationship in a given case except to document it, although later it will enforce whatever rights flow from it under the applicable law. That contractual relationship, as we have demonstrated, is subject to the impact upon it of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Connecticut law which in this case is found not only in the Liquor Control Act<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but also in our stock corporation statutory scheme. This arrangement between a manufacturer or out-of-state shipper and a Connecticut wholesaler does not involve a \u201clicense\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 (4) and 4-182 as claimed. All Brand\u2019s permit from the department to operate as an out-of-state shipper (or manufacturer) was not the focus of any \u201cgrant, denial or renewal\u201d under \u00a7 4-182 (a) and, therefore, the provisions of the UAPA concerning contested cases did not apply. None of All Brand\u2019s rights under the UAPA was violated. All Brand is not without recourse. It still may seek the \u201cjust and sufficient cause\u201d hearing provided under \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2) to seek the termination or diminution of Star\u2019s distributorship; that method is \u201ca legitimate method of structuring the state\u2019s liquor distribution system\u201d and \u201c[additionally, it serves the equally important purpose of preventing out-of-state shippers from dominating Connecticut wholesalers.\u201d <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor </em>Control, supra, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Finally, invoking \u201cplain error\u201d under Practice Book \u00a7 4185, All Brand contends that if the interpretation of \u00a7 33-369 (c) by the department and the trial court is correct, then \u201c[sjection 33-369 would be rendered unconstitutional\u201d because of the \u201canti-competitive effects of such an interpretation.\u201d In doing so, All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Brand invokes a statement in Burt\u2019s trial brief that that interpretation suggests an antitrust violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 et seq. Both the department and Star oppose this argument and we agree with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">There are a number of reasons justifying rejection of this argument. These include: It was not advanced during the declaratory ruling held by the department; there are no facts in the record respecting the impact of the department\u2019s ruling on competition; the department did not rule on that matter; and the appeal filed in the Superior Court in this case does not allege an antitrust ground as a basis for reversal of the department\u2019s decision. Moreover, to the extent that All Brand is here advancing this argument as a means for an enforcement action under \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act, it would appear that there is a lack of jurisdiction. State courts do not have jurisdiction over federal antitrust claims as they are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. <em>Marrese </em>v. <em>American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, </em>470 U.S. 373, 379-80, 105 S.

Jur. 2d, Corporations \u00a7 2629 (1989 Cum. Sup.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\"> All Brand argues that the department\u2019s interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 33-369 (c), which automatically vests Star with the distribution contract earlier given Gallo by All Brand, violates the department\u2019s own regulations that require that an appointment'once made by the out-of-state shipper (or manufacturer) be accepted and then approved by the department. Maintaining that this was not done in this case, All Brand contends that this contravenes our holding in <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>211 Conn. 51, 557 A.2d 1249 (1989). In <em>Gianetti, </em>the plaintiff physician had been denied reappointment to the staff of the defendant hospital. There, we said that a contractual relationship existed between the physician and the hospital because, in accepting his staff appointment, he agreed to abide by the hospital bylaws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and they, in turn, agreed to deal with him in accordance with their bylaws. In denying the plaintiff staff reappointment, the hospital did not abide by its bylaws as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>Gianetti </em>is inapposite. Unlike the case now before us which is an administrative appeal from the action of a state agency, <em>Gianetti </em>was not an administrative appeal but one seeking the determination of contractual rights between two private parties. In addition, unlike <em>Gianetti, </em>where the two principal parties to the contract were actively litigating their respective rights and duties under the contract, in this case the department is not a party to the appointment contract between All Brand and Gallo (now Star). All Brand\u2019s invocation of <em>Gianetti </em>must recognize that the automatic vesting in Star of Gallo\u2019s distribution appointment by All Brand was brought about by the impact of \u00a7 33-369 (c) upon the merger of Gallo and Star by operation of law and not departmental action. <em>Gianetti </em>does not aid the plaintiff in this case which still has recourse under General Statutes \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> All Brand also makes the claim that, in any event, Gallo \u201cvoluntarily released\u201d All Brand. We do not agree. After the merger, Star contacted the department concerning Star\u2019s belief that the merger automatically transferred the distribution rights of Gallo to Star pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-369 (c). The department indicated to Star that new appointment letters should be obtained in order to facilitate the protection to Star under the wholesaler distribution statute in General Statutes \u00a7 30-17 (a) (2) and that, for departmental record purposes, Star should obtain reappointments. To do this, Star communicated with All Brand that Gallo\u2019s appointment as a distributor would be released in exchange for the appointment of Star. A fair reading of the exhibits and the record would indicate that Gallo\u2019s \u201crelease\u201d of Star was \u201cconditional,\u201d as Star claims in its brief, in exchange for its appointment by All Brand as well as to satisfy departmental procedural requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\"> The Liquor Control Act requires that a person distributing liquor in Connecticut have a wholesaler\u2019s permit issued by the department.

State Agencies \u00a7 30-6-A4 (a); subject to the surrender of the permit of the terminating corporation, i.e., Gallo. Gallo did surrender its wholesaler permit. In the circumstances of this case, we see no problem with the automatic vesting upon merger in Star of Gallo\u2019s distribution rights under its appointment by All Brand. Under General Statutes \u00a7 33-369 (c), that Gallo appointment clearly fell within the \u201crights, privileges, immunities and franchises\u201d language of that statute that automatically vested, upon merger, in Star, as the surviving corporation, \u201cwithout further act or deed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b229-5\"> We will assume, arguendo, that the requisite state action is present in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\"> The Uniform Administrative Procedure Act applies to all agency proceedings not expressly exempted.
