As this court noted in the second appeal, <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 438-39, 497 A.2d 974 (1985), in May, 1974, the body of seventeen year old Jay Cunningham was found in a wooded area of Enfield. The chief medical examiner classified Cunningham\u2019s death as a homicide resulting from multiple stab wounds. More than seven years later, in December, 1981, Wilmer Paradise and Brian Ellis were arrested and charged with the crimes of murder, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, felony murder, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, and kidnapping, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2), in connection with Cunningham\u2019s death. One month after their arrest, the defendants moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that their prosecution was barred by General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 54-193,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which imposed a five year limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>on the prosecution of any crime for which \u201cthe punishment is or may be imprisonment in the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers.\u201d On March 29,1982, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions and the state appealed. This court found no error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 456 A.2d 305 (1983) <em>(Paradise I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">After the decision in <em>Paradise I, </em>the state, on April 11, 1983, rearrested Paradise and Ellis on charges of capital felony, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (5).* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Paradise and Ellis filed motions to dismiss, claiming, inter alia, that their prosecution was barred under the principles of res judicata. The trial court agreed and dismissed the indictments. The state appealed, and on September 10, 1985, this court held that the trial court had improperly applied the doctrine of res judicata and set aside the judgments of dismissal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">On October 25,1985, Paradise waived a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause in return for the state\u2019s agreement not to seek the death penalty. He entered a plea of not guilty and demanded a trial by jury. On June 8,1987, the state filed a substitute information, again charging him with the crime of capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (5). The trial began on that date before a jury of twelve, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>presided over by the Honorable Thomas H. Corrigan. On July 2, 1987, the jury found Paradise guilty as charged, and on September 3,1987, he received a sentence of twenty-five years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Paradise has now appealed to this court, arguing: (1) the dismissal of the charges initially brought against him on the grounds that they were barred by the statute of limitations renders his subsequent prosecution on a more severe charge for the same conduct viola-tive of the due process clauses of the United States and Connecticut constitutions;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) a new trial is required as a result of the state\u2019s misrepresentations concerning its sentencing recommendation for an accomplice witness, Brian Ellis; (3) the trial court erred in prohibiting him from inquiring into charges of misconduct leveled against a physician who testified as to the cause of the victim\u2019s death; and (4) the trial court erred in failing to ascertain on the record whether he had made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to testify on his own behalf. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">From the evidence revealed at trial the jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the evening of May 14, 1974, the defendant, Ellis, and David Worthington were driving around in a van when the defendant suggested that they go looking for Jay Cunningham because Cunningham owed him between $6000 and $7000 as a result of a drug deal. The trio found Cunningham standing outside the Scitico Shopping Center in Enfield. The defendant told Ellis and Worthington that if Cunningham did not have his money that \u201cwe\u2019re going to rough him up.\u201d Ellis, who was driving, stopped the van, and the defendant and Worthington got out. The defendant asked Cunningham if he had the money. When Cunningham said \u201cno,\u201d the defendant and Worthington grabbed him by his left arm and pushed him into the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>At the defendant\u2019s direction, Ellis pulled the van onto a dirt road in Enfield, and came to a stop by a gravel bank. The defendant, Worthington and Cunningham got out of the van. Ellis stayed behind the wheel and watched as Worthington punched Cunningham in the face. Cunningham fell down and Worthington kicked him three times in his midsection. As Cunningham was struggling to get back to his feet, the defendant pulled a knife and stabbed him. Cunningham screamed and fell back down and the defendant stabbed him again. Ellis then exited the van and approached Cunningham. Both Ellis and Worthington wanted to leave quickly. The defendant, however, told them that if either left he would tell the police that that person had killed Cunningham. The defendant then gave the knife to Wor-thington and insisted that he stab Cunningham. Worthington complied. The defendant then handed the knife to Ellis and made a similar demand, and Ellis stabbed Cunningham in the right side. Cunningham\u2019s body was found on May 31,1974, by a tobacco worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The defendant claims that the state\u2019s bringing the charge of capital felony against him, after the initial charges of murder, felony murder and kidnapping were dismissed on statute of limitations grounds, violated his due process rights under the United States and Connecticut constitutions. In particular, the defendant asserts that the state\u2019s bringing of the subsequent charge of capital felony constituted prosecutorial vindictiveness. We hold, however, that the defendant is precluded by the principles of res judicata, as enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>189 Conn. 416, 456 A.2d 279, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 124, 78 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1983), from bringing a prosecutorial vindictiveness claim in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The defendant in <em>Aillon </em>was charged with three murders. His first two trials on those charges had failed to result in the final judgment of either conviction or acquittal. Aillon claimed, for the second time, that a third trial would subject him to double jeopardy, in violation of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. This court held, however, that the rejection, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>182 Conn. 124, 438 A.2d 30 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1090, 101 S. Ct. 883, 66 L. Ed. 2d 817 (1981), of his first claim of double jeopardy, after the second trial, was res judicata with respect to his second double jeopardy claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 416, 420-23. The court noted: \u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, a former judgment on a claim, if rendered on the merits, is an absolute bar to a subsequent action on the same claim. A judgment is final not only as to every matter which was offered to sustain the claim, but also as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>County of Sac, </em>94 U.S. 351, 352-53, 24 L. Ed. 195 (1876); 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 19, 25; James &amp; Hazard, Civil Procedure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 11.3. . . . Whether two claims in a criminal case are the same for the purposes of res judicata should therefore be considered \u2018in a practical frame and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 416, 423-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Therefore, the principal question that the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 416, had to resolve was whether the defendant\u2019s latter claim of double jeopardy was sufficiently similar to his earlier double jeopardy claim to warrant the court\u2019s giving preclusive effect to the prior judgment. The court noted (pp. 426-27): \u201cThe defendant\u2019s previous double jeopardy claim had as a factual basis the first trial judge\u2019s improper contact with a juror. From that basis, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>defendant argued unsuccessfully that the first trial was the functional equivalent of a mistrial, and that two successive mistrials barred reprosecution. The present claim relies on precisely the same facts, sought to be supplemented with evidence purporting to show the judge\u2019s bad faith, to advance a legal argument only slightly different; i.e., that the judge\u2019s misconduct foreclosed the defendant\u2019s right to be judged by the first tribunal convened to judge him. This slight shift in evidentiary basis and substantive theory of law does not constitute a new claim. 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 25, comments b, d; accord <em>Steele </em>v. <em>United States No. 2, </em>267 U.S. 505, 507, 45 S. Ct. 417, 69 L. Ed. 761 (1924). That identical grounds for relief may be supported by different factual allegations or different legal arguments or couched in different language renders those grounds no less identical. <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 16, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 10 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1963).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The court\u2019s analysis in <em>Aillon </em>is directly on point in the instant case with respect to Paradise\u2019s claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness. In Paradise\u2019s second appeal, <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, he raised the issue of whether the principles of res judicata barred the state\u2019s charging him with capital felony, after its initial charges of murder, felony murder and kidnapping were dismissed on statute of limitations grounds. This court held that the dismissal of the initial charges did not bar the state\u2019s subsequent prosecution of Paradise on a charge of capital felony. Thus, the principal question in this case is whether Paradise\u2019s present claim of pros-ecutorial vindictiveness is sufficiently similar to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>earlier claim of res judicata to warrant this court\u2019s giving preclusive effect to the judgment in <em>Ellis. </em>We conclude that it is. Just as the defendant in <em>Aillon </em>raised two double jeopardy claims emanating from precisely the same facts, Paradise raises two due process claims stemming from precisely the same facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Although the doctrine of res judicata itself is not of constitutional dimensions; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>242 U.S. 85, 87-88, 37 S. Ct. 68, 61 L. Ed. 161 (1916); <em>Ellis </em>is a due process case. As this court noted in <em>Ellis: </em>\u201cWhere the double jeopardy clause is inapplicable, due process protects against vindictive or coercive use of the power to prosecute. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 372,102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982); <em>Blackledge </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 28-29, 94 S. Ct. 2098, 40 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1974).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 478. In simple terms, the issue in <em>Ellis </em>was whether the state could bring a subsequent prosecution that was based on the same evidence and conduct as the previous prosecution.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the underpinning of <em>Ellis </em>is clearly one of due process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Both the claim asserted by Paradise in <em>Ellis </em>and the claim asserted by him in the present case therefore, are ones of due process. Since both claims arise from the same factual and evidentiary foundation, the state\u2019s decision to bring a subsequent charge of capital felony against Paradise, we hold that Paradise\u2019s first due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>cess claim in <em>Ellis </em>is res judicata with respect to his due process claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness in the present case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Next, the defendant claims that a new trial is required as a result of the state\u2019s repeated misrepresentations concerning its sentencing recommendation for its key witness, Brian Ellis. We disagree. The defendant contends that the state\u2019s attorney did not accurately portray the nature of the bargain that his accomplice, Ellis, struck with the state. Paradise maintains that the prosecutor led the jury and the court to believe that Ellis\u2019 testimony would have no bearing on his sentence and then, at the time of Ellis\u2019 sentencing, requested the sentencing court to consider Ellis\u2019 testimony in imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In particular, on April 10, 1986, in relation to the charge of capital felony that was pending against him for his involvement in Cunningham\u2019s murder, Ellis entered a plea of nolo contendere to the crime of kidnapping in the second degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94. At that time, the state represented that \u201cwe intend to recommend at the time of sentencing a sentence to serve not less than seven years, nor more than fourteen years. Counsel has reserved his right to argue for the imposition of a lesser sentence.\u201d During Paradise\u2019s trial, the prosecutor then had the following colloquy with Ellis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201cQ. Do you have an understanding as to whether or not the State will make any recommendation with respect to your sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\u201cA. I hope so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">\u201cQ. And what is your understanding, Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">\u201cA. That if I testify, I can get a lower sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">\u201cQ. And what is the recommended sentence? What will the State recommend for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">\u201cA. Hopefully something lower than the sentence that I\u2019m getting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">\u201cQ. Which sentence are you going to get, Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">\u201cA. Seven to 14 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">\u201cQ. The sentence of not less than seven or more than 14 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">\u201cQ. To serve?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-16\">\u201cQ. And do you understand whether or not your attorney has the right to argue for a lesser sentence? Mr. Klein, here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-18\">\u201cQ. And can you tell us why you\u2019re testifying here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-19\">\u201cA. So that I hope that I do get a lesser sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-20\">\u201cQ. Now do you understand that the State is going to recommend a sentence of seven to 14 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-21\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-22\">\u201cQ. And your attorney has the right to argue for a lesser sentence, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\u201cQ. And do you understand that the State\u2019s recommendation is seven to 14 years, regardless of whether you testify today? You understand that, Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201cA. Yes, Your Honor; I mean, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\u201cQ. And that you\u2019re testifying today, are you, so that your attorney .may argue for a lesser sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Then, the same prosecutor who conducted this line of questioning with Ellis, stated the following at Ellis\u2019 sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: . . . [W]e ask the Court to\u2014 ah \u2014 I do feel that some mitigation of the seven to fourteen (7 to 14) would certainly be appropriate; and I think it\u2019s only appropriate, however, in cases where people come forward and actually testify. And, not so when people \u2018stonewall\u2019 and don\u2019t testify. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">\u201cThe Court: I would gather from that, if Mr. Ellis were here today pleading for the first time \u2014 after the testimony \u2014 that you would probably \u2014 your recomme-nation would have been lower than it was originally-knowing all the facts now. I recognize, in different words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: It\u2019s a difficult question to answer. I really can\u2019t answer it. All I can do is to urge the Court to give him some concrete consideration with respect to the \u2014 as against the cap which the State</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">\u201cThe Court: All right. I assume that you\u2019re urging that because you feel that\u2019s appropriate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">\u201c[State's Attorney]: I do it for two (2) reasons. First, I have a duty to; and second, I feel it\u2019s appropriate also. . . . [Everything he has done since the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the plea of no contest has been of assistance to the State; and I feel very strongly, that he should get the Court\u2019s consideration for what he\u2019s done because it has been difficult for him and helpful to the State.\u201d The court then stated: \u201cEssentially, I\u2019m going to give you [Ellis] the recommendation of the State \u2014 but it\u2019s not less than seven (7) or more than fourteen (14). . . . I\u2019m going to impose a sentence of not less than four and a half (4 1/2) years and no more than nine (9) years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The defendant claims that the state\u2019s effectively altering its sentencing recommendation for Ellis, after steadfastly representing at trial that it would not do so, constitutes constitutional error. The defendant maintains that two possibilities exist regarding the state\u2019s actions, both of which result in the defendant being deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial: (1) either there was a secret bargain and therefore Ellis understood at the time of the trial that the prosecutor would reward him for his testimony; or (2) Ellis was kept in the dark, and thus the prosecutor deceived the court, the jury and Ellis as to his true intentions regarding his sentencing recommendation for Ellis.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The defendant asserts that either scenario results in constitutional error under <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972), and <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217 (1959),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> since the knowing presentation of false evidence by the state is incompatible with the \u201c \u2018rudimentary demands of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 153, quoting <em>Mooney v. Holohan, </em>294 U.S. 103, 112, 55 S. Ct. 340, 79 L. Ed. 791 (1935). Furthermore, due process is similarly offended if the state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u201calthough not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.\u201d <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 269. If a government witness falsely denies having struck a bargain with the state, or substantially mischaracterizes the nature of the inducement, the state is obliged to correct the misconception. <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 269-70. \u201cRegardless of the lack of intent to lie on the part of the witness, <em>Giglio </em>and <em>Napue </em>require that the prosecutor apprise the court when he knows that his witness is giving testimony that is substantially misleading.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>498 F.2d 1164, 1169 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Young </em>v. <em>United States, </em>419 U.S. 1069, 95 S. Ct. 655, 42 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1974). \u201cA new trial is required if \u2018the false testimony could . . . in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u2019 <em>Napue </em>[v. Illinois], supra, 271.\u201d <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 154; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 678-80, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We conclude, however, that it is unnecessary to determine if either one of the defendant\u2019s factual scenarios is accurate. We hold that even if there were, as claimed by the defendant, a secret bargain or knowing misrepresentations by the state, a new trial would not be required because evidence of such would not \u201cin any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 271. In short, we conclude that the fact that the state altered its sentencing recommendation for Ellis, after it represented at trial that it would not, constitutes harmless error in this case for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">First and foremost is the fact that \u201c \u2018[t]he thrust of <em>Giglio </em>and its progeny [is] to ensure that the jury knows the facts that might motivate a witness in giving testimony . . . .\u2019 <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>715 F.2d 1459, 1467 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1003, 104 S. Ct. 510, 78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 699 (1983).\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>785 F.2d 1457, 1465 (11th Cir. 1986); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>830 F.2d 1574, 1578 (11th Cir. 1987), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 969, 108 S. Ct. 1243, 99 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1988). Therefore, the state\u2019s mitigation of its initial sentencing recommendation is of little or no import in this case because the jury was already apprised of Ellis\u2019 motivation for testifying. As noted, when asked at trial what his understanding was with the state regarding his sentencing recommendation, Ellis replied: \u201cThat if I testify, I can get a lower sentence. . . . Hopefully something lower than the sentence that I\u2019m getting.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]he jury actually learned the primary motivation behind [Ellis\u2019] testimony. This is all that <em>Giglio </em>requires.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>supra, 1579. Second, the jury was made well aware of the severity of the charge that Ellis originally faced, including the fact that by testifying he no longer faced the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Therefore, \u201cthe question is not whether the verdict might have been different without any of [Ellis\u2019] testimony, but whether the verdict might have been different if [Ellis\u2019] testimony were further impeached by disclosure of the [alleged] deal.\u201d <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>828 F.2d 656, 660 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1069, 108 S. Ct. 1035, 98 L. Ed. 2d 999 (1988). Given the multitude of evidence presented at trial concerning Ellis\u2019 motivation for testifying, any benefit that the defendant might have derived from the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>awareness of what the state was actually going to recommend at Ellis\u2019 sentencing hearing was minimal at best. Obviously, it would have been more forthright on the part of the state to admit during trial that it was going to ask the sentencing court to mitigate Ellis\u2019 sentence in consideration of his cooperation and testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial. The state\u2019s failure to do so. did not, however, in this case, deprive the defendant of a fair trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The defendant further argues that the trial court erred in prohibiting him from cross-examining a physician concerning charges of official misconduct that had been brought against him. Specifically, the state called Dr. Elliot Gross to testify as to the victim\u2019s cause of death. Gross, who at the time of the trial was the chief medical examiner of New York city, had been the chief medical examiner of Connecticut at the time of Cunningham\u2019s murder. Gross did not perform the autopsy on the victim\u2019s body, but reviewed several photographs of the body, the official autopsy report, a report of the doctor who went to the crime scene, as well as a summary of the report made by the Enfield police department. After reviewing these materials, Gross arrived at the conclusion that the victim\u2019s death was the result of multiple stab wounds to the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">During his cross-examination at trial, the defendant attempted to ask Gross about an \u201cinvestigation Mayor Koch and the governor conducted\u201d regarding him and the office that he headed, the New York city medical examiner\u2019s office. The state objected, and the jury was excused. The defendant explained that he wanted to conduct an inquiry into the investigation for \u201cimpeachment purposes to challenge [Gross\u2019] opinion as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>[expert].\u201d Although the defendant conceded that Gross had been exonerated of the \u201ccharges\u201d arising out of the investigation, he argued that \u201cdespite the fact that he\u2019s been exonerated, if there were specific examples or cases in which there may have been some small problems or something more than a small problem, I think I should be able to inquire as to those specific cases, to test his credibility, reliability as a[n] expert.\u201d After hearing argument, the court sustained the state\u2019s objection to the proposed cross-examination and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow his questioning of Gross regarding the investigation of him and his office constitutes reversible error both in terms of the common law of evidence and the confrontation clauses of the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not agree. The confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees an accused the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const., amend. VI. \u201c \u2018The main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974), quoting 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed. 1940) \u00a7 1395, p. 123. Nevertheless, \u201ctrial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevent.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986). \u201c[T]he defendants\u2019 right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses against them is not absolute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>but must, on occasion, bow to other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d <em>In re Robert H., </em>199 Conn. 693, 705, 509 A.2d 475 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In the present case, the trial court acted well within its discretion. First, Gross had been exonerated of all charges arising out of the investigation; thus, evidence pertaining to the investigation was of dubious value. Second, questions regarding Gross\u2019 conclusions in other cases would inevitably have led to a \u201cmini-trial\u201d of each of those cases. Even if the defendant were able to extract an admission of negligence from Gross, the weight to be given such an admission would not have been immediately apparent. In order for the jury to assess such an admission in weighing Gross\u2019 opinion in the present case, the jury would have had to have known, at a minimum, the circumstances of the other cases, the nature of the mistakes made in those cases, how they occurred, and what, if anything, about those cases made it more likely that Gross was mistaken in his opinion concerning the cause of Cunningham\u2019s death. It was, therefore, well within the discretion of the trial court to prohibit such a time-consuming and collateral inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to ascertain, on the record, whether he had made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to testify on his own behalf. We do not agree. The United States Supreme Court has explicitly confirmed that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to testify on their own behalf. <em>Rock </em>v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 51-53, 107 S. Ct. 2704, 97 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1987). The defendant argues that, as an incident to this right, the trial judge has an affirmative duty to canvass the defendant to ensure that his waiver of his right to testify is knowing, voluntary and intelli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>gent. We do not believe that federal law contains any such procedural requirement in a case such as this where the defendant has not alleged that he wanted to testify or that he did not know that he could testify. See <em>Siciliano </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>834 F.2d 29, 30 (1st Cir. 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bernloehr, </em>833 F.2d 749, 751-52 (8th Cir. 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Janoe, </em>720 F.2d 1156, 1161 (10th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1036, 104 S. Ct. 1310, 79 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1984); but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>681 P.2d 504, 512-13 (Colo. 1984). As the First Circuit Court of Appeals stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Systems Architects, Inc., </em>757 F.2d 373, 375 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 847, 106 S. Ct. 139, 88 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1985): \u201cThe accused must act affirmatively. While the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment may be understood to grant the accused the right to testify, the \u2018if\u2019 and \u2018when\u2019 of whether the accused will testify is primarily a matter of trial strategy to be decided between the defendant and his attorney.\u201d Accordingly, we find that the trial judge had no duty to canvass the defendant in this case regarding his waiver of his right to testify on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1975)] Sec. 54-193. limitation of prosecutions for various offenses.

Such a result is unconstitutional. <em>Due process </em>forbids punishing criminal defendants for the exercise of constitutional or statutory rights.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b415-12\"> In fact, defense counsel admitted to such at oral argument, stating: \u201cThere was a due process claim pursued in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis </em>[197 Conn. 436, 497 A.2d 974 (1985)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> In addition, Paradise has not asserted a valid reason as to .why he could not have brought his present due process claim in his appeal in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 497 A.2d 974 (1985), especially since Paradise did bring a cross appeal in <em>Ellis </em>on another issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Furthermore, although the issue of prosecutorial vindictiveness was not the principal issue before the court in <em>Ellis, </em>the court noted: \u201cThe defendants do not contend, nor do we find, that the state reinitiated prosecution in this case for other than constitutionally legitimate reasons.\u201d Id., 477-78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b419-7\"> The defendant also argues that it would be appropriate for this court to invoke its inherent supervisory power to set aside his conviction pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>193 Conn. 474,499-500, 479 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990, 105 S.

For example, defense counsel asked Ellis if his memory of the events surrounding Cunningham\u2019s death had improved so that he could take advantage of the plea bargain offered by the state. At another juncture, Ellis admitted that he would choose freedom over going to jail, and that in order to get his freedom he had to testify.
