(NELCO), in conjunction with a claim for a real estate commission. We find error and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The trial court, <em>Fuller, J., </em>found that the evidence offered by NELCO at the hearing on DeMarkey\u2019s motion was \u201cbasically uncontested.\u201d NELCO is a real estate brokerage company with an office in Greenwich. One of its employees is George N. Bagley, a licensed Connecticut real estate broker. On September 22,1986, the defendants, William DeMarkey, Jr., and Connecticut Bank and Trust Company (CBT), were owners of real property located at 177 West Putnam Avenue in Greenwich. NELCO, acting through Bagley as its agent, on September 22, 1986, procured a written agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with DeMarkey and CBT that gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>NELCO the exclusive right to sell the Greenwich property and the exclusive right to sublease all or part of it. The agreement extended from September 22,1986, to \u201cMarch 23, 1987 and thereafter, until terminated by either party giving to the other 30 days prior notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>in writing.\u201d In the agreement, the defendants agreed to pay NELCO a commission based on the rental price or gross sales price as provided in a schedule attached to the agreement and designated in the agreement as Appendix A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The agreement provided for a sales commission of 6 percent of the property\u2019s sale price. If the property were sold or leased by a broker not employed by NELCO, however, the defendants agreed to pay a commission to NELCO of one and one-half times the commission stated in Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">In addition, on March 5, 1987, NELCO and the defendants signed a modification<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the September 22, 1986 agreement, extending it to September 30, 1987, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>and specifically stating that all other provisions of the agreement remained unaltered and in full effect. On March 23, 1988, a letter,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> signed by an agent of NELCO and by DeMarkey, referenced the prior agreement and provided for a $30,000 payment to NELCO for providing two tenants for the building on the property. The letter specifically stated that it was intended \u201cto confirm that except as modified hereby our original Exclusive Listing Agreement is still in full force and effect.\u201d CBT, however, did not sign this letter. Futhermore, no written notice was given that the termination date of the original agreement, March 23, 1987, had passed, and that the termination date of the modification agreement, September 30,1987, had also passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">On April 6,1988, NELCO entered into a co-brokerage agreement regarding the property with two licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Connecticut real estate brokers, Marjorie Rowe and Benjamin Rowe. The defendants also received from the Rowes an offer to buy the property. The next day, April 7,1988, the Rowes agreed to purchase the property from the defendants for $1,800,000, and during the summer of 1988, the defendants sold the property to the Rowes for that price. The defendants refused, however, to pay NELCO any sales commission. In addition, DeMarkey also failed to pay the $30,000 provided in the agreement between himself and NELCO in the letter dated March 23, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">NELCO then commenced this action against the defendants. NELCO\u2019s complaint was in two counts. The first count sought recovery of the sales commission ($162,000)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the second count sought recovery of the $30,000 that NELCO claimed DeMarkey owed it as a result of their letter agreement. NELCO obtained a prejudgment remedy for $192,000 against DeMarkey\u2019s interest in property that he owned in Greenwich. DeMarkey moved to discharge the prejudgment real estate attachment, claiming that there were several defenses to NELCO\u2019s commission claim, most of them based on alleged noncompliance with the real estate listing statute, \u00a7 20-325a<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>utes. The court, <em>Fuller, J., </em>however, denied the motion. DeMarkey appealed to the Appellate Court and pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, we transferred the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">On appeal, DeMarkey claims that the court, <em>Fuller, J., </em>erred: (1) in finding probable cause that a listing complies with General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a, despite its failure to include a notice of negotiability mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 20-325b;* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) in utilizing the provisions of a termination clause in a listing, which violates General Statutes \u00a7 20-320 (6),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to extend the duration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>of the listing to encompass the services performed by the broker for which it seeks to collect a commission; (3) in finding probable cause that a listing failing to state the listed price of the property was enforceable; and (4) in concluding that there is probable cause to recover a real estate commission under the second count to the complaint because the listing agreement fails to contain the notice of negotiability mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 20-325b and, does not include a leasing price.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Because DeMarkey has appealed, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-2781, </em>from an adverse ruling on his motion to dissolve or vacate a prejudgment remedy order, we first must determine the scope of our review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cWe have recently examined the trial court\u2019s function in considering an application for prejudgment remedy of attachment: \u2018The language of our prejudgment remedy statutes; General Statutes \u00a7 52-278a et <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>seq.; requires that the court determine \u201cwhether or not there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d (a); that is to say \u201cprobable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c (a) (2). \u201cThe legal idea of probable cause is a <em>bona fide </em>belief in the existence of the facts essential under the law for the action and such as would warrant a man of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment, under the circumstances, in entertaining it.\u201d <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Toomey, </em>52 Conn. 35, 36 (1884). Probable cause is a flexible common sense standard. It does not demand that a belief be correct or more likely true than false. <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 103 S. Ct. 1535, 75 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1983). The hearing in probable cause for the issuance of a prejudgment remedy is not contemplated to be a full scale trial on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The plaintiff does not have to establish that he will prevail, only that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the claim. <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>172 Conn. 577, 584, 376 A.2d 60 (1977). The court\u2019s role in such a hearing is to determine probable success by weighing probabilities. <em>Michael Papa Associates </em>v. <em>Julian, </em>178 Conn. 446, 447, 423 A.2d 105 (1979).\u2019 <em>Three S. Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>193 Conn. 174, 175-76, 474 A.2d 795 (1984); see also <em>Babiarz </em>v. <em>Hartford Special, Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 388, 393, 480 A.2d 561 (1984).\u201d <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>196 Conn. 359, 362-63, 493 A.2d 193 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">As for our standard of review, we have stated: \u201cThis court\u2019s role on review of the granting of a prejudgment remedy is very circumscribed.\u201d <em>Three S. Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>supra, 176. In its determination of probable cause, \u201cthe trial court is vested with broad discretion which is not to be overruled in the absence of clear error. <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>173 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>426, 429, 378 A.2d 538 (1977).\u201d Id. \u201cSince <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>supra, we have consistently enunciated our standard of review in these matters. \u2018 \u201cIn the absence of clear error, this court should not overrule the thoughtful decision of the trial court, which has had an opportunity to assess the legal issues which may be raised and to weigh the credibility of at least some of the witnesses.\u201d \u2019 <em>Three S. Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>supra; <em>William M. Raveis &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>[186 Conn. 329, 333, 441 A.2d 200 (1982)]; <em>Babiarz </em>v. <em>Hartford Special, Inc., </em>supra, 392-94; see also <em>Michael Papa Associates </em>v. <em>Julian, </em>supra, 447. At this time, therefore, we need only decide whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions were reasonable under the \u2018clear error\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>supra, 364. Accordingly, we conclude that our standard of review is to determine if the trial court\u2019s denial of DeMarkey\u2019s motion constituted clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The gravamen of DeMarkey\u2019s claims is that \u201cthe Listing under which [NELCO] seeks to collect a commission fails to include two essential conditions: the statutory notice of negotiability mandated by . . . \u00a7 20-325b and, a listing price.\u201d We will consider these claims in the reverse order stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b) a real estate broker cannot bring an action for a real estate commission unless his \u201cacts or services were rendered pursuant to a contract or authorization from the person for whom such acts were done or services rendered. To satisfy the requirements of this subsection any such contract or authorization shall . . . (4) contain the conditions of such contract or authorization . . . . \u201d In <em>Storm Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baumgold, </em>186 Conn. 237, 244, 440 A.2d 302 (1982), we considered the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>ments of a listing contract under \u00a7 20-325a (b) (4) in conjunction with our discussion of the requirements of a sales contract, and we stated: \u201cIts [General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b) (4)] commandment that the written listing contract contain \u2018the conditions of such contract or authorization\u2019 refers to the conditions of the listing contract and not to those of the sales contract. For the listing contract, it suffices to identify the property being offered for sale and <em>the price at which it is to be listed. </em>See <em>Brazo </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>[177 Conn. 515, 522, 418 A.2d 883 (1979)].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In this case, the trial court, <em>Fuller, J., </em>expressly found that the listing agreement did not contain the price at which the property was to be offered for sale. The trial court, however, did not view the absence of a stated price in the listing as invalidating the listing agreement pursuant to \u00a7 20-325a (b) (4). Rather, the trial court concluded that, even though the listing agreement did not contain a specific price for a sale or lease of the property, the agreement could \u201carguably be construed as meaning any price at which the owner agrees to sell or lease the property, i.e., at a price subject to the owner\u2019s approval, as opposed to a price set in advance.\u201d The trial court failed to point to any language in the listing agreement that permits such a construction. In support of its construction, however, the trial court cited <em>Sticklor </em>v. <em>Woodland House Condominium, Inc., </em>9 Conn. App. 293, 518 A.2d 949 (1986), cert. denied, 202 Conn. 807, 520 A.2d 1288 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In <em>Sticklor, </em>the Appellate Court held enforceable a listing agreement that failed to include the sale price of the property. In so doing, the Appellate Court concluded that, under the particular facts of that case, \u00a7 20-325a (b) (4) did not require that the price be included under the listing agreement Id., 294. We express no opinion concerning the holding in <em>Sticklor, </em>but note that the facts of the instant case distinguish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>it from <em>Sticklor. </em>In <em>Sticklor, </em>the \u201cproperty was a 237 unit condominium complex and the broker\u2019s primary obligation was to find potential buyers for the seller rather than to sell the units himself.\u201d Id., 297. From these facts, the Appellate Court concluded that it was apparent that the seller \u201cwas reserving to itself the right to determine which unit it was willing to sell and the price it would accept for any given unit.\u201d Id. This case is devoid of any facts indicating any reservation to the seller to determine the sale price of the property. We therefore adhere to our construction of \u00a7 20-325a (b) (4), as set forth in <em>Storm Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baumgold, </em>supra, that the listing contract must identify a particular price at which the property is offered for sale, or at least provide a formula by which the price may be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Furthermore, although the granting or denial of a prejudgment remedy involves ordinarily a factual determination, in this action, that factual determination in turn furnishes the predicate for the determination of the legal issue, i.e., whether the listing agreement complies with \u00a7 20-325a (b). Whether a particular listing agreement complies with \u00a7 20-325a (b) is a question of law. Moreover, our attention has not been directed to any statutory or case law requiring the legal defense asserted in this case to be postponed for consideration until trial. We are persuaded, therefore, that, where the pleadings and exhibits are the only evidentiary concerns, the dictates of judicial economy instruct us to resolve the legal validity of a particular agreement, under an applicable statute at the earliest time practicable. Accordingly, since the trial court made a finding of fact that the listing agreement did not contain a price for the sale of the defendants\u2019 property, we conclude that the listing agreement as a matter of law fails to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) (4) of the General Statutes. See <em>Storm Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baumgold, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Because the listing agreement in this case is unenforceable, it was clear error for the trial court to deny DeMarkey\u2019s motion to dissolve or vacate the prejudgment remedy placed against his property in Greenwich.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Returning to the first claim of DeMarkey, that the listing agreement failed to include the essential condition of the statutory notice of negotiability mandated by \u00a7 20-325b of the General Statutes, the trial court found that \u201c[t]he listing here and any extension of it did not meet this [\u00a7 20-325b] requirement.\u201d The trial court in its memorandum of decision referred to two Superior Court cases<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> concerning the negotiability issue but, the court refused nonetheless to hold that as a matter of law a listing agreement that failed to comply with \u00a7 20-325b precluded granting a prejudg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ment remedy based on the agreement. Because of our disposition of the issue regarding the listing agreement\u2019s failure to contain the property\u2019s sale price as required by \u00a7 20-325a (b) (4), it is unnecessary for us to decide DeMarkey\u2019s negotiability claim. For the same reason, it is not necessary for us to determine the validity of the listing agreement\u2019s automatic extension provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Finally, the $30,000 indebtedness alleged in count two of the complaint cannot support a prejudgment remedy since this debt is based on the modification of the listing agreement that we have concluded will not justify the granting of a prejudgment remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">There is error in denying DeMarkey\u2019s motion to dissolve or vacate the prejudgment real estate attachment and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Healey and Hull, Js., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Covello, J., dissenting.

In this case, DeMarkey moved to dissolve and a hearing was held at which he appeared and was heard. Thus, this appeal presents no constitutional problem. See <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F.

Healey, J.), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 13 Conn. App. 527, 537 A.2d 1036, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 809, 541 A.2d 1238 (1988), and <em>T. R. Preston Co. </em>v. <em>Pasay, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Wind-ham, Docket No. CV 840028111S (January 23,1985) (Noren, J.). The trial court stated: \u201cWhile the Superior Court decisions referred to indicate that noncompliance with the notice requirement in [General Statutes] \u00a7 20-325b precludes an action to recover a broker\u2019s commission under [General Statutes] \u00a7 20-325a (b) and it may be a valid defense at a trial on the merits, in the absence of a higher court decision this court cannot decide that it is a sufficiently clear legal defense to deny the [plaintiff] a [prejudgment remedy]. It is also recognized that there are numerous cases holding that the listing agreement must strictly comply with \u00a7 20-325a (b) in order for a real estate broker to recover a commission. See <em>Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>17 Conn. App. 294, 305 [552 A.2d 827 (1989)]; <em>Revere Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cerato, </em>186 Conn. 74, 77 [438 A.2d 1202 (1982)]; <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>184 Conn. 228, 229, 230 [439 A.2d 946 (1981)]; <em>Hossan </em>v. <em>Hudiakoff, </em>178 Conn. 381, 383 [423 A.2d 108 (1979)]; <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>[189 Conn. 52, 55, 453 A.2d 771 (1983)]; <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Schweir, </em>[7 Conn.
