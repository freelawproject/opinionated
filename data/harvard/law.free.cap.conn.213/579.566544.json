Following a jury trial, he was convicted of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten nor more than twenty years. On the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of conviction, the Appellate Court determined that the trial court had committed reversible error in two respects: (1) in refusing to instruct the jury that the defense of self-defense was applicable to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree; and (2) in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of criminally negligent homicide. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>17 Conn. App. 502, 554 A.2d 746 (1989). The state, after this court had granted certification,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealed from the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment reversing the judgment of the trial court. We conclude that the trial court did err in refusing to instruct the jury that the defense of self-defense was applicable to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree, but we determine that this error was harmless in nature. We also conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of criminally negligent homicide. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Although the facts that the jury could reasonably have found are set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, we summarize those pertinent to the issues in this appeal. On January 27,1981, at approximately 10 p.m., the defendant entered the VIP Lounge on Albany Avenue in Hartford. Soon thereafter he engaged in an argument with another patron in the bar, James Robinson. The argument escalated into a physical confrontation and eventually moved from inside the bar to the sidewalk in front of the bar. Almost immediately after the fight had moved outside, the defendant fired six rapid-fire gunshots into Robinson. No evidence was presented as to which of the shots were the fatal ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The defendant testified in his defense and narrated his version of the events that had occurred before, during, and after the shooting. He admitted that he had shot the victim several times from a distance of two to three feet, but claimed that he had done so in self-defense. According to the defendant, he and Robinson had been at an illegal gambling game across the street from the VIP Lounge prior to the shooting incident. The defendant had won money at the game, but Robinson had lost, prompting Robinson to ask the defendant for a loan. The defendant did not comply with Robinson\u2019s request, and, consequently, when the two men were later at the VIP Lounge, Robinson provoked an argument. The argument escalated into a physical confrontation when Robinson jumped on the defendant and cut him with a knife. The two men then fought their way to the exterior doors of the bar through which Robinson exited. The defendant followed Robinson outside and immediately realized that Robinson was pointing a gun at him. The defendant, having witnessed Robinson\u2019s violent tendencies on a prior occasion, testified that he was fearful for his life. Thus, in an effort to protect himself, he quickly pulled out his gun and started firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The first issue presented by this appeal is whether the Appellate Court erred in concluding that the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that self-defense was an applicable defense to manslaughter in the second degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> constituted reversible error. The trial court instructed the jury on the charged offense of murder and on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first degree and manslaughter in the second degree. The trial court also charged the jury on the law of self-defense; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but specifically instructed, contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>to the defendant\u2019s timely request to charge, that self-defense was applicable only to murder and manslaughter in the first degree and was not to be considered with respect to manslaughter in the second degree. The Appellate Court determined that the trial court\u2019s instruction constituted reversible error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 510-15. The state argues that the holding of the Appellate Court is erroneous in that: (1) the definitions of self-defense and manslaughter in the second degree are mutually incompatible, thus the trial court\u2019s instruction was not error; or in the alternative that (2) even if the instruction was error, it was harmless in nature. We are persuaded by the latter argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The state first claims error in the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense with respect to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree. The state bases its claim on the contention that the definitions of self-defense and manslaughter in the second degree are mutually incompatible, i.e., if the state proves the elements of manslaughter in the second degree beyond a reasonable doubt, it will necessarily have negated the defense of self-defense. Accordingly, the state argues, a trial court need only instruct the jury as to the elements of manslaughter in the second degree and may omit any specific reference to the theory of self-defense. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The Appellate Court focused on the \u201cdifficulty a jury has in weighing the justifiability of risk and action inherent in the crime of manslaughter in the second degree and the concept of self-defense\u201d in resolving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the claim now before us: \u201c[I]n matters involving such esoteric concepts, the jury should have the benefit of as much information and instruction as will aid them in arriving at a just verdict. . . . We conclude, therefore, that the trial court should have instructed the jury on self-defense with respect to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We agree with the Appellate Court that, where the evidence warrants, the trial court must instruct the jury on self-defense in cases involving the charge of manslaughter in the second degree. We find further support for our holding in an important distinction between self-defense and manslaughter in the second degree. The statutory definitions of self-defense and manslaughter in the second degree reveal this distinction. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19, in subsection (a), provides that, subject to the exceptions in subsections (b) and (c), <em>\u201ca </em>person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself . . . from what <em>he </em>reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force, and he may use such degree of force which <em>he </em>reasonably believes to be necessary for such purpose . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: (1) He recklessly causes the death of another person . . . <em>\u201cA </em>person acts \u2018recklessly\u2019 with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>regards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. <em>The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\u201c \u2018[General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19] focuses on the person . . ; claiming self-defense. It focuses on what <em>he </em>reasonably believes under the circumstances and presents a question of fact.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 389, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982). Self-defense thus requires the trier of fact to measure the justifiability of the defendant\u2019s actions from a subjective perspective.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Manslaughter in the second degree, on the other hand, requires the trier of fact to view the justifiability of the defendant\u2019s risk and action from the objective perspective of a reasonable person. It is this distinction that allows self-defense to be an applicable defense to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1). Conduct may be a \u201cgross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13); but, at the same time, may be wholly justified if the defendant\u2019s beliefs are reasonable from the perspective of that defendant. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense with respect to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree, and that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give such an instruction was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Having found error in the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must address the state\u2019s alternative claim that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless. \u201cWe have said that \u2018[a] fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 83, 355 A.2d 6 (1974).\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 660, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 660-61, 443 A.2d 906 (1982). This fundamental constitutional right includes proper jury instructions on self-defense as defined by \u00a7 53a-19. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 388; <em>States. Corchado, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra. \u201cThe standard of review to be applied on this constitutional claim is whether \u2018 \u201cit is reasonably possible that the jury were misled.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra. \u2018 \u201cThe charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in \u2018artificial isolation\u2019 from the overall charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 305, 386 A.2d 243 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmquist, </em>173 Conn. 140, 151, 376 A.2d 1111, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 306, 54 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1977). The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>173 Conn. 35, 40, 376 A.2d 391 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullings, </em>166 Conn. 268, 274-75, 348 A.2d 645 (1974).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Estep, </em>186 Conn. 648, 652, 443 A.2d 483 (1982).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Maturo, </em>188 Conn. 591, 599, 452 A.2d 642 (1982); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 660-61.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The majority of the Appellate Court rejected the state\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on self-defense with respect to manslaughter in the second degree was harmless error. As authority for its holding, the Appellate Court relied on our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>decision <em>in State </em>v. <em>Monte, </em>131 Conn. 134, 137, 38 A.2d 434 (1944), in which we held that the refusal to charge on a lesser included offense cannot be held harmless merely because the defendant was convicted of a greater offense. The Appellate Court reasoned as follows: \u201cBecause it is settled that a jury should be given the entire range of possible verdicts in a case in which the evidence warrants the giving of the lesser included offenses, it follows that defenses that are supported by a reasonable construction of the evidence should be given along with those same lesser charges. We are not persuaded by the argument that, in cases in which the defendant is convicted of the greater offense, the failure to give warranted instructions on the lesser included offenses is not harmless, while the failure to give similarly warranted instructions on corresponding defenses is harmless.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 514-15. Judge Stoughton dissented with respect to the majority\u2019s resolution of this issue. Id., 523-24. We embrace the view expressed in his dissent and hold that <em>Monte </em>does not compel the conclusion that, under the facts here presented, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on self-defense with respect to manslaughter in the second degree was harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">This court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Monte, </em>supra, 136, recognized that jury verdicts are often the product of \u201copen-minded discussion and an honest weighing of the opinion of others.\u201d Consequently, we held that a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on warranted lesser included offenses cannot be held harmless merely because the defendant was convicted of a greater offense: \u201c[T]he situation presented where the alternative is between finding a defendant guilty as charged or not guilty may be quite different from one where, under the charge of the court, they have the further choice of finding him guilty of some lesser offense embraced within the information. From the standpoint of the actual process by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>which juries arrive at verdicts, a failure to submit to them the lesser offense as a permissible basis for their verdict may work a very serious harm to the defendant.\u201d Id., 136-37. Under the facts here presented, the trial court\u2019s failure to give a warranted self-defense instruction to a lesser included offense does not involve the harm sought to be avoided by <em>Monte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The trial court instructed the jury on the charged offense of murder as well as the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first degree and manslaughter in the second degree. The trial court\u2019s instruction on self-defense, while limiting the applicability of that defense, did not eliminate the jury\u2019s consideration of it. Rather, the jury was fully instructed on the law of self-defense with respect to murder and manslaughter in the first degree, and was told: \u201cIf you find that the defendant acted in self-defense, it is a complete justification for his conduct and you will find him not guilty.\u201d Thus, the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on the offense of manslaughter in the first degree was necessarily a rejection of the defense of self-defense. Since the elements of self-defense as applied to manslaughter in the second degree would have been the same as those applied to manslaughter in the first degree, the defendant would not have benefited by an instruction that the defense was applicable to manslaughter in the second degree. The court\u2019s instructions did not interfere with \u201cthe effort of [the] jury to reach a verdict with which each member [could] conscientiously agree.\u201d Id., 136. Accordingly, we hold that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jurors that they might consider self-defense with respect to manslaughter in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We now turn to the question of whether the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of criminally negligent homicide; General Statutes \u00a7 53a- 58;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> constituted error. The defendant timely filed his request to charge prior to closing arguments, and took an exception when the charge was not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201c Tn <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), this court articulated a four pronged test for determining when it is proper to charge a jury with respect to a lesser included offense. \u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if . . . (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>195 Conn. 567, 574, 489 A.2d 1024 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. Vass, 191 Conn. 604, 616-17, 469 A.2d 767 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>199 Conn. 155, 158, 506 A.2d 104 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>201 Conn. 534, 556-57, 518 A.2d 915 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The Appellate Court concluded that the defendant had established all four prongs of <em>Whistnant </em>and, thus, that the trial court had erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of criminally negligent homicide. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 519-23. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>state argues that the Appellate Court\u2019s holding is erroneous in that the defendant failed to meet even the first prong of <em>State </em>v. Whistnant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>requires that the defendant request \u201can appropriate instruction.\u201d A proposed instruction on a lesser included offense, like any other proposed jury instruction, is not appropriate unless made in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 854 (formerly \u00a7 852). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 556-58; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra. Section 854 requires, inter alia, that a request to charge set forth \u201cthe evidence to which the proposition would apply.\u201d We have held that, in the context of a written request to charge on a lesser included offense, this requirement of \u00a7 854 is met only if the proposed request contains \u201c \u2018such a complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u2019 <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>155 Conn. 406, 410, 232 A.2d 326 (1967), quoting <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>103 Conn. 678, 680, 131 A. 838 (1925).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Killenger, </em>193 Conn. 48, 57, 475 A.2d 276 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 558; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The defendant\u2019s written request to charge made only one reference to the facts: \u201cThe situation referred to in this case is only the situation commencing with the fight inside the VIP Lounge between Mr. Hall and Mr. Robinson and ending with the shots outside the VIP Lounge.\u201d The Appellate Court concluded that this statement \u201cdrew the trial court\u2019s attention to the crucial, relevant factual scenario so that the court could justifiably have given the requested instruction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 521. We do not agree. A mere general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>statement of the entire incident at issue does not comply with our rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of criminally negligent homicide when, <em>with criminal negligence, </em>he causes the death of another person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cA person acts with \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14). The defendant\u2019s request to charge does not enumerate the essential facts that would have justified the court\u2019s instruction to the jury pertaining to the defendant\u2019s failure to \u201cperceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d of the victim\u2019s death. Absent such facts, the defendant\u2019s request to charge merely refers to a fatal shooting and is as applicable to the offenses of murder, manslaughter in the first degree, and manslaughter in the second degree as to criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The defendant conceded at oral argument that the written request to charge did not set forth facts that related specifically to the offense of criminally negligent homicide, but contended that he was nevertheless entitled to the requested instruction. The defendant argued that, since he had testified at trial that he had intended only to wound the victim, he had presented the necessary facts to justify an instruction on criminally negligent homicide. We have rejected such a claim in the past and have stated that \u201ca trial court [does not have] an independent obligation \u2018 \u201cto instruct, sua sponte, on general principles of law relevant to all issues raised in evidence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra, 160, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 198 n.9, 502 A.2d 858 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cWhile this court does not favor unyielding adherence to \u2018rules of procedure where the interests of justice are thereby disserved\u2019; <em>[State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra, 160]; the ever increasing refinement of our law justifies cooperation of counsel in stating requests for jury instruction. \u2018The minor burden of cooperation imposed by [Practice Book \u00a7 854] is neither unreasonable nor novel.\u2019 Id., 161.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 559. The defendant\u2019s proposed request did not contain, as our rules of practice and our case law require, \u201ca complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>supra, 680. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing the defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury on the offense of criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-12\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-55. manslaughter in the first degree: class B felony, (a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\"> This court certified the following questions for review from the Appellate Court: (1) \u201cDid the Appellate Court err in concluding that the trial court should not have instructed the jury that self-defense was not available as a defense to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree?\u201d;
