Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJy\">This is an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs and the defendant\u2019s motion to open the 1984 judgment of annulment of their 1983 marriage in Connecticut. We transferred this case from the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">The factual background that generates the issue to be decided is the following. The parties, David Singh (husband) and Seoranie Singh (wife), were married on January 13,1983, in Hartford. In their complaint, seeking an annulment, they alleged that their 1983 marriage was entered into \u201cupon the mistaken belief by both parties that they were not related,\u201d but \u201cthey [had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>only] recently discovered that they are uncle and niece.\u201d There were no issue of this marriage. In 1984, the court, <em>Hon. Simon Cohen, </em>state trial referee, rendered judgment of annulment declaring the marriage null and void after finding, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he marriage was entered into upon the mistaken belief by both parties that they were legally qualified to marry,\u201d but that \u201c[both parties] have recently discovered that they are uncle and niece.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Thereafter, in November, 1988, both parties filed a motion to open the judgment. That motion alleged that, although the judgment found that they were uncle and niece and, therefore, not legally qualified to marry, in fact, since the wife\u2019s mother is the husband\u2019s half sister, the wife is the husband\u2019s half niece and not his niece. The parties also maintained that they sought the annulment only because of the advice of counsel that their marriage was, \u201cwithout question,\u201d incestuous and void under our statutory scheme. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-21,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 53a-191.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In view of the fact that our statute concerning kindred who may not marry does not mention \u201chalf nieces\u201d or \u201chalf uncles\u201d and no Connecticut decision extends the scope of the law\u2019s prohibition to relatives of the half blood, the parties claimed that the marriage \u201cmight well be deemed lawful and valid.\u201d They further alleged that they were remarried in August, 1988, in California where, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>69 Cal. 2d 44, 442 P.2d 675, 69 Cal. Rptr. 595 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>(1968), they assert that the California Supreme Court has determined that marriages between uncles and nieces of the half blood are not proscribed by that state\u2019s incest statute.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The trial court, <em>Kline, J., </em>denied the motion to open the judgment of annulment. In doing so, it found that the wife was the daughter of her husband\u2019s half sister and that this half sister and the husband were descended from a common mother but different fathers. It noted that while there were some Connecticut cases<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> implicating the statute, there were no Connecticut cases specifically addressing the question whether persons of the half blood fall within the statutorily prohibited degrees of whole blood relationships. Further, the trial court not only said that a number of cases in other jurisdictions indicated that marriage or sexual intercourse between an uncle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>niece of the half blood could be incestuous, but also opined that the texts seemed to be uniform that both at common law and by statute prohibited degrees of relationship by blood included persons of the half blood as well as of the whole blood. The court also stated that these authorities uniformly held that there is no distinction between the whole blood and half blood in computing the degrees within which marriages are prohibited as incestuous. The trial court also concluded that not only consanguinity but also the degree of the relationship between the parties was a basis for prohibiting certain marriages. Because \u00a7 46b-21 prohibits marriages between stepparents and stepchildren, the court inferred that it was not the actual blood relationship that appeared to concern the legislature but rather the degree or distance of the relationship between the parties indicating a legislative intent to prevent not only marriages of the whole blood but also those of the half blood. The trial court accordingly denied the motion to open and set aside the judgment of annulment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The issue to be decided is whether a marriage between persons related to one another as half uncle and half niece is incestuous under our statutory scheme and, therefore, void. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-21, 53a-191. The parties maintain that such a marriage is not incestuous under our statutory law. The attorney general, who appeared as an amicus curiae, argued to the contrary. The determination of this question involves the interrelation and judicial interpretation of two statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 46b-21 and 53a-191. This case, unlike <em>State </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>132 Conn. 163, 43 A.2d 76 (1945), or <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>158 Conn. 461, 262 A.2d 166 (1969), to which counsel have referred, does not come before us on appeal from a conviction of the crime of incest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>These cases, however, are instructive on the issue to be resolved in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Historically, marriage between certain relatives \u201chas been disfavored by all nations during all ages.\u201d F. Keezer, Marriage and Divorce (3d Ed. 1923) \u00a7 170; 1 C. Vernier, American Family Laws (1931) \u00a7 37; 1 H. Clark, Law of Domestic Relations in the United States (2d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 2.9; see <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>78 Conn. 242, 244, 61 A. 604 (1905). Although incest was punished by the ecclesiastical courts in England, it was not an indictable offense at common law and punishment was left entirely to the ecclesiastical courts. See <em>Peoples. Baker, </em>supra; <em>Cecil </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>140 Ky. 717, 719, 131 S.W. 781 (1910); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>20 Or. 437, 439, 26 P. 302 (1891); 4 Blackstone Com. 4. \u201cThe ecclesiastical courts followed the interdiction of Levitical law which prohibited marriages between persons more closely related than fourth cousins unless a dispensation was procured from the Church of Rome; no distinction was made between persons related by affinity or consanguinity.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 49; see <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Gastrill, </em>Gilbert\u2019s Rep. 156, 156-57, 25 Eng. Rep. 110 (1721); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>174 Ind. 715, 718-19, 93 N.E. 3 (1910). In 1540, during the reign of Henry VIII, a statute was passed regulating the degrees of relationship within which marriage was illegal. See 32 Henry 8, c. 38. That statute limited the prohibitions against marriage to relatives closer than first cousins, and although the ecclesiastical courts approved of the statute, the courts continued to make no distinction between relatives by consanguinity or affinity. <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Gastrill, </em>supra; <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>St. Giles in the Fields, </em>11 Q.B. 173, 116 Eng. Rep. 441 (1847). \u201cConsanguinity\u201d is a blood relationship. It is the connection or relation of persons descended from the same stock or common ancestor. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). It is distinguished from \u201caffinity\u201d which, in turn, is the connection existing in consequence of a marriage between each of the married persons and the kindred of the other spouse. Id.; see <em>Lavieri </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>184 Conn. 380, 383, 439 A.2d 1012 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The initial departure of the American jurisdictions from the English law was to declare incest a crime. The crime of incest is purely statutory, and most states have a statute making it a crime. The statutes delineating incestuous relationships departed from the ecclesiastical law in two respects. The majority of states extended the criminal prohibitions to first cousins and beyond while other states imposed criminal penalties only where the relationship was that of consanguinity. <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra; F. Keezer, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 171 and 172, pp. 220-22. As will be seen, Connecticut\u2019s incest statute followed the former course. While these statutes may vary in detail, they generally define incest as marriage or sexual intercourse between persons too closely related in consanguinity or affinity to be entitled to marry legally. See 72 A.L.R.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In Connecticut, incest has been a crime since the incest statute was enacted in 1702 as part of \u201cAn Act to prevent Incestuous Marriages.\u201d General Statutes (1702-1733), p. 74; see <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>148 Conn. 288, 290, 170 A.2d 726 (1961); <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra, 246. The 1702 act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prohibited marriages between per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>sons within certain degrees of kinship including that of uncle and niece. <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>supra; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra. In the 1875 revision, the language describing the degree of relationship, now appearing in \u00a7 46b-21, was adopted. General Statutes (1875 Rev.) \u00a7 1; <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>supra. There has been no substantive change in the language since that time.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, since 1702, our incest statute has interdicted marriage between persons related by either consanguinity or affinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Initially, the parties claim that the trial court erred by adhering to a line of cases dating from the interpretations of the incest statute during the reign of Henry VIII<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> citing to the English statute of 32 Henry 8, c. 38. They concede that \u201c[d]espite notable changes in sexual mores and in the very conditions which underlie the incest taboo itself, which have intervened since the time of Henry VIII, most Courts considering [the] question have been satisfied to mechanically reproduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>precedents of several hundred years ago.\u201d They, nevertheless, urge \u201ca more modern approach to the construction of our incest statute\u201d and maintain that they \u201crely upon a line of cases placing more emphasis on the rights of criminal defendants, and the importance of preserving bona fide marriages against the undue extension of statutory categories.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They claim that there are several compelling reasons for the statutory construction that they urge: (1) the plain language of \u00a7 46b-21 favors the construction allowing uncle-niece marriages between relatives of the half blood; (2) undue judicial extension of the prohibitions contained in \u00a7 46b-21 may lead to unfair prosecutions for the crime of incest under \u00a7 53a-191; (3) an unwarranted extension of the incest prohibition to include uncles and nieces of the half blood is inconsistent with proper respect for the preservation of bona fide marriages; and (4) since the prohibition of \u201cuncle-niece marriages, especially those between relatives of half blood, are not the object of universal condemnation, the Court will not be at odds with \u2018natural law\u2019 if it adopts the construction [advocated] by [the parties].\u201d We are not persuaded by any of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">It is clear that \u00a7 46b-21 does not contain any language that expressly distinguishes between relatives of the whole blood and the half blood. It is also clear that although \u00a7 46b-21 is a civil statute, its interrelationship with \u00a7 53a-191, the criminal statute prohibiting incest, is such that both statutes may fairly be said to be in pari materia and so \u00a7 46b-21 is to be construed in this case in harmony with the law of which it forms a part. See <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 575, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>522 A.2d 763 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Millette, </em>112 N.H. 458, 465, 299 A.2d 150 (1972); 82 C.J.S., Statutes \u00a7 362 (1953). The infusion into \u00a7 53a-191 of the degrees of relationship set out in \u00a7 46b-21 as the predicate for the commission of the crime of incest invokes the rule of strict construction that is applied to criminal statutes. The United States Supreme Court has said: \u201cThat criminal statutes are to be construed strictly is a proposition which calls for the citation of no authority. But this does not mean that every criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bramblett, </em>348 U.S. 503, 509-10, 75 S. Ct. 504, 99 L. Ed. 594 (1955). The same court also said: \u201cNo rule of construction, however, requires that a penal statute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conduct clearly intended to be within its scope \u2014 nor does any rule require that the act be given the \u2018narrowest meaning.\u2019 It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent of (the legislature].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raynor, </em>302 U.S. 540, 552, 58 S. Ct. 353, 82 L. Ed. 413 (1937). We have said: \u201cStrict construction does not mean that a statute must be read in isolation. \u2018 \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d \u2019 . . . \u2018\u201cThe rule of strict construction does not require that the narrowest technical meaning be given to the words employed in a criminal statute in disregard of their context and in frustration of the obvious legislative intent.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Luis R., </em>204 Conn. 630, 635, 528 A.2d 1146 (1987). Such authority demonstrates that the rule of strict construction of penal statutes is not without limitation; the doctrine of strict construction is only one of the aids which is to be used in the construction of penal statutes. See 3 J. Sutherland, Statutory Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>struction (4th Ed. 1986) \u00a7 59.06. Other aids include such things as the statutory language itself, legislative history where available, the furthering of the policy and purposes fairly apparent from the statute which include the mischief sought to be proscribed and related statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In our analysis, it is proper to explore further the state of the law as it was at the time that our incest statute was enacted in 1702. The fundamental case explicating the ecclesiastical law as it was deemed at the time was <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Gastrill, </em>supra. That case, which was decided in 1722, said: \u201cAnd when we consider who are prohibited to marry by the Levitical Law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we must not only consider the mere Words of the Law itself, but what, from a just and fair Interpretation, may be deduced from it.\u201d Id., 158. On the basis of early English cases discussing the prohibition of marriage within certain degrees, Halsbury said: \u201cIn reference to the prohibited degrees, relationship by the half blood is a bar to marriage equally with relationship by the whole blood.\u201d 16 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England p. 284. Another noted text writer wrote: \u201cThe relationship by half blood is the same in [the consanguinity cases] as by whole blood; so that, for example, it is incestuous for a man to marry the daughter of his brother of the half blood, or the daughter of his half-sister.\u201d 1 J. Bishop, Marriage, Divorce and Separation \u00a7 748. It is fair to assume that, when the incest statute was enacted in 1702, the framers were aware of and adopted the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law as it then existed in England, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>thus treating the relation of the half blood like that of the whole blood. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashey, </em>248 Mass. 259, 42 N.E. 788 (1924); 1 J. Schouler, Marriage, Divorce, Separation and Domestic Relations (6th Ed.) \u00a7 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">There has been no substantive change since that time in our incest statute insofar as the degree of consanguinity within which marriage is proscribed. That is not without significance. Indeed, implicating the issue before us, in 1961, we said: \u201cIt has been the declared public policy of this state continuously since 1702 to prohibit marriages of uncle and niece and declare them void.\u201d <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>supra, 290. Our decisional law under the incest statute has been sparse. In <em>Catalano, </em>we held invalid a marriage between an uncle and a niece under our statutory scheme although the marriage was valid in Italy where it was performed. In that case, we noted that the \u201cgenerally accepted rule\u201d was that a marriage valid where the ceremony was performed was valid everywhere. Id., 291. We pointed out, however, that there were certain exceptions to the rule, including one which regarded as invalid incestuous marriages between persons so closely related that their marriage was contrary to the strong public policy of the domicil. Id. In that context, we said: \u201cThat exception may be expressed in the terms of a statute or by necessary implication.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Besides <em>Catalano, </em>two other cases merit discussion. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>132 Conn. 163, 43 A.2d 76 (1945), we held that the relationship of brother and half sister was comprehended within the degrees of relationship forbidding marriage under the incest statute. In that case, we rejected the defendant brother\u2019s claim that the relationship of half sister did not come within the statutory prohibition. Id., 165. In doing so, we pointed out that the defendant \u201cadmitted in his brief that all the cases which [his counsel] have found are to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>trary and that public policy would indicate that relationship of the half blood should be included in the prohibition of the incest statute.\u201d Id. After referring to several cases from other jurisdictions that directly held that \u201cbrother\u201d includes a brother of the half blood and that \u201csister\u201d includes a sister of the half blood, we said: \u201cIn view of the purpose of the statute ... its language, and the. soundness of the decisions we have cited, we hold that the word sister, as used in the statute, applies to and includes a half sister.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>158 Conn. 461, 464, 262 A.2d 166 (1969), the defendant had been found guilty of incest<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> where the parties involved were the defendant and the nineteen year old daughter of the defendant\u2019s brother-in-law, that is, the daughter of the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother. In reversing the incest conviction in <em>Moore, </em>we observed that the trial court \u201cextended the meaning of \u00a7 46-1 (now \u00a7 46b-21) beyond its fair import.\u201d Id., 465. In doing so, we referred to <em>Skinner, </em>pointing out that the relationship in that case contained the element of consanguinity and we also noted that that element appeared in all the relationships enumerated in \u00a7 46-1 (now \u00a7 46b-21) except the relationship of stepmother or stepdaughter and stepfather or stepson. Id., 466. <em>Moore </em>then goes on to say: \u201cThe question at once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>arises as to why, in its enumeration of relationships which do not include the element of consanguinity, the General Assembly saw fit to include only those of stepparent or a stepchild. In the application of the criminal law, it would be an unwarranted extension and presumption to assume that by specifying those relationships the legislature has intended to include others which lack the element of consanguinity. Had the legislative intent been to include what, in this case, would commonly be called a relationship of niece-in-law and uncle-in-law, it would have been a simple matter to say.\u201d Id. Therefore, the <em>Moore </em>court opined that, absent such a declaration, the trial court\u2019s construction \u201camounted to an unwarranted extension of its expressed meaning and intent.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The parties stress that <em>Moore </em>is very supportive of their position. We do not agree for several reasons. First, the fact pattern in <em>Moore </em>was different from that in both <em>Skinner </em>and <em>Catalano, </em>as in the latter two cases, unlike <em>Moore, </em>a blood relationship was involved. Second, in <em>Moore, </em>we referred to <em>Skinner, </em>noting that, in <em>Skinner, </em>we not only pointed out that the relationship .in that case \u201cis embraced within the meaning of the statute\u201d but also that in that relationship there was the element of consanguinity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>supra. In <em>Moore, </em>the element of consanguinity was absent but that of affinity was present. Moreover, in <em>Moore, </em>we did not qualify our holding in <em>Skinner </em>but acknowledged its viability. Finally, in <em>Moore, </em>we were not called upon to decide whether the statute proscribed marriage between two persons where <em>each </em>was a relative of the half blood although <em>Skinner, </em>fairly read, was a step in that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Nor do we overlook, in reaching our conclusion, those cases that the parties urge us to rely upon in reaching \u201ca more modern approach\u201d to the construction of our incest statute. This approach, they claim, is one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>places more emphasis on the rights of criminal defendants as well as \u201cpreserving bona fide marriages against the undue extension of statutory categories.\u201d They cite the following cases: <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>167 Cal. App. 2d 130, 334 P.2d 309 (1959); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Bartley, </em>304 Mo. 58, 263 S.W. 95 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The parties place the greatest stress on <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra. A close reading of that case demonstrates that it is clearly inapposite. That case was an incest prosecution against Baker who had had sexual relations with his niece who was related to him by the half blood; that is, her mother was the defendant\u2019s half sister. The trial court found him guilty of incest. His principal claim on appeal was that the prohibition in California Penal Code \u00a7 285<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> against fornication by an uncle and his niece did not apply where they were related by the half blood. That statute provided in part: \u201cPersons being within the degrees of consanguinity within which marriages are declared by law to be incestuous and void . . . who commit fornication . . . with each other . . . are punishable by imprisonment . . . .\u2019\u2019California Civil Code \u00a7 59 provided: \u201cMarriages between parents and children, ancestors and descendants of every degree, and between brothers and sisters <em>of the half as well as the whole blood, </em>and between uncles and nieces or aunts and nephews, are incestuous, and void from the beginning, whether the relationship is legitimate or illegitimate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The <em>Baker </em>court reversed the conviction. In doing so, it reasoned that the phrase \u201cof the half as well as the whole blood\u201d obviously referred to brothers and sisters and could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>be interpreted also to modify \u201cuncles and nieces\u201d under established tenets of statutory construction. Moreover, by including relationships between brothers and sisters of the half blood and not so specifying as to more distant relatives, the <em>Baker </em>court reasoned that the legislature evinced the intention to exclude such persons from the statutory prohibition. <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra. In recognizing that various state statutes differ, it acknowledged that the more common type of statute extended the prohibition to uncles and nieces of the half blood even where half blood relationships were not mentioned.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The manifest dissimilarity of the California statute in <em>Baker </em>from our statutes affords little support for the claims of the parties in this case. Indeed, <em>Baker </em>itself expressly points this up when, after stating that incest is governed by specific statutes in the various states, it says that \u201cthe relevant decisions must be considered in the context of the statutory scheme peculiar to the particular state.\u201d Id., 47. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The <em>Baker </em>court addressed the earlier case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>supra. <em>Womack </em>posed the question whether an admitted act of sexual intercourse between the defendant Womack and the fourteen year old daughter of his half sister was incestuous under the same statutory scheme that existed in <em>Baker. </em>The California Court of Appeals had affirmed Womack\u2019s conviction of incest. In doing so, it construed the statutory scheme to include the defendant and the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>within those degrees of relationship between whom sexual intercourse was prohibited. In its decision, it observed that \u201c[b]y definition, an uncle is a brother of one\u2019s father or mother, and no distinction is made between the whole and the half blood according to common and ordinary usage.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>supra, 131. <em>Baker </em>not only referred to <em>Womack </em>but expressly \u201cdisapproved\u201d of it as \u201cbeing inconsistent with fundamental canons of construction of criminal statutes.\u201d Therefore, <em>Womack </em>hardly supports the parties in the case before us. Rather significantly, however, the <em>Baker </em>court explicitly did say: \u201cUndeniably, the great weight of authority is in accord with the result reached in <em>Womack. </em>(Note, 72 A.L.R. 2d 706)\u201d and conceded that those decisions which represented the weight of authority were consonant with the English ecclesiastical law declaring a marriage between an uncle and niece of the half blood incestuous. <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Finally, the parties refer us to <em>State </em>v. <em>Bartley, </em>supra, but that Missouri incest decision hardly buttresses their claim. The defendant Bartley, who had been convicted in the trial court, was a half brother of the mother of the young woman with whom he had had sexual intercourse, the relationship being that of uncle and niece of the half blood. The Missouri statute defining incest provided in part: \u201cPersons within the following degrees of consanguinity, to wit: Parents and children, including grandparents and grandchildren of every degree, <em>brothers and sisters of the half as well as of the whole blood, uncles and nieces, </em>aunts and nephews, who shall intermarry, or who shall commit adultery or fornication . . . shall be adjudged guilty of incest. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 61. In reversing the conviction, the Missouri Supreme Court adopted a strict construction of the statute against the state saying, inter alia, that \u201c[n]o one is to be made subject to such statutes by implication\u201d and \u201c[wjhere one class of persons is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>designated as subject to its penalties, all others not mentioned are exonerated.\u201d Id., 63. That case effectively held: \u201cWhen the Legislature mentioned brothers and sisters of the half blood it necessarily excluded all other relationships of the half blood.\u201d Id. Again, as in <em>Baker </em>and <em>Womack, Bartley </em>involved a statutory scheme quite dissimilar from ours. Each involves statutes that expressly provide for certain relationships of the half blood; ours does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In addition, the parties suggest that holding marriages between uncles and nieces of the half blood valid will place more emphasis on the rights of criminal defendants and the importance of preserving bona fide marriages against the undue extension of statutory categories. At the outset, we should point out that in this appeal there are no claims that the statutory scheme involved is unconstitutional. Moreover, this appeal does not come to us as a criminal matter. We are, therefore, disinclined to give any opinion, without any factual predicate, what effect upholding the parties\u2019 \u201cmore emphasis on the rights of criminal defendants\u201d claim; because to do so would amount to an advisory opinion. Also, on that branch of their claim, we point out here, as we did in <em>Lomas &amp; Nettleton Co. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>122 Conn. 228, 234, 188 A. 433 (1936), that \u201c[l]aw suits are not determined by a consideration of philosophy in the abstract, but by the application of legal principles to the facts of a particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Connecticut has its statutory scheme in place to implement its policy of delineating the relationships between persons under our jurisdiction who may properly enter into marriage. It has been for many years and still remains the declared public policy of the state. See <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>supra. The degrees of relationship within which marriages are prohibited are not, from what we have already said, words of art. Fairly read, the prohibition against intermarriage of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>related by consanguinity can be understood to extend to those of the half blood as well as of the whole blood. In <em>Skinner, </em>which predated the case before us by a generation, we held that the words \u201cbrother\u201d and \u201csister\u201d included those of the half blood. \u201cAccording to the common meaning of the word [\u2018uncle\u2019], it includes the half-brother of the [mother] and there is no distinction between the whole and half blood.\u201d 90 C.J.S. 1025. We believe that the same can be said of the term \u201cniece,\u201d that is, that it comprehends the half blood as well as the whole blood. In doing so, we accord to each word its common meaning without frustrating legislative intent but rather enhancing it. Other courts have had no difficulty concluding that their statutes, although silent on the half blood matter, comprehend that relationship in \u201cuncle-niece\u201d incest cases. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>209 Iowa 132, 227 N.W. 830 (1929); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashey, </em>supra, 260. In giving a statute its full meaning where that construction is in harmony with the context and policy of the statute, \u201cthere is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean.\u201d <em>Roschen </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>279 U.S. 337, 339, 49 S. Ct. 336, 73 L. Ed. 722 (1929); <em>Don-nelly </em>v. <em>United States, </em>276 U.S. 505, 48 S. Ct. 400, 72 L. Ed. 676 (1928). We will attempt no encompassing definition of a \u201cbona fide marriage\u201d in the incest context. The parties have advanced none. We submit, however, that, given the common meaning of uncle and niece, as we have discussed it, what would constitute a \u201cbona fide marriage\u201d in the incest context should be decided on a case-by-case basis against the background of authority we have set out above. Therefore, contrary to the parties\u2019 claim, our interpretation of the statutory scheme does not constitute an \u201cunwarranted extension\u201d of the incest prohibition that \u201cis inconsistent with proper respect for the preservation of bona fide marriages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>In conclusion, a marriage between persons related to one another as half uncle and half niece is void under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-21 and 53a-191 as incestuous.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-21 provides: \u201c(Formerly See. 46-1.) kindred WHO MAY NOT MARRY.

The reasons they advanced to support this latter claim of the two year delay was, they claim, due to certain amendments in November, 1986, to the Immigration and Nationality Act. The wife was a citizen of Guyana when she remarried her husband. She had been cited by the immigration authorities for exclusion as an \u201coverstay\u201d and was therefore precluded from applying for an \u201cadjustment status\u201d to permanent residency based on that marriage. Consequently, she will have to return to Guyana and cannot initiate an \u201cadjustment status\u201d application until she has completed two years of residence outside the United States.
