J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax_\">The sole issue in this tax appeal is whether the plaintiff Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory, Inc. (taxpayer), has established that its design computer qualifies for an exemption as \u201cmachinery used directly in a manufacturing . . . process\u201d in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34). After a determination by the defendant commissioner of revenue services (commissioner) that the taxpayer was liable for a deficiency assessment, the taxpayer appealed to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422. The trial court concluded that the commissioner should prevail. We transferred the taxpayer\u2019s appeal from this adverse judgment to the Supreme Court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The facts are undisputed. The taxpayer uses a milling machine to produce aluminum and steel injection molds according to predetermined specifications. To assist in this process, the taxpayer in 1982 bought a computer known as a CAD/CAM, which stands for \u201ccomputer aided design/computer aided manufacturing.\u201d The CAD/CAM translates information from blueprints into numeric design specifications that, at the time relevant to this assessment, were encoded on a paper tape. Upon its completion, the tape was physically removed from the CAD/CAM and inserted into a milling machine. While previously a personal operator had controlled the milling machine\u2019s preparation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of a mold, the tape produced by the CAD/CAM gave the milling machine the necessary instructions without further human intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The taxpayer\u2019s purchase of the CAD/CAM would obligate it to pay a Connecticut sales and use tax, General Statutes \u00a7 12-411, unless this transaction qualifies for a statutory exemption under General Statutes \u00a7 12-412. Subsection 12-412 (34) specifically exempts \u201c[sjalesof . . . machinery used directly in a manufacturing . . . process\u201d but not sales of \u201coffice equipment or data processing equipment other than numerically controlled machinery used directly in the manufacturing process.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Departmental regulations define both \u201cmanufacturing\u201d and \u201cmanufacturing production process.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The trial court determined that the applicability of the \u00a7 12-412 exemption to the taxpayer\u2019s CAD/CAM purchase had raised a question that was not free from ambiguity, and that the taxpayer bore the burden of persuasion on resolving this ambiguity so as to establish its right to claim the exemption. From this vantage point, the court concluded that the CAD/CAM was \u201cdata processing equipment [which functioned as] numerically controlled machinery,\u201d but that the taxpayer had not shown that the equipment was \u201cused directly in the manufacturing process.\u201d Accordingly, the court ruled that judgment should enter for the commissioner in an amount to which the parties had previously stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">On appeal, the taxpayer maintains that the trial court erred in interpreting \u00a7 12-412 (34) to conclude that the CAD/CAM was (1) not \u201cused directly in the manufacturing process,\u201d and (2) taxable data processing equipment rather than \u201cequipment or devices used ... to control, regulate or operate the machinery.\u201d In this case, there is no functional distinction between these two claims of error. Even if the taxpayer were correct that the CAD/CAM should properly have been denominated as machinery rather than as data processing equipment, the taxpayer\u2019s claim for an exemption would still have to satisfy the overarching requirement of \u00a7 12-412 (34) that the machinery was \u201cused directly in a manufacturing . . . process.\u201d Because the sole link between the CAD/CAM and the milling machine consisted of its production of a physically discrete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>imprinted tape, the issue is whether the taxpayer\u2019s CAD/CAM was \u201cused directly\u201d in the taxpayer\u2019s manufacturing process. For this taxpayer, that issue is the same however the CAD/CAM is characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">We begin our discussion of this issue by noting the principles of statutory construction that govern the availability of a tax exemption. First, statutes that provide exemptions from taxation are a matter of legislative grace that must be strictly construed against the taxpayer. Second, any ambiguity in the statutory formulation of an exemption must be resolved against the taxpayer. Third, the taxpayer must bear the burden of proving the error in an adverse assessment concerning an exemption. <em>Stop \u2019N Save, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>212 Conn. 454, 462, 562 A.2d 512 (1989); <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>199 Conn. 133, 142, 506 A.2d 93 (1986); <em>The B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 8-9, 490 A.2d 991 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Applying these principles in this case, we conclude that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in determining, as a mixed question of fact and law, that the taxpayer\u2019s CAD/CAM was not \u201cused directly in a manufacturing process.\u201d The CAD/CAM\u2019s end product, at the time of this litigation, was an encoded paper tape. The CAD/CAM had no direct link, electronic or otherwise, with the taxpayer\u2019s milling machine and did not directly transform the raw material that the milling machine made into injection molds. Once the milling machine received the encoded tape containing instructions from the CAD/CAM, a separate unit, known as a DAC interface control, was required to convey these instructions electronically to the milling machine for operational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Although the taxpayer does not dispute the accuracy of this factual recitation, it contends that anything that affects the process of the production line as a whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>can come within the category of \u201cused directly in a manufacturing process.\u201d The taxpayer maintains that it was not required to show that the CAD/CAM directly affected the raw material that its milling machine would ultimately manufacture into molds. Comparing the regulation for tax exemptions for tools with that governing tax exemptions for machinery, it notes that only tools are expressly required to be used \u201cin the operation of machines for the purpose <em>of producing a direct effect upon the product </em>being manufactured\u201d (emphasis added); Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-11b (a) (13); while machinery may be used in a \u201cmanufacturing production process\u201d in any \u201cone of a series of production activities.\u2019,\u2019 Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-11b (a) (11). The taxpayer reminds us that this court, in <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>145 Conn. 176, 186, 140 A.2d 486 (1958), held that X-ray films, testing chemicals, oil and gasoline qualified for the exemption contained in an earlier sales tax statute, General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1955) \u00a7 1167d, for \u201cpersonal property . . . used directly . . . in the process of the manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold,\u201d even though the plant manufactured and sold airplanes. Thereafter, in <em>Ziperstein </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 493, 496, 423 A.2d 129 (1979), we held that electricity used in the process of manufacturing ice milk was used and consumed \u201c \u2018directly ... in an <em>industrial plant </em>in the actual fabrication of the finished product to be sold.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., quoting General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 12-412 (r). We find these arguments unpersuasive both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">As a factual matter, on the present record the trial court was entitled to find that the absence of any direct linkage between the CAD/CAM and the milling machine served to defeat the taxpayer\u2019s claim to the statutory exemption. The production of encoded tape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>could reasonably be found to be akin to the production of blueprints or other design documents, all of which are preliminary to the manufacturing process, rather than \u201cused directly\u201d therein.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As a legal matter, the taxpayer\u2019s argument overlooks the regulatory changes that have, since 1980, imposed additional limitations upon the exemption provided in \u00a7 12-412 (34). In <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Barboto, </em>206 Conn. 337, 343, 537 A.2d 490 (1988), we concluded that the regulation presently defining \u201cmanufacturing\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-11b (a) (10); validly requires a taxpayer claiming an exemption for machinery \u201cused directly in a manufacturing . . . process\u201d to prove a direct connection with a process that results in the substantial transformation of the \u201c \u2018form, composition or character\u2019 \u201d of personal property. Id., 343 n.6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This circumscribed regulatory definition of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d narrows the scope of the statutory exemption for machinery \u201cused directly in a manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>turing . . . process\u201d to one that is less inclusive than it was when <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>and <em>Ziperstein </em>were decided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id. The regulatory definition of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d also limits the scope of \u201cmanufacturing production process\u201d in \u00a7 12-426-11b (a) (11) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Read conjointly, these regulations make the statutory exemption available only upon a showing that the machinery at issue is used in \u201cone of a series of production activities\u201d that results in a substantial change in the \u201cform, composition or character\u201d of personal property. So construed, the regulations governing the exemption for machinery are not, in principle, inconsistent with the regulation defining the exemption for tools. In both cases, the statutory exemption turns upon effecting a change in the product being manufactured.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We therefore agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion, insofar as it was based on a construction of the applicable statute and regulations, that the taxpayer has failed to prove that its CAD/CAM was \u201cused directly in a manufacturing process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34) provides: \u201cexemptions.
