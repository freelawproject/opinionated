Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak8\">The principal issue in this case is whether an endorsement to an owners\u2019, landlords\u2019 and tenants\u2019 liability insurance policy amends or adds to the policy provisions defining insured premises. The trial court, Ryan, <em>J., </em>found the definition of insured premises in the endorsement controlling and interpreted the provision so as to deny the plaintiff relief under the insurance policy. From this judgment, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, we transferred the case to this court. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. On August 15, 1978, Phyllis G. Olschan transferred title and delivered possession of the premises known as 416 Erskine Road, Stamford (Stamford property), to the plaintiff and her husband. On September 4, 1978, the plaintiffs decedent, Andrew G. Schultz, eight years of age, was severely injured as a result of the detonation of a hand grenade that had been left on the premises. Andrew G. Schultz died about three weeks later as a result of these injuries. The plaintiff was appointed administratrix of the estate of Andrew G. Schultz and instituted an action against Olschan to recover for the bodily injuries suffered by Andrew G. Schultz and his subsequent wrongful death by reason of the negligence of Olschan. On March 13, 1985, the plaintiff obtained a judgment against Olschan in the amount of $100,000 in damages. Olschan, however, failed to pay any part of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The plaintiff thereafter brought an action, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38-175,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in two counts against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the Hartford Fire Insurance Company and the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to collect the unpaid judgment. In count one of the complaint, the plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that Olschan had in effect on the day of the accident a liability insurance policy, number 31 RA 607453, issued by the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. In count two, the plaintiff alleged that Olschan had in effect on the day of the accident an insurance policy, number 31 OLT 195229, issued by the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants denied these allegations and pleaded, by way of special defenses as to count one, that policy number 31 RA 607453 was cancelled prior to the accident involving Andrew Schultz. As to the second count, they denied that policy number 31 OLT 195229 extended coverage to the Stamford property as \u201cinsured premises.\u201d As to both counts, they denied that they had in effect a policy covering the Stamford property on the day of the accident. Prior to trial, however, the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ties stipulated that the only policy in effect at the time of the accident was policy number 31 OUT 195229 issued by the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">No evidence was presented to the trial court. The trial court held that endorsement L-3038-2 to the policy defining the insured premises designated 1141 Fair-field Beach Road, Fairfield (Fairfield beach property), as the insured premises and not the Stamford property. The trial court stated that the parties\u2019 true intentions to insure only the Fairfield beach property were evident. The trial court found that the endorsement listed a one family dwelling as the \u201cdesignated premises,\u201d and that that endorsement applied only to the Fairfield beach property. Moreover, the trial court stated that \u201c[a]n interpretation that the alienated premises clause encompasses all premises ever alienated by [Olschan] individually, or by Lillian Goldman individually, or by both [Olschan] and Lillian Goldman jointly, would be [an] unreasonable interpretation of [the alienated premises] clause.\u201d The court concluded that the policy covered only the Fairfield beach property.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in concluding that (1) the defendant\u2019s policy did not extend coverage to the Stamford premises recently alienated by its insured, and (2) notwithstanding the designation of \u201calienated premises\u201d as \u201cinsured premises\u201d within the defendant\u2019s policy, it would be unreasonable to provide such coverage. Because we find that the endorsement amends the provision defining insured premises in the policy, we do not need to decide the plaintiff\u2019s second claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">At the time of Andrew G. Schultz\u2019s accident, Olschan and Goldman, as named insureds, had in effect an insurance policy entitled \u201cOwners\u2019, Landlords\u2019 and Tenants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Liability Insurance.\u201d The focus of the plaintiffs claim is on the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision in the policy and the endorsement that both contain a definition of \u201cinsured premises.\u201d The policy when issued provided, inter alia, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201cIV. ADDITIONAL DEFINITION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201cWhen used in reference to this insurance (including endorsements forming a part of the policy): <em>\u2018insured premises\u2019 </em>means (1) the premises designated in the declarations, (2) premises alienated by the <em>named insured </em>(other than premises constructed for sale by the <em>named insured), </em>if possession has been relinquished to others, and (3) premises as to which the <em>named insured </em>acquires ownership or control and reports his intention to insure such premises under this policy and no other within 30 days after such acquisition; and includes the ways immediately adjoining such premises on land.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The endorsement states in part: \u201cIt is agreed that the insurance applies to the <em>insured premises, </em>subject to the following additional provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">\u201c1. The definition of <em>\u2018insured premises\u2019 </em>is amended to read as follows: <em>\u2018insured premises\u2019 </em>means the premises described below or designated in the policy as subject to this endorsement, including the ways immediately adjoining and including garages and stables incidental thereto, gardens incidental thereto on land not owned by the <em>named insured, </em>and individual or family cemetery plots or burial vaults.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in applying the definition of insured premises in the endorsement rather than the definition in the insurance policy as originally issued. The plaintiff argues that the trial court either overlooked or ignored the policy provision requiring that the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision defining insured premises still be given effect even when there were endorsements forming a part of the policy. The introductory clause to the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision, the plaintiff maintains, makes it clear that endorsements forming a part of the policy could never alter or delete from coverage those prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ises included within the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision. The introductory language, to which the plaintiff refers in this context, provides: \u201cWhen used in reference to this insurance (including endorsements forming a part of the policy): <em>\u2018insured premises\u2019 </em>means . . . . \u201d Had the defendant company desired to reserve the right to alter coverage, the plaintiff contends, it would have used the words \u201cexcluding endorsements\u201d rather than \u201cincluding endorsements\u201d in this introductory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">An insurance policy is to be interpreted by the same general rules that govern the construction of any written contract and enforced in accordance with the real intent of the parties as expressed in the language employed in the policy. <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 305, 309, 524 A.2d 641 (1987); <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>186 Conn. 507, 512-13, 442 A.2d 920 (1982); <em>Gottesman v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>177 Conn. 631, 634, 418 A.2d 944 (1979). If the \u201cinsurance coverage is defined in terms that are ambiguous, such ambiguity is, in accordance with standard rules of construction, resolved against the insurance company. \u2018Where the terms of the policy are of doubtful meaning, the construction most favorable to the insured will be adopted.\u2019 <em>LaBonte </em>v. <em>Federal Mutual Ins. Co., </em>159 Conn. 252, 256, 268 A.2d 663 (1970); see also <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>[supra]; <em>Simses </em>v. <em>North America Co. for Life &amp; Health Ins., </em>175 Conn. 77, 84-85, 394 A.2d 710 (1978).\u201d <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>205 Conn. 246, 250, 532 A.2d 1297 (1987). If, however, the words in the policy \u201care plain and unambiguous the established rules for the construction of contracts apply, the language, from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced, must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning, and courts cannot indulge in a forced construction ignoring provisions or so distorting them as to accord a meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>other than that evidently intended by the parties.\u201d <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 675, 425 A.2d 131 (1979). \u201cA court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>146 Conn. 490, 494-95, 152 A.2d 316 (1959). We find the language in the introductory clause to the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We construe the introductory clause of the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision to be clear evidence of the parties\u2019 intent to include within the definition of insured premises any endorsement forming a part of the policy. The word \u201cendorsement\u201d has been defined as meaning \u201ca provision added to an insurance contract altering its scope or application that takes precedence over printed portions in conflict therewith.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; see <em>Commercial Standard Ins. </em>v. <em>General Trucking, </em>423 So. 2d 168, 170 (Ala. 1982). \u201cEndorsement\u201d has also been defined generally to mean \u201c[a] written or printed form attached to the policy which alters provisions of the contract.\u201d T. Green, Glossary of Insurance Terms (1980). \u201cAlter\u201d has been defined to mean \u201cto cause to become different in some particular characteristic [by adding, deleting or amending] without changing into something else.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. The word \u201calter\u201d is synonymous with \u201cchange.\u201d Id. Therefore, any endorsement that may add, delete or amend the definition of insured premises is to be considered in determining whether the Stamford property is covered within the policy as an \u201cinsured premises.\u201d Thus, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contentions, we find the introductory language to be evidence of the parties\u2019 intent to reserve the right to add, delete or amend coverage under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>If we construe the introductory language as urged by the plaintiff, we would need to disregard the express terms of the endorsement. The endorsement specifically states: \u201cThis endorsement forms a part of Policy No. 31OLT195229.\u201d In construing an insurance policy, the court must not ignore or disregard any provision that can be reconciled with other parts of the policy nor should a court interpret a single provision or sentence in a policy and attach to it a greater significance than is intended by the whole terms of a policy. See <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>supra, 494-95; <em>Commercial Standard Ins. </em>v. <em>General Trucking, </em>supra. It is clear that the parties intended to include any endorsement as part of the policy, specifically the endorsement that is the subject of this appeal, when referring to the definition of \u201cinsured premises.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in its consideration of the endorsement notwithstanding the language of the introductory clause of the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that if the endorsement is to be included as forming a part of the policy, then it should be interpreted as relating back and including the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision defining insured premises. The plaintiff argues that the trial court misinterpreted the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d in the endorsement as covering only the Fairfield beach property. The endorsement defines insured premises to include \u201cthe premises described below or designated in the policy as subject to this endorsement . . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues that this definition refers to two distinct types of premises. The first type is \u201cthe premises described below\u201d which refers to the Fairfield beach property. The second type of premises, she claims, are those premises \u201cdesignated in the policy as subject to this endorsement.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that the only premises subject to an endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ment are those premises described in the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision of the policy which appears on an earlier page entitled, in part, \u201cCoverage for Designated Premises.\u201d The plaintiff also argues that the use, in the endorsement, of the words \u201cadditional provisions\u201d preceding the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d suggests an intent on the part of the defendant company to <em>add </em>to the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d as already defined in the policy. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the endorsement deletes any reference to an alienated premises clause and limits the designation of insured premises to the Fairfield beach property.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The court must interpret the insurance contract as a whole with all relevant provisions considered together. <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>supra, 495; see also <em>Beckenstein </em>v. <em>Potter &amp; Carrier, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 120, 134, 464 A.2d 6 (1983). \u201cThe insurance contract includes the printed form policy, declarations therein, and any endorsements thereto. ... In construing an endorsement to an insurance policy, the endorsement and policy must be read together, and the policy remains in full force and effect except as altered by the words of the endorsement; conversely the endorsement modifies, to [the] extent of the endorsement, the terms and conditions of the original insurance contract. . . . If any irreconcilable conflict exists between provisions of the policy and provisions of an endorsement, then the latter must control.\u201d 13A J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 7537; see <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>655 F.2d 521, 524 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Independent School District, </em>355 N.W.2d 413, 418 (Minn. 1984); <em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>West Plains Air, </em>637 S.W.2d 444, 447 (Mo. App. 1982); <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Daddy$ Money, Inc., </em>646 S.W.2d 255, 259 (Tex. App. 1982); 1 G. Couch, Insurance (2d Ed.) \u00a7 436. The pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>vision in the endorsement defining insured premises states: \u201cThe definition of <em>\u2018insured premises\u2019 </em>is <em>amended </em>to read as follows: <em>\u2018insured premises\u2019 </em>means the premises described below or designated in the policy as subject to this endorsement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff, in making her claim, does not refer to the clause preceding the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d in the endorsement which purports to amend the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision defining \u201cinsured premises\u201d in the policy, nor does the plaintiff offer any reasonable rationale why we should disregard that particular language. To accept the plaintiffs interpretation of the endorsement as relating back and including the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision of the policy it would be necessary to disregard completely the clause preceding the definition of \u201cinsured premises,\u201d specifically the natural and ordinary meaning of the word \u201camended.\u201d \u201cEvery provision is to be given effect, if possible, and no word or clause eliminated as meaningless, or disregarded as inoperative, if any reasonable meaning consistent with the other parts of the policy can be given to it.\u201d <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>supra, 495. We have interpreted the word \u201camendment\u201d in reference to a statutory amendment as \u201ceffectpng] a change in the existing law.\u201d <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>193 Conn. 208, 232, 477 A.2d 988 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 676, 509 A.2d 20 (1986). The ordinary definition of the word \u201camend\u201d is \u201cto change or alter in any way, especially in phraseology.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. We find the clause preceding the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d in the endorsement as evidence of the parties\u2019 intent to have the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d in the endorsement supersede the definition in the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d portion of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The plaintiff, however, contends that the phrase immediately preceding the amendment clause should control our interpretation of the endorsement. That phrase states: \u201cIt is agreed that the insurance applies to the <em>insured premises, </em>subject to the following <em>additional </em>provisions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The \u201cadditional provisions\u201d language in that phrase, the plaintiff maintains, suggests that the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d includes the \u201cAdditional Definition\u201d provision in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The words \u201cadditional provisions\u201d in the phrase immediately preceding the amendment clause in the endorsement is general introductory language that applies to all four provisions appearing in the endorsement. There are two provisions within the endorsement that use language that indicates an express intent not to add to the provisions in the policy. The first provision is the subject of this appeal; the second provision specifically states with respect to operations at the insured premises: \u201cExclusion (p) is deleted.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If we were to interpret this introductory language of the endorsement, i.e., \u201cadditional provisions,\u201d to mean that each provision is to be added to the policy provision, then a question arises as to how we interpret the provision stating \u201cExclusion (p) is deleted\u201d and \u201c[t]he definition of <em>\u2018insured premises\u2019 </em>is amended.\u201d The plaintiff does not offer a reasonable legal basis for disregard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ing the specific language we refer to in either of these provisions and for relying solely on the general introductory language of the endorsement. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in its application of the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d in the endorsement, thereby denying the plaintiff relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38-175 provides: \u201cliability of insurer under liability policy. Each insurance company which issues a policy to any person, firm or corporation, insuring against loss or damage on account of the bodily injury or death by accident of any person, or damage to the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>erty of any person, for which loss or damage such person, firm or corporation is legally responsible, shall, whenever a loss occurs under such policy, become absolutely liable, and the payment of such loss shall not depend upon the satisfaction by the assured of a final judgment against him for loss, damage or death occasioned by such casualty. No such contract of insurance shall be cancelled or annulled by any agreement between the insurance company and the assured after the assured has become resposible for such loss or damage, and any such cancellation or annulment shall be void. Upon the recovery of a final judgment against any person, firm or corporation by any person, including administrators or executors, for loss or damage on account of bodily injury or death or damage to property, if the defendant in such action was insured against such loss or damage at the time when the right of action arose and if such judgment is not satisfied within thirty days after the date when it was rendered, such judgment creditor shall be subrogated to all the rights of the defendant and shall have a right of action against the insurer to the same extent that the defendant in such action could have enforced his claim against such insurer had such defendant paid such judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\"> Although the named insureds, on the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company policy No. 31 OLT 195229, were Lillian Goldman and Phyllis G.
