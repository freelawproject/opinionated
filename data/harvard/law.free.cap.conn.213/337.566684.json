In accordance with the attorney state trial referee\u2019s report, judgment was rendered for the defendant on both the complaint and the counterclaim. The plaintiff appealed this judgment to the Appellate Court which rendered an amended judgment for the defendant on the counterclaim. <em>Rowan Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Hassane, </em>17 Conn. App. 71, 549 A.2d 1085 (1988). We granted certification on the defendant\u2019s appeal and the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal, limited to the following questions: (1) Did the Appellate Court err in concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the report of the trial referee was untimely; and (2) If the objection was untimely, did the Appellate Court err in concluding that plenary review of the plaintiff\u2019s objection was nonetheless warranted?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The underlying facts are set forth fully in the decision of the Appellate Court. Id., 73-75. For the purpose of this appeal, we are concerned with the following. At the close of the pleadings on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, the court, sua sponte, assigned the action to an attorney state trial referee for hearing. Id., 73. In a finding of fact and decision, dated January 8, 1986, the referee \u201cfound\u201d for the defendant on the complaint and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>counterclaim, assessing the defendant\u2019s damages at $55,682.93. Both parties moved to correct these findings and on May 21,1987, the referee filed a corrected finding, increasing the award of damages on the counterclaim to $120,682.93. Id., 74. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment rendered on the referee\u2019s corrected report claiming, inter alia, error in accepting the report of the referee and in awarding damages to the defendant. Id., 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s challenge in the Appellate Court to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the referee\u2019s report was based on two objections it had filed to that report. On May 28, 1987, the plaintiff had filed an \u201cobjection to state trial referee reference\u201d of the case on the sole ground that the matter had been referred without its express consent. Id., 74. The plaintiff had filed a further objection to the referee\u2019s report on June 15,1987, that reiterated its objection of May 28, and included substantive objections to the report specified in Practice Book \u00a7 440.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate Court found that the May 28 objection to the referee\u2019s report was implicitly overruled on August 6,1987, by the rendering of judgment in accordance with the referee\u2019s reports. Id., 78. The court stated that the objection to the referee\u2019s report filed on May 28, 1987, was not a basis for challenge contemplated by Practice Book \u00a7 440. Id., 79. The court concluded, therefore, that the timely filing of the May 28 objection did not prevent the June 15 objection from being untimely. The court thus held that the June 15 objection, which included the substantive challenges to the report, was clearly untimely because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>was not filed within two weeks of the date of the referee\u2019s corrected report as mandated by Practice Book \u00a7 441.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id., 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Despite its finding that the plaintiff made no valid objection to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report, the Appellate Court nevertheless concluded that the trial court had \u201cerred substantially\u201d when it rendered judgment in the amount of $120,682.93, citing Practice Book \u00a7 4185<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as its authority to find error in the judgment even though the procedural problems would ordinarily bar the plaintiff\u2019s claim on appeal. Id., 79. The court found error in the measure of damages on the counterclaim and remanded the case with direction to render judgment on the counterclaim in a lesser amount. Id., 81. On certification to this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report was untimely, but erred in concluding that plenary review of the plaintiff\u2019s objection was nonetheless warranted. The plaintiff claims, conversely, that the Appellate Court erred in its ruling on the timeliness of the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the referee\u2019s report, but correctly concluded that review of this objection was warranted, despite the untimely objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Of primary significance in this case is the defendant\u2019s failure to object in the trial court, on the ground of untimeliness, to the plaintiff\u2019s June 15 objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>referee\u2019s corrected finding. The first time the defendant raised this objection was in his brief to the Appellate Court. We conclude, therefore, that <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 555 A.2d 986 (1989), decided after the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion in this case, is, by clear and cogent analogy, dispositive of the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In <em>Lo Sacco, </em>the sole issue was whether the Appellate Court had erred in limiting its review of the plaintiff\u2019s claims to plain error based on the plaintiff\u2019s untimely filing of a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, even though the defendants had not objected to the untimely motion. The Appellate Court declared, sua sponte, that the untimeliness of the plaintiff\u2019s motion was dispositive of the appeal, noting that Practice Book \u00a7 320 required such a motion to be filed within five days from the day the verdict is accepted or the judgment is rendered, which the plaintiff had failed to do. The court found no plain error and the plaintiff appealed to this court. Id., 505. We agreed with the defendant\u2019s contention that the filing deadline in Practice Book \u00a7 320 is a mandatory requirement. Id., 507. We then stated that the more important question before us was whether the time limit under Practice Book \u00a7 320 was a substantive requirement or a procedural requirement. Id., 507-508. We stated that \u201c[i]f it is the former, noncompliance with the rule is a jurisdictional defect that may be raised on the court\u2019s own motion, but if it is the latter, any defect caused by noncompliance with the rule may be waived by the opposing party and thus may not be raised by the court sua sponte.\u201d Id., 508. We then concluded that the time limitation of Practice Book \u00a7 320 is procedural rather than substantive, and that the Appellate Court had erred in raising the timeliness issue sua sponte, because the defendants had waived the nonjurisdictional defect. Id., 508-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>We turn now to the certified questions before us. We first must note that in applying the rationale of <em>Lo Sacco </em>to this case, we make no distinction between the term \u201cmust\u201d in Practice Book \u00a7 320 involved in <em>Lo Sacco </em>and the term \u201cshall\u201d in Practice Book \u00a7 441 involved in this case. \u201cWe have held other rules of practice that employ the term \u2018must\u2019 or a similar term to be mandatory. See <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>200 Conn. 400, 402-403, 510 A.2d 992 (1986); see also <em>Blonder </em>v. <em>Hartford Helicopters, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 618, 619-20,- 552 A.2d 427 (1989); <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>209 Conn. 609, 613-14, 553 A.2d 161 (1989).\u201d <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 507. We thus conclude that the Appellate Court was correct in finding that the plaintiffs objection to the referee\u2019s report was untimely. The court erred, however, in not finding this delay to be a procedural defect waived by the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the untimeliness in the trial court. This error does not require reversal of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision since that court, even though it erred in using the plain error standard of review, reached a result which the plaintiff-cross appellant seeks to sustain in this court. The defendant, likewise, cannot claim that a decision reached under the rigorous plain error standard would not necessarily have been reached under the ordinary civil standard of review. Although the court\u2019s conclusion that plenary review of the plaintiff\u2019s objection was warranted was erroneous, it is academic in view of our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 440 provides in relevant part: \u201cA party may file objections to the acceptance of a report on the ground that conclusions of fact stated in it were not properly reached on the basis of the subordinate facts found, or that the committee erred in rulings on evidence or other rulings or that there are other reasons why the report should not be accepted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> \u201c[Practice Book] \u00a7 441. time to file objections</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cObjections to the acceptance of a report shall be filed within two weeks after the filing of the report or finding, or if a motion to correct the report or finding has been made, within two weeks from the filing of the decision on the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\"> \u201c[Practice Book] \u00a7 4185.
