Later, after ad valorem property taxes imposed by Jackson County, Mississippi went unpaid, the property was sold to plaintiff-appellant Equity Trust Company at a tax sale. Equity Trust Company claims that it acquired title by that tax sale and ultimately filed suit to quiet title in a Mississippi state court. The defendant-appellee Secretary removed the action to federal court and counter-claimed for declaratory relief. The district court determined the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Equity Trust Company\u2019s suit and therefore dismissed it. The district court further found that the tax sale was void and therefore quieted title in favor of the Secretary. Both of these rulings are challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-21\">The Supreme Court has held that the Quiet Title Act \u201cprovide[s] the exclusive means by which adverse claimants [may] challenge the United States\u2019 title to real property.\u201d <em>Block v. N. Dakota ex rel. Bd. of Univ. &amp; Sch. Lands, </em>461 U.S. 273, 286, 103 S.Ct. 1811, 1819, 75 L.Ed.2d 840 (1983). Equity Trust Company ignores the Quiet Title Act and argues that Com gress waived sovereign immunity with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a). That statute provides, generally, that the Secretary may \u201csue and be sued\u201d over \u201cmatters arising by reason of\u2019 the VA loans program. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a)(1). In <em>Block, </em>the Supreme Court held not only that a Quiet Title Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>claim in federal court is the \u201cexclusive means\u201d by which a quiet title action may be brought against the federal government, it also recognized \u201cthe rule that a precisely drawn, detailed statute preempts more general remedies.\u201d <em>See </em>461 U.S. at 285-86, 103 S.Ct. at 1819. <em>Block </em>controls. A quiet title action against the federal government must be brought in federal court, and when the state court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, no jurisdiction is added by removal to federal court. <em>See Lopez v. Sentrillon Corp., </em>749 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2014), as revised (Apr. 28, 2014). The district court rightly concluded it was without subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Congress has the \u201cPower to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2. This Property Clause of the Constitution vests in the legislature \u201c \u2018the absolute right to prescribe\u2019 the manner in which its property is transferred.\u201d <em>In re Supreme Beef Processors, </em>Inc., 468 F.3d 248, 252 (5th Cir.2006) (en banc) (quoting <em>Gibson v. Chouteau, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 92, 99, 20 L.Ed. 534 (1872)). Absent congressional permission, government officials may not \u201crelease or otherwise dispose of\u2019 government property. <em>Royal Indem. Co. v. United States, </em>313 U.S. 289, 294, 61 S.Ct. 995, 997, 85 L.Ed. 1361 (1941). Moreover, \u201cfor the most obvious reasons of public policy,\u201d the property of the federal government \u201cearn not be seized by authority of another sovereignty, against the consent of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Ansonia Brass &amp; Copper Co., </em>218 U.S. 452, 471, 31 S.Ct. 49, 54, 54 L.Ed. 1107 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The Secretary has statutory authority to purchase property and may \u201csell, at public or private sale, exchange, assign, convey, or otherwise dispose of any such property.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a)(5). \u201cFor the purpose of facilitating the most expeditious sale, at the highest possible price,\u201d real property guaranteed by VA loans and obtained by the Secretary through foreclosure must be listed \u201cwith real estate brokers under such arrangements as the Secretary determines to be most appropriate and cost effective.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3733(d)(2). Thus, \u201c[t]he statutory scheme is clear: only the VA may sell property acquired under the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program.\u201d <em>Yunis v. United States, </em>118 F.Supp.2d 1024, 1036 (C.D.Cal.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Here, the property was sold pursuant to Mississippi state law. In the absence of consent from the federal government, that sale was invalid. <em>See United States v. Alabama, </em>313 U.S. 274, 282, 61 S.Ct. 1011, 1014, 85 L.Ed. 1327 (1941). According to Equity Trust Company, the required congressional permission is found in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a)(6), which provides that acquisition of property by the Secretary, \u201cshall not deprive any State or political subdivision thereof of its civil or criminal jurisdiction of, on, or over such property (including power to tax) or impair the rights under the State or local law of any persons on such property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">While the statute preserves local \u201cpower to tax,\u201d it does not permit local governments to seize and sell federal government property. Equity Trust Company therefore relies on the latter half of the provision, which states that acquisition of property shall not \u201cimpair the rights under the State or local law of any persons on such property.\u201d Equity Trust Company contends that that Jackson County is a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a)(6), meaning its right to sell the property at a tax sale was not impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>\u201cA proceeding against property in which the United States has an interest is a suit against the United States\u201d implicating sovereign immunity. <em>See Alabama, </em>313 U.S. at 282, 61 S.Ct. at 1014. This includes tax sales. <em>See id. </em>\u201cWaivers of the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity, to be effective, must be \u2018unequivocally expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nordic Village Inc., </em>503 U.S. 30, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 1014, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992) (quoting <em>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, 457, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990)). Further, \u201cwaivers of sovereign immunity should be narrowly construed in favor of the United States.\u201d <em>In re Supreme Beef Processors, Inc., </em>468 F.3d at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Section 3720(a)(6) is not an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity that permits Jackson County to sell federally owned property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, Equity Trust Company\u2019s argument that Jackson County, Mississippi is a person within the meaning of the statute is implausible. Section 3720(a)(6) distinguishes between \u201cState or political subdivision^]\u201d and \u201cpersons.\u201d It also distinguishes between \u201cpower\u201d (of local governments) and \u201crights\u201d (of persons). The tax sale of federally owned real estate was null and void, and the district court rightly quieted title in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">. Confronted with the same question, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania reached the same result. <em>See In re Upset Tax Sale, Sept. 13, 2006, </em>976 A.2d 1271, 1277 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2009) (\u201c[T]he language of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a)(6) does not provide unequivocal consent to a tax claim bureau to divest the V.A. of its property through an upset tax sale.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
