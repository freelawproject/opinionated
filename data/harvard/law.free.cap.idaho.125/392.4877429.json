The primary issue presented is whether the trial court properly issued a writ of mandate ordering the director (the director) of the Idaho department of water resources (the department) immediately to comply with I.C. \u00a7 42-602 and distribute water in accordance with the doctrine of prior appropriation. There are also issues concerning the award of attorney fees and the trial court\u2019s order prohibiting the payment of these attorney fees and costs from the Snake River Basin Adjudication account (SRBA account).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-22\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s issuance of the writ of mandate, its award of attorney fees, and the order prohibiting the payment of attorney fees and costs awarded from the SRBA account.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-24\">THE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-25\">Alvin and Tim Musser own real property (the Mussers\u2019 property) in Gooding County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Idaho, which has appurtenant to it a decreed right for 4.8 cubic feet per second (efs) of water from the Martin-Curran Tunnel (the tunnel) with a priority date of April 1, 1892. Howard \u201cButch\u201d Morris leases the Mussers\u2019 property together with the appurtenant water rights. In this opinion, we refer to the Mussers and Morris collectively as \u201cthe Mussers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The Mussers\u2019 property is located within water district 36A (the district). The district is served by a watermaster (the watermaster) appointed by the director. The springs which supply the Mussers\u2019 water are tributary to the Snake River and are hydrologically interconnected to the Snake plain aquifer (the aquifer).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In the spring of 1993, the Mussers found that the tunnel did not supply them with sufficient water to fulfill their adjudicated water rights. As a result, they contend they planted less acreage than they had previously and that many of their crops were lost and damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">On May 25, 1993, other owners of water rights from the tunnel demanded that the watermaster deliver water to them. The watermaster relayed the demand to the director who rejected the demand. On June 16,1993, the Mussers made a similar demand on the director for the \u201cfull and immediate delivery of their decreed water rights from the Curran Tunnel.\u201d The director denied the demand on the grounds that \u201cthe director is not authorized to direct the watermaster to conjunctively administer ground and surface water within Water District 36A short of a formal hydrologic determination that such conjunctive management is appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The Mussers sought a writ of mandate to compel the director: (1) to deliver their full decreed water rights, and (2) to control the distribution of water from the aquifer according to the priority date of the decreed water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The director and the department moved to dismiss the Mussers\u2019 request for a writ of mandate, arguing that the request was moot because after the Mussers initiated the action, the director issued a notice of intent to promulgate rules and a notice and order for a contested case. The proposed rules would allow the director to respond to the Mussers\u2019 demands by providing for the conjunctive management of the aquifer and the Snake River. The contested case would provide a forum for determining how to deliver the Mussers\u2019 water pending completion of the proposed rules. Alternatively, the director and the department contended the petition should be dismissed because a writ of mandate is an inappropriate method by which to litigate the relationship between senior and junior ground water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and concluded that the director owes the Mussers \u201ca clear legal duty to distribute water under the prior appropriation doctrine.\u201d The trial court determined that the director\u2019s failure to adopt rules and regulations enabling him to respond to the Mussers\u2019 demand for delivery of their water was a breach of his \u201cmandatory, ministerial duty.\u201d The trial court also said the director\u2019s refusal to honor the Mussers\u2019 demand was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and that the Mussers had no \u201cadequate, plain or speedy remedy at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The trial court issued a writ of mandate commanding the director \u201cto immediately comply with I.C. \u00a7 42-602 and distribute water in accordance with the Constitution of the State of Idaho and the laws of this state commonly referred to as the Doctrine of Prior Appropriation____\u201d The director and the department appealed and asked the trial court to stay the writ during the appeal. The trial court denied the motion to stay, noting: \u201cI don\u2019t see what there is in the writ of mandate that needs to be stayed since the department is proceeding to honor it in its entirety.\u201d This Court also denied the request of the director and the department to stay the writ during this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">The Mussers sought attorney fees in the trial court pursuant to I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-117 and 12-121 and the private attorney general doctrine. The trial court concluded that the director and the department acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law and defended the action frivolously, unreasonably and without foundation and that the Mussers were compelled to pursue private enforcement \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>require the director to perform a duty that is clear, unambiguous and constitutionally required.\u201d The trial court ruled that the Mussers are entitled to fees under all three of the theories advanced, and ordered that the costs and fees not be paid out of the SRBA account, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117(3). The director and the department appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY ISSUED A WRIT <em>OF </em>MANDATE COMMANDING THE DIRECTOR IMMEDIATELY TO COMPLY WITH I.C. \u00a7 42-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The director and the department assert that the trial court should not have issued the writ of mandate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In <em>Idaho Falls Redev. Agency v. Countryman, </em>118 Idaho 43, 794 P.2d 632 (1990), the Court recapitulated the requirements for the issuance of a writ of mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">In <em>Utah Power &amp; Light Co. v. Campbell, </em>108 Idaho 950, 953, 703 P.2d 714, 717 (1985), this Court stated that \u201c[m]andamus will lie if the officer against whom the writ is brought has a \u2018clear legal duty\u2019 to perform the desired act, and if the act sought to be compelled is ministerial or executive in nature.\u201d Existence of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, either legal or equitable in nature, will prevent issuance of a writ, and the party seeking the writ must prove that no such remedy exists. This Court has repeatedly held that mandamus is not a writ of right and the allowance or refusal to issue a writ of mandate is discretionary. Likewise, Idaho law requires that a writ must be issued in those cases where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 44, 794 P.2d at 633 (citations omitted). I.C. \u00a7 42-602 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">It shall be the duty of the director of the department of water resources to have <em>immediate direction and control </em>of the <em>distribution of water </em>from all of the streams, rivers, lakes, ground water and other natural water sources in this state to the canals, ditches, pumps and other facilities diverting therefrom. Distribution of water shall be accomplished either (1) <em>by water-masters </em>appointed as provided in this chapter and supervised by the director; <em>or (2) directly by employees of the department </em>of water resources under authority of the director in those areas of the state not constituted into water districts as provided in this chapter. <em>The director must execute the laws relative to the distribution of water in accordance with rights of prior appropriation as provided in section 42-106, Idaho Code.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-14\">The director of the department of water resources shall, in the distribution of water from the streams, rivers, lakes, ground water and other natural water sources, be governed by this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">I.C. \u00a7 42-602 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">We conclude that the director\u2019s duty to distribute water pursuant to this statute is a clear legal duty. The director himself testified that he was aware that his duty to deliver water under I.C. \u00a7 42-602 is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">The director contends, however, that although his duty under I.C. \u00a7 42-602 is mandatory, the statute leaves to the director\u2019s discretion the means that will be used to respond to calls for water. For more than three-quarters of a century, the Court has adhered to the following principle: \u201cThe fact that certain details are left to the discretion of the authorities does not prevent relief by <em>mandamus.\u201d Beem v. Davis, </em>31 Idaho 730, 736, 175 P. 959, 961 (1918) (emphasis in original). <em>See also Moerder v. City of Moscow, </em>74 Idaho 410, 415, 263 P.2d 993, 998 (1953) (\u201cPublic officials may, under some circumstances, be compelled by writ of mandate to perform their official duties, although the details of such performance are left to their discretion.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">This principle applies to this case. The director\u2019s duty pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 42-602 is clear and executive. Although the details of the performance of the duty are left to the director\u2019s discretion, the director has the duty to distribute water.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The director defended his refusal to honor the Mussers\u2019 demand by claiming that a \u201cpolicy\u201d of the department prevented him from taking action. In his testimony at the hearing to consider whether the writ would issue, the director referred to I.C. \u00a7 42-226 and stated that \u201ca decision has to be made in the public interest as to whether those who are impacted by groundwater development are unreasonably blocking full use of the resource.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">We note that the original version of what is now I.C. \u00a7 42-226 was enacted in 1951. 1951 Idaho Sess.Laws, ch. 200, \u00a7 1, p. 423. Both the original version and the current statute make it clear that this statute does not affect rights to the use of ground water acquired before the enactment of the statute. Therefore, we fail to see how I.C. \u00a7 42-226 in any way affects the director\u2019s duty to distribute water to the Mussers, whose priority date is April 1, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The Mussers presented evidence indicating that suing the director for damages was not a plain, adequate, and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law because of the ongoing nature of the harm and the difficulty in determining the damages they would incur due to the director\u2019s refusal to comply with I.C. \u00a7 42-602. The Mussers also contended that suing the director was inadequate because of the director\u2019s immunity from damages under I.C. \u00a7 6-904, a portion of the Idaho tort claims act.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The director and the department contend that the Mussers could have pursued administrative hearings before the director, administrative appeals, and motions for interim administration of water rights. We note that the only manner in which any of these asserted remedies were presented to the trial court was in the final argument by the attorney for the director and the department at the hearing concerning the request for the writ. There, the attorney argued that the Mussers should seek a hearing and then judicial review pursuant to I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 42-237e and 42-1701A. Because these were the only alternative remedies presented to the trial court, these are the only ones we will address.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">I.C. \u00a7 42-237e states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">Any person dissatisfied with any decision, determination, order or action of the director of the department of water resources____ made pursuant to this act may, if a hearing on the matter already has been held, seek judicial review pursuant to section 42-1701A(4), Idaho Code. If a hearing has not been held, any person aggrieved by the action of the director____ may contest such action pursuant to section 42-1701A(3), Idaho Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">By its terms, I.C. \u00a7 42-1701A(3) applies only to \u201cany applicant for any permit, license, certificate, approval, registration, or similar form of permission required by law to be issued by the director.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 42-1701A(3) concludes: \u201cJudicial review of any final order of the director issued following the hearing may be had pursuant to subsection (4) of this section.\u201d These provisions do not apply to the circumstances presented in this case. The Mussers did not seek a permit, license, certificate, approval, registration, or similar form of permission required by law to be issued by the director. Therefore, these remedies are not available to the Mussers to obtain review of the director\u2019s refusal to comply with I.C. \u00a7 42-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN AWARDING ATTORNEY FEES PURSUANT TO I.C. \u00a7 12-117 AND IN ORDERING THAT THE FEES AND COSTS NOT BE PAID FROM THE SRBA ACCOUNT.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">The director and the department assert that the trial court should not have awarded attorney fees to the Mussers and should not have ordered that the fees and costs not be paid from the SRBA account. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 and in ordering that the fees and costs not be paid from the SRBA account, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">I.C. \u00a7 12-117(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-17\">In any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency and a person, the court shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>award the person reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds in favor of the person and also finds that the state agency acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In awarding attorney fees and costs, the trial court concluded that by rejecting the Mussers\u2019 request to perform the duties mandated by I.C. \u00a7 42-602, the director acted without any reasonable basis in fact or law.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Recently, we have reiterated the standard by which we review the award of attorney fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">In those instances wherein attorney fees can properly be awarded, the award rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and the burden is on the person disputing the award to show an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>Fox v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, </em>121 Idaho 684, 685, 827 P.2d 697, 698 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Applying the three-step analysis of <em>Sun Valley Shopping Ctr. v. Idaho Power Co., </em>119 Idaho 87, 94, 803 P.2d 993, 1000 (1991), we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117. The trial court correctly perceived the award to be a discretionary act, acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the consideration of an award, and reached its decision by an exercise of discretion. We agree with the trial court that there was no reasonable basis in law or fact for the director\u2019s refusal to comply with I.C. \u00a7 42-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Citing I.C. \u00a7 12-117(3), the trial court ordered that the attorney fees and costs awarded to the Mussers not be paid out of the SRBA adjudication account. I.C. \u00a7 12-117(3) provides: \u201cExpenses awarded under this section shall be paid from funds in the regular operating budget of the state agency.\u201d The adjudication account is created under \u00a7 42-1777. This statute limits the use by the department of money in the account, \u201cupon appropriation by the legislature, to pay the costs of the department attributable to general water rights adjudications conducted pursuant to chapter 14, title 42, Idaho Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">The attorney fees and costs awarded to the Mussers were not costs of the department attributable to a general water rights adjudication. The Court has recently reiterated that the purpose of an award pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 is to deter groundless or arbitrary agency action and to provide a remedy for persons who have borne unfair and unjustified financial burdens attempting to correct mistakes agencies should never have made. <em>Lockhart v. Department of Fish and Game, </em>121 Idaho 894, 898, 828 P.2d 1299, 1303 (1992). Treating the trial court\u2019s award as costs of the department under I.C. \u00a7 42-1777 is inconsistent with this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Because we affirm the award of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117, we find it unnecessary to address the other bases for the award stated by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s issuance of the \u25a0writ of mandate, award of attorney fees and costs, and order that the attorney fees and costs not be paid out of the SRBA account.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">We award the Mussers costs on appeal. We also award the Mussers attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-18\">McDEVITT, C.J., and BISTLINE, TROUT and SILAK, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
