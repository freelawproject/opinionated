We conclude that in adopting an administrative rule establishing a probationary period of 1,040 hours of credited state service for state employees, the Idaho Personnel Commission (the commission) erroneously construed its statutory authority to adopt a rule establishing a probation period not to exceed six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">THE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">Cottie Hood was employed by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (the department) as a social worker specialist. On April 29, 1990, Hood was hired by the department as a probationary employee, working twenty-four hours each week. On March 25, 1991, approximately eleven months after she was hired as a probationary employee, Hood was given written notification that she would be terminated the following month for failure satisfactorily to complete her entrance probationary period. Hood filed a grievance with the department, stating that at the time she received her termination notice, she was no longer a probationary employee, because she had worked more than the maximum probationary period of six months established by I.C. \u00a7 67-5309(i). (Note that in 1993 this section was amended and this subdivision was redesignated as \u00a7 67-5309\u00a9.) Hood claimed she was entitled to a performance evaluation and various procedural safeguards before the department could terminate her. Hood also contended that, as a permanent employee, she could only be terminated for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">The department rejected Hood\u2019s grievance, relying on a rule of the commission, IDAPA 28.15.A.2.a, which sets the entrance probation period at \u201cone thousand forty (1040) hours of credited state service.\u201d (Note that IDAPA 28.15.A.2.a subsequently has been redesignated as IDAPA 28.01.01150.02.a.) One thousand forty hours of credited state service is equal to employment for six months at forty hours each week.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>IDAPA 28.15.C.1 (now IDAPA 28.01.-01152.01) requires the department, no later than thirty days after the expiration of the entrance probation period, to notify a probationary employee of the employee\u2019s failure to \u201cserve satisfactorily.\u201d The department determined that Hood did not complete the requisite 1,040 hours of service until February 27, 1991. The department took the position that pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-5309 and IDAPA 28.15.C.1 and 2, Hood was given timely notice of her termination. The department relied on IDAPA 28.15.A.2.a, to support its determination that Hood\u2019s termination was not a \u201cgrievable issue\u201d under I.C. \u00a7 67-5315(1), because Hood was a probationary employee at the time of the notice of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Hood appealed the rejection of her grievance to the commission, which assigned the matter to a hearing officer. The department moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The hearing officer denied the department\u2019s motion, ruling that pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-5309(i), Hood\u2019s six-month probationary period was completed October 28, 1990. The hearing officer concluded that because Hood did not receive an evaluation within thirty days after this date, and because no extension of the probationary period was requested by the state personnel director, Hood became a permanent classified employee by operation of law. Therefore, the hearing officer decided, Hood could only be terminated for cause. The hearing officer remanded the proceeding to the department with instructions to reinstate Hood to her former position, to certify Hood as a permanent classified employee without loss of pay or benefits, and to reconsider Hood\u2019s grievance. The heaidng officer denied an award of attorney fees to Hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The department appealed the hearing officer\u2019s determination to the full commission. The commission reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision, concluding that IDAPA 28.15.-A.2.a is a valid construction of I.C. \u00a7 67-5309(i), and affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s denial of attorney fees to Hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Hood appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the district court. The district court affirmed the commission\u2019s decision, finding that IDAPA 28.15.A.2.a is a valid construction of the legislative guidelines provided in I.C. \u00a7 67 \u2014 5309(i). The district court declined to reach the issue of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Hood appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">BY PROVIDING FOR A PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF \u201c1040 HOURS\u201d IN IDAPA 28.15.A.2.a, RATHER THAN SIX CALENDAR MONTHS, THE COMMISSION ERRONEOUSLY CONSTRUED I.C. \u00a7 67-5309(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Hood asserts that in promulgating IDAPA 28.15.A.2.a, the commission erroneously construed I.C. \u00a7 67 \u2014 5309(i). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">In <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Tax Com\u2019n, </em>120 Idaho 849, 820 P.2d 1206 (1991), the Court reaffirmed the validity of the rule of deference to agency construction of statutes. To aid in determining the appropriate level of deference to be given, the Court established a \u201cfour-prong test\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Q\">The court must first determine if the agency has been entrusted with the responsibility to administer the statute at issue. Only if the agency has received this authority will it be \u201cimpliedly clothed with power to construe\u201d the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-15\">The second prong of the test is that the agency\u2019s statutory construction must be reasonable____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-17\">The third prong for allowing agency deference is that a court must determine that the statutory language at issue does not expressly treat the precise question at issue____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-19\">If an agency, with authority to administer a statutory area of the law, has made a reasonable construction of a statute on a question without a precise statutory answer then, under the fourth prong of the test, a court must ask whether any of the rationales underlying the rule of deference are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 862, 820 P.2d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-21\">Addressing the first prong of the <em>Simplot </em>test, the Court must determine whether the commission has been entrusted with the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>sponsibility to administer I.C. \u00a7 67-5309(i). I.C. \u00a7 67-5309 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">The commission shall have the power and authority to <em>adopt ... </em>such rules ... as may be necessary for proper administration of this act. Such rules shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">(1) A rule establishing a probation period not to exceed six (6) months for all appointments ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Clearly, the legislature entrusted the commission with the responsibility to administer I.C. \u00a7 67-5309\u00ae by establishing a probationary period within the statutory limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The second prong of the <em>Simplot </em>test directs the Court to determine whether the commission\u2019s construction of I.C. \u00a7 67-5309\u00ae is reasonable. We conclude that the commission\u2019s construction of I.C. \u00a7 67-5309\u00ae in IDAPA 28.15.A.2.a is not reasonable. I.C. \u00a7 73-114 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">Statutory terms defined.\u2014 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">The following words have, in the compiled laws, the signification attached to them in this section, unless otherwise apparent from the context:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">4. The word \u201cmonth\u201d means a calendar month, unless otherwise expressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">It is not reasonable in light of this definition for the commission to construe \u201csix months\u201d to mean \u201cone thousand forty (1,040) hours of credited state service.\u201d Whatever utility the commission may have concluded its definition provided, it is not within the statutory limit set by I.C. \u00a7 67-5309\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Under the third prong of the <em>Simplot </em>test, the Court must decide whether the language of I.C. \u00a7 67-5309(i) expressly requires that the probationary period established by the commission not exceed six calendar months, whether the employee works part-time or full-time. The Court will not defer to the commission\u2019s construction, if the construction contradicts the clear expression of the legislature. <em>Simplot, </em>120 Idaho at 862, <em>820 P.2d </em>at <em>1219. </em>The legislature has clearly indicated that the maximum period of probation for \u201call appointments\u201d is six calendar months. The commission\u2019s construction contradicts this express provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">Because of our conclusions that the commission\u2019s construction of the statute was not reasonable and contradicts the clear expression of the legislature, it is not necessary for us to address the fourth prong of the <em>Simplot </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">HOOD IS NOT ENTITLED TO ATTORNEY FEES IN THIS APPEAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">Hood asserts that she is entitled to attorney fees from the department under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 for successfully challenging the probationary period in excess of six calendar months. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-19\">In <em>Lockhart v. Department of Fish and Game, </em>121 Idaho 894, 898, 828 P.2d 1299, 1303 (1992), the Court restated the purpose of I.C. \u00a7 12-117:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-20\">(1) to serve as a deterrent to groundless or arbitrary agency action; and (2) to provide a remedy for persons who have borne unfair and unjustified financial burdens defending against groundless charges or attempting to correct mistakes agencies should never ha[ve] made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-21\"><em>Id. </em>at 898, 828 P.2d at 1303 (quoting <em>Bogner v. State Dep\u2019t of Revenue &amp; Taxation, </em>107 Idaho 854, 859, 693 P.2d 1056, 1061 (1984)) (brackets in original). Citing <em>Moosman v. Idaho Horse Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>117 Idaho 949, 793 P.2d 181 (1990), the Court also stated that \u201cwhere a state agency had no authority to order a particular action, it acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.\u201d <em>Lockhart, </em>121 Idaho at 898, 828 P.2d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-22\">Although we have concluded that the commission acted outside its authority by setting the probationary period at 1,040 hours of credited state service, we conclude that the department did not act unreasonably in following the commission\u2019s invalid rule and relying on the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AEL1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\">CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"ASK\">We reverse the decision of the commission and remand the matter to the commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"A5-\">We award Hood costs, but not attorney fees, on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"Axm\">McDEVITT, C.J., BISTLINE and SILAK, JJ., and HART, J.
