At approximately 10:00 p.m., June 22, 1990, Mitchel John Odiaga (\u201cOdiaga\u201d) drove a white Oldsmobile into Ketchum, Idaho. Odiaga then shot and killed Gerald \u201cShenendoa\u201d Wright (\u201cWright\u201d) and Bruce Schafer (\u201cSchafer\u201d). The shootings occurred within minutes of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">Odiaga proceeded to Warm Springs Road, where he exited his car. Jerry Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d) was driving down Warm Springs Road, toward Odiaga. Odiaga brought his rifle to bear on Johnson, who dove across the front seat of his car. A bullet from Odiaga\u2019s rifle entered the driver\u2019s-side window of the car, passed over Johnson, and exited through the passenger\u2019s side door.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">After driving through two police roadblocks, Odiaga drove his vehicle out of Ketchum, toward Galena Summit. Idaho State Policeman Ross Kirtley followed Odiaga north on Highway 75 toward Galena Summit. Officer Kirtley soon found Odiaga\u2019s vehicle overturned in the barrow pit alongside the road. Odiaga was not in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-21\">At approximately 3:80 a.m., June 23, Odiaga approached Gary Perdue, a city marshall from Stanley, at a roadblock on the highway. Odiaga, carrying his rifle, approached Officer Perdue and said \u201cthere\u2019s been a terrible accident.\u201d Officer Perdue took the rifle from Odiaga, who did not resist, and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-22\">Before entering a plea, Odiaga moved for a hearing to determine his competency to stand trial. The State did not contest the contention that Odiaga was not competent and, on September 13, 1990, the trial court entered an order suspending the proceedings. Odiaga was committed to the Director of the Department of Corrections for care and treatment at the Idaho Secure Medical Facility. The court ordered that Dr. Estess, a psychiatrist assigned to the State Board of Corrections, function as a court-appointed doctor, with the power to treat Odiaga. In a letter dated December 14, 1990, Dr. Estess informed the court that Odiaga was competent to stand trial. Odiaga entered a plea of not guilty to all counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-23\">Prior to trial, Odiaga moved the court to order that, if Odiaga lacked the capacity to appreciate his conduct or to conform his conduct with the requirements of the law, he should be acquitted. Odiaga also moved for a post-indictment preliminary hearing. The Court denied both of Odiaga\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-24\">The State then moved to compel a psychiatric evaluation of Odiaga. The State argued that, because Odiaga was relying on psychiatric evaluations as a key part of his defense, the State should be entitled to compel an evaluation under Idaho Code \u00a7 18 \u2014 211(5)(d). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>compel, ordering that Odiaga\u2019s attorneys could be present during the evaluation, the evaluation would be recorded, and the prosecutors would be prohibited from specifically inquiring into privileged information. If improper or inadmissible information was obtained, the court held that Odiaga could move to suppress it.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">On February 28, 1991, Odiaga filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him or, in the alternative, to suppress statements made \u201cto any state agent or evidence derived therefrom\u201d on the grounds that the statements were elicited in violation of Odiaga\u2019s rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Odiaga argued that various law enforcement personnel denied him access to counsel, and improperly elicited several statements after he invoked his right to counsel. After hearing extensive evidence on this issue, the trial court suppressed the statements Odiaga made to arresting and interrogating officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">On July 16, 1991, the defense filed a motion asking the court to direct the State to stop administering all antipsychotic and psychotropic medications to Odiaga. The defense reasoned that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s demeanor has probative value, and anti-psychotic medication artificially alters his demeanor, thus denying him a fair trial, due process, and the right to effectively be present at trial____\u201d The trial court reserved ruling on the matter, stating that the record indicated medication was necessary for the defendant to be competent to stand trial. Odiaga\u2019s attorney stated that Odiaga would waive his right to be competent at trial if the court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The court later denied the motion from the bench, reasoning that there was no proof of what would happen if Odiaga were to be taken off medication. The court found that, according to Dr. Estess, the only reason Odiaga was presently competent was because of the medication. The court also held that expert witnesses could adequately inform the jury what effect the medication was having on Odiaga\u2019s demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">During the trial, the defense moved to exclude cross-examination and rebuttal regarding Odiaga\u2019s prior acts of violence and illegal drug abuse. The court reserved ruling on the motion in limine, indicating that the issues raised on direct examination would determine the admissibility of the evidence. After Odiaga called and examined Dr. Estess, the State asked the court to rule that they could inquire into Odiaga\u2019s specific acts of violence and drug abuse. The court ruled that issues raised by the defense on direct examination justified admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The jury returned a verdict finding Odiaga guilty of two counts of second degree murder, one count of attempted first degree murder, and two counts of aggravated assault. The jury found Odiaga not guilty of aggravated or simple assault on the count relating to Officer Perdue. The jury also found that Odiaga used a deadly weapon and/or firearm in the commission of each crime for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">At the sentencing hearing, the court heard testimony from Dr. Estess, Dr. Beaver, Odiaga\u2019s father, a statement from Odiaga, and considered a presentence investigation report. The court then sentenced Odiaga to concurrent minimum determinate life sentences for each second degree murder conviction; an enhanced determinate sentence of thirty years, fifteen years determinate, for the attempted first degree murder conviction, with an additional determinate fifteen year enhancement for use of a firearm or deadly weapon; and enhanced determinate sentences of fifteen years for both counts of aggravated assault, consisting of five years for each aggravated assault conviction and an additional determinate term of ten years for the use of a firearm or deadly weapon on each count. The court ordered that all sentences be served concurrently at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution, and authorized treatment during the period of confinement as prescribed by Dr. Estess or his successor. Odiaga appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">A. Did the trial court err by denying Odiaga\u2019s motion to be taken off anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>psychotic and psychotropic medications?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">B.

Was the State\u2019s violation of Odiaga\u2019s constitutional rights by questioning him after he invoked the right to counsel without first providing him with a public defender so \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d as to warrant an acquittal?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">F. Did the trial court err by allowing the State to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of Odiaga?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">G. Was the trial court\u2019s sentence excessive?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">A. Did the trial court err by denying Odiaga\u2019s motion to be taken off antipsychotic and psychotropic medications?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">On May 18,1992, six months after the trial court entered the judgment of conviction against Odiaga, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Riggins v. Nevada, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1810, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992). <em>Riggins </em>presented the precise issue this Court now faces: under what conditions can a trial court order that a criminal defendant be administered antipsychotic medication against his or her will?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">We note at the outset that Odiaga did not challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling under the Idaho Constitution. Our analysis is therefore restricted to issues raised under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>See State v. Raudebaugh, </em>124 Idaho 758, 763, 864 P.2d 596, 601 (1993) (refusing to consider issue raised under Idaho Constitution when presented for first time in reply brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-20\">Under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Riggins, </em>once Odiaga moved to terminate the administration of antipsychotic medication, \u201cthe State became obligated to establish the need for [the medication] and the medical appropriateness of the drug.\u201d <em>Riggins, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1815. The burden rests with the prosecution to show that medication is medically appropriate, essential to protect some significant interest, such as Odiaga\u2019s safety or the safety of others, and that no less obtrusive means of protecting that interest exists. <em>Id. </em>In this ease, the trial court erred by placing the burden on Odiaga to show what would happen if he were taken off antipsychotic medications. The record presents neither a finding of what would happen if the medication were terminated during trial nor any discussion of less obtrusive alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-23\">The trial court also based its holding on the argument that terminating Odiaga\u2019s medication could render him incompetent to stand trial. Although this issue was not directly presented to the United States Supreme Court in Riggins,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is clear that the trial court similarly violated Odiaga\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by requiring that he come forward with a showing that he could remain competent without medication. The court improperly placed this burden on Odiaga, rather than requiring the State to prove that the medication was necessary for this purpose and that no less obtrusive alternative was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-24\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Riggins </em>was announced after the trial court entered judgment against Odiaga. However, the present case is presented to this Court on direct review, which requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that this Court give the federal constitutional issues decided in <em>Riggins </em>full retroactive effect. As the United States Supreme Court recently announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">When [the federal Supreme Court] applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and <em>must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review </em>and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7JK\"><em>Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 2517, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The trial court\u2019s order denying Odiaga\u2019s motion to terminate treatment violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. We therefore reverse the judgment of conviction, and remand this case for a new trial. Because we order a new trial on appeal, this Court \u201cshall pass upon and determine all questions of law involved in the case presented upon such appeal, and necessary to the final determination of the case.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 1-205; <em>Bott v. Idaho State Bldg. Auth., </em>122 Idaho 471, 479, 835 P.2d 1282, 1290 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">B. Does the absence of an insanity defense in Idaho violate the Idaho and United States Constitutions?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The validity of I.C. \u00a7 18-207, eliminating mental condition as a defense in criminal proceedings, is now established in Idaho case law. <em>See State v. Winn, </em>121 Idaho 850, 854, 828 P.2d 879, 883 (1992) (\u201cIt is well established that the absence of an insanity defense ... does not violate any constitutional protections.\u201d); <em>State v. Card, </em>121 Idaho 425, 429, 825 P.2d 1081, 1085 (1991) (\u201cabsence of the insanity defense ... does not violate any constitutional protections\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 321, 121 L.Ed.2d 241 (1992); <em>State v. Searcy, </em>118 Idaho 632, 637, 798 P.2d 914, 919 (1990) (\u201cdue process ... does not constitutionally mandate an insanity defense\u201d). Odiaga presents no new basis upon which to consider the constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 18-207, but simply asserts that this Court should reconsider its prior rulings on the subject. Having previously decided this question, and being presented with no new basis upon which to consider the issue, we are guided by the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>to adhere to the law as expressed in our earlier opinions. <em>See Card, </em>121 Idaho at 444, 825 P.2d at 1100 (McDevitt, J., specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">C. Did the trial court err by allowing the State to introduce evidence of Odiaga\u2019s prior bad acts?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Idaho Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides that \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person____ It may, however, be admissible for other purposes.\u201d If relevant to another issue at trial, evidence of other bad acts must nonetheless be excluded \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury----\u201d I.R.E. 403. The decision to admit evidence of prior crimes and bad acts requires balancing the importance of the purpose for which it is offered under I.R.E. 404(b) with the extent of its likely prejudicial effect under I.R.E. 403. This balancing \u201cis a matter for the exercise of the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>117 Idaho 891, 896, 792 P.2d 916, 921 (1990) (quoting <em>State v. Stuart, </em>110 Idaho 163, 170, 715 P.2d 833, 840 (1985) <em>(affirmed on rehearing)). </em>Thus, our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling is limited to determining whether the court abused its discretion by admitting the evidence of Odiaga\u2019s prior bad acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">Odiaga asserts that the court erred by admitting evidence of his prior marijuana and LSD use, threats of violence, and violent acts. However, Odiaga elicited the first testimony regarding acts and threats of violence during his direct examination of Dr. Estess, and did not object to the first reference to prior marijuana use. <em>See State v. Orr, </em>123 Idaho 55, 56-57, 844 P.2d 684, 685-86 (1992) (this Court will not consider an issue not raised before the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-18\">The State moved the trial court to allow cross-examination into Odiaga\u2019s prior LSD use after Odiaga\u2019s direct examination of Dr. Estess. Although the trial court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>previously ruled that the State could not present evidence of Odiaga\u2019s prior bad acts, the court granted the State\u2019s motion, finding that Odiaga\u2019s direct examination provided a basis upon which the evidence was admissible. The court reasoned that the defense may have placed Odiaga\u2019s character at issue. If so, that was a sufficient justification by itself under I.R.E. 404. The court also found that the defense \u201copened the door\u201d for admission of this evidence by selectively raising issues from Odiaga\u2019s past, dating back to his childhood. Also, experts called by the defense testified that this evidence was part of the basis for their opinions. Dr. Estess specifically stated that the evidence should be considered on the issue of intent, and that the evidence offered a reasonable alternative explanation for the events of June 22nd. The court also ruled that the evidence was proper impeachment of testimony elicited by the defense that Odiaga had a normal childhood and other defense witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding past acts of bizarre behavior. Finally, the court ruled that the evidence is relevant to determining whether Odiaga\u2019s intoxication was voluntary or involuntary, and rebuts the defense\u2019s contention that Odiaga was self-medicating with Sudafed at the time of the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The trial court\u2019s focus on these issues properly balanced the issues of relevance and potential prejudice under I.R.E. 408. Even if this evidence were not properly admissible at the time the court originally granted Odiaga\u2019s motion in limine to exclude it, the extensive evidence the defense elicited during direct examination provided sufficient justification for the court\u2019s later ruling. <em>See State v. Enno, </em>119 Idaho 392, 407, 807 P.2d 610, 625 (1991) (character evidence properly rebutted by State when offered and admitted by the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">D. Does a defendant who has been indicted by a grand jury have a right to a post-indictment preliminary hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Odiaga argues that he was denied due process because he was indicted by a grand jury instead of being accused through a preliminary hearing. There is no constitutional basis upon which to base this claim. The Idaho Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be held to answer for any felony or criminal offense of any grade, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury or on information of the public prosecutor----\u201d Idaho Const, art. I, \u00a7 8. No language in the Idaho Constitution indicates that the two accusatory proceedings are anything other than alternatives to one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">In <em>State v. Edmonson, </em>113 Idaho 230, 743 P.2d 459 (1987), this Court specifically held that \u201cthe prosecutor can use <em>either </em>a grand jury proceeding or a preliminary hearing before an impartial magistrate to initiate criminal proceedings.\u201d 113 Idaho at 232, 743 P.2d at 461 (emphasis added). The Court went on to conclude that \u201can indictment by a grand jury does not afford the accused a right to a preliminary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indictment and information both afford criminal defendants all of the process that is due at the accusatory stage in the proceedings. The trial court did not err by denying Odiaga\u2019s motion for a post-indictment preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">E. Was the State\u2019s violation of Odiaga\u2019s constitutional rights by questioning him after he invoked the right to counsel without first providing him with a public defender so \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d as to warrant an acquittal?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">Odiaga was first given his <em>Miranda </em>rights immediately after his arrest at approximately 3:30 a.m., June 23, 1990. After asking to have his <em>Miranda </em>rights read to him again, Odiaga invoked his right to counsel. However, police officers repeatedly questioned Odiaga without providing an attorney. The public defender requested access to Odiaga from the morning of June 23rd until appointed by a magistrate to represent him on June 25th. Prior to this incident, all local police agencies were notified by letter that Mr. Elkins would be taking public defender appointments during June 1990. The letter also demanded, under I.C. \u00a7 19-853(a)(2), that Mr. Elkins be immediately notified if any suspect without his or her own attorney was detained for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">Although the public defender was not appointed until June 25th, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>correctly concluded that questioning between the time of Odiaga\u2019s arrest and that appointment was \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d implicating Odiaga\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>See State v. Ybarra, </em>102 Idaho 573, 576, 634 P.2d 435, 438 (1981) (\u201cThe test for determining whether questioning is custodial or merely investigative is whether the person is in custody or deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d). Odiaga was promptly advised of his constitutional rights before and during this interrogation, and invoked his right to counsel by saying \u201cI\u2019d just as soon hire an attorney.\u201d The police extensively questioned Odiaga after he made this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Based on these facts, Odiaga moved the trial court to suppress statements elicited after Odiaga invoked his right to counsel or, alternatively, to dismiss the charges against him. The court granted Odiaga\u2019s motion to suppress in substantial part. On appeal, Odiaga assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to suppress testimony about a telephone conversation between Odiaga and his cousin\u2019s wife while he was in custody and the fact that it did not dismiss the prosecution against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Odiaga did not include testimony about the telephone conversation in his motion to suppress, presented no argument on the issue at trial, and did not object to any portion of the court\u2019s order granting the motion to suppress. Odiaga\u2019s sole objection to this testimony at trial was that the State did not provide sufficient notice that the witness would be called for rebuttal. Evidence before the trial court indicated that the State received the information shortly before it was offered, and that the defense had interviewed this witness and was aware of the statements more than a year before they were offered. Both at trial and on appeal, Odiaga states no prejudice from the late disclosure of the information. The proper test in this situation is to determine \u201cwhether lateness of disclosure so prejudiced defendant\u2019s preparation or presentation of his defense that he was prevented from receiving his constitutionally guaranteed fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Pizzuto, </em>119 Idaho 742, 751, 810 P.2d 680, 689 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 1268, 117 L.Ed.2d 495 (1992). In this case, although the State\u2019s disclosure was late in the proceedings, the record indicates that the defense was aware of this witness and her potential testimony for more than a year before the testimony was offered. Even if the State\u2019s behavior had violated the duty to disclose, the trial court\u2019s refusal to exclude the evidence is not reversible error absent a showing of prejudice. <em>State v. March, </em>112 Idaho 860, 868, 736 P.2d 1314, 1322 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The question of whether this testimony resulted from the State\u2019s withholding Odiaga\u2019s access to counsel, after repeated requests from both Odiaga and Mr. Elkins, was not presented to the trial court and is not properly resolved here. If that issue is presented during the new trial ordered in this case, it will be a matter for the trial court to determine at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Alternatively, Odiaga relies on dictum from <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973), as a basis for dismissing the charges. That opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">We may some day be presented with a situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">411 U.S. at 431-32, 93 S.Ct. at 1642-43. While the State\u2019s actions were constitutionally defective, the court suppressed all testimony derived through those actions. The only prejudice Odiaga can plausibly argue at this point is from the admission of testimony about the telephone conversation, which was not included in this motion to suppress. If that issue is presented to the trial court, it would then be proper to consider the evidence and its relation to the motion to suppress or dismiss. At this juncture, there is no basis upon which Odiaga can allege significant prejudice which was not properly cured by the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the State\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>F. Did the trial court err by allowing the State to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of Odiaga?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 13 of the Idaho Constitution prohibit compelling a criminal defendant to be a witness against himself or herself. Following Idaho\u2019s repeal of the insanity defense, no statutory scheme remains through which a psychological evaluation can be compelled without threatening the rights guaranteed under both of those constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">This procedure also directly implicates the psychotherapist-patient privilege provided under I.R.E. 503. That rule provides that, in criminal proceedings, the patient may \u201crefuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional condition____\u201d I.R.E. 503(b)(2). Although I.R.E. 503(d)(3) states that \u201c[tjhere is no privilege under this rule as to a communication relevant to an issue of the ... mental or emotional condition of the patient in any proceeding in which he relies upon the condition as an element of his claim or defense[,]\u201d in the wake of Idaho\u2019s repeal of the insanity defense, mental defect is no longer an assertable defense. This rule, and pre-repeal ease law recognizing the State\u2019s right to compel a psychological evaluation of a defendant who pleads the defense of insanity, no longer apply. As a result, we conclude that the trial court erred by allowing the State to compel Odiaga to submit to a psychological evaluation. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 18-207(a) (\u201cMental condition shall not be a defense to any charge of criminal conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The State urges that the trial court had \u201cinherent authority\u201d to compel a psychiatric evaluation, and analogizes the situation to medical examination in civil suits. However, this view ignores the plain language of I.R.E. 503, which allows such examinations when they pertain to an element of a claim or defense put in issue by the patient. This analysis also ignores the unique constitutional difficulties posed when a criminal defendant is compelled to submit to an examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">G. Was the trial court\u2019s sentence excessive?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">This Court\u2019s task when reviewing the reasonableness of the sentence imposed below is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Charboneau, </em>124 Idaho 497, 499, 861 P.2d 67, 69 (1993) (quoting <em>State v. Broadhead, </em>120 Idaho 141, 143, 814 P.2d 401, 403 (1991)). The record clearly shows that the trial court properly applied I.C. \u00a7 19-2520, the criteria for placing the defendant on probation or imposing imprisonment, and the four objectives of criminal punishment stated by this Court in <em>State v. Wolfe, </em>99 Idaho 382, 582 P.2d 728 (1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question presented in this case is whether the trial court exercised its discretion consistently with the legal standards for considering mental capacity at sentencing set out by I.C. \u00a7 19-2523(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2523, which requires that the trial court consider the defendant\u2019s mental illness as a sentencing factor, was an integral part of the legislature\u2019s repeal of mental condition as a defense. <em>See </em>S.L.1982, ch. 368 \u00a7 2 (abolishing mental condition as a defense); S.L.1982, ch. 368 \u00a7 10 (requiring consideration of mental condition at sentencing). That statute requires that, if the defendant\u2019s mental condition is a significant issue, the sentencing judge must consider such factors as;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-16\">(a) The extent to which the defendant is mentally ill;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-17\">(b) The degree of illness or defect and level of functional impairment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-18\">(c) The prognosis for improvement or rehabilitation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-19\">(d) The availability of treatment and level of care required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>(e) Any risk of danger which the defendant may create for the public, if at-large, or the absence of such risk;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">(f) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law at the time of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">I.C. \u00a7 19-2523(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The trial court properly considered the first five factors, noting that Odiaga is seriously mentally ill under (a) and (b); that the prognosis for rehabilitation under (c) is limited to some relief from the symptoms of the psychosis, with no cure likely; that the appropriate treatment in (d) is available at the secure facility; and that Odiaga is potentially dangerous if he stops taking his medication, creating a potential risk to the public that should be considered under (e). With regard to Odiaga\u2019s capacity to appreciate and conform his conduct, the court found that, although all of the medical experts testified that Odiaga was not capable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law, the jury found to the contrary, and the court agreed with the jury\u2019s conclusion. Because Odiaga\u2019s capacity was not an issue presented to the jury, the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard to the choices available to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The trial court apparently concluded that the jury\u2019s finding that Odiaga possessed the intent necessary to commit murder involved the same inquiry into capacity required at sentencing by I.C. \u00a7 19-2523(1). <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 18-4001 (\u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought____\u201d). The jury\u2019s finding that Odiaga possessed the intent necessary to commit murder was not the finding as to the degree of his capacity to appreciate and conform his conduct required by I.C. \u00a7 19-2523.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Before any defendant can be sentenced, that person must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the offense with which he or she is charged, including the intent to commit the offense. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-114 (\u201cIn every crime or public offense there must exist a union, or joint operation, of act and intent, or criminal negligence.\u201d); 18-115 (\u201cThe intent or intention is manifested by the circumstances connected with the offense, and the sound mind and discretion of the accused.\u201d). By requiring the court to consider the defendant\u2019s capacity at sentencing, the legislature necessarily required that the court consider the defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate his or her actions separately from the ability to form the requisite intent to commit the offense. The trial court therefore erred by incorrectly applying the legal standard for determining intent to the issue of the Odiaga\u2019s capacity to appreciate and conform his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-14\">BISTLINE, JOHNSON, TROUT and SILAK, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-16\">. The Supreme Court referred to this issue, commenting that \u201cthe state might ... justify medically appropriate, involuntary treatment with the drug by establishing that it could not obtain an adjudication of Riggins' guilt or innocence by using less intrusive means.\u201d <em>Riggins, </em>\u2014\u2022 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 1815. However, the Court did not rule on this issue, holding that \"[t]he issue of whether a competent criminal defendant may refuse antipsychotic medication if cessation of medication would render him incompetent at trial is not before us.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\">. The factors to be considered in sentencing which this Court listed in <em>Wolfe </em>are: (1) protection of society; (2) deterrence of the individual and the public generally; (3) the possibility of rehabilitation; and (4) punishment or retribution. <em>Wolfe, 99 </em>Idaho at 384, 582 P.2d at 730; <em>see also State v.
