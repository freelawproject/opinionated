An injured worker sued a company the worker alleges is liable pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223, a portion of the workers\u2019 compensation law, for the injury as a third party who is not the worker\u2019s direct or statutory employer. We conclude that the company was not a third party as contemplated by the statute, but instead was a special employer of the worker, who was a loaned employee of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">THE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Industrial Personnel, Inc. (IP) is a temporary employment agency which supplies workers for most of the major lumber manufacturers in north Idaho. IP contracted with Idaho Forest Industries (IFI) to provide workers for IFI. The agreement between IP and IFI refers to a worker provided pursuant to this agreement as the \u201cgeneral employee\u201d of IP and as the \u201cspecial employee\u201d of IFI. The agreement specifies that the worker is under the exclusive supervision and control of IFI while on the job site. The agreement states that IFI has the right to terminate the worker. IFI pays IP a fee for the worker, from which IP pays the worker\u2019s wages and acquires workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the worker covering the work for IFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Robert W. Lines went to IP seeking employment. IP assigned Lines to work at one of IFI\u2019s lumber mills. Before Lines went to work at the IFI mill, he read and signed the IP employee handbook, agreeing that IP was his \u201cgeneral employer,\u201d that IFI was his \u201cspecial employer,\u201d and that if he were injured while working for IFI, he would be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits provided under the insurance provided by IP.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Lines was injured while working at the IFI mill. State Insurance Fund (SIF), the workers\u2019 compensation insurer which IP paid to cover Lines while he was working at the IFI mill, paid medical and disability benefits to Lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">Lines sued IFI, alleging that IFI\u2019s negligence caused his injury and that IFI is liable pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">Third party liability. \u2014 (1) The right to compensation under [the workers\u2019 compensation law] shall not be affected by the fact that the injury ... is caused under circumstances creating in some person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages therefor, such person so liable being referred to as the third party. Such third party shall include those employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code [requiring every employer to secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits in one of the authorized ways].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">The pertinent portions of I.C. \u00a7 72-216 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-17\">Contractors. \u2014 (1) Liability of employer to employees of contractors and subcontractors. An employer subject to the provisions of [the workers\u2019 compensation law] shall be liable for compensation to an employee of a contractor or subcontractor under [the employer] who has not complied with the provisions of section 72-301 [requiring every employer to secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits in one of the authorized ways] in any case where such employer would have been liable for compensation if such employee had been working directly for such employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">The trial court granted summary judgment denying Lines\u2019s claim on the ground that IFI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>was not a third party referred to in I.C. \u00a7 72-228. After Lines moved for reconsideration, SIF was granted leave to intervene. At IFI\u2019s request, the trial court amended the summary judgment and included a provision holding SIF liable for payment to Lines of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits awardable with regard to the injury Lines received at the IFI mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Lines appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">IFI IS NOT LIABLE AS A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO I.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00a7 72-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Lines asserts that IFI is a third party who is liable for Lines\u2019s injury pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Lines argues that IP is a contractor or subcontractor under IFI, within the contemplation of I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-216 and 72-223, citing <em>Runcorn v. Shearer Lumber Prod., Inc., </em>107 Idaho 389, 690 P.2d 324 (1984). This is not a case like <em>Runcorn, </em>however.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">In <em>Runcorn, </em>the company (Shearer) that the worker (Runcorn) sought to hold liable as a third party pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223, had contracted with Runcorn\u2019s employer (Atlas) for Atlas to repair a boiler on Shearer\u2019s premises. Runcorn was injured during the repair. The Court concluded: \u201cShearer was an employer, described in I.C. \u00a7 72-216, since it had under it a contractor, Atlas, and Shearer was hable for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to Runcorn if Atlas had not provided the coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 690 P.2d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The primary distinction between Shearer in <em>Runcorn </em>and IFI in this case is that IP is not a contractor \u201cunder\u201d IFI. IFI did not contract with IP for IP to do any work for IFI. Instead, IP merely loaned an employee to IFI according to the terms of the agreement between IP and IFI. This characterization of the relationship among Lines, IP, and IFI is confirmed by the recent decision in <em>Hill v. E &amp; L Farms, </em>123 Idaho 371, 848 P.2d 429 (1993). In <em>Hill, </em>the Court said: \u201c[I]n a two-employer situation, the \u2018right to control\u2019 test is the primary determinative test, with the existence of a contract for hire, express or implied, and whether the work being done is essentially that of the special employer as secondary, \u2018[ajdditional factors germane to loaned employee status.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 848 P.2d at 431. The undisputed facts in this case indicated that both the right of control and the secondary, additional factors noted in <em>Hill </em>are present in the relationship between Lines and IFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">We conclude that Lines was the loaned employee of IFI. As a loaned employee, Lines was working for IFI at the time of the injury, not for IP as a contractor or subcontractor under IFI. Therefore, IFI is not a third party who is liable for Lines\u2019s injury pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">LINES DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT HAD JURISDICTION TO DETERMINE THAT SIF IS LIABLE FOR PAYMENT OF LINES\u2019S WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION BENEFITS.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">Lines asserts that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to determine that SIF is liable for payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Lines. We do not address this question, because it is not a final judgment determining Lines\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">I.A.R. 11(a)(1) provides that an appeal may be taken as a matter of right from a final judgment, order, or decree in a civil action. In <em>Nelson v. Whitesides, </em>103 Idaho 374, 647 P.2d 1246 (1982), the Court pointed out: \u201cThe final judgment or decree to which I.A.R. 11(a)(1) refers \u2018means a \u201cfinal determination of the rights of the parties.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 647 P.2d at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">The trial court\u2019s determination that SIF is hable for payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Lines is not a final determination of Lines\u2019s rights. Yet to be determined is the amount of compensation to which Lines is entitled. If there is a dispute about the amount of compensation, the Industrial Commission will resolve the dispute. <em>Cf. Law v. Omark Indus., </em>121 Idaho 128, 823 P.2d 162 (1992) (decision of the Industrial Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>awarding medical benefits, but not determining impairment or disability, not a final order subject to appeal under I.A.R. 11(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s summary judgment denying Lines\u2019s claim against IFI pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We dismiss the appeal as it relates to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to determine SIF\u2019s liability for workers\u2019 compensation payments awardable to Lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">We award IFI costs on appeal. IFI did not request attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b501-9\">McDEVITT, C.J., and BISTLINE, TROUT and SILAK, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
