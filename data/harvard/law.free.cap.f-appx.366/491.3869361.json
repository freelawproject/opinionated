She contends that the district court erred by enhancing her offense level by eight, pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), based on her two state drug possession convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tions. Citing <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Pena contends that the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d does not include simple possession offenses and thus her state convictions are not aggravated felonies as that term is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). She further argues that her second state drug possession offense does not correspond to a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act because recidivist proceedings were not invoked in her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008), we held that, even after <em>Lopez, </em>a second state conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance qualifies as an aggravated felony that supports the imposition of the eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
