Parker argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion when it resentenced him to 236 months\u2019 imprisonment, despite the parties\u2019 Joint Stipulation agreeing to a sentence of 210 months; (2) a sentence of 236 months is not a reasonable sentence; and (3) the district court had the discretion to sentence Parker below the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">I. Effect of the Joint Stipulation</p>\n<p id=\"b156-17\">Parker first argues that the district court abused its discretion by amending Parker\u2019s sentence to 236 months instead of 210 months, given that, in the Joint Stipulation filed by the parties, the Government did not object to Parker\u2019s request that his sentenced be reduced to 210 months. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in reducing Parker\u2019s sentence to 236 months instead of 210 months as requested by Parker in the Joint Stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-18\">The district court, in its order directing a response concerning retroactive application of the crack cocaine amendment as to Jerry Parker, encouraged the parties to confer regarding Parker\u2019s eligibility for a sentence reduction. The court, however, did not direct the parties to stipulate to a specific reduced sentence, and in fact the Government did not stipulate that Parker\u2019s sentence should be reduced to the low end of the sentencing range. The Government merely did not oppose Parker\u2019s request for a low-end sentence. Nothing in the statute or caselaw suggests that a post-sentencing stipulation of this nature could limit a district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cBoth the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>guage of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this circuit\u2019s precedent indicate that the sentencing court\u2019s power to reduce a sentence is discretionary.\u201d). Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in failing to reduce Parker\u2019s sentence to 210 months, as requested by Parker in the Joint Stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">II. Reasonableness of the Reduced Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Parker next argues that his reduced sentence of 236 months is not a reasonable sentence. We review the reasonableness of a sentence imposed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court did not abuse its discretion by reducing Parker\u2019s sentence to the mid-point of the new, amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce a term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court must (1) \u201crecalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines,\u201d and (2) \u201cdecide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose a new sentence within the amended guidelines range or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court is not required to articulate the applicability of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor as long as the record demonstrates that the court took the factors into account. <em>Id. </em>at 1219.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Parker was originally sentenced to 294 months, a mid-range sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines based on his offense level and criminal history. Pursuant to Amendment 706, Parker was entitled to a reduction of his offense level from 37 to 35. Given Parker\u2019s criminal history, the appropriate sentence range for his new offense level is 210 to 262 months. The district court once again imposed a sentence in the middle of the relevant range, i.e. 236 months. Thus, in setting Parker\u2019s reduced sentence at the middle of the new sentencing range, the district court took into account the mid-range determination made at the original sentencing hearing. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760 (explaining that the district court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guidelines range and holding all other guidelines findings made at the original sentencing hearing constant).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The record also demonstrates that, in reducing Parker\u2019s sentence, the district court took into account the Sentencing Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Parker has not shown that the district court overlooked any material facts concerning his individual suitability for a lower sentence. Therefore, the district court\u2019s reduction of Parker\u2019s sentence to the middle, rather than the low end, of the new range was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">III. Discretion to Sentence Below the Amended Guideline Range</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Finally, Parker argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the district court had discretion to amend Parker\u2019s sentence to below the amended guideline range. We reject this argument based upon the Sentencing Guidelines and our prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Any reduction in a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issues by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that the court shall \u201cnot reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). Moreover, we have expressly held that, (1) \u201cif the defendant\u2019s original sentence was within the then-applicable guidelines range, at resentencing, the district court has no discretion to impose a sentence below the amended guidelines ranges\u201d and (2) <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>\u201cdo not apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>576 F.3d at 1219 (citing <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191-92 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In the instant case, there is no doubt that Parker\u2019s original sentence was within the then-applicable guidelines range. Therefore, the district court had no discretion to impose a sentence below the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">. \"The factors to be considered under section 3553(a) include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the applicable sentencing range under the guidelines; (5) any pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statement; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims.\u201d <em>United States v.
