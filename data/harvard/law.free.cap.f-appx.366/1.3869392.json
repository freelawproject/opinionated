Herna-ni contends that he should be allowed to use a visa petition for purposes of a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>adjustment of status application under INA \u00a7 245 after previously using the same visa petition to obtain permanent resident status. We find no merit to Hernani\u2019s argument and affirm the ruling of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Hernani\u2019s first 1-485 application for permanent residence was approved on March 7, 1997. This application was based on a visa petition his father, who was a permanent resident, filed for him. On the 1-485 application, Hernani checked a box stating that he had never committed any crime of moral turpitude or any drug related offense. When Hernani later applied to become a naturalized citizen it was discovered that Hernani had been convicted of possession of cannabis prior to his application for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Hernani was subsequently served with notice of removal proceedings due to the fact that he had fraudulently procured his permanent resident status. On March 19, 2007, Hernani asserted that he was eligible to submit an application to adjust his status under INA \u00a7 245 and waive his fraud and marijuana possession under INA \u00a7 212(h) and (i). Hernani argued that because fraud occurred in the application for permanent resident status he was never lawfully accorded permanent residence status. Thus, Hernani concluded that he never \u201cused\u201d the visa petition and it remained available to him for the current INA \u00a7 245 status adjustment petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The IJ found that Hernani could adjust his status under INA \u00a7 245 and waive his fraud and marijuana possession under INA \u00a7 212(h) and (i), if he had an immigrant visa that was approved and current. However, the IJ found that the visa petition from Hernani\u2019s initial application for permanent resident status had been \u201cused.\u201d Therefore, Hernani did not have an approved and current visa and his petitions were denied. Hernani appealed to the BIA where the IJ\u2019s decision was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">When examining a petition for review, we \u201cmust first consider whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petition at all.\u201d <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2004). \u201cWe review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s order, so we review the BIA\u2019s order. We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-13\">On appeal, Hernani contends that we have jurisdiction to review his question of law regarding when an immigration visa and visa petition is used and when they are available for purposes of an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245. We do not have jurisdiction to review denials of certain types of discretionary relief, including the denial of an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245 (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). However, we do have jurisdiction to review constitutional questions and questions of law that an alien raises in his petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because the issue of whether Hernani \u201cused\u201d the visa petition when he applied for an adjustment of status in 1997 is a question of law, we have jurisdiction to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Hernani relies on <em>In re Koloamantangi, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 548, 549-50 (BIA 2003), to support his argument that his visa petition was not \u201cused\u201d in his initial application for permanent resident status. \u201c[A]n alien was not \u2018lawfully\u2019 admitted for permanent resident status if, at the time such status was accorded, he or she was not entitled to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550; <em>see also Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1317 (11th Cir.2006) (adopting the BIA\u2019s definition of \u201clawful\u201d from <em>Koloamantangi). </em>The fact that Hernani fraudulently entered information on his initial permanent resident application means that he was never lawfully admitted to permanent resident status. Hernani then concludes that because he was never lawfully admitted to permanent resident status his visa petition was never \u201cused\u201d and thus that visa petition is available for use in his current INA \u00a7 245 application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The U.S. Attorney General has the discretion to admit an alien for lawful permanent residence if (1) the alien applies for an adjustment, (2) the alien is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) \u201can immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.\u201d INA \u00a7 245(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">When a visa petition has been approved, and subsequently a new petition by the same petitioner is approved for the same preference classification on behalf of the same beneficiary, the latter approval shall be regarded as a reaffirmation or reinstatement of the validity of the original petition, <em>except </em>when the original petition has been terminated pursuant to section 203(g) of the Act or revoked pursuant to part 205 of this chapter, or <em>ivhen an immigrant visa has been issued to the beneficiary as a result of the petition approval.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(h)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">The BIA has found that this regulation applies where a petitioner used his original visa petition to become a lawful permanent resident, was placed in cancellation of removal proceedings based on a criminal conviction, and applied for an adjustment of status based on his original visa petition. <em>See In re Villarreal-Zuniga, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 886, 887-90 (BIA 2006). <em>In re Villarreal-Zuniga </em>ruled that once the visa petition was used to adjust the petitioner\u2019s status, it could not be used to adjust his status a second time. <em>Id. </em>at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">Hernani argues that his case is different from the facts in <em>In re Villarreal-Zuniga. </em>The petitioner in <em>In re Villarreal-Zuniga </em>was lawfully admitted as a permanent resident and then attempted to use the same visa petition for adjustment of status proceedings when he was facing removal. Hernani, however, was never considered to have been lawfully admitted as a permanent resident. Hernani argues that this means that his visa petition was \u201cused\u201d and thus <em>In re Villarreal-Zuniga </em>does not control his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">\u201c[Ojnce an approved visa petition is used to obtain a benefit, it cannot be used again.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 889. Regardless of whether Hernani\u2019s receipt of permanent resident status was actually lawful, he did in fact receive it and maintain the status for a number of years. This receipt and maintenance of permanent resident status, however dubious, was a benefit that Hernani received from the use of the visa petition. Therefore, we find that Hernani used the visa petition and cannot use it a second time for his current adjustment of status. Thus, when Hernani applied to adjust his status a second time he did not have an immediately available immigration visa and was ineligible to apply for lawful per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>manent residence under INA \u00a7 245. Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Hernani\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
