Tompkins claims that his 96-month sentence, which was at the high end of the properly calculated guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable and that he should have been sentenced below or at the low end of the guidelines range. Tompkins asserts that the district court did not apply the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors properly in that (1) it failed to consider what he deems to be his minimal role in the offense and (2) it created an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and that of his codefendant, who joined Tompkins in the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-19\">A defendant whose motion for a downward departure has been overruled may argue on appeal that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court \u201cfailed adequately to consider factors counseling in favor of a downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>552 U.S. 868, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). Reasonableness review is bifurcated; if a review of the sentence for procedural error reveals none, the appellate court then determines whether the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If error has been preserved, an appellate court reviewing for reasonableness \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Given that Tompkins disclaims procedural error, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>need only consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of [his] sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Substantive reasonableness is determined in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Although he argued in the district court that he played but a minimal role in the assault and therefore merited a sentence below or at the low end of the guidelines range, Tompkins did not, when given the chance, specifically object to the sentence actually imposed. Consequently, there may be some question whether he is entitled to review for abuse of discretion or merely for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). However, as Tompkins is unable to show either abuse of discretion or plain error, we need not decide which standard of review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">While Tompkins testified that he did not administer the permanent injuries that his cellmate suffered in the assault, it is clear that Tompkins failed to persuade the district court that this was so and that the PSR\u2019s statement to the contrary was incorrect. A sentencing court may rely on information in the PSR in making factual determinations about a sentence unless the defendant shows, by credible rebuttal evidence, that the PSR is untrue or inaccurate. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>558 F.3d 371, 376-77 (5th Cir.2009). Although it made no explicit credibility determinations, when the district court adopted the PSR over Tompkins\u2019s objections it implicitly rejected Tompkins\u2019s testimony that he played only a small part in inflicting the permanent injuries suffered by his cellmate. The district court was not required to accept Tompkins\u2019s self-serving declarations, made with the purpose of reducing his sentence, about the circumstances of his crime. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Tompkins\u2019s parity argument is equally unavailing. In considering an appropriate sentence, the district court must account for \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(6). But Tompkins and his codefendant were not similarly situated. Tompkins is a career offender; the codefendant is not. <em>Cf. United States v. Duhon, </em>440 F.3d 711, 721 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Being -within the properly calculated guidelines range, Tompkins\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456; <em>see also United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). The district court, moreover, gave extensive consideration to Tompkins\u2019s argument for a sentence at the low end of or below the guidelines range but determined that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record before it counseled in favor of a sentence at the high end of that range. And even if we were to agree with Tompkins that the sentence that he proposed was a more reasonable one, that would be insufficient justification for not deferring to the district court\u2019s decision to impose the sentence that it selected. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
