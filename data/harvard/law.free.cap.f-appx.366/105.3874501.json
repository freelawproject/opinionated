After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), cert <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Clayton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Clayton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most of the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C., amends. 706, 713. Because Clayton was designated a career offender at his original sentencing, his offense level was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Thus, Amendment 706 had no effect on Clayton\u2019s ultimate sentencing range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28 (concluding that defendant sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering the applicable guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Clayton\u2019s argument that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis on which to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion), <em>cert denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Clayton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>was ineligible for resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court had no authority to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or the advisory guidelines range or exercise its discretion to impose a new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">To the extent Clayton challenges his original sentence on due process and equal protection grounds, these arguments are outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings to cases where retroactive amendment affects the applicable sentencing range); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencings and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resen-tencing issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court's conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\">. Clayton's reliance on <em>United States v. Knox, </em>573 F.3d 441 (7th Cir.2009), is misplaced. <em>Knox </em>involved a direct appeal of an original sentence challenging a district court's pre-<em>Kimbrough </em>conclusion that it could not consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity in the guidelines in deciding whether to impose a sentence below the advisory guidelines range. 573 F.3d at 446. <em>Knox </em>was not an appeal of a denial \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 and does not support Clayton\u2019s argument that, even though his sentencing range is based on his career offender status, he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because he was convicted of conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
