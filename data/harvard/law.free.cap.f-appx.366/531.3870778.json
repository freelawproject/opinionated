The district court enhanced the sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) after it determined that Hernandez-Perez intentionally or recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the aliens he transported. Hernandez-Perez contends that the circumstances of his offense do not warrant the sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and reviews its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511, 514 (5th Cir.2005). It is undisputed that Hernandez-Perez transported fifteen persons in a vehicle rated to carry seven passengers and that thirteen of his passengers lacked safety restraints and were \u201clying on top of each other\u201d in the vehicle\u2019s rear compartment. As the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.1 gives \u201ccarrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle or vessel\u201d as an example of reckless conduct that would support a sentence enhancement under that Guideline, we perceive no error in Hernandez-Perez\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.1, comment. (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
