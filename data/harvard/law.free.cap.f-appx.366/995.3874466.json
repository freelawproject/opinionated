In his supporting brief, in addition to arguing about the reconsideration order, Shimi-zu also appears to attack the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s underlying orders denying asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. This appeal raises two issues, namely (1) whether we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Shimizu\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief; and (2) whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying Shimizu\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">On appeal, Shimizu appears to challenge the merits of the BIA\u2019s final removal order, denying his request for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. He argues that the BIA erred in sustaining the IJ\u2019s alleged adverse credibility finding, as the finding was predicated on his purported omission of his homosexual status from his first asylum application, although such status was irrelevant to his initial claim of political persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-15\">We review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). We do not have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal if the petition for review is not filed within this deadline, as \u201cthe statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is mandatory and jurisdictional, [and] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe filing of [a] reconsideration motion does not toll the time to petition for review.\u201d <em>Stone v. I.N.S., </em>514 U.S. 386, 395, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1544, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>see also Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3 (citing <em>Stone </em>for the proposition that the time for filing a petition for review \u201cis not suspended or tolled by the [filing of] a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>motion to reopen the removal proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Because Shimizu did not file his petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s order denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to consider the merits of that decision. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Shimizu next argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion for reconsideration because, in doing so, the BIA sustained the Id\u2019s alleged adverse credibility finding. A review of the record shows that Shimizu raised essentially the same claim in his appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (addressing motions to reopen). Motions to reconsider are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (discussing motions to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); see also INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). \u201cHowever, a motion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute specifying errors of fact or law as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">We conclude from the record that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Shimizu\u2019s motion to reconsider because the motion merely reiterated arguments that the BIA previously had considered and rejected. Accordingly, we deny Shimizu\u2019s petition in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss Shimizu\u2019s petition in part and deny his petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">PETITION DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
