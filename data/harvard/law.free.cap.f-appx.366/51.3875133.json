On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment for NORS prematurely, because there were pending motions against NORS based on discovery abuses. He also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions for sanctions based on NORS\u2019s failure to comply with discovery requests. He contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for NORS on his disparate-treatment claim because it erroneously found that he did not suffer an adverse employment action by being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>moved to an isolated cubicle and that he could not show that NORS\u2019s stated reason for the move \u2014 complaints by female coworkers about his behavior \u2014 was pretextual. Finally, he argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his failure-to-promote claim because, contrary to the district court\u2019s findings, there were vacancies open, and he was qualified for a promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s discovery orders and evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Porter v. Ogden, Newell &amp; Welch, </em>241 F.3d 1334, 1338 (11th Cir.2001). A party must show substantial harm to its case from the denial of requests for additional discovery. <em>Leigh v. Warner Bros., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 1210, 1219 (11th Cir.2000). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are to be construed liberally. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 governs motions for summary judgment. The rule states that a defending party may move for summary judgment at any time, but the motion must be served at least ten days before the day set for hearing. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). We have held that the rule requires a court to give ten days\u2019 advance notice to parties when it takes a motion for summary judgment under advisement. <em>See Burns v. Gadsden State Cmty. Coll, </em>908 F.2d 1512, 1516 (11th Cir.1990). Under Rule 56(f), a party may move for a continuance to conduct additional discovery to respond to a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Almeida v. Amazon.com, Inc., </em>456 F.3d 1316, 1327 n. 6 (11th Cir. 2006); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">In <em>Fernandez v. Bankers Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>906 F.2d 559, 570 (11th Cir.1990), we considered whether the district court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment without permitting the plaintiff to obtain relevant discovery. While a motion to compel production of records was pending, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment and denied the motion to compel as moot. <em>Id. We </em>held that, where the plaintiff informed the court that the defendant had not produced documents that were relevant to the disposition of the motion for summary judgment and the case, the district court erred in not ruling on the motion to compel before granting summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 570-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">In <em>Leigh, </em>a trademark and copyright-infringement case, the plaintiff argued that the district court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment without allowing him to conduct additional discovery. 212 F.3d at 1219. We held that reversal of a grant of summary judgment was inappropriate where the additional discovery sought either already was possessed by the plaintiff \u2014 in that case, evidence to establish that the photograph was trademarked \u2014 or could not counter the showing that there was a substantial dissimilarity between the plaintiffs photograph and the defendant\u2019s work. <em>Id. </em>at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">The record here demonstrates that Guimaraes had sufficient opportunity to conduct discovery, he did not move for a continuance, and NORS substantially complied with discovery orders. Additionally, Guimaraes has not shown substantial harm, because he either possessed the requested discovery or the discovery would not have changed the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>SCADIF, S.A. v. First Union Nat\u2019l, </em>344 F.3d 1123, 1130 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Under Rule 11, a party may move for sanctions in some situations, but the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>explicitly states that it \u201cdoes not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions under Rules 26 through 37.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(d). Under Rule 16(f), a court may impose sanctions if a party or its attorney violates a scheduling or other pretrial order, including a discovery order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f)(1)(C). We have upheld the denial of sanctions where the non-moving party had not timely produced documents but the documents in question were \u201cof minimal relevance.\u201d <em>SCADIF, </em>344 F.3d at 1130. We have held that \u201cdistrict courts have discretion to decide if there is a pattern of delay or a deliberate refusal to comply with court orders or directions that justifies a sanction\u201d under Rule 16. <em>United States v. Samaniego, </em>345 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir.2003). Pursuant to Rule 26(g), a court may impose sanctions for discovery objections that are frivolous or submitted with an improper purpose, such as causing unnecessary delay or to harass. Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(g)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Because the record demonstrates that NORS substantially complied with discovery orders, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.\" Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment should be granted if evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the non-movant, shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1085. \u201cA mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party will not suffice to overcome a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Young v. City of</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\"><em>Palm Bay, Fla., </em>358 F.3d 859, 860 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">A three-step burden-shifting analysis is applied to evaluate discrimination claims based on circumstantial evidence. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). First, the plaintiff must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, which, if met, creates a rebut-table presumption of unlawful discrimination. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). Second, if a <em>prima facie </em>case is established, the burden shifts to the employer to present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment action. <em>Id. </em>Third, the plaintiff may then present evidence sufficient to permit a factfinder to conclude that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is not the real reason for the action. <em>Id. </em>A plaintiff may do so by either directly \u201cpersuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State of Ala. State Tenure Comm\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe district court must evaluate whether the plaintiff has demonstrated such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, ineo-herencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997) (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>marks omitted). We have applied the burden-shifting analysis from <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>to claims under the ADEA based on circumstantial evidence. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In <em>Knight v. Baptist Hosp. of Miami, Inc., </em>330 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir.2003), we held that a plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment by showing that (1) she was a member of a protected class, (2) she was subjected to an adverse job action, (3) her employer treated similarly-situated employees outside her class more favorably, and (4) she was qualified to do her job. The methods of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case \u201care not fixed; they are flexible and depend to a large degree upon the employment situation.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1087. We have typically required a showing of causality in harassment and retaliation cases, rather than disparate-treatment cases. <em>See, e.g., Webb-Edwards v. Orange County Sheriffs Office, </em>525 F.3d 1013, 1028 (11th Cir.2008) (harassment); <em>Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1453, 1454 (11th Cir.1998) (race-based retaliation). To constitute an adverse employment action, \u201cthe employer\u2019s action must impact the \u2018terms, conditions, or privileges\u2019 of the plaintiffs job in a real and demonstrable way\u201d and must be a \u201cserious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err in finding that NORS\u2019s movement of Guimaraes to a cubicle farther away from other employees was not an adverse employment action. We also conclude that Guimaraes has failed to show that NORS\u2019s stated reason for the move \u2014 complaints from female coworkers \u2014 is unworthy of credence or not the real reason for the move.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">A plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination based on failure to promote by showing that: (1) he belonged to a protected class; (2) he was qualified for and applied for a position; (3) despite qualifications, he was rejected; and (4) the position was filled with an individual outside the protected class. <em>See Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Group Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1348 n. 2 (11th Cir.2007) (racial-discrimination case); <em>Ramsey v. Chrysler First, Inc., </em>861 F.2d 1541, 1543 (11th Cir.1988) (ADEA failure-to-promote case).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The Supreme Court noted in <em>Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 358 n. 44, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1866 n. 44, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), that, under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>a plaintiff must \u201cdemonstrate at least that his rejection did not result from the two most common legitimate reasons on which an employer might rely to reject a job applicant: an absolute or relative lack of qualifications or <em>the absence of a vacancy in the job sought.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Guimaraes has not demonstrated that he applied for a promotion \u2014 because there were no positions available \u2014 or that NORS\u2019s stated reason for not promoting him \u2014 because there was nowhere to promote him \u2014 was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and its orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
