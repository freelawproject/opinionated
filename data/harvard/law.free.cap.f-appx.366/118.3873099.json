Reyes, through counsel, seek review of a Board of Immigration Appeals order denying their motion to reopen removal proceedings. Specifically, the Hodges argue that the BIA erred in denying their motion to reopen because they received ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-27\">In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings, we employ \u201ca deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of review.\u201d <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 827, 834, - L.Ed.2d - (2010); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">An alien may file one motion to reopen removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c). \u201cMotions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u2018where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (quoting <em>I.N.S. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). Generally, an alien must file a motion to reopen proceedings \u201cwithin 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). We have said that the statutory ninety-day filing deadline \u201cis mandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The BIA dismissed the Hodges\u2019 appeal of the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision on May 30, 2008. The Hodges filed their motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel approximately five months later, on October 27, 2008. The Hodges\u2019 motion to reopen was clearly untimely. We can find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of the Hodges\u2019 clearly untimely motion to reopen. <em>See Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150. Even if equitable tolling of the ninety-day statutory deadline was permitted, the Hodges do not argue in their brief that the deadline should be tolled in their case and have therefore abandoned that issue. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Even were we to reach the substance of the Hodges\u2019 ineffective assistance argument, the result of this appeal would not change because that argument is fatally flawed. An alien may base a motion to reopen on ineffective assistance of counsel, as \u201c[i]t is well established in this Circuit that an alien in civil deportation proceedings ... has the constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause to a fundamentally fair hearing to effective assistance of counsel where counsel has been obtained.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2005) (emphasis omitted). We have explained that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of a removal hearing must show prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 1274. \u201cPrejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">The Hodges argue in their motion to reopen and in their appellate brief that their counsel did not meet with them in order to prepare for their removal proceedings. However, the Hodges attached to their motion to reopen a complaint they filed with the Florida bar in which they said that they met with their attorney twice prior to the removal proceedings. Either way, other than a conelusory statement that their attorney\u2019s actions caused them prejudice, the Hodges fail to demonstrate or even address how additional meetings with their counsel in preparation for the removal proceedings would have changed the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>at 1275. Because the Hodges make no showing that their counsel\u2019s allegedly ineffective assistance prejudiced them, their motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>assistance of counsel is fundamentally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Hodges\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely. <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150. Additionally, the Hodges failed to show prejudice as required when an alien moves to reopen or reconsider removal proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1274-75. For either of these reasons, we cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied the Hodges\u2019 motion to reopen; we therefore deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-17\">. The Hodges filed a second motion to reopen with the BIA, and that motion was based on changed circumstances in Colombia, the country to which removal had been ordered. The Hodges raise no challenge to the BIA's determination that the Hodges failed to demonstrate a material change of conditions in Colombia. The Hodges have therefore abandoned that issue. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
