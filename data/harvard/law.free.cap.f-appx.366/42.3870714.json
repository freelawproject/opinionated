Vincent Settle, III, appointed counsel for Robert Allen, in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further x*epresentation of the appellant because, in his opinion, the appeal is without merit. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Allen\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIR1MED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
