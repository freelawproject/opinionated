Homrighausen appeals the district court\u2019s order that (1) denied his motion for return of property ($8,040 in cash) filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), and (2) simultaneously directed that the funds Homri-ghausen sought to have returned be deposited with the U.S. Treasury, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(f), as payment for Homri-ghausen\u2019s legal representation. After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Homrighausen\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion, but dismiss Homrighausen\u2019s appeal to the extent he seeks review of the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3006A(f) payment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">This is Homrighausen\u2019s second appeal regarding his motion for return of property. In 2006, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrested Homrighausen in connection with a bank robbery and seized $3,040 found in his pocket. A federal grand jury indicted Homrighausen for bank robbery, but the indictment did not include a forfeiture count. Because at an initial appearance hearing Homrighausen indicated that he did not have funds to hire a lawyer, a magistrate judge appointed an assistant public defender to represent Homrighausen pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(b). After trial, the jury found Homrighausen not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">On the same day that the district court entered a judgment of acquittal, Homri-ghausen filed a Rule 41(g) motion for the return of the $3,040 seized at the time of his arrest. The government did not respond to this motion. Without notice or a hearing, the district court entered an order denying Homrighausen\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion and directing that the $3,040 be paid to the Treasury to defray the costs of hiring the public defender to represent Homrighausen.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">On appeal, this Court vacated the district court\u2019s order and remanded with instructions that \u201cif the district court wants to remit the funds to the Treasury as reimbursement, it must comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(f) and the procedures outlined in <em>Bursey. </em>Failing that, the district court must return the funds to Homri-ghausen.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Homrighau-sen, </em>327 Fed.Appx. 124, 126 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">Section 3006A(f) permits a district court to direct that funds be deposited in the Treasury as a reimbursement when the court \u201cfinds that funds are available for payment from or on behalf of a person furnished representation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(f). Our decision in <em>Bursey </em>prohibits the district court from summarily disbursing funds to the Treasury under \u00a7 3006A(f) and requires the district court to first \u201cmake an \u2018appropriate inquiry\u2019 as to the availability of the funds for payment as required under subsection (f).\u201d 515 F.2d at 1236, 1238 (quoting \u00a7 3006A(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-16\">On remand, the district court held an initial hearing and ordered the government to respond to Homrighausen\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion. After the government complied and Homrighausen filed a reply, the district court notified Homrighausen of its intent to deposit the $3,040 in seized funds with the Treasury pursuant to \u00a7 3006A(f) and advised him to file any objections. Homrighausen filed his objections, arguing that he had been unemployed for the past three years, currently had no significant assets and was in virtually the same finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>cial condition as when he was originally-found eligible for court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The district court held a second hearing and heard testimony from Homrighausen about his financial resources. Homrighau-sen testified that he had less than $100 in cash, had no savings account or investments, currently earned approximately $200 per week, paid $115 per week in rent, and owned two bicycles and some modest jewelry. Homrighausen was not married and did not have any dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">After the hearing, the district court entered an order finding that because the $3,040 in cash belonged to Homrighausen and he was entitled to its return absent a legitimate reason to withhold it, Homri-ghausen had \u201cfunds available for payment\u201d for his court-appointed representation, as required by \u00a7 3006A(f) and <em>Bursey. </em>The district court thus denied Homrighausen\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion for the return of this cash and directed that the $3,040 be deposited with the Treasury for partial reimbursement of his legal representation, pursuant to \u00a7 3006A(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Homrighausen filed this second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">At the outset, we must address whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order. Citing <em>United States v. Griggs, </em>240 F.3d 974 (11th Cir. 2001), the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3006A(f) ruling. We agree. Under <em>Griggs, </em>an order for the payment of funds under \u00a7 3006A(f) is not a final appealable order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because, <em>inter alia, </em>it is administrative in nature and left to the discretion of the trial court. 240 F.3d at 974. Thus, we do not address the merits of the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3006A(f) ruling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">We do have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s ruling on Homrighausen\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion. <em>See United States v. Machado, </em>465 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir .2006), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1311-13 (11th Cir.2009). Rule 41(g) provides that \u201ca person aggrieved ... by the deprivation of property may move for the property\u2019s return.\u201d Fed. R. Crim P. 41(g). When the Rule 41(g) motion is filed after criminal proceedings have terminated, \u201cthe person from whom the property was seized is presumed to have a right to its return and the government must demonstrate that it has a legitimate reason to retain the property.\u201d <em>United States v. Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">A Rule 41(g) motion filed after the termination of the criminal proceedings is a motion in equity, for which the district court \u201cwill determine all the equitable considerations in order to make a fair and just decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Howell, </em>425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>F.3d 971, 974 (11th Cir.2005). We review questions of law relating to a Rule 41(g) motion <em>de novo, </em>but review \u201cthe equitable equation of the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 41(g) motion only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Machado, </em>465 F.3d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Here, the district court denied Homri-ghausen\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion because, after following the procedures set forth in \u00a7 3006A(f) and <em>Bursey, </em>the district court determined that the seized funds were \u201cavailable for payment\u201d to the Treasury for of Homrighausen\u2019s court-appointed representation. And, Homrighausen does not dispute that he had court-appointed representation or that the representation through trial was more than the $3,040. Under the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in denying the Rule 41(g) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\">. <em>United States v. Bursey, </em>515 F.2d 1228 (5th Cir.1975). In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) <em>(en hanc), </em>we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit decided before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">. At the hearing, Homrighausen's public defender advised the district court that he spent approximately fifty hours on Homrighausen\u2019s trial. The district court estimated, based on the current pay rate of $110 an hour for attorney's appointed under the Criminal Justice Act, that Homrighausen's defense cost approximately $5,500. Thus, the $3,040 was only a partial reimbursement for Homrighau-sen\u2019s representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\">. Under <em>Griggs, </em>we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of a district court's \u00a7 3006A(f) ruling (i.e., the finding that funds are available for payment and the discretionary decision whether to direct that funds be paid to the Treasury as reimbursement for court-appointed counsel). Under <em>Bursey, </em>however, we can review whether the district court has complied with the procedural requirements before entering the \u00a7 3006A(f) ruling. In this second appeal, Homrighausen does not contend that the district court failed to comply with the procedures in \u00a7 3006A(f) and <em>Bursey </em>before directing payment to the Treasury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
