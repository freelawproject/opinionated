Martinez argues that the district court\u2019s within-guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In support thereof, he contends that the illegal reentry Guideline is not empirically based because the defendant\u2019s criminal record is double-counted and that his personal history and characteristics, the nonviolent nature of his offense, and his revocation sentence warranted a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We review the substantive reasonableness of Martinez\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Martinez\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because the illegal reentry Guideline is not empirically based was rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). His argument that his personal history and characteristics entitled him to leniency is also unavailing. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant,\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), and, citing Martinez\u2019s two prior illegal reentry convictions, the sentencing judge determined that the sentence imposed would promote Martinez\u2019s respect for the law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">Finally, Martinez\u2019s suggestion that his within-guidelines sentence was unreasonable because of the nonviolent nature of his illegal reentry offense and in light of his revocation sentence is also unavailing; his disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
