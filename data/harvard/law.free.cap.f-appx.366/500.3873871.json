He contends that the denial of his motion was an abuse of discretion because the district court failed to take into consideration the crack/powder disparity and gave too much weight to his prison disciplinary offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-26\">We review the decision whether to grant or deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). A district court is required to consider the sentencing factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when contemplating a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, but it need not explain that it has done so. <em>Id. </em>at 673-74. A district court need not provide any reasons at all for denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 674. We can assume that a district court has considered any \u00a7 3553(a) arguments presented in favor of a sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The district court implicitly considered Lutcher\u2019s rehabilitative efforts in prison, <em>see id., </em>and explicitly considered Lutcher\u2019s lack of rehabilitative efforts generally. Lutcher, moreover, has a history as a habitual criminal. The denial of Lutcher\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
