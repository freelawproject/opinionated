We construe Archie\u2019s motion as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-21\">Archie does not challenge either the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to comply with its discovery orders, nor does he challenge the court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint based on his failure to comply with such orders. He argues that his claims against Warden Book were barred in federal court on the basis of sovereign immunity and, thus, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-22\">The Eleventh Amendment does not limit jurisdiction as to suits against parishes. <em>United Disaster Response, LLC v. Omni Pinnacle, LLC, </em>511 F.3d 476, 479 (5th Cir.2007). In Louisiana, the operation of the parish prison is the responsibility of local parish authorities, not of the State. <em>See Fairley v. Stalder, </em>294 Fed.Appx. 805, 811-12 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1619, 173 L.Ed.2d 995 (2009). Archie\u2019s contention that he is prohibited from suing Warden Book in federal court is thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-26\">Archie\u2019s appeal is frivolous. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-27\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b584-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
