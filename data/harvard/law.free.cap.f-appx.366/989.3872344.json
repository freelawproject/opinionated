Based in part on a 2006 conviction for fleeing and alluding a police officer under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2), the district court applied the career offender enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), and sentenced Redhead to 230 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Redhead argues that: (1) a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as contemplated by the career offender enhancement; (2) his trial counsel was ineffective; and (3) the district court clearly erred when it overruled his objection to paragraph 13 of the pre-sen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). After thorough review, we vacate and remand in part, and dismiss in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">The decision to classify a defendant as a career offender is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Young, </em>527 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 616, 172 L.Ed.2d 470 (2008). \u2018Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact, subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Nixon v. Newsome, </em>888 F.2d 112, 115 (11th Cir. 1989). \u201c[W]e review the factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1247 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">First, we agree with Redhead, and the government, that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) is not a \u201ccrime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>violence\u201d for purposes of the career offender enhancement. A defendant qualifies as a career offender if: (1) he was at least 18 years old at the commission of the offense of conviction; (2) the offense of conviction is a felony crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2007). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-5\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-6\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-7\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). To come within the so-called \u201cresidual provision\u201d of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), the predicate crime must not only pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, but it must also involve \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d conduct. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2009). We have recently held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) does not involve the \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d conduct necessary to constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1296 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">Here, Redhead was sentenced as a career offender in part due to his 2006 conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2). As the government concedes, under our precedent in <em>Harrison, </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and thus cannot be used as a predicate conviction for the career offender enhancement. Even though <em>Harrison </em>was decided in the context of the ACCA, \u201c[t]his [Cjourt has repeatedly read the definition of a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under \u00a7 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act as \u2018virtually identical\u2019 to the definition of a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we vacate Redhead\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for re-sentencing without the application of the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">Next, we dismiss without prejudice Redhead\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We generally do not consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, especially where \u201cthe claim has not been heard by the district court nor a factual record developed.\u201d <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 969 (11th Cir.), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>910 F.2d 713 (1990). In such a case, the preferred method of raising ineffective assistance of counsel is in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 505-06, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">We recognize that Redhead raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel to the district court, but the district court declined to address the issue. As a result, his trial counsel did not make a record regarding his alleged deficiencies. For example, Redhead asserts ineffective assistance for counsel\u2019s failure to present a defense or subpoena witnesses; however, the record does not reflect what the witnesses would have testified to for us to gauge any prejudicial effect. Without a factual record revealing the reasons for counsel\u2019s choices, we cannot effectively de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>cide this claim. We therefore dismiss this claim without prejudice to Redhead\u2019s remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Khoury, </em>901 F.2d at 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Finally, we agree with Redhead that the district court clearly erred in overruling his objection to paragraph 13 of the PSI, which stated that police officers found mail addressed to him during their search. When a defendant challenges a fact in the PSI, the government must establish the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1566 (11th Cir.1995). When a defendant withdraws an objection to the PSI, we generally do not consider that objection on appeal. <em>See United States v. Horsfall, </em>552 F.3d 1275, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2008), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2034, 173 L.Ed.2d 1120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Contrary to the government\u2019s contention, Redhead did not \u201caffirmatively withdr[a]w\u201d his objection to paragraph 13, as contemplated by <em>Horsfall. </em>Instead, the district court overruled the objection to paragraph 13. However, Redhead agreed with the district court that his objection \u201ctechnically\u201d went to paragraph 8, so his objection to paragraph 13 would be precluded by invited error. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1216 (11th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[t]he doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error\u201d) (quotations omitted). Nonetheless, both the government and the district court concluded that any mail that was found at the residence was addressed to Marvin, Redhead\u2019s brother, so paragraph 13 is clearly wrong. Since the information contained in that paragraph did not effect sentencing, and because we are already remanding for re-sentencing, we see no harm in having the district court correct this error in the PSI on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">. In addition, Appellant\u2019s motion to substitute retained attorney Matthew M.
