After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b108-27\">In 2005, Keechle pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and was sentenced to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. On February 3, 2009, Keechle began his supervised release in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On June 25, 2009, Keechle\u2019s probation officer petitioned for revocation of his supervised release, alleging Keechle had committed four violations: (1) new criminal charges in Ohio arising from his reckless driving of a stolen vehicle while intoxicated on May 22, 2009; (2) new criminal charges in Florida of grand theft auto, possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and resisting an officer on June 13, 2009; (3) new criminal charges in Florida of burglary and possession of burglary tools on June 10, 2009; and (4) travel outside the district without permission when, on or before June 3, 2009, Keechle went from Ohio to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">A. Probation Officer\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The probation officer prepared a sentencing memorandum advising the district court, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) a finding that Keechle violated his supervised release by possessing a controlled substance would require the district court to revoke supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g) and impose a sentence not to exceed two years\u2019 imprisonment; (2) because Keechle was charged with a Grade B violation, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), a finding of a violation would require the district court to revoke supervised release, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l), and impose a custody term; and (3) when a defendant has a Grade B violation and an original criminal history category of V, a range of 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment is recommended by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The memorandum also summarized the events underlying each of the alleged violations. According to the memorandum, on May 22, 2009, Ohio police were notified by a gas station clerk that Keechle, who was about to drive away from the station, appeared to be intoxicated. An officer observed Keechle drive out of the parking lot and weave across the center line three times. When the officer attempted to perform a traffic stop, Keechle sped up, reaching a top speed of 100 miles per hour, ran a stop sign and nearly caused several accidents. The officer kept a safe distance and watched as Keeehle lost control of his car, crashed into two fences and hit a tree. Before the officer could reach the accident scene, Keeehle fled on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Officers later learned that the car Keechle was driving was stolen. They also received a call from a woman whose car windows had been broken. The woman said that Keechle had called her and admitted breaking her windows and told her that he needed a ride because he was running from the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">On June 13, 2009, a Florida sheriffs deputy was investigating a suspicious vehicle and found Keechle asleep in the driver\u2019s seat with the keys in the ignition. Keechle was slumped over the wheel and unresponsive. The deputy checked the car\u2019s tag and discovered the car was stolen in Ohio. When the deputy pulled Keechle out of the car, Keechle began kicking and resisting. Keechle broke free and led the deputy on a brief foot chase before being subdued. The deputy found two baggies of marijuana in Keechle\u2019s right front pocket. A search of the car uncovered a crack pipe, and a purse and other items belonging to a woman. Deputies contacted the woman and learned that the items were stolen from her car on June 12, 2009, and that she had filed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">The memorandum indicated that until Keechle was arrested for the new criminal offenses, Keechle was actively participating in treatment, had no positive drug screens and was in compliance with all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>terms of his supervised release. The probation officer recommended an 18-month sentence, followed by two years of supervised release because Keechle was involved with criminal activity within three months of his release from prison. Keechle did not object to the probation officer\u2019s sentencing memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">B. Revocation Hearing and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">At the revocation hearing, Keechle admitted that he pled guilty to marijuana possession and resisting arrest in Ohio in July 2009 (i.e., partial admission to second violation) and that he traveled outside the district (fourth violation). The government stated that it would not press the two remaining violations alleged in the petition for revocation, but would discuss them in addressing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court concluded that Keechle\u2019s partial admission lowered his violation from the sentencing memorandum\u2019s recommended Grade B to a Grade C and reduced his guidelines range from 18 to 24 months\u2019 to 7 to 13 months\u2019 imprisonment and that his statutory maximum sentence was two years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In mitigation, Keechle argued that he was an impulsive and \u201ctroubled young man,\u201d with \u201calmost ... irresistible urges that he has to sort of lash out\u201d and \u201c[h]e acts upon it and runs away.\u201d Keechle pointed to his years of drug and alcohol abuse, which contributed to many of his prior arrests and convictions. Keechle stressed that he initially complied with his supervision requirements and was trying to get mental health treatment, but had not yet been successful. He became depressed, \u201c[got] back into drugs in very short order,\u201d and, consistent with his past pattern, ran away in someone else\u2019s car and got caught with drugs. Keechle noted that, while serving his federal 46-month sentence, he was housed in a penitentiary, where he fought with gang members and was placed in a special housing unit. Keechle argued that he should not be placed in a penitentiary and asked for a recommendation to a facility where he could get mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The district court noted the charges listed in the petition for revocation. The court acknowledged Keechle\u2019s need for help, but emphasized the seriousness of Keechle\u2019s supervised release violations, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">So, you know, I understand what you\u2019re saying, that you need help. And I can appreciate that. But you can also appreciate how a person shouldn\u2019t be doing any of that anyway, but especially a person on supervised release, who has a probation officer, has obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">So, this is pretty serious stuff. I mean, this isn\u2019t ... that you were late for your curfew or that you were \u2014 this is serious stuff. This isn\u2019t just a little bit. And so that\u2019s the problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">In addressing Keechle\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d the government recounted the facts underlying the charges in the petition for revocation. The government pointed out that Keechle\u2019s original presentence investigation report reflected a pattern of similar offenses in which Keechle led police on car or foot chases or was found by police asleep in cars. Many of these offenses involved alcohol or drugs. The government asked the district court to impose the statutory maximum of two years to protect the public while Keechle got substance abuse treatment in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">In response, Keechle admitted that he had at least ten drug \u2014 or alcohol \u2014 related arrests and had a substance abuse problem that manifested itself in patterns in his criminal history. Keechle contended that he needed long-term treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">The district court stated that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors focus not only on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, but also on the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, provide punishment, deterrence and protection to the public. The district court stressed that Keechle was \u201cunable to not commit crimes\u201d even while under both state and federal supervision. The district court stated that, while it was not holding Keechle legally accountable for all of the recent criminal activity, it found the pattern \u201cvery troubling.\u201d The district court explained that even if Keechle\u2019s conduct was \u201cfueled by drug addiction [and] perhaps mental health issues,\u201d Keechle \u201cas he currently is operating, is a danger the community\u201d and the court had to consider the needs to protect the public and for deterrence. The district court stated that given \u201cthe limited range of options available\u201d the court was \u201cgoing to try to accomplish both of those things.\u201d The district court noted that a further term of supervision \u201cprobably doesn\u2019t make much sense\u201d because Keechle faced state sentencing once he finished his federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Given all of these considerations, the district court concluded that the statutory maximum sentence was \u201cthe correct sentence.\u201d The district court recommended that Keechle receive mental health and intensive drug treatment while incarcerated and, if possible, that Keechle be housed at Butner. Accordingly, the district court imposed a 24-month sentence, with no supervised release. Keechle filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8583(e), a district court may, upon finding by a preponder-anee of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, under \u00a7 3583(g), revocation of supervised release and the imposition of some term of imprisonment are mandatory where, as here, the defendant violated supervision by possessing a controlled substance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The district court also must consider the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, one of which provides recommended, non-binding ranges of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006). The parties do not dispute that, with a Grade C violation and a criminal history category of V, Keechle\u2019s recommended guidelines range under advisory Chapter 7 was 7 to 13 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Because Keechle was on supervised release for a Class C felony, his sentence could not exceed two years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3), (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1106-07. A reasonableness review is synonymous with the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (explaining that a reasonableness review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>should \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guideline range\u201d). The party challenging the sentence has the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United, States v. Talley, </em>481 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Here, Keechle has not shown that his 24-month sentence was unreasonable. Within four months of completing his 46-month sentence, Keechle was engaging in the same kind of conduct that has been getting him in trouble since he was a teenager. Keechle admitted that he is a troubled man who acts impulsively, which supports the district court\u2019s observation that Keechle appears unable to keep himself from engaging in this kind of criminal activity. Furthermore, as the district court pointed out, Keechle\u2019s admitted conduct, possession of marijuana and resisting arrest, are not minor or technical violations of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The record does not support Keechle\u2019s claim that the district court did not adequately explain the reasons for imposing a sentence above the advisory guidelines range. Likewise, the record does not support Keechle\u2019s claim that the district court considered only two of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors- \u2014 the need for deterrence and to protect the public \u2014 to the exclusion of the other factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dialogue between the court and the parties shows that the court fully and carefully considered Keechle\u2019s arguments in mitigation, including Keechle\u2019s substance abuse and mental health problems and his need for treatment. The district court explicitly acknowledged these factors, but balanced them against the other factors. Under the totality of the circumstances, the district court was well within its discretion to conclude that the mitigating factors Keechle stressed were outweighed by the seriousness and dangerousness of his post-release conduct and the need to protect the public and afford deterrence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">. The relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the court must consider are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to afford adequate deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (5) the Sentencing Guidelines range and pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(cross referencing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thus, we do not address the continuing viability of the statement in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th Cir. 2000), that \"when revocation of supervised release is mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g), the statute does not <em>require </em>consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b112-18\">. To the extent Keechle argues that his sentence is unreasonable because he is currently housed in a penitentiary and not at Butner, we reject this claim. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b) (giving the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\u201d) the authority and the discretion to designate a federal prisoner's place of confinement and providing that sentencing court recommendations are not binding on the BOP).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
