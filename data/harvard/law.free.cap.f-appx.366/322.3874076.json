For substantially the same reasons provided by the District Court, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-22\">In August 2008, Feaster filed a complaint alleging that items from his personal property were lost when he was transferred from USP-Lewisburg to USP-Tucson. After his administrative tort claim was denied, Feaster filed the instant lawsuit against the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), various officials employed at USP-Lewisburg, and Henry Sadowski, the Northeast Regional Counsel for BOP (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d). Feaster alleged that defendants were liable under the FTCA for losing his property and sought damages totaling $5,657.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-23\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. In the motion, defendants treated Feaster\u2019s complaint as separate causes of action, one based on the FTCA and the other based on <em>Bivens v. Six </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>Unknown Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The District Court determined that it was clear from the face of Feaster\u2019s complaint that he had lodged a singular cause of action under the FTCA and denied defendants\u2019 motion on the <em>Bivens </em>theory as moot. With respect to Feaster\u2019s FTCA claim, the court found that such a claim be properly lodged only against the United States of America, and dismissed the individually named defendants to substitute the United States as the only proper party. Relying on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), the District Court found that Feaster cannot maintain an FTCA claim against the United States and dismissed the case in its entirety. Feaster timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. Our review is plenary. <em>See Miller v. Foitis Benefits Ins. Co., </em>475 F.3d 516, 519 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The only proper defendant in an FTCA suit is the United States itself. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 et seq. The FTCA waives the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed by federal employees \u201cunder circumstances where ... a private person ... would be liable\u201d under applicable state tort law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). But the FTCA exempts from this waiver \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d \u00a7 2680(c). The United States Supreme Court recently held that claims against corrections officers who are accused of mishandling an inmate\u2019s property fall with the FTCA\u2019s exception to the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>See Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>552 U.S. 214, 216, 227-28, 128 S.Ct. 831, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008). Therefore, the District Court properly found that Feast-er\u2019s claims are barred by the exception found in \u00a7 2680(c). <em>See id.-, see also Kosak v. United States, </em>465 U.S. 848, 854, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984) (holding that phrase \u201cany claim arising in respect of\u2019 the detention of goods means any claim \u201carising out of\u2019 the detention of goods, and includes a claim resulting from negligent handling or storage of detained property).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Accordingly, as the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm and deny Appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
