He contends that the district court reversibly erred when it enhanced his offense level for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Alvarez does not dispute that he provided a false name when he was arrested, when he was interviewed by pretrial services, and when he appeared before the magistrate judge. However, he argues that the record does not support the determinations that he acted willfully and with the intent to hinder justice. He also argues that his misrepresentation was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">We review a district court\u2019s factual finding that a defendant has obstructed justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 for clear error. <em>United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 752 (5th Cir.1999). The record reflects that Alvarez used a false name when under oath before the magistrate judge. This conduct was sufficient to support the obstruction of justice enhancement, even without a showing of significant hindrance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 4(f)); <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>964 F.2d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir. 1992). We also conclude that the district court did not err in finding the misrepresentation material. <em>See generally United States v. Najera Jimenez, </em>593 F.3d 391 (5th Cir.2010)(eonstruing similar materiality requirement in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and concluding that the government need not show that it was actually misled in order for a misrepresentation to be material). Therefore, the district court did not clearly err when it increased Alvarez\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tu Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
