He was admitted into the United States at Houston, Texas, on September 16, 2001, as a nonimmigrant visitor with permission to remain here until October 15, 2001. He overstayed his visa, and the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) served him with a notice to appear in immigration court to answer to the charge of remova-bility as an alien who \u201cremained in the United States for a time longer than permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-21\">In February 2003, petitioner filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. At a master calendar hearing on June 11, 2003, he appeared through counsel, admitted the allegations in the notice to appear, and conceded removability. In November 2007, he appeared with counsel before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) for a hearing on the merits of his application. He conceded that he was ineligible for asylum<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and stated that all he was seeking was withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-22\">Petitioner was his only witness, and the IJ found him to be credible. Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>testified that he never belonged to any political organization or business association in Peru. The IJ found nothing in his testimony that would support a finding that he had been subjected to past persecution or that he would be persecuted at the hands of the Peruvian government if returned to Peru. The IJ therefore denied Petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of removal or CAT relief, and ordered removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Petitioner appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA dismissed his appeal because, as the IJ had concluded, he had failed to \u201cestablish past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution.\u201d He now seeks review of the BIA\u2019s decision, contending that, in considering his application for CAT relief, \u201cthe BIA erred in finding that the record did not indicate that it is more likely than not that the Petitioner will be subject to torture by or with the acquiescence of a member of the [Peruvian] government.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 12. He claims that he endured mental torture because a commander in the Peruvian military threatened his life and pointed a gun at him when he attempted to collect a debt the military owed him. Petitioner also asserts that the IJ and the BIA failed to consider both his argument that he endured mental torture and the 2006 U.S. Department of State\u2019s Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Peru (\u201cCountry Report\u201d), which he submitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We review administrative findings of fact under the substantial evidence test. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). Under this test, we \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. \u201c[Findings of fact ... may be reversed by this court only when the record compels a reversal....\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, \u201c[w]e review all legal issues <em>de novo.\u201d Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir.2006). Finally, because the BIA issued its own opinion without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning, we only review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Under the CAT, the applicant has the burden of proof to establish through objective evidence \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1180 (11th Cir.2004). The CAT defines \u201ctorture\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab-\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Torture is \u201can extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment,\u201d that does not include \u201cpain or suffering arising only from ... lawful sanctions.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2), (3). Moreover, to constitute torture, the act and its consequences must be intentional, and the act must be \u201cdirected against a person in the offender\u2019s custody or physical control.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(5), (6). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Finally, in order for there to be acquiescence by a public official, the \u201cofficial, pri- or to the activity constituting the torture, [must] have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In sum, we have stated that in order for an act to constitute \u201ctorture,\u201d it must be: \u201c(1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for an illicit or proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\u201d <em>Cadet, </em>377 F.3d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">For mental pain or suffering to amount to torture, it \u201cmust be prolonged mental harm,\u201d caused by: (i) \u201c[t]he intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering\u201d; (ii) the administration or threatened administration of mind altering substances or similar procedures; (iii) \u201c[t]he threat of imminent death\u201d; or (iv) \u201c[t]he threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind altering substances.... \u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Finally, in order to determine \u201cwhether it is more likely than not that an applicant would be tortured in the proposed country of removal,\u201d the court must consider all relevant evidence, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">(i) Evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">(ii) Evidence that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">(iii) Evidence of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal, where applicable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">(iv)Other relevant information regarding the country of removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the BIA, we conclude that Petitioner failed to demonstrate that the record compelled the BIA to find that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he removed to Peru. Moreover, he did not show that either IJ or the BIA failed to consider the Country Report or his claim that he endured mental torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">We therefore find no basis for reversing the BIA\u2019s decision denying Petitioner CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-23\">. His application for asylum was untimely filed and he could not show changed country conditions or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the late filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\">. The IJ granted voluntary departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
