Calz\u00f3n argues that the district court erred when it allowed a government witness, Alberto Francisco, to refresh his memory at trial by looking at a record prepared by the Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d) in preparation for trial. Calz\u00f3n further argues that the district court erred when it entered a final judgment for the government because the government did not present a Disclosure Statement and Repayment Schedule setting forth Calzon\u2019s repayment terms and schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">I. Alleged Evidentiary Error</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">Generally, we review a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion, and will reverse only if the moving party establishes that the rulings resulted in a substantial prejudicial effect. <em>Conroy v. Abraham Chevrolet-Tampa, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). Where the party failed to make a timely objection, however, we will only examine an objection made for the first time on appeal for plain error in an exceptional civil case, if the error would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>S.E.C. v. Diversified Corporate Consulting Group, </em>378 F.3d 1219, 1227 n. 14 (11th Cir.2004). Under plain error review, we will reverse if, (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected substantial rights, and (4) not correcting the error would seriously affect the fairness of the judicial proceeding. <em>Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>197 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">Fed.R.Evid. 612 provides that a witness may use a writing to refresh her memory for the purpose of testifying. Fed.R.Evid. 612. \u201cThe principal requirements for the use of the statement for the purpose [are] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that the witness demonstrated a need for having his memory refreshed and that the paper used had that effect.\u201d <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>342 F.2d 137, 139 (5th Cir. 1965) (citation omitted). \u201cThe reliability or truthfulness of the statement [is] relevant only to the problem of the weight and credibility to be accorded the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139 (citation omitted). Counsel may not refresh recollection simply as an excuse to bring inadmissible material before the fact-finder. <em>See id. </em>at 140. Nonetheless, we said in a criminal context that \u201c[w]hen there is careful supervision by the court, the testimony elicited through refreshing recollection may be proper, even though the document used to refresh the witnesses\u2019 memory is inadmissible.\u201d <em>United </em>States v. Scott, 701 F.2d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir.1983) (citation omitted); <em>see United States v. Horton, </em>526 F.2d 884, 888-89 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We conclude, based on this record, that the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, when it allowed Francisco to use the Borrower\u2019s History and Activity Report to refresh his memory during his testimony. The record shows that Francisco, during trial, referred to that business record so that he could remember the date when her loan was disbursed. Francisco also looked at the report so that he could testify about the exact dates when the DOE sent letters to Calz\u00f3n, informing her that her loan payments were past due. Francisco permissibly used this data, from underlying records prepared and relied upon in the ordinary course of business, to refresh his memory of when her loan was disbursed and the DOE sent her the past due notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">II. Ultimate Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">A district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. Wexler v. Anderson, </em>452 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). Additionally, we \u201cwill not overturn an evidentiary ruling and order a new trial unless the objecting party has shown a substantial prejudicial effect from the ruling.\u201d <em>Maiz v. Virani, </em>253 F.3d 641, 667 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Calzon\u2019s argument that she was not on notice that her loan payments were due is predicated on her contention that Francisco\u2019s testimony was improper. Calz\u00f3n contends that, without Francisco\u2019s allegedly improper testimony, the government could not prove she defaulted on her loan. However, as discussed above, Francisco\u2019s testimony, in which he refreshed his memory using Calzon\u2019s Borrower\u2019s History and Activity Report, was not improper. Moreover, even if Francisco\u2019s testimony was improper, Calz\u00f3n has not shown that it resulted in substantial prejudice. <em>See Maiz, </em>253 F.3d at 667. It is undisputed that Calz\u00f3n had executed a promissory note with DOE and had made no repayments on her loan. In light of her note and her admitted failure to make any payments on her note, Calz\u00f3n has not demonstrated how she suffered substantial prejudice from Francisco\u2019s allegedly improper testimony. The district court did not err when it entered judgment against Calz\u00f3n on her student loan obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
