The BIA found Rodriguez was ineligible for asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 208, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, because Rodriguez did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Additionally, the BIA concluded that Rodriguez did not establish that a protected ground was at least one central reason for his fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-16\">We review the decision of the BIA and not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision impacted the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Gonzalez-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 975, 976 (5th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We accord deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the immigration statute unless there are compelling indications that its interpretation is incorrect. <em>Rivera-Cruz v. INS, </em>948 F.2d 962, 966 (5th Cir.1991). Thus, absent dispositive error of law, we must affirm the Board\u2019s determination that Rodriguez was ineligible for asylum if we find that its decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">To qualify for asylum, an applicant must show he is a refugee within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)\u00ae, that is, he is unable or unwilling to return to his country of origin \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>see also Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444-45 (5th Cir. 2001). The applicant must also establish that race, religion, nationality, membership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>in a particular social group, or political opinion \u201cwas or will be at least one <em>central reason </em>for persecuting the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Rodriguez does not challenge the Board\u2019s finding that he failed to establish that he was persecuted in Colombia before leaving for the United States in March 2005. While in Columbia, he had no personal contact with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the group he now claims will persecute him if he returns. FARC\u2019s first contact with the Rodriguez family was an incident in July 2004, during which Rodriguez\u2019s father told FARC guerillas who had come to his home that he was associated with President Ur-ibe. Following this encounter, which, according to Rodriguez, demonstrates that FARC targeted his father, and by extension, will target him, Rodriguez remained in Columbia for eight months without incident. After leaving Columbia, Rodriguez lived for approximately one year in the United States, unaware of his father\u2019s ongoing problems with FARC. During this time, Rodriguez\u2019s brother was living openly in Colombia with no problems from FARC. Nevertheless, Rodriguez contends that he cannot return to Columbia because he fears persecution from FARC on the basis of his father\u2019s political views, which he argues that FARC will impute to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that FARC\u2019s interest in Rodriguez\u2019s father was not primarily on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). Rodriguez testified that FARC\u2019s interest in his father was due primarily to his father\u2019s wealth. Rodriguez\u2019s father testified that he was perceived in Colombia as \u201cnot a political person but a monied comfortable person.\u201d Although Rodriguez\u2019s father also testified that FARC beat him on account of his association with President Uribe, this encounter was premised on FARC\u2019s interest in verifying the accuracy of a list of the father\u2019s business assets \u2014 a list which FARC compiled prior to the encounter, and thus prior to their knowledge of his association with President Uribe. We do not recognize economic extortion as a form of persecution under immigration law, nor do we recognize wealthy Columbian businessmen as a protected group. <em>See Thapa v. Holder, </em>2009 WL 4885138 (5th Cir. Dec.16, 2009) (listing cases). Further, although Rodriguez alleges that FARC\u2019s motives for persecuting his father are \u201cmixed,\u201d substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that economic interests were the primary motive. <em>See Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 864 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cAlthough a statutorily protected ground need not be the only reason for harm, it cannot be incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate to another reason for harm.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Additionally, even if we were to assume that his father\u2019s persecution was primarily politically motivated, Rodriguez \u201ccannot rely solely on the persecution of [his] family member[ ] to qualify for asylum.\u201d <em>See Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 681 n. 15 (5th Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed, the statute requires \u201cthe applicant [to] establish that ... political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting <em>the applicant.\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i) (emphasis added); <em>see also Tamas-Mercea v. Reno, </em>222 F.3d 417, 424 (7th Cir.2000) (concluding that while persecution of family members can directly affect an applicant seeking asylum, the asylum statute requires sufficient individual persecution of the applicant); <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994) (requiring an asylum applicant to demonstrate \u201ca good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In light of the fact that both Rodriguez and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>his brother lived openly in Columbia without problems, the BIA\u2019s decision not to impute his father\u2019s persecution to Rodriguez is well-supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In sum, the BIA\u2019s determinations are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Rodriguez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b582-13\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-14\">. Rodriguez dedicates a substantial portion of his brief to arguing the timeliness of his application. However, the BIA\u2019s holding was without regard to the issue of timeliness. Since we only review the IJ\u2019s decision to the degree that it impacted the BIA\u2019s opinion, the timeliness issue is not before us. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997) (noting the court only has authority to review the BIA\u2019s decision, unless the IJ's conclusions impacted the BIA's decision).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
