In his petition, Palomino-Abad argues that the BIA erred in refusing to grant his motion for reconsideration because the first Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) who considered his case entered a final order granting him relief under \u00a7 212(c). He also contends that our recent decision in <em>De la Rosa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>579 F.3d 1327 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. Nov. 13, 2009) (No. 09-594), is flawed because it violates the Equal Protection Clause, raises retroactivity concerns, and accords deference to a BIA decision that does not merit deference. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Palomino-Abad, a native and citizen of Peru, was admitted into the United States on or about May 27, 1987, as an immigrant. On April 14, 1998, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) served Palomino-Abad with a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), for having been \u201cconvicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.\u201d Specifically, the INS alleged that Palomino-Abad had been convicted of: (1) engaging in lewd and lascivious conduct constituting sexual battery on a minor, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04; and (2) burglary, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02. The convictions occurred, respectively, on July 16, 1993, and September 4, 1992. In March 1999, the INS also charged Palomino-Abad with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), for having been convicted of an aggravated felony. The INS indicated that this ground for removal was based on Palomino-Abad\u2019s 1993 sexual battery conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">After numerous continuances of his immigration proceedings, Palomino-Abad informed the IJ that he intended to file an application for relief under INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), and, thereafter, submitted a written application for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">In May 2002, Palomino-Abad, represented by counsel, conceded that he was removable as charged in the NTA, and the IJ sustained the charges. He then testified in support of his application for relief under \u00a7 212(c), and admitted, among other things, that he had been convicted of sexual battery against a minor in 1993. The IJ ordered Palomino-Abad to complete 200 hours of community service, and warned him that, if he did not complete 200 hours of community service and avoid further criminal activity, he would \u201cdeport [him][the] next time.\u201d The IJ ordered that the next hearing in Palomino-Abad\u2019s case would take place in March 2003. The IJ concluded the hearing by addressing Palomino-Abad\u2019s family members, stating, \u201c[W]e\u2019ll see what happens, it\u2019s up to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>from now on.\u201d Although Palomino-Abad subsequently submitted documents certifying that he completed 200 hours of community service, the IJ who conducted the May 2002 hearing did not hold an additional hearing or otherwise take further action in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">After a second IJ continued Palomino-Abad\u2019s case two more times, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) filed a motion to pretermit his application for \u00a7 212(c) relief. In its motion, the DHS noted that the BIA had recently decided <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 2005), and asserted that, in light of this decision, Palomino-Abad\u2019s 1993 conviction for sexual battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 precluded his eligibility for relief under \u00a7 212(c). <em>Blake </em>concerned \u00a7 212(c), a statute vesting the Attorney General with discretion to waive a ground of inadmissibility for an alien seeking entry into the United States. <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 723-29. In <em>Blake, </em>the BIA noted that \u00a7 212(c) relief had been extended to aliens facing deportation, but only where the ground for deportability was comparable to a ground of inadmissibility set forth in INA \u00a7 212(a). <em>Id. </em>at 728-29. The BIA applied this \u201ccomparable ground\u201d or \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d test to hold that an alien whose ground for deportability was based on his conviction for sexual abuse of a minor would not be eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>In applying the test, the BIA found that this offense has no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility in \u00a7 212(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In November 2005, the second IJ conducted a hearing regarding the government\u2019s motion to pretermit Palomino-Abad\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) application. The IJ issued an oral decision granting the DHS\u2019s motion. The IJ found that the previous IJ who handled the case did not enter a final order either granting or denying relief under \u00a7 212(c). The IJ noted that Palomino-Abad had been charged with remova-bility on two grounds \u2014 his conviction of an aggravated felony, under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), and his convictions for two crimes involving moral turpitude, under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii). The IJ found that, had Palomino-Abad been charged with re-movability only under \u00a7 237(a) (2) (A) (ii), for crimes involving moral turpitude, he would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. The IJ determined, however, that under <em>Blake, </em>the additional charge of removal under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), for commission of the aggravated felony of sexual battery, precluded Palomino-Abad\u2019s eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Accordingly, the IJ ordered that Palomino-Abad be removed to Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Palomino-Abad appealed from the IJ\u2019s order. In his brief to the BIA, Palomino-Abad argued that he was not removable because the first IJ who considered his case entered a final order granting his application for relief under \u00a7 212(c). In addition, he argued that he was eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief despite the BIA\u2019s holding in <em>Blake. </em>He contended that <em>Blake\u2019s </em>statutory counterpart rule retroactively imposed a new substantive requirement for \u00a7 212(c) relief, which violated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 293, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2275,150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). He also asserted that the <em>Blake </em>decision violated the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The BIA denied Palomino-Abad\u2019s appeal, agreeing with the IJ\u2019s ultimate finding that, under <em>Blake, </em>he was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 212(c). The BIA explained that Palomino-Abad\u2019s conviction for sexual battery, and the resulting ground for his removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, had no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility set forth in \u00a7 212(a). The BIA did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>not make a finding regarding the issue of whether the first IJ who considered Palomino-Abad\u2019s case entered a final order granting him relief under \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Palomino-Abad filed a motion to reconsider, largely reiterating the arguments he set forth in his brief on appeal. The BIA denied the motion. In its order denying the motion to reconsider, the BIA found that the first IJ who handled Palomino-Abad\u2019s case did not enter an order granting him \u00a7 212(c) relief. The BIA rejected Palomino-Abad\u2019s argument that applying the statutory counterpart test contravened <em>St. Cy-r's </em>concerns with retroactivity. The BIA explained that the statutory counterpart test was \u201cwell-established.\u201d The BIA found that, even if Palomino-Abad\u2019s charge under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) had a statutory counterpart in \u00a7 212(a)\u2019s grounds for inadmissibility, he still would be ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because, under <em>Blake, </em>the sexual battery charge under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) lacked a statutory counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">After Palomino-Abad filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying his motion to reconsider, we remanded his case to the BIA for further consideration in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. 2007), in which that circuit reviewed the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Blake </em>and rejected its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On remand, the BIA again denied Palomino-Abad\u2019s motion to reconsider. The BIA found that an alien facing deportation is eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief only where the statutory ground of removability corresponded to a statutory ground of inadmissibility. The BIA acknowledged that the Second Circuit rejected its statutory counterpart test in <em>Blake v. Carbone, </em>but declined to follow the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Palomino-Abad\u2019s case because this decision was not controlling in this Circuit. Palomino-Abad then filed the present petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Before considering the merits of an alien\u2019s petition for review, we \u201cmust first consider whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petition at all.\u201d <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2004). We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Id. </em>Generally, we lack jurisdiction to review a determination that an alien is removable due to his status as a convicted felon. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1328 n. 1. We possess jurisdiction, however, to review a claim raised by such an alien if it constitutes a constitutional claim or a question of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1328 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). This standard of review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008). However, we review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006). A decision by a panel of this Court constitutes binding precedent unless it has been overruled by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or the Supreme Court. <em>King v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>505 F.3d 1160, 1169 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">In INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a), Congress has set forth certain categories of aliens who are not eligible for admission into the United States <em>(i.e., </em>aliens who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u201cinadmissible\u201d or \u201cexcludable\u201d). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a); <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1328 n. 2 (noting that aliens previously referred to as \u201cexcludable\u201d are now referred to as \u201cinadmissible,\u201d and that these two terms may be used interchangeably). Inadmissible aliens include, in relevant part, aliens who have been convicted of \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude (other than a purely political offense).\u201d INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Likewise, in INA \u00a7 237(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a), Congress has set forth classes of aliens who are inside the United States but are subject to deportation (\u201cdeportable aliens\u201d). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 237(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a). Aliens subject to deportation include any alien who, after admission into the United States, \u201cis convicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii). Under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), which was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), the Attorney General possessed discretion to waive exclusion for \u201caliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.\u201d <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1329 (quoting \u00a7 212(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Although \u00a7 212(c) has been repealed by the IIRIRA, certain aliens may still apply for relief under this provision. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. at 2293. In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether an alien, who was a legal permanent resident and who faced deportation based on his 1996 conviction for drug trafficking, was eligible for relief from removal under \u00a7 212(c). <em>Id. </em>at 293, 121 S.Ct. at 2275. The Court noted that, at the time of his conviction, the alien was eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>By the time the INS commenced removal proceedings against him, however, \u00a7 212(c) had been repealed. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that, even though \u00a7 212(c) had been repealed by the IIRI-RA, relief under this provision is still available to an alien whose conviction was \u201cobtained through [a] plea agreement and who, notwithstanding [the] conviction[ ], would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of [the] plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 121 S.Ct. at 2293. In support of this holding, the Court voiced its concern that, prior to IIRIRA\u2019s repeal of \u00a7 212(c), aliens \u201calmost certainly\u201d relied on the availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief when pleading guilty to an offense, and the IIRIRA\u2019s repeal of \u00a7 212(c) could retroactively impose new legal consequences on a past event. <em>Id. </em>at 325,121 S.Ct. at 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">While the literal terms of \u00a7 212(c) extended relief only to those aliens deemed inadmissible under \u00a7 212(a), the DHS has permitted some aliens inside the United States who face deportation proceedings to apply for relief under \u00a7 212(c). <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). The purpose of this extension \u201cwas to equalize the treatment of aliens who were deportable versus excludable on equivalent grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, relief under \u00a7 212(c) was available to a deportable alien where his deportability \u201cwas based on a ground for which a comparable ground for exclusion existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in order to show that he is eligible for relief under \u00a7 212(c), a deport-able alien must show that the ground for deportability has a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d in the grounds for inadmissibility set forth in \u00a7 212(a). <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1332. This \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d test has been codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5), which provides that, \u201cAn application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act shall be denied if ... [t]he alien is deporta-ble under former section 241 of the Act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>removable under section 237 of the Act on a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section 212 of the Act.\u201d Id.; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5). As noted above, in <em>In re Blake, </em>the BIA held that an alien who was deportable based on his conviction for sexual abuse of a minor was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, because this offense had no statutory counterpart in \u00a7 212(a)\u2019s grounds of inadmissibility. <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In <em>De la Rosa, </em>we considered whether an alien, who had been admitted into the United States and faced deportation due to his 1995 conviction for sexual battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was eligible for a waiver of deportation under \u00a7 212(c). 579 F.3d at 1328. Based on his sexual battery offense, the DHS had charged the alien with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) on the ground that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1328, n. 3. We rejected the alien\u2019s argument that the statutory counterpart test violated the Equal Protection Clause, because deportable aliens and inadmissible aliens are not similarly situated unless they are inadmissible and deporta-ble, respectively, based on substantially identical statutory grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1338. In addition, we rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Blake v. Carbone </em>and held instead that the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>In re Blake </em>warranted deference. <em>Id. </em>at 1340. Accordingly, we applied the statutory counterpart test to hold that the alien was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because the aggravated felony of sexual battery lacks a statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility set forth in \u00a7 212(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1339-40. We explained that the categorical formulation of the statutory counterpart test, as set forth in <em>In re Blake, </em>required that a court look:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">not to the underlying criminal conviction[,] but rather to the statutory ground for removal contained in INA \u00a7 237 and whether it has a counterpoint in the statutory ground for exclusion provisions of INA \u00a7 212(a). Under this categorical analysis, [a court should] compare the removal and exclusion provisions of the INA to determine whether they are substantially equivalent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1339 (quoting, with approval, <em>Caroleo v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 158, 164 (3d Cir.2007)) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">As an initial matter, we note that Palomino-Abad does not challenge on appeal the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determinations that, even if his charged ground of removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), for his crimes involving moral turpitude, had a statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility, he would still be ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief if his charge under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), for his aggravated felony, lacked such a statutory counterpart. Accordingly, he has abandoned this issue, and we focus solely on the issue of whether the BIA properly applied the statutory counterpart test to determine that Palomino-Abad was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 212(c) due to his aggravated felony conviction for sexual battery. See <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that the petitioners abandoned an argument by failing to raise it in their initial appellate brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider Palomino-Abad\u2019s argument that the first IJ who considered his case rendered a final decision granting him \u00a7 212(c) relief. This is because this argument raises a factual issue, and we lack jurisdiction to consider an issue raised by an alien who is removable due to his commission of a criminal offense unless the issue is constitutional or legal in nature. We possess jurisdiction, however, to consider Palomino-Abad\u2019s arguments that we should not apply the statutory counterpart test, as these arguments implicate constitutional and legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Our precedent in <em>De la Rosa </em>forecloses Palomino-Abad\u2019s arguments that the statutory counterpart test violates the Equal Protection Clause. A determination that Palomino-Abad was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief would violate the Equal Protection Clause only if the grounds for his deportation had a substantially identical statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility set forth in \u00a7 212(a). In <em>De la Rosa, </em>we deferred to the BIA\u2019s holding that, where an alien is removable based on his aggravated felony conviction for sexual battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04, his ground for removal lacks a statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility in \u00a7 212(a). Because Palomino-Abad is removable based on his conviction for this exact same crime, the <em>De la Rosa </em>decision establishes that he is not similarly situated to an inadmissible alien, and also establishes that the BIA\u2019s determination that he was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief did not violate the Equal Protection clause. Our decision in <em>De la Rosa </em>also forecloses Palomino-Abad\u2019s argument that we should follow the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Blake v. Carbone </em>by declining to defer to the BIA\u2019s statutory counterpart test.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Finally, Palomino-Ahad\u2019s argument that the statutory counterpart test violates <em>St. Cyr </em>also lacks merit. While <em>St. Cyr </em>concerned the retroactive deprivation of a statutory right, such a concern is not implicated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-5\">. In De <em>la Rosa, </em>we noted that the alien was convicted under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3). De <em>la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1328. This provision currently provides that a defendant's ignorance of the victim\u2019s age cannot be raised as a defense. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3). In 1995, however, this provision prohibited sexual battery against a minor. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1995). The provision regarding sexual battery is currently found at \u00a7 800.04(4). Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
