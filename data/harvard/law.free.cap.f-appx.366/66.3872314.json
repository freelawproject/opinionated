On appeal, Williams argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing evidence of his prior convictions (sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>counterfeit cocaine, armed robbery, possession of cocaine and aggravated assault with a weapon) to be admitted at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u201c[W]e review the evidentiary rulings of the trial court only for a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009). Under \u201cthe deferential abuse-of-discretion standard we must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). We have stated that \u201cRule 404(b) is a rule of inclusion, and that accordingly 404(b) evidence, like other relevant evidence, should not lightly be excluded when it is central to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>United States v. Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">In reviewing 404(b) decisions, we apply a three-part test for admissibility of such evidence: (1) the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; (2) there must be sufficient proof so that the factfinder could find that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and (3) the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by undue prejudice. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>443 F.3d 772, 779 (11th Cir.2006). Here, Williams does not challenge the second prong of the three-part test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">We have stated that, \u201cin every conspiracy case, a not guilty plea renders the defendant\u2019s intent a material issue\u201d and that \u201c[e]vidence of such extrinsic evidence as may be probative of a defendant\u2019s state of mind is admissible unless the defendant affirmatively takes[ ] the issue of intent out of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296, 1311 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and ellipsis omitted); <em>see also United States v. Butler, </em>102 F.3d 1191, 1195 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cIntent is always at issue when a defendant pleads not guilty to a conspiracy charge.\u201d); <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1330-31 (11th Cir.1997) (determining that intent was at issue when the defendant argued that he was \u201cmerely present at the scene of the drug activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Under the third prong of the balancing test, \u201cthe probative value of the evidence must not be <em>substantially outweighed </em>by unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1282 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThis determination lies within the sound discretion of the district judge and calls for a common sense assessment of all the circumstances surrounding the extrinsic offense, including prosecutorial need, overall similarity between the extrinsic act and the charged offense, as well as temporal remoteness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). We have noted that \u201ctemporal remoteness is an important factor\u201d and stated that a defendant \u201cbears a heavy burden in demonstrating an abuse of the court\u2019s broad discretion in determining if an extrinsic offense is too remote to be probative.\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1311 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Because Williams\u2019s prior convictions were relevant to issues other than his character and their probative value was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the prior convictions into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Based on our review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Williams\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
