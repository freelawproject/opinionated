He argues his sentence is unreasonable because: (1) the district court did not consider a within-Guidelines sentence or any of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (2) the district court did not adequately explain its reasons for imposing an above-Guidelines sentence; and (3) the district court impermissibly increased his sentence based on unfounded assumptions about his immigration status. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">A sentence imposed following the revocation of supervised release is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). The district court need not state on the record that it explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient\u201d under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">Thus, even where the district court fails to \u201cexplicitly articulate that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d its explanation is sufficient if it is clear that it did consider a number of the sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007) (district court\u2019s failure to explicitly articulate that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was not error, in light of its consideration of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>objections and motion for downward departure, which implicated a number of factors). The weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is left to the district court\u2019s discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Title 18, United States Code, \u00a7 3583 provides that a district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a sentence of imprisonment for the violation after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). These factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristic of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to (a) afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (b) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (c) provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment; (3) the sentencing range established by the Guidelines; (4) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted disparities; and (6) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)(D), (a)(4)-(7). Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines, which governs violations of supervised release, contains policy statements, including U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, which provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation. Although these policy statements are merely advisory, \u00a7 3553 requires the district court to consider them when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1301-02 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Here, Sanchez has not established that the district court imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence because it both considered the advisory Guidelines range and the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In particular, although the district court did not explicitly state it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it allowed both the government and Sanchez to make arguments concerning the appropriate sentence to impose, both of which discussed facts relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the district court declared, before imposing sentence that it had \u201cconsidered the statements of the parties.\u201d In addition, in enumerating the reasons for the sentence imposed, the district court referenced the nature and circumstances of the offense, Sanchez\u2019s characteristics, the need to protect the public from Sanchez, and the need to provide him with medical treatment by ordering his participation in a drug and alcohol abuse program. Further, the district court did consider the advisory guidelines range. At the district court\u2019s request, the government provided it with the correct Guidelines range \u2014 18 to 24 months \u2014 and the statutory maximum-three years. The district court then stated that it found a sentence above that range to be appropriate, which provided \u201csome indication the district court was aware of and considered [the Guidelines].\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Nor has Sanchez established that the district court failed to adequately explain its reasons for imposing a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range. Where, as here, the district court sentences the defendant outside of the Guidelines, it commits a procedural error if it fails to adequately explain why it has done so. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). The district court clearly stated that \u201ca sentence above the advisory guideline range is appropriate in this matter, based upon the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>case and the injuries suffered by the victim\u201d of Sanchez\u2019s unprovoked assault as well as the fact that Sanchez lied to his probation officer about the details of the attack. This is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Although we generally review the sentence imposed for reasonableness, we review <em>de novo </em>\u201cwhether a factor considered by the district court in sentencing a defendant is impermissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). \u201cA sentence that is based entirely upon an impermissible factor is unreasonable because such a sentence does not achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, \u201ca judge may not impose a more severe sentence than he would have otherwise based on unfounded assumptions regarding an individual\u2019s immigration status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The district court did not mention Sanchez\u2019s immigration status when it stated its reasons for the sentence imposed. Instead, the district court only commented on Sanchez\u2019s immigration status after imposing his sentence and in the context of discussing his obligations should he be deported or voluntarily leave the country. Accordingly, Sanchez has not established that the district court impermissibly increased his sentence based on unfounded assumptions regarding his immigration status. AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\">. This Court has not addressed whether the plain error standard applies when a party fails to object in detail to the reasonableness of a sentence below. We need not reach that issue here, because Sanchez\u2019s sentence is proper under both the reasonableness and plain error standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
