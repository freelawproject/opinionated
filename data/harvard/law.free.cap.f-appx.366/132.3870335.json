We review a district court\u2019s decision to remove a juror for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Register, </em>182 F.3d 820, 839 (11th Cir.1999). And we review the exercise of discretion to ensure that the district court did not \u201cdischarge the juror without factual support, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>or for a legally irrelevant reason so as to amount to a showing of bias or prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Puche, </em>850 F.3d 1137, 1152 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Here, at the start of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, the juror explained to the district court that he was a sole proprietor and both of his employees were unable to work the week Hyacinth\u2019s trial began because of family situations and, thus, that he faced a financial hardship if forced to continue on the jury. The court concluded that the juror did not wish to participate and would not be cooperative due to the financial hardship he would suffer if he remained on the jury. On this record, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the juror: the court had adequate information about the juror\u2019s reasons for seeking to be excused and a sufficient factual basis existed for the court\u2019s decision. Nothing suggests that the decision was based upon bias or prejudice to Hyacinth. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We now address Hyacinth\u2019s sentencing arguments. Hyacinth challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a sophisticated means enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(6)(C). We review for clear error the finding and imposition of a sophisticated means enhancement. <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">A two-level enhancement is warranted if the offense in question \u201cinvolved sophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(6)(C).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The guidelines explain \u201csophisticated means\u201d as especially complex or intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, comment. (n.18) (explaining that \u201c[cjonduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts ... ordinarily indicates sophisticated means\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Here, Hyacinth actively participated in a large mortgage fraud scheme that involved (1) the use of straw borrowers to hide the true beneficiaries of loans, (2) obtaining fraudulent appraisals to receive the loans, and (3) creating a variety of false documents to hide the fraudulent nature of the beneficiaries of the loan. Hyacinth personally recruited straw borrowers and created false documents about these borrowers. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1316 (11th Cir.2007) (in terms of sophistication of concealment, concluding that there was no difference between hiding assets or transactions through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts and hiding assets or transactions through the use of a straw man or campaign fund). Hyacinth clearly contributed to the elaborate execution and concealment of the fraud in the large and lengthy scheme.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Clarke, </em>562 F.3d 1158, 1166 (11th Cir.2009) (noting the three-year length of the conspiracy in determining that the sophisticated means enhancement was appropriate). We see no clear error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>district court\u2019s application of the sophisticated means enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Hyacinth also argues that he received a higher sentence because of his refusal to enter into pretrial stipulations. He contends that he was punished for exercising his constitutional rights, in violation of due process. To succeed on a claim that an impermissible factor affected the sentence, \u201cthe party challenging the sentence bears the initial burden of establishing that the district court considered an impermissible factor at sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). \u201cA sentence may be substantively unreasonable when the district court ... bases the sentence on impermissible factors[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191-92 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA sentence that is based entirely upon an impermissible factor is unreasonable because such a sentence does not achieve the purposes of\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Lorenzo, </em>471 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Under section 3553(a), a district court can consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)\u2014 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">At sentencing, the district court rejected Hyacinth\u2019s request for a non-guideline sentence and imposed a sentence near the top of the guidelines range. In doing so, the court noted that Hyacinth\u2019s role in the extensive scheme was that of a \u201crecruiter, organizer, leader, and manager\u201d and that, unlike his co-defendants in similar roles, he did not cooperate with the government and refused to accept responsibility. And as part of this refusal to accept responsibility, the court noted that Hyacinth refused to stipulate to anything at trial, including the authenticity of several business records. This refusal to stipulate forced the government to call several records\u2019 custodians to authenticate the records, thus resulting in a lengthy and costly trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">The district court considered no impermissible factor in sentencing Hyacinth. A sentencing court \u201ccannot consider against a defendant any constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>959 F.2d 193, 197 (11th Cir.1992). But a sentencing court can consider a defendant\u2019s denial of culpability. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>934 F.2d 1199, 1200 (11th Cir.1991) (concluding that the denial of an acceptance of responsibility reduction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, did not impermissibly punish a defendant for exercising his constitutional right to stand trial). And a sentencing court also is entitled to consider a defendant\u2019s failure to cooperate without violating defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>See United States v. Malekzadeh, </em>855 F.2d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1988). Thus, the court did not punish Hyacinth for exercising his constitutional rights. The court was permitted to consider Hyacinth\u2019s denial of culpability and lack of cooperation; and his refusal to stipulate was reflective of both of these things.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>considered Hyacinth\u2019s history and characteristics in imposing sentence, permissible section 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\">. Hyacinth was indicted on and convicted of 16 counts, including conspiracy, bank loan application fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">.Hyacinth argues that the court\u2019s presumption that the excused juror did not want to participate was incorrect because the juror told the court that he did not \u201chave a problem\u201d and was glad to participate. But the juror\u2019s statement was made in response to the court telling the juror that he may be called to serve as a juror in a future case, not in Hyacinth\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-12\">. The 2000 Sentencing Guidelines were used to calculate Hyacinth's sentencing range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\">. The scheme lasted for 15 months, and involved over 27 properties (with respect to just Hyacinth) and 13 codefendants and 22 parties in related cases who either pleaded or were found guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b161-13\">. Hyacinth argues that his lawyer, not him, refused to stipulate at trial and that he was punished for the acts of a third party. If this matters, the contention is belied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>record: Hyacinth refused to enter into stipulations about the authenticity of business records, despite his lawyer's apparent recommendation that such stipulations be accepted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
