Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">Defendant-appellant Cleveland Clinic Foundation appeals from the jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs-appellees Birdie Watkins, by and through her guardian (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>son), David Pollard, and her husband, Thomas Watkins.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons adduced below, we affirm in part and reverse in part, and vacate the award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In April 1995, Birdie Watkins, a sixty-year-old woman, went to the appellant complaining of a sinus infection. Watkins was referred to Dr. Isaac Eliachar, an attending surgeon in appellant\u2019s Ear, Nose, and Throat (\u201cENT\u201d) Department, who noted that no infection was present, but did diagnose a deviated septum in the patient\u2019s nose and advised that a surgical procedure known as septoplasty be performed. When asked by the patient whether he would be performing the procedure, Eliachar stated that he did not operate alone. The doctor testified that he advised the patient on May 4, 1995, of the risks and benefits of the surgery and that he would operate with the participation and assistance of medical residents. It is uncontested that the appellant\u2019s billing records referred to Eliachar as the surgeon of record. Further, the patient did not sign a written consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">May 5, 1995, was the date of the surgery. On that morning, Eliachar was scheduled to perform four elective surgeries in two adjoining operating rooms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The anesthesiologist was Dr. Marc Popovich, who was also involved in more than one surgery at the time and, like Eliachar, moved between operating rooms during the patients\u2019 procedures. The nurse anesthetist, who assisted Popovich in Popovich\u2019s absence, was Dennis Woods, B..N. The chief resident of the ENT Department, Dr. Marc Guay, performed the surgery on Watkins. Eliachar, who was listed in the operation records and discharge summary as the performing surgeon, allegedly supervised periodically Guay\u2019s work as Eliachar moved between the adjoining operating rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Guay testified that he first met the patient on the day of the surgery in the preoperation holding area minutes before the patient was transported to the operating room. He also testified that Eliachar assigned the surgery to him and that Eliachar did not even scrub up that morning. Guay, upon meeting the patient, told the patient that he \u201cwould be operating on her <em>with </em>Dr. Eliachar.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Guay did not explain to the patient what he meant by that phrase. Guay did not know extubation parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>During the operation, which began at 7:30 a.m. and ended at 11:10 a.m., the patient was under a general anesthesia and was intubated<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by the nurse anesthetist to ensure normal breathing. According to Popovich, he did not inform the patient that a nurse anesthetist would perform the intubation and extubation and did not indicate that he, the anesthesiologist, would not be present throughout the operation. The septoplasty was uneventful. According to Eliachar, it was the surgeon\u2019s ultimate responsibility to ensure that the patient maintained an adequate airway during and after the operation. Yet Eliachar could not recall whether he was present when the patient was extubated. He believed that the nurse anesthetist extubated the patient. Popovich was not present for the extubation and did not evaluate the patient between the operating room and the postanesthesia care unit (\u201cPACU\u201d). The nurse anesthetist stated that the patient was extubated at approximately 10:30 a.m. in the operating room and that he and Guay then transported the patient to the PACU. On the way to the PACU at 10:35 a.m., the patient\u2019s heart rate was eighty-five beats per minute according to nurse Woods\u2019s records. Yet the nurse\u2019s notes from PACU indicate that at 10:35 a.m., when the patient was admitted to the PACU, her heart rate was fifty beats per minute. The nurse anesthetist\u2019s records also indicate that the patient was awake and responsive when he transported her to the PACU, yet the PACU records indicate that the patient was unresponsive, emitting a large amount of clear urine and not moving. At 10:40 a.m., the nurse anesthetist\u2019s records indicate that the patient\u2019s heart rate was seventy-eight to eighty beats per minute, while the PACU nurse\u2019s record states thirty beats per minute, a rate that is admittedly life-threatening, according to the nurse anesthetist. When the heart rate hit thirty beats per minute, the nurse anesthetist recalls, resuscitative measures were begun on the patient. The patient was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was reintubated at 10:50 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Popovich testified that it would have been preferable for the patient to have been awake and responsive when extubated and if the patient was not awake and responsive, it would have been inappropriate to extubate the patient. According to the anesthesia record, Popovich stated that the patient was in trouble at the time she was admitted to the PACU.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Dr. Howard Tucker, a board-certified neurologist and plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> testified that the patient, who is in a persistent vegetative state but otherwise healthy, is unable to communicate or care for herself, has no cognitive or conscious awareness, and requires full-time care. The patient has a feeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>tube, which admits liquid food directly to the stomach, and a tracheostomy to permit a direct airway through her windpipe. It was his medical opinion that the patient had the probability for a full-life expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">George Cyphers, a certified rehabilitation counselor, testified on behalf of plaintiffs as to the life-care plan developed for the patient, which details the medications and health care supplies, equipment, and services, and their attendant costs, that will be needed over the patient\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">John Burke, who holds a doctorate in economics, testified for the plaintiffs regarding financial losses of the patient experienced as a result of the patient\u2019s injury. The witness calculated the patient\u2019s statistical life expectancy from the date of the injury as 22.8 years, to an age of 80.1 years. Wage loss from her employment as an autoworker at General Motors was calculated at a present value of $299,360. The amount needed to medically maintain the patient in her home was calculated as $5,511,870. Burke expressed various concerns about the report of defendant\u2019s economic expert, Mr. Morbach, including (1) the forecast estimation of the inflation rate over time, which Burke stated no one could do with any certainty, (2) the use of higher-risk investments as a basis for an annual interest rate to calculate the present value of money for annuity purposes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (3) the fact that Morbach is not an economist, and (4) the fact that Morbach\u2019s analysis used a ten-year time span rather than Burke\u2019s 22.8 year time span, the effect of which would be to lessen the final amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Thomas Watkins, the patient\u2019s husband, testified that Eliachar told him that he had performed the operation. Watkins also detailed the personal life he enjoyed with his wife and family and the effect of the injury on the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Melanice Watkins, the patient\u2019s daughter, testified that as of the date of the trial in June 1997, her mother\u2019s medical bills totaled $555,551.81. She also testified as to the effect of her mother\u2019s condition on the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The defense case consisted of the testimony of five witnesses. Dr. Donald Mann, a board-certified neurologist, testified as a defense expert. Mann\u2019s medical opinion was that Mrs. Watkins\u2019s life expectancy was five to ten years, but in rare cases such patients can live thirty to forty years. Mann, who did not examine Watkins, further opined that patients in a persistent vegetative state demonstrate movement but such movement is merely an autonomic reflex and not the product of will or a thinking brain. The witness also stated that it was his experience that no patient in a persistent vegetative state has been successfully treated in the home, which is what Watkins\u2019s family wishes to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The second witness for the defense was Guay, who generally reiterated his earlier testimony. -In addition, Guay stated that he personally informed Watkins during preop that he would be operating on her that day, but did not tell her that Eliachar would not be performing any of the surgery on her. On cross-examination, the witness stated that he told Watkins that he would be performing the surgery with Dr. Eliachar. The witness also stated that Eliachar, was present in the operating room overseeing the procedure. Guay denied being involved in the extubation of Watkins, but did assist nurse Woods in transporting the patient from the operating room to the PACU. Guay noticed no problems with the patient when they arrived at the PACU, and left that area shortly after delivering the patient. According to him, there is no signed consent form by Watkins in the hospital records.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The third defense witness was Latressa Albert, the daughter of Watkins, whose deposition was read into evidence. Albert testified that she spoke with Eliachar the night after the surgery and that Eliachar did not specifically state then that he had done the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The fourth defense witness was Thomas Watkins, who generally reiterated his earlier testimony, adding that the family had incurred a debt balance of $27,-129.12 owed to MedBridge, a care facility that provided services to Watkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The fifth defense witness was Timothy Morbach, an investment professional at the brokerage firm of Kidder, Peabody and Company specializing in structured settlements involving injured persons and estates. Morbach reviewed the life-care plan prepared by plaintiffs and came to the conclusion that an annuity of $1,165,154 (present value) would cover in-home care for five years of life expectancy, or $1,813,396 (present value) for in-home care for ten years of life expectancy. If the patient were cared for in a nursing home facility, an annuity of $388,156 (present value) would cover a life expectancy of five years, or $610,013 (present value) for a life expectancy of ten years. These figures, which cover only the cost of medical care for Watkins, would start in 1997 and would not cover Mrs. Watkins from the time in 1995 when she entered her persistent vegetative-state. The witness also stated that he used various inflation factors and that recognizing inflation was proper in his industry. On cross-examination, the witness stated that the annuity was premised on women sixty-two and seventy-eight years of age at present. On further cross-examination, he stated that for a twenty-year life expectancy, the amount needed to fund the life-care plan would be $8,009,679, which would be discounted to a present value of $4,548,974.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The jury found for plaintiffs on the fraud and battery claims before it and awarded compensatory damages to Watkins in the amount of $9,660,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>jury also awarded damages of $1,300,000 to the husband of Mrs. Watkins for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Thereafter, the court heard testimony offered by Kevin P. Roberts, the treasurer of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, relative to the issue of punitive damages. In 1996, the defendant had total net assets in the amount of $766,076,000, an increase of approximately $100,000,000 from 1995. Actual cash on hand at the end of 1996 was $17,985,000 from income from operations in the amount of $19,406,000. The total excess of revenues over expenses for 1996 was $57,708,000. At the close of this testimony and subsequent to closing arguments, the jury awarded punitive damages in the amount of $3,500,000. Thus, the total damage award was $14,460,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Defendant-appellant presents nine assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error in disallowing one of the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s peremptory challenges based upon an unsupportable claim of racial discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The standard of review for a claim of excluding jurors through the use of peremptory challenges based upon racial motivation was originally set forth in <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69. The <em>Batson </em>test was recently applied to a civil case in <em>Hicks v. Westinghouse Materials Co. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 95, at 98-99, 676 N.E.2d 872, at 876-877:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court set forth in <em>Batson </em>the test to be used in determining whether a peremptory strike is racially motivated. First, a party opposing a peremptory challenge must demonstrate a prima-facie case of racial discrimination in the use of the strike. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723, 90 L.Ed.2d at 87. To establish a prima-facie case, a litigant must show he or she is a member of a cognizable racial group and that the peremptory challenge will remove a member of the litigant\u2019s race from the venire. The peremptory-challenge opponent is entitled to rely on the fact that the strike is an inherently \u2018discriminating\u2019 device, permitting \u2018 \u201c \u2018those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>State v. Hernandez </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 577, 582, 589 N.E.2d 1310, 1313, certiorari denied (1992), 506 U.S. 898, 113 S.Ct. 279, 121 L.Ed.2d 206. The litigant must then show an inference or inferences of racial discrimination by the striking party. The trial court should consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether a prima-facie case exists, including statements by counsel exercising the peremptory challenge, counsel\u2019s questions during voir dire, and whether a pattern of strikes against minority venire members is present. See <em>Batson </em>at 96-97, 106 S.Ct. at 1723, 90 L.Ed.2d at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201cAssuming a prima-facie case exists, the striking party must then articulate a race-neutral explanation \u2018related to the particular case to be tried.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1724, 90 L.Ed.2d at 88. A simple affirmation of general good faith will not suffice. However, the explanation \u2018need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 97, 106 S.Ct. at 1723, 90 L.Ed.2d at 88. The critical issue is whether discriminatory intent is inherent in counsel\u2019s explanation for use of the strike; intent is present if the explanation is merely a pretext for exclusion on the basis of race. <em>Hernandez v. New York </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 352, 363, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1868, 114 L.Ed.2d 395, 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u201cLast, the trial court must determine whether the party opposing the peremptory strike has proved purposeful discrimination. <em>Purkett v. Elem </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 765, 766-767, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 1770, 131 L.Ed.2d 834, 839. It is at this stage that the persuasiveness, and credibility, of the justification offered by the striking party becomes relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 768, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d at 839. The critical question, which the trial judge must resolve, is whether counsel\u2019s race-neutral explanation should be believed. <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. at 365, 111 S.Ct. at 1869, 114 L.Ed.2d at 409.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The final element of the standard enunciated in <em>Hicks, </em>the issue of credibility, was explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u201cReview of a <em>Batson </em>claim largely hinges on issues of credibility. Accordingly, we ordinarily defer to the findings of the trial court. See <em>Batson </em>at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1724, 90 L.Ed.2d at 89, fn. 21. Whether a party intended to racially discriminate in challenging potential jurors is a question of fact, and in the absence of clear error, we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. at 369, 111 S.Ct. at 1871, 114 L.Ed.2d at 412; <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 583, 589 N.E.2d at 1314. Trial judges, in supervising voir dire, are best equipped to resolve discrimination claims in jury selection, because those issues turn largely on evaluations of credibility. See <em>Batson </em>at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1724, 90 L.Ed.2d at 89, fn. 21.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 676 N.E.2d at 878-879.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The venire pool before the trial court contained three prospective jurors who happened to be African-American: juror No. 5, Carl Cunningham, who had been employed as an insurance agent for eight years in the past, had some minor medical training involving advanced first aid and life-saving techniques while employed as a fireman, and had been pleased to have successful arthroscopic surgery performed on his knees at the defendant hospital; juror No. 9, Myrtle Patton, who is employed by defendant as a receptionist in the surgery department and who knew many of the actors who would testify and who were likewise employed by the defendant; and juror No. 11, Vera Jackson, who is employed by defendant as a unit secretary, but did not know any of the persons expected to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>called to testify. Before jurors 9 and 11 were placed in the jury box for voir dire, the defendant asked the court in an <em>in camera </em>hearing to excuse those two jurors for cause without further questioning solely because they were employed by the defendant. See R.C. 2313.42(E). Those two jurors were questioned by the trial court and counsel and were then dismissed for cause upon the request of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The defendant\u2019s first peremptory challenge was exercised against juror No. 6, Mrs. Papp, who was a Caucasian psychiatric nurse and whose aunt had experienced a bad result during a surgery performed at defendant hospital, but also expressed her belief that she could perform as a juror fairly and without bias. Papp was excused because of her medical background, not for her relative\u2019s bad experience at the defendant\u2019s hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Defendant\u2019s second peremptory challenge was exercised against juror No. 5, Cunningham. When pressed by the court, defense counsel stated the reason for striking this juror was that Cunningham had had training in medicine and that defense counsel had had bad experiences with nurses and other persons with medical training in other medical malpractice cases. Over the strenuous objection of the defense, the trial court overruled this peremptory challenge, essentially finding that the race-neutral reasons provided by defendant for the peremptory challenge were merely a pretext:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201c[Y]our reason for peremptoring him otherwise is not appropriate. That it\u2019s not applicable to circumstances of his education and background.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">\u201cThey [the reasons for the peremptory challenge] are inappropriate, and I\u2019m also establishing for the record, I would indicate the pattern being your insistence that your own employees, you know, be removed and their race as well. You know if you want that on the record, there it is. And that is the pattern that I\u2019m finding. That\u2019s the end of the argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The first prong of the <em>Hicks </em>standard, that of a prima facie case of racial discrimination, was satisfied. Defendant had excused two of the three African-American members of the venire prior to exercising the peremptory challenge on the sole remaining black juror, Cunningham. The inference of racial discrimination by the defendant in striking Cunningham from the venire is drawn from the fact that while he was struck on the basis of his medical experience, two other jurors, No. 4 and 18, had as much medical training as Cunningham or significantly more, yet were seated on the jury. Furthermore, the fact that the defendant used its first peremptory challenge to strike Papp, who also had significantly greater medical training than Mr. Cunningham, is of little note. As the trial court surmised from judging the credibility and intent of the parties and counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the true problem defendant had with Papp was that she had a relative who had experienced a bad result from surgery at the defendant\u2019s hospital, which left Papp with a feeling she described as \u201cinevitable.\u201d These facts led the defendant to seek, and receive, permission to voir dire Papp on that issue in chambers and out of the presence of the venire. The only way for defendant to prevent Papp from being seated on the jury was to exercise a peremptory challenge. The trial court could properly conclude that the race-neutral explanation for the challenge to Cunningham advanced by defendant was a ruse. Absent clear error, we must defer to the trial court\u2019s determination of purposeful discrimination. <em>Hicks, supra, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 102, 676 N.E.2d at 878-879.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred by communicating with and instructing the jury without notifying counsel and allowing them to participate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The questions presented to the trial court by the jury and the responses by the court are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\u201cFirst question I\u2019m reading here just by the fact it\u2019s on top, \u2018Can the jury consider pain and suffering for Mr. Watkins?\u2019 Signed Mary Ann Shipman.

Flower Hosp. </em>(June 27, 1997), Lucas App. No. L-96-329, unreported, 1997 WL 362465, at 5, states the following with respect to the tort of battery in a medical setting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cIn <em>Anderson v. St. Francis-St. George Hosp. </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 221, 225, 614 N.E.2d 841 [844], the First District Court of Appeals set forth the law controlling the disposition of this assignment of error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u201c \u2018Concerning the substantive law of this dispute, the rule is that a person commits a battery when he unlawfully strikes or touches another. <em>Green v.

St. Francis-St. George Hosp. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 82, 84, 671 N.E.2d 225, 227, citing <em>Love v. Port Clinton </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 98, 524 N.E.2d 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">In the case before us, in addition to the seven factors set forth in the previous assignment, it is beyond doubt that Eliachar controlled the actions of Guay through his assignment of the procedure to Guay and the supervision of Guay. Also, there was testimony from Guay that he informed Watkins before she was transported to the operating room that he would be performing the operation, yet there is no corroboration of consent to Guay by the patient in the medical record; thus, consent is a question for the trier of fact. The allegedly unconsensual touching by Guay, which is attributable to Eliachar, and then to the defendant hospital, and which permitted Eliachar to be absent at the time of the premature extubation of the patient in the operating room, caused the injury and resulting damages to the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">These facts demonstrate a prima facie cause of action for battery sufficient to be placed into the hands of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The appellant next argues in this assignment of error that the jury instructions relative to battery were inaccurate and misleading. The charge given by the court relative to battery states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">\u201cWith respect to the next count, battery, a battery is an intentional unconsented contact with another. A surgical operation on the body of a person is a technical battery unless the patient consented to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff Birdie Watkins has brought this action alleging that consent was not given to the defendant Cleveland Clinic to perform the surgery in the manner in which it occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\u201cThe defendant denies a battery occurred. In order for the plaintiff to prevail, you must find that the following facts have been proven by a greater weight of the evidence, that Birdie Watkins was not told that Dr. Eliachar would not be performing the surgery upon her on May 5, 1995, and that Dr. Eliachar did not perform the surgery in the manner you find he expressed he would to Birdie Watkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u201cYou must determine under the facts as you find them whether the surgery performed constituted an intentional and unconsented contact in light of what Mrs. Watkins was told by Cleveland Clinic employees regarding the performance of the surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">\u201cIt is no defense to a battery claim that the surgery was performed skillfully. If you find that the plaintiff has proved the elements of battery by a greater weight of the evidence, your verdict must be for the plaintiff on that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">\u201cIf you find that the plaintiff has failed to prove the evidence by the greater weight of the evidence, your verdict must be for the defendant on the issue of battery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">\u201cFinally, with respect to the damages in the case, the issue here is what would be fair compensation for the plaintiffs injuries and damages? You will determine from the preponderance of the evidence an amount of money that will reasonably compensate the plaintiff for the actual injuries sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">The defendant\u2019s proposed instructions relative to battery stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">\u201cPROPOSED JURY INSTRUCTION NO. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-14\">\u201c219.02 Battery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-15\">\u201c1.

SEPARATE ISSUE. A party who seeks to recover for [fraud or battery] must prove not only that the other party [committed fraud and/or battery], but also that such fraud and/or battery was a proximate or direct cause of injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201c2. DEFINED. Proximate cause is an act or failure to act which in the natural and continuous sequence directly produces the injury, and without which it would not have occurred. Cause occurs when the injury is the natural and foreseeable result of the act or failure to act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The defendant\u2019s first proposed jury instruction was given virtually verbatim by the trial court in its instructions to the jury. As to the term \u201ccause,\u201d the court instructed the jury that \u201c[C]ause means the natural and probable consequences of the act. An injury is caused when it happens in the natural and continuous sequence of events and without which it would not have occurred.\u201d' This charge is not misleading as it tracks the defendant\u2019s proposed charge on cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">While it is true that the court did not address proximate cause in its charge on battery, the effect of any error on the damage award is entirely speculative since the award was not apportioned between the separate causes of action, but was given in a general award. Without this predicate of prejudice, the error can be deemed to be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that it \u201chad to find that Dr. Guay\u2019s intentional contact with Mrs. Watkins was without her consent,\u201d and in instructing that battery could be shown if \u201cDr. Eliachar did not perform the surgery in the manner you find he expressed he would to Birdie Watkins.\u201d We conclude that the given instructions, when viewed in the context of the overall charge given by the court, adequately informed the jury of its obligations relative to the claim for battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred by denying the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s motions for a directed verdict on plaintiffs claim for damages for pain and suffering and by instructing the jury on present and future pain and suffering and \u2018hedonic\u2019 damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>In this assignment, appellant argues that pain and suffering and hedonic losses attributable to Mrs. Watkins should not have been permitted because she was not able to experience them due to her permanently unconscious state.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">While defendant\u2019s medical expert (Dr. Mann) opined that Watkins did not have brain function apart from basic autonomic responses, plaintiffs\u2019 medical expert (Dr. Tucker) stated, when referring to patients in persistent vegetative state, that \u201cwe don\u2019t know what their thought processes are\u201d because such patients cannot verbalize and that such patients \u201ccannot formulate ideas as far as we know.\u201d This is not to say, conclusively, that such patients cannot feel pain or suffer as a result of their physical condition. This view is buttressed by the videotape of Watkins, which was played for the jury to demonstrate the home care needs of the patient, and which showed Watkins wincing and flinching, displaying obvious discomfort, as her tracheostomy tube was being cleaned. Finally, during the cross-examination of Melanice Watkins by the defendant, defense counsel asked the witness whether she had any further thought on her mother\u2019s consciousness and ability to feel pain, and whether any other professional had discussed the matter with her since her mother left the hospital. The defense having opened the door, Melanice Watkins, on redirect examination, responded by telling of statements attributed to an Erie, Pennsylvania neurologist, who treated Mrs. Watkins while she was staying at a facility there. That physician allegedly told Melanice Watkins that the patient \u201cvery well probably does hear and she is aware, but the brain has been so damaged and is too weak that it can\u2019t send signals out to respond.\u201d Given these conflicting viewpoints, the matter was a question of fact for the jury to resolve, assessing the weight to such opinions as it deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As to future pain and suffering, it is undeniable that Watkins is in a permanent vegetative state. Her condition will not change over her life expectancy. It is also reasonably certain that her damages will also likely continue during that life expectancy. Thus, the jury charge on this issue was proper. <em>Patton v. Cleveland </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 21, 30, 641 N.E.2d 1126, 1131. Even were we to assume that the instruction on future pain and suffering was error, the failure of the verdict to apportion the damages between present and future pain and suffering precludes recognizing prejudice to the defendant and resulting error. Cf. <em>Sentinel Consumer Prod. v. Mills, Hall, Walborn &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 211, 673 N.E.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred by refusing to give the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s proposed jury instruction on the cost of an annuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In discussing the instructions to be given to the jury, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and the trial court before closing arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201cMR. JACKSON: Judge, one additional, you are going to charge the jury on the cost of annuity under the statute, 2317.62?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: No. I\u2019m only going to tell them whatever amount of money they deem appropriate has to be present value. That\u2019s all that the law requires.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The defendant\u2019s proposed instruction relative to the cost of an annuity, which was found in 1 Ohio Jury Instructions (1996) 214, Section 23.09, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">PROPOSED JURY INSTRUCTION NO. 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\u201c23.09 Tort actions based on claims for future damages; cost of annuity</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">\u201cYou have heard evidence about the cost of an annuity in connection with the award of future damages, if any. One method of determining the present value of future damages is the cost of an annuity. You may consider that evidence in making your decisions about the amount of future damages and give it such weight as you think proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Pursuant to R.C. 2317.62(B), the cost of all annuities was expressed through the economic testimony of both parties in terms of present value. The parties argued the present value of the annuities in their closing arguments. The court instructed the jury that damages should be in an amount that would reasonably and fairly compensate the plaintiffs. After the court instructed the jury, the court asked the parties if they had any problems with the charge. The defense, which did suggest several objections to the charge as given, did not with specificity object to informing the jury that the cost of an annuity must be represented by its present value. This represents a waiver of that argument on appeal. <em>Schade, swpra. </em>Even if it were not considered as waived, we conclude that the overall charge, when viewed against the evidence, the arguments of counsel to the jury, and the amount of the award for Mrs. Watkins, adequately expressed the pertinent law to the jury. <em>State v. Price </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 136, 398 N.E.2d 772, paragraph four of the syllabus. Also, since the damage award for Mrs. Watkins is not apportioned between the different elements of her overall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>damage award (wage loss, pain and suffering, current and future medical expenses, etc.), we are unable, based upon the overall award, to conclude that the jury was confused by the charge so as not to apply the present value of an annuity as its cost in determining the damage award for future medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred by denying the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s motions for a directed verdict on plaintiffs claim for punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">In this assignment, appellant argues that the issue of punitive damages was improperly permitted to go to the jury because there was no demonstration of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">In <em>Malone v. Courtyard by Marriott </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 440, 445-446, 659 N.E.2d 1242, 1246-1248, a case that determined whether the granting of a directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages was proper, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">\u201cThe law of Ohio is clear on when punitive damages may be awarded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">\u201c \u2018[PJunitive or exemplary damages are not recoverable from a defendant in question in a tort action unless <em>both </em>of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">\u201c \u2018(1) The actions or omissions of that defendant demonstrate malice * * *, or that defendant as principal or master authorized, participated in, or ratified actions or omissions of an agent or servant that so demonstrate; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">\u201c \u2018(2) The plaintiff in question has adduced proof of actual damages that resulted from actions or omissions as described in division (B)(1) of this section.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2315.21(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">\u201cThus, as a threshold matter, Malone and Meador were obligated to present evidence of malice on the part of Marriott before their claim for punitive damages could proceed to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-15\">\u201cOur case law defines \u2018malice\u2019 as \u2018(1) that state of mind under which a person\u2019s conduct is characterized by hatred, ill will or a spirit of revenge, <em>or </em>(2) a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has. a great probability of causing substantial harm.\u2019 (Emphasis sic.) <em>Preston v. Murty </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 334, 512 N.E.2d 1174, syllabus. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-16\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-17\">\u201c * * * As Chief Justice Moyer noted in <em>Preston, </em>an award of punitive damages based on conscious disregard malice requires \u2018a positive element of conscious wrongdoing * * *. This element has been termed conscious, deliberate or intentional.

Murty, supra, </em>is not at issue in the present case. As to the second type of malice enunciated in <em>Preston, </em>the positive element of conscious -wrongdoing was not demonstrated by the evidence. The medical evidence was that it was common practice at the defendant\u2019s hospital for interns to assist in surgical operations and be supervised by more senior surgeons. Eliachar had done this numbers of time in his practice as a surgeon. The septoplasty procedure was an uncomplicated and relatively unsophisticated procedure. The operation on Watkins, up to the extubation of the patient, was unremarkable. Guay had performed more than twelve hundred surgical procedures during his tenure at the defendant\u2019s hospital and Eliachar had no knowledge of any deficiencies in Guay\u2019s abilities as a surgeon, or Popovich\u2019s abilities as an anesthesiologist, or nurse Woods\u2019s abilities as a nurse anesthetist. In short, there was no demonstration that Eliachar was aware that his action in not performing the actual surgery on Watkins and overseeing the extubation of the patient had a great probability of causing substantial harm. Accordingly, the trial court erred in permitting the jury to consider the issue of punitive damages. Therefore, that part of the damage award is reversed and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The seventh assignment of error is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u201cThe jury verdict should be reversed because it was based on passion and prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In this assignment, appellant argues that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, attorney Charles Kampinski, appealed to the passion and prejudice of the jury through a number of alleged mischaracterizations of the evidence and/or inflammatory statements to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">In determining whether passion or prejudice affected a jury\u2019s damage award to the point of necessitating a new trial, a reviewing court must consider the amount of the award and whether the damages were induced by (1) incompetent evidence, (2) misconduct by the court or counsel at trial, or (3) any other action at trial which may reasonably be said to have swayed the jury. <em>Shelton v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 665, 682, 584 N.E.2d 1323, 1334; <em>Loudy v. Faries </em>(1985), 22 Ohio App.3d 17, 19, 22 OBR 52, 54, 488 N.E.2d 235, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">In light of the evidence presented and the severity of the injuries sustained by plaintiffs, the amount of the award, viewed independently, was supported by that evidence and does not shock the conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Turning to the remaining three criteria set forth in <em>Shelton, </em>the first example of alleged misconduct by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was the use of an allegedly outdated American Medical Association (\u201cAMA\u201d) ethical opinion that identified the action of a surgeon of record in permitting an operation to be performed by another surgeon without the knowledge and consent of the patient as \u201cghost surgery.\u201d It was alleged that the more recent edition did not expressly use the term \u201cghost surgery.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether the term was in the proper edition or not, it is an accurate description for the actions at issue; thus there was no error in counsel using it before the jury. Further, appellant asserts that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel misled the jury during closing argument by telling the jury that the AMA ethical opinion prohibits such actions by surgeons and that such actions are illegal, <em>ie., </em>a criminal offense. There was no objection by the defense to this line of commentary. Accordingly, error therein was waived for appellate purposes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The second example purports to demonstrate that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel misled the jury by stating in closing argument that Watkins\u2019s medical bills to date total $555,000 while the actual medical bills offered into evidence total approximately $360,000. While this is a technically true statement of the documentation of the medical bills, Melanice Watkins testified that the total amount of the medical bills was approximately $550,000, and the parties argued in closing concerning the reasons for the missing documentation representing the difference between $360,000 and $550,000. The jury was free to assess the evidence and determine the amount of the medical expenses up to trial. Certainly, this $190,000 difference cannot be accurately assessed as having been awarded or not, given the lack of apportionment in the award to Mrs. Watkins. Whether the jury was misled on this point is not demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The third example of an appeal to inflame the passion of the jury was plaintiffs showing the videotape of Watkins, in which she is seen exhibiting a painful reflex during the suctioning of her airway. The images depicted in this videotape were relevant to demonstrate that Watkins could experience pain and suffering and corroborated the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony in that regard. Thus, its introduction was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The fourth example of alleged incitement of the jury was the remarks of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel during closing argument concerning (1) no inclination exhibited by the defendant to accept responsibility for payment of the damages and (2) counsel\u2019s opinion that defendants will hold the verdict in the same contempt that they exhibit for the truth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201cThe defendants have shown absolutely no inclination no [sic] accept responsibility regarding the payment of the damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201cMR.

JACKSON: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">THE COURT: Sustained. Disregard the last comment. Go ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">First, the comment regarding accepting \u201cresponsibility regarding payment of the damages\u201d is a proper comment considering that defendant is fighting the claims advanced by plaintiffs at trial. It can be inferred from this posture that defendant, in litigating these claims, is not accepting responsibility, as seen through the eyes of the plaintiffs, to accept an allegedly good faith claim for relief. As to the second comment, the court promptly gave a curative instruction to the jury to disregard it, thereby minimizing to the greatest extent possible prejudice to the defendant. Further, taking the proceedings in their totality, it cannot be said that the verdict was affected to any great extent on this lone comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> The fifth example of an incitement of the jury\u2019s passion allegedly occurred near the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 rebuttal closing argument, when counsel stated the following without objection by the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">\u201cIf you are inflamed, it\u2019s because the facts inflame you. It inflamed me. But I\u2019m not here asking you to punish these people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">The failure to timely object waives error at the appellate level. Even had there been an objection raised, we do not consider this comment to be error, but a fair comment on the evidence. To prohibit jurors, and counsel, from having strong feelings in a case such as this is asking the impossible considering the uncomplicated nature of the medical procedure that led up to the injury and the tragically severe injuries that followed. Much of the sting of this comment was displaced and placed in perspective when plaintiffs\u2019 counsel tempered his comment by asking that the jury not act to punish the defendant, but to \u201ccompensate these people for their loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">The eighth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">\u201cThe cumulative effect of the errors below requires reversal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Based on the determinations of the previous assignments of error, this assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
