Pentaflex contends that the trial court erred by rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants, by failing to rule on its motion to amend its complaint, and by failing to determine whether insurance obtained by the defendants provided it with coverage for an employer intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">We conclude that the trial court did not err by rendering summary judgment. We also conclude that the trial court did not err by failing to make a determination regarding insurance coverage, because that issue was not made out by the pleadings. Finally, we presume that the motion for leave to amend the complaint was denied despite the fact that the trial court did not expressly rule upon the motion, and we conclude that the denial of the motion for leave to amend was within the trial court\u2019s discretion; therefore, the trial court\u2019s failure to issue a ruling was not error. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">Plaintiff-appellant Pentaflex, Inc., is an Ohio corporation, engaged in the business of metal stamping, with its principal place of business located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Springfield, Ohio. Defendant-appellee Express Services, Inc., is a temporary employment service company based in Oklahoma. Express Services provides temporary personnel to business and industry. Defendant-appellee Gleam, Inc., is a franchise of Express Services, located in Springfield, Ohio, owned and operated by Larry Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Pentaflex began using personnel provided by Express Services in 1989. Sometime thereafter, Pentaflex requested that Express Services provide it with an indemnification agreement regarding injuries to employees provided by Gleam. Larry Hill obtained a form from Express Services, which was a \u201cstandard indemnity agreement\u201d used by Express Services. The parties executed an indemnity agreement, dated May 7,1989, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201cExpress Services, Inc. * * * does hereby agree to indemnify Pentaflex' Inc. * * * (hereinafter called Client) under the following terms and conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201cWhereas Express Services is desirous of furnishing temporary personnel to the Client for consideration as agreed upon between the parties; and whereas the Client is desirous of obtaining temporary personnel from Express Services from time to time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cIt is HEREBY agreed by and between Express Services and Client that Express Services has procured, and will maintain in effect throughout the life of this Agreement, Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance in full limits as required by statute, and Employers Liability with a limit of $1,000,000 covering temporary personnel assigned to Client hereunder. Express Services agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Client, its agents, employees, officers, or affiliated entities against and in respect of any and all claims, demands or losses for Bodily injury or Disease to the Express Services Temporary Personnel caused by or resulting from the work performed for Client to the limit of the Worker\u2019s Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance carried by Express Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\u201cExpress Services agrees to maintain Comprehensive General Liability Insurance in the combined single limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence for Bodily Injury or Property Damage to include contractual liability coverage for the indemnity and hold harmless provisions of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">\u201cExpress Services assumes and agrees to indemnify Client for losses which Express Services is legally obligated to pay which are covered by the above insurance. However, this does not include losses resulting from: work being performed in a reasonable, prudent manner by Express Services Temporary Personnel and/or as instructed by Client; losses resulting from willful misconduct, intentional acts or negligence of the Client (except for losses covered by Express Services Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance); injury to Client\u2019s employees; operations of any motor vehicle licensed for highway use; or for damage of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>machinery, equipment, or materials in the care, custody or control of an Express Services employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In response to a letter from Pentaflex\u2019s insurance agent seeking clarification of the agreement, the risk management director of Express Services sent a letter explaining that the fifth paragraph of the agreement applied only to the comprehensive general liability insurance referred to in the fourth paragraph of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">According to Express Services, the indemnity agreement was not the sole writing executed by the parties with respect to responsibility for injuries and related expenses. Apparently, Express Services and Gleam provided Pentaflex with weekly group time sheets, which contained the following indemnity language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c3. It is agreed that client will indemnify Express Services and Express Services employees for: Injuries incurred by client\u2019s employees in the course of their employment; losses resulting from work performed by Express Services employees in a reasonable, prudent manner and/or as instructed by client; and losses resulting form willful misconduct, intentional or negligent acts by the client (except for losses covered by Express Services\u2019 Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">* \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\u201c6. It is agreed that the Client will furnish a suitable place for Express Services employees to work which shall comply with all laws and ordinances related to occupational health and safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">According to Express Services, these weekly time sheets also stated that \u201cClient\u2019s Signature indicates acceptance of the terms and conditions on the reverse side.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">In April 1992, Express Services assigned Charles Jackson as a temporary worker at Pentaflex. About a month later, Jackson was injured while working at Pentaflex when part of his right hand and arm were severed by a hydraulic press. Jackson sued Pentaflex, Gleam, and Express Services, alleging negligence and intentional tort claims. In 1994, summary judgment was rendered in favor of both Gleam and Express Services with respect to Jackson\u2019s negligence and intentional tort claims. The trial court also dismissed Jackson\u2019s negligence claim against Pentaflex, leaving only his intentional tort claim against Pentaflex for trial. The record does not reveal the outcome of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">In February 1993, Pentaflex brought this declaratory judgment action against both Express Services and Gleam. Pentaflex alleged that the indemnity agreement required Express Services and Gleam to \u201cindemnify, hold harmless and defend\u201d it in the civil action brought by Jackson. Gleam and Express Services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>filed a motion for summary judgment in April 1996. The motion for summary judgment was multifaceted. Express Services and Gleam claimed that the complaint of Pentaflex should be dismissed because (1) the indemnity agreement provided to Pentaflex violated public policy, (2) the indemnity agreement did not expressly waive immunity from common law liability as provided by the workers\u2019 compensation laws (R.C. Chapter 4123) and Section 35, Article II, of the Ohio Constitution, (3) the indemnity agreement was superseded by the weekly group time sheets provided to Pentaflex, and (4) the liability for which Pentaflex sought indemnification occurred outside the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The trial court first denied the motion for summary judgment, stating only that genuine issues of material fact existed. Express Services and Gleam moved the court for a reconsideration of its denial of their motion for summary judgment. Thereafter, in September 1996, Pentaflex filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint to include a claim for reformation of contract and estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In January 1998, the trial court filed an entry granting summary judgment in favor of Express Services and Gleam. The entry, in its entirety, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201cThis cause came to be heard on the motion of the Defendants, for a reconsideration of their motion for summary judgment granting dismissal of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201cThe Court having considered the pleadings, affidavits, and arguments of counsel, and there being no genuine issues as to material facts, and the Defendant being entitled to a judgment granting the relief prayed for as matter of law, it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201cORDERED that the motion for summary judgment be and is hereby granted and the case is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">\u201cCosts to the Plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">From this judgment, Pentaflex appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Pentaflex\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the appellee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">Pentaflex contends that the trial court erred by rendering summary judgment in favor of Express Services and Gleam. Pentaflex argues that genuine issues of fact exist in regard to every issue raised by Gleam and Express Services in the motion, so that summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Although we are not favored with the court\u2019s reasoning in deciding to grant summary judgment, our review of that decision is <em>de novo. Koos v. Cent. Ohio Cellular, Inc. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 579, 588, 641 N.E.2d 265, 271-272. \u201cPursuant to Civ. R. 56, summary judgment is appropriate when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, said party being entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We conclude that Gleam and Express Services are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the indemnification provision upon which Pentaflex relies is not sufficient to overcome their statutory and constitutional immunity from liability resulting from injury to an employee. R.C. 4123.74; Section 35,.Article II, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"> It is not disputed that Express Services and Gleam complied with the requirements of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or that Jackson was their employee for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Pursuant to <em>Kendall v. U.S. Dismantling Co. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 61, 20 OBR 360, 485 N.E.2d 1047, an employer in compliance with the workers\u2019 compensation laws of Ohio does not surrender its statutory and constitutional immunity from suits arising out of employment absent an express and specific waiver of that immunity. <em>Id., </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. The waiver must refer specifically to this type of immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 65, 20 OBR at 363, 485 N.E.2d at 1051. Absent an express waiver that refers specifically to the immunity arising from the workers\u2019 compensation statute and constitutional provision, an indemnification agreement between the employer of the injured person and a third party may not override the immunity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The indemnification provision upon which Pentaflex relies is neither artful nor \u2022 clear, but appears to have been intended to make any proceeds from the workers\u2019 compensation insurance or employers\u2019 liability insurance that Gleam and Express Services agree to carry available to indemnify Pentaflex for any liability that it may incur to a loaned employee. In any event, the indemnification provision does not refer specifically to the immunity arising from the workers\u2019 compensation statute and constitutional provision. Therefore, pursuant to <em>Kendall, supra, </em>the indemnification provision is not sufficient to overcome the immunity to liability of Gleam and Express Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Pentaflex argues that the immunity arising from the workers\u2019 compensation statute and constitutional provision is not available to Gleam and Express Services because its liability arises from the law of employer intentional tort, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>which is outside the scope of workers\u2019 compensation immunity. The flaw in this argument is that we are not concerned with Pentaflex\u2019s immunity, but with the immunity of Gleam and Express Services. Gleam and Express Services did not commit an act exposing Jackson, their employee, to a substantial certainty of injury. Their liability would arise out the fact that Jackson was their employee; consequently, they are immune unless they waive their immunity by specific reference to the immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Because we hold that Gleam and Express Services enjoyed immunity from liability under the workers\u2019 compensation statute and constitutional provision, and did not waive that immunity, we conclude that the trial court correctly rendered summary judgment <em>in </em>their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Pentaflex\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Pentaflex\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to consider whether a contractual obligation to obtain employer\u2019s liability insurance required coverage for an employer intentional tort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Pentaflex appears to be contending that because the indemnity agreement required Express Services and Gleam to maintain employer\u2019s liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000, the trial court erred when it did not resolve the issue of whether the employer\u2019s liability insurance obtained by Express Services and Gleam included coverage for employer intentional torts</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">However, Pentaflex also admits that the issue of whether the employer\u2019s liability policy provided such coverage was not raised in the motion for summary judgment filed by Express Services and Gleam. More important, no claim was set up in Pentaflex\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment based upon an alleged breach of contractual duty to provide insurance coverage. Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court erred by failing to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Pentaflex\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Pentaflex\u2019s third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to rule on a motion to amend the complaint which amendment asked the trial court to declare whether a contractual obligation to obtain employers liability insurance required procurement of insurance covering employer intentional tort claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Pentaflex contends that the trial court erred because it did not rule on Pentaflex\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, which was filed prior to the entry rendering summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u201cWhen a trial court fails to rule upon a motion, it will be presumed that it was overruled.\u201d <em>Gosden v. Louis </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 195, 222, 687 N.E.2d 481, 498. Therefore, we must presume that the trial court denied Pentaflex\u2019s motion, and determine whether that denial constitutes reversible error. A trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a pleading will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Wilmington Steel Prod. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 573 N.E.2d 622, 624-625. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Quebodeaux v. Quebodeaux </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 502, 505, 657 N.E.2d 539, 541. A movant must provide prima facie support for the new claims that it seeks to plead. <em>Wilmington, supra, </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in this case. The motion to amend the complaint was not filed until more than three years after the original complaint was filed. Pentaflex stated that the amendment was necessary in order to raise the issue whether the indemnity agreement required Express Services and Gleam to obtain employers\u2019 liability coverage. However, the only evidence offered in support of the motion was a statement that an insurance agent for Pentaflex had testified that employers\u2019 liability coverage should have provided coverage for intentional torts. Furthermore, in the answer to the original complaint, Express Services and Gleam specifically denied that they had procured such coverage. Their denial should have alerted Pentaflex to the issue of insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Before Pentaflex sought to amend its complaint to encompass an additional claim for relief based upon an alleged breach of the contractual obligation to provide insurance coverage, Gleam and Express Services had already filed their motion for summary judgment. While proceedings with respect to a motion for summary judgment are ordinarily less onerous than trial \u2014 the very reason for providing for motions for summary judgment \u2014 they are not free of legal expenses, and those legal expenses are not trivial. Once the parties have briefed a motion for summary judgment, together with the submission of relevant evidentiary material, upon the assumption that the issues framed by the pleadings have been fully addressed in connection with the motion for summary judgment, the trial court may reasonably conclude that it would be unduly burdensome to permit one party to introduce a new claim for relief, potentially requiring new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>discovery and the preparation of new evidentiary material and legal arguments, all at substantial expense to the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Pentaflex\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">All of Pentaflex\u2019s assignments of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-9\">Brogan, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b250-10\">Grady, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b250-11\">Grady, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">The indemnity agreement demonstrates no promise by Express Services, Inc. or Gleam, Inc. to indemnify Pentaflex, Inc. for its liability for intentional torts. The promisors, Express Services and Gleam, have merely agreed to indemnify the promisee, Pentaflex, for any liability arising from the promisors\u2019 failure to maintain workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability insurance coverages. Workers\u2019 compensation does not cover intentional torts. The nature and extent of the promised employer\u2019s liability insurance coverage are not defined, but the exclusion of \u201closses resulting from willful misconduct (or) intentional acts\u201d eliminates any possibility that intentional tort claims are covered or indemnified thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Any reliance on <em>Kendall v. U.S. Dismantling Co. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 61, 20 OBR 360, 485 N.E.2d 1047, is wholly misplaced. <em>Kendall </em>stands for the proposition that an employer may waive its workers\u2019 compensation immunity from common-law civil liability to its employees, if it does so expressly. The waiver doctrine cannot create liability where none exists, which is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">I would overrule the second assignment of error on the foregoing basis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
