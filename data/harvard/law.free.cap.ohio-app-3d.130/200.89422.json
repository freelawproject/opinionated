Because we conclude that the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">While on routine patrol, a Bowling Green police officer ran a random registration check of the vehicle traveling in front of his police car. The dispatcher reported that the vehicle\u2019s owner was appellant, Nancy L. Marker. The dispatcher further reported that the owner\u2019s driving privileges were suspended. Based upon this information and noting that the driver was female, the officer stopped the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Appellant, who was in fact driving the vehicle, was cited for driving under suspension and violating the Financial Responsibility Act in violation of Bowling Green Ordinance 71.13(B)(\u201cCount One\u201d), and driving under suspension and failure to pay the reinstatement fee in violation of Bowling Green Ordinance 71.13(C)(\u201cCount Two\u201d). Appellant moved to suppress, arguing that the officer did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to stop her vehicle. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The prosecution then was granted leave to amend Count Two of the complaint to driving under suspension and failure to pay the reinstatement fee in violation of R.C. 4507.02(C), and to dismiss Count One. Appellant pled no contest to amended Count Two and was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Appellant now appeals, setting forth the following sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\u201cThe stop and subsequent arrest of the appellant was a violation of appellant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution because the stop was not based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion that appellant was engaged in criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">When determining a motion to suppress, a trial court becomes the trier of fact and is, therefore, in the best position to resolve questions of fact and to evaluate the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Vance </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 56, 58, 647 N.E.2d 851, 852; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 37, 41, 619 N.E.2d 1141, 1143-1144. An appellate court must accept the findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>Id. </em>Accepting those facts as true, the appellate court must \u201cdetermine as a matter of law without deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, whether they meet the applicable standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">We recently stated in <em>State v. Pennington </em>(July 17, 1998), Wood App. No. WD-97-122, unreported, 1998 WL 456597, that \u201ca police officer does not need to possess specific and articulable facts warranting suspicion of criminal behavior to run a license plate check on a vehicle traveling the public roadways. <em>United States v. Walraven </em>(C.A.10, 1989), 892 F.2d 972; <em>State v. Owens </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 523 [599 N.E.2d 859].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">We have also concluded that it is reasonable to infer that an automobile\u2019s owner is driving it. <em>State v. Epling </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 663, 665, 664 N.E.2d 1299, 1300; <em>State v. Owens, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">In this case, the officer knew that the owner of the vehicle, a woman, had suspended driving privileges. Upon seeing that the driver of the vehicle was a woman, it was reasonable to infer that the owner of the vehicle was driving it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Consequently, the officer possessed a reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts that appellant was engaged in criminal activity. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The judgment of the Bowling Green Municipal Court is affirmed. Court costs of this appeal are assessed to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-8\">Handwork, P.J., and Glasser, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
