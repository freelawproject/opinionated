Juniper, on one count of aggravated trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(10) with two specifications, one count of aggravated trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), one count of permitting drug abuse in violation of R.C. 2925.13(A) with a specification, and one count of fleeing and eluding in violation of R.C. 2921.331. The charges stemmed from an undercover drug buy on January 25, 1996, wherein appellant was the driver of the Chevrolet Blazer vehicle involved therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">On September 4, 1996, appellant filed a motion to suppress evidence, including appellant\u2019s vehicle and any statements made by appellant. Appellant claimed that law enforcement officers had misused the felony-investigation subpoena statute. Pursuant to an agreed entry filed October 31, 1998, appellant\u2019s statements were suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">A jury trial commenced on October 1, 1996. During deliberations, it was brought to the trial court\u2019s attention that a document containing appellant\u2019s suppressed statement had been was inadvertently submitted to the jury. Appellant moved for a mistrial, and a ruling was deferred pending the jury\u2019s verdict. The jury found appellant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">On October 23, 1996, appellant filed a motion for new trial. By entry filed November 22, 1996, the trial court denied that motion and appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. By entry filed January 28,1997, the trial court sentenced appellant to a term of fifteen years to life plus a three-year term of actual imprisonment, to be served consecutively, and imposed a $7,500 fine plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Both appellant and appellee, the state of Ohio, filed notices of appeal. This matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial after it was established that appellant\u2019s illegally obtained confession, which had been excluded from evidence, was nevertheless submitted to the jury, thereby violating his rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and comparable provisions of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial after it was established that appellant\u2019s illegally obtained confessions, which had been excluded from evidence, was nevertheless submitted to the jury, thereby violating his rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and comparable provisions of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the Chevrolet Blazer, because this evidence was seized in violation of his rights as guaranteed by the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and comparable provisions of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">Cross-Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision to refuse to order a mandatory fine while ordering a general f\u00edne of $7500.00 was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Assignments of Error I, II</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial and motion for a new trial based upon the inadvertent submission to the jury of appellant\u2019s suppressed statement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">After hearing and extensive briefing on appellant\u2019s statement to law enforcement officers obtained under the felony-investigation subpoena statute (R.C. 2935.23), the trial court sanctioned an agreed entry suppressing the statement. By memorandum filed September 24, 1996, the trial court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-15\">\u201cFirst, the defendant asserts that the case against Shawn M. Juniper should be dismissed for reasons heretofore examined by the court, that is, misuse of the felony investigation subpoena procedure. The court again takes notice of the agreement reached by counsel or at least the offer of the state not to use the statement made by the defendant except upon cross-examination. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>finds such sanction to be adequate and again reiterates this resolution as the proper order to be made.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">At the conclusion of the trial, a letter (State\u2019s Exhibit No. 29/Court\u2019s Exhibit No. 1) from the prosecutor to defense counsel went with the jury into the deliberation room. Included within this exhibit were the statements \u201cThe Defendant later admitted to being the driver of the Blazer that was involved in the chase\u201d and \u201cThe Defendant stated that he is unable to identify the passenger that was in his vehicle that day.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case in chief, the trial court and counsel reviewed the exhibits, and the prosecutor agreed that the letter \u201cdoesn\u2019t go to the jury. And it is in the group. That goes with the file for the purpose of any appeal, if it would ever get that far.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">After commencing deliberations, the forelady of the jury returned to open court and the following exchanges occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you want to have your seat, if you would, please? You\u2019re Juror 101; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: We have had a question come up that I would need to inquire of you. Is this your note about there being no sticker on Exhibit No. 29?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: It\u2019s my note that we were missing several items of evidence: A, B, C, D \u2014 and there were two more. There were six pieces-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. We\u2019ll get to that in a minute. I have here a letter from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office marked State\u2019s Exhibit 29 with no sticker on it. And I have attached to that a comment, \u2018There\u2019s no sticker. Are we supposed to have this?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Could you tell us what the jury did with this? Have they considered this letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: No, we didn\u2019t consider that, really. We just looked at that and wondered if we should be considering it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. No juror has read this; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-16\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: It has been read, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: And I take it \u2014 has it been commented on also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\u201c(No verbal response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I mean, was it read out loud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: It was not a factor \u2014 it has not been a factor in our discussions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Well, somebody read it, or was it read out loud, or how did this happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: It was read out loud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And you say it\u2019s not been a factor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: No, it hasn\u2019t been a factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">\u201cMR. HUEY: Were you all each taking an item of the evidence and reading through it? Would that \u2014 I don\u2019t know how the jury \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: No. Actually, one person \u2014 a couple of people were just looking through the pile of evidence to make sure that we had all of the pieces there. So it seems like one person \u2014 yea, not all of us didn\u2019t \u2014 we were not all looking at all of the evidence, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">\u201cMR. HUEY: But somebody was \u2014 -you were trying to sort out of the evidence, sort out the exhibits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: Uh-huh. \u2022 Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-16\">\u201cMR. HUEY: A couple of people were doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-17\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-18\">\u201cMR. HUEY: And somebody found that exhibit and read a portion of that page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-19\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-20\">\u201cMR. HUEY: Do you know which portion of that page that would be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-21\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: The second part. There are two pages, I think and I think it was the second part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, actually, there are three pages. You say there were things on the second page that were read to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-23\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-24\">\u201cTHE COURT: Could you maybe explain a little bit better what you mean by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-25\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: I can tell you exactly what was \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014 that it was not a factor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: Yes, I could. We had already had \u2014 we had already had our discussion and kind of come to our decision, and then this was found and brought out. This was not a factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: You had already reached a decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cJUROR NO. 101: Well, in a tentative sense. Not \u2014 we didn\u2019t finalize anything, but we had all discussed and brought our \u2014 we all knew what everybody else thought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">After an in-chambers discussion between the trial court and counsel (not recorded), the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">\u201cThere is one further question on what was marked as State\u2019s Exhibit 29, but not given a sticker. The question is: \u2018Are we supposed to have this?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">\u201cThe answer is no. This was submitted to you by mistake. I think when that was submitted to you, everybody was so tired, I don\u2019t know that anybody looked at it. I will submit to you the correct Exhibit 29 that you may consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">\u201cThe letter that you returned to the Court must not be considered by you for any reason. This is not evidence and it\u2019s not proper that you consider it. I would give you the same instruction that I gave when an answer has been given that I\u2019ve instructed you to disregard. You must treat it as though you had never seen it. If you have reached any kind of understanding, you should not change your opinions or decisions on the basis of this letter. You should just disregard it. I will give you the correct Exhibit 29 that ybu may consider in your deliberations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Defense counsel moved for a mistrial but suggested that the trial court withhold its ruling until a verdict was reached. The trial court assented to this suggestion, agreeing to wait seven days after the verdict to rule on the motion and to continue appellant\u2019s bond in the event of an adverse verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">The long-standing law of this nation and state is that involuntary confessions are an abridgement of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the right against self-incrimination afforded under the Fifth Amendment and will not be permitted. Therefore, any conviction including an unlawful and involuntary confession will not stand. <em>Rogers v. Richmond </em>(1961), 365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760; <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>(1964), 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">It is undisputed there was a constitutional error in submitting the unlawfully obtained statement to the jury. As explained by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State v. Esparza </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 660, 661, 660 N.E.2d 1194, 1196, there are two types of constitutional error:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302, the United States Supreme Court distinguished between two types of constitutional error: \u2018trial error\u2019 and \u2018structural error.\u2019 Trial error \u2018oecur[s] during the presentation of the case to the jury, and * * * may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 499 U.S. at 307-308, 111 S.Ct. at 1264, 113 L.Ed.2d at 330. Structural error affects \u2018the entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end\u2019 as well as \u2018the framework within which the trial proceeds.\u2019 Such errors \u2018defy analysis by \u201charmless-error\u201d standards.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 309-310, 111 S.Ct. at 1265, 113 L.Ed.2d at 331.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">. The <em>Esparza </em>court went on to hold that evidence improperly submitted to a jury is trial error, not structural error, and is therefore subject to review under the harmless error standard. <em>Id. </em>at 661-662, 660 N.E.2d at 1195-1197. The Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E.2d 1323, paragraph six of the syllabus, held, \u201cWhere constitutional error in the admission of evidence is extant, such error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The thrust of appellant\u2019s defense was that he was not the driver of the vehicle involved in the drug buy. Appellant sought to question the credibility of the law enforcement officers who identified him and an individual by the name of Scott Lewis who had entered into a plea negotiation for his testimony to identify appellant. Once the jury was cognizant of appellant\u2019s statement that he in fact was driving the vehicle, the entire defense theory of the case was discredited. The law enforcement officers\u2019 identifications and Lewis\u2019s testimony are validated. Appellant\u2019s case was nullified by the inadvertent admission of the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Upon review, we find that the constitutional error was not harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motions for mistrial and new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Assignments of Error I and II are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his vehicle, the Chevrolet Blazer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Appellant\u2019s vehicle was seized after appellant revealed its location during the interrogation associated with the misuse of the felony-investigation subpoena statute. Appellant argues that his disclosure was involuntary given the nature of the interrogation and that therefore the vehicle should have been suppressed pursuant to the exclusionary rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u201cThe deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right. By refusing to admit evidence gained as a result of such conduct, the courts hope to instill in those particular investigating officers, or in their future counterparts, a greater degree of care toward the rights of an accused.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Tucker </em>(1974), 417 U.S. 433, 447, 94 S.Ct 2357, 2365, 41 L.Ed.2d 182, 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">By memorandum filed July 15, 1996, the trial court found that appellant\u2019s disclosure was involuntary but found that the doctrine of inevitable discovery applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cThe question then remains was the discovery of the location of the vehicle inevitable? The investigation on the drug sale and fleeing and eluding in the Blazer was well under way at the time of the disclosure by defendant. Jodi West and Scott Lewis had provided information about defendant and his friends and the sheriffs office had the ID number of the subject vehicle. Being at one of defendant\u2019s friend\u2019s home, its location was only a matter of a short while.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In revisiting the same issue, the trial court once again denied the motion to suppress the vehicle, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cFinally, with respect to the question of the suppression of the evidence relating to the vehicle, allegedly driven by the defendant, the court finds said motion to be without merit. Before the Blazer was located the focus of the sheriffs offices investigation was on the defendant and his Blazer. The Blazer was parked on a street in Whitehall in clear view of anyone who might approach it. The sheriffs office was enthusiastically pursuing this case as it considered the case to be of major importance and it was reasonably, if not highly, probable that the vehicle would have been located even without the assistance of the defen- \u25a0 dant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The inevitable-discovery exception to the exclusionary rule states that \u201cillegally obtained evidence is properly admitted in a trial court proceeding once it is established that the evidence would have been ultimately or inevitably discovered during the course of a lawful investigation.\u201d <em>State v. Perkins </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 193, 196, 18 OBR 259, 261, 480 N.E.2d 763, 766-767. In order to have evidence admitted under this exception, the state must demonstrate the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">\u201c(1) a reasonable probability that the evidence would have been discovered by lawful means but for the police misconduct, (2) that the police possessed the leads making the discovery inevitable at the time of the misconduct, and (3) that the police were actively pursuing an alternate line of investigation prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>misconduct.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 333, 336, 646 N.E.2d 863, 865.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Captain Dennis Carley of the Fairfield. County Sheriffs Office testified that based upon information he received from one Jody West,, he determined that appellant owned a mid-1980 Blazer like the one they were looking for. Several law enforcement officers drove by appellant\u2019s house looking for the vehicle. Upon serving appellant with the subpoena, Captain Carley identified appellant as the person driving the vehicle involved in the drug buy. The vehicle was found in Whitehall, about five to ten minutes away from appellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Based upon the evidence presented, we concur with the trial court\u2019s conclusions and find that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Assignment of Error III is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">CROSS-ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Based upon our decision in Assignments of Error I and II, this assignment of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Fairfield County, Ohio is hereby affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-11\">William B.
