Coffman, Sr. appeals the judgment and sentence of the Mercer County Common Pleas Court following a jury trial and conviction for two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Defendant was indicted for engaging in sexual contact with his seven-year-old grandson, Shaun Coffman, two separate times over the course of the same evening. Count one of the indictment was based on the allegation that on or about January 4, 1997, defendant placed his hand onto Shaun\u2019s penis, began rubbing it, and asked Shaun if it \u201cfelt good.\u201d Count two of the indictment was based on the allegation that defendant caused Shaun to place his hand on defendant\u2019s penis and rub it for defendant\u2019s own sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">From the summer of 1996 through early 1997, Shaun spent a significant amount of time with defendant. Defendant often took Shaun along to help him at work, and Shaun was paid for this help. Shaun frequently spent weekends at \u25a0 defendant\u2019s apartment, and evidence at trial indicated that they may have slept in the same bed on at least some occasions. Shaun\u2019s father (defendant\u2019s son) and mother expressed some concern about the sleeping arrangements, but generally approved of the time Shaun spent with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Shaun\u2019s contact with defendant abruptly ceased the first Saturday of January 1997. That day, defendant got into an argument with Shaun\u2019s parents, who felt that Shaun was spending too little time at home and too much time with defendant. As a result of the argument, Shaun\u2019s parents and defendant stopped speaking to one another. Shaun did not visit or see defendant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">On approximately February 25, 1997, Shaun\u2019s parents made a report to the Mercer County Department of Human Services. His parents asserted that on the previous day, Shaun had informed them that defendant had touched his genitals and that he had seen and touched defendant\u2019s genitals. On February 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>1997, Detective Pat Elking and social worker Roberta Donovan conducted a brief interview of Shaun and began an investigation of defendant. On July 15, 1997, defendant was indicted by the grand jury for two violations of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4). A trial was conducted December 16 to 18,1998, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was denied on January 23, 1998. Defendant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of three years each on February 27, 1998. Defendant appeals and asserts the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cAssignment of Error I: The court erred when it permitted, over the objection of defendant, the prosecuting attorney to claim that it was his job to seek justice rather than convictions thereby inferring that in exercising the power of the state, he had information which was sufficient to obtain a conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cAssignment of Error II: The court erred when it permitted the police officer to testify, over the objection of the defendant, that in his eighteen (18) years of experience, he had never known a child to lie about being sexually abused and further over objection, he was allowed to testify that in his experience, one half of the victims are totally honest the first time he talks to them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Defendant argues in his first assignment of error that the following portion of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s final rebuttal argument was improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201cMR. HOWELL: * * * But I also want to tell you that my job as Prosecutor, Mr. Poppe is trying to make it sound like I\u2019m trying to lead this witness, create this case. <em>My job as the prosecuting attorney, I took an oath not just to convict but to fairly enforce the law. In fact, ladies and gentlemen, I have an obligation to make sure that innocent people don\u2019t go to jail.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201cMR. POPPE: Objection, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">\u201cMR. HOWELL: And, yes, I talked\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdS\">\u201cTHE COURT: What\u2019s your objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">\u201cMR. POPPE: Your Honor, he\u2019s giving testimony. That is improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Objection is overruled. Mr. Howell, you may continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">\u201cMR. HOWELL: Thank you, your honor. It\u2019s my job to talk to these witnesses, not to coach them, not to make them say things. Every good prosecutor talks to witnesses. And you know why? <em>Because we want to make sure that they\u2019re going to testify to the truth and innocent people don\u2019t go to jail. That\u2019s why we do that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-15\"><em>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019m proud to be the prosecuting attorney in this case. </em>And once again, I thank you for your time. Thank you.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Defendant contends that these remarks improperly indicated to the jury that the prosecutor personally believed in the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The relevant inquiry regarding a prosecutor\u2019s improper statements during closing argument is \u201cwhether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 318, 470 N.E.2d 883, 885. This inquiry is guided by consideration of four factors: (1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an objection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant. <em>Sidney v. Walters </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 825, 829, 694 N.E.2d 132, 134-135. Finally, courts must also be mindful of the general maxim that prosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for reversal unless it so taints the proceedings that it deprives the defendant of a fair trial. See, <em>e.g., State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 90, 656 N.E.2d 643, 661-662.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We agree with defendant that the remarks improperly indicated the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s guilt. The state argues in response that the prosecutor was required to make the challenged statements to rebut \u201cderogatory comments\u201d by defense counsel and that defense counsel \u201copened the door\u201d to arguments about the special duties imposed on prosecutors by impugning the prosecutor in his own closing argument. The state thus contends that its remarks were invited by defendant and were not improper. See, <em>e.g., State v. Uhler </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 113, 124, 608 N.E.2d 1091, 1097-1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">A thorough reading of the record does not support the state\u2019s claim. The following excerpt from closing argument is the closest defense counsel comes to a personal attack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201cNow if the purpose of an investigation is only to find evidence for which to convict a person, then you obviously don\u2019t want to worry about that. But if the purpose of your investigation is to find the truth, then you obviously need to be looking at those kinds of things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">While this argument clearly attacks the validity of the state\u2019s investigation, we are not persuaded that it was a personal attack on the prosecutor\u2019s integrity. Furthermore, the prosecutor chose not to object. An objection is the proper remedy for defense misconduct during closing argument. <em>United States v. Young </em>(1984), 470 U.S. 1, 13, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1045, 84 L.Ed.2d 1, 11. Moreover, even if defendant\u2019s argument did invite a response from the prosecutor, that response was not proportional. We therefore find the state\u2019s invocation of the invited-reply doctrine unpersuasive, and conclude that the trial court incorrectly overruled defendant\u2019s objection to the challenged remarks. Standing alone, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>unlikely that these remarks would rise to the level of reversible error. Unfortunately, they must be considered in the context of additional assertions raised in defendant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error asserts that the trial court improperly allowed the state to address the credibility of the victim and defendant. Under the rule of <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 129, 545 N.E.2d 1220, 1240-1241, an expert witness is precluded from testifying as to the expert\u2019s opinion of the veracity of the statements of a child declarant. Here, the state offered the testimony of Detective Patrick Elking, an eighteen-year veteran police officer, who investigated defendant and who was present at the initial interview of defendant\u2019s grandson Shaun. However, the prosecutor\u2019s questions repeatedly attempted to elicit testimony from Detective Elking about his experience in other cases, with the apparent purpose of improperly bolstering Shaun\u2019s credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cQ: In all the cases that you\u2019ve interviewed these children who have had allegations of sexual abuse against them, have all of those cases resulted in indictments against the defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cA: No, by no means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">\u201cQ: So I assume in that answer that there have been some that have not resulted in indictments. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">\u201cA: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">\u201cQ: Have there been some of those interviews where it was later found out that the child was being misinterpreted or was lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">\u201cA: I don\u2019t remember one where a child was ever lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">\u201cMR. POPPE: Objection as to relevance, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Howell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">\u201cMR. HOWELL: Your Honor, this goes to the questioning of the child in this particular case, and I believe Mr. Poppe, throughout his voir dire and his opening statement, has alleged the manner in which these children or this child was interviewed. I think it\u2019s relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-16\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Again, I don\u2019t remember a child Shaun\u2019s age lying. We have had instances where it was confirmed 16-and 17-year-old children have lied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-17\">Admission of this testimony, over defendant\u2019s proper objection, was erroneous. Whether the victims in previous cases which Detective Elking has investigated were truthful and accurate is not relevant to the truth or accuracy of Shaun\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>account of the incident at issue in this case. As such, the testimony seems clearly intended to indirectly introduce the officer\u2019s opinion as to the credibility of the prosecuting witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The prosecution\u2019s examination of Detective Elking continued with the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cQ: Now, you\u2019ve interviewed more than just children witnesses, haven\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cA: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\u201cQ: In fact you\u2019ve interviewed quite a few adult alleged criminals. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201cA: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">\u201cQ: Who do you generally find lie more that the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">\u201cA: Obviously, the defendants. I\u2019ve never had anyone even near Shaun\u2019s age where we knew for a fact they were lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">\u201cMR. POPPE: Objection, your Honor. Again, he is trying to establish credibility through testimony; and he has not been qualified as an expert to give any such testimony in credibility. And that is.not permissible for a witness to give testimony about credibility in a case as such because that\u2019s a jury question, and it\u2019s something that is done through the jury instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to sustain the objection. You can question this witness about the manner in which he has interviewed this particular \u2014 conducted interviews in this particular case, but to the extent that the testimony lends itself as to the truthfulness of any particular statements, specifically, the 16-year-old or the youth in this case, I\u2019m going to sustain the objection and instruct the jury to disregard the defendant\u2019s answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-14\">\u201cMR. HOWELL: Thank you, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">Here, the court properly sustained defendant\u2019s objection. Detective Elking not only repeated his testimony about child abuse victims always telling the truth, but also attempted to testify that defendants often lie. Such testimony is unquestionably improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-16\">However, we note that the court\u2019s curative instruction contained a fault of its own. The court instructed \u201cthe jury to disregard <em>the defendant\u2019s </em>answer.\u201d The challenged testimony was that of a prosecution witness, not that of the defendant. While in the broader context of the testimony and the trial (especially considering the general jury instructions at the close of the case) we believe that the misstatement was a minor error, we do believe that it may have dampened the effectiveness of the curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-17\">The prosecution made a third attempt to improperly bolster Shaun\u2019s credibility at the close of Detective Elking\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201cQ: Now, Detective Elking, Mr. Poppe raised an issue in his opening statement about the child, Shaun, making disclosures at separate times, perhaps inconsistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201cHas it been your experience over all these years that you\u2019ve interviewed children in these types of cases for them to make a gradual disclosure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cMR. POPPE: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">\u201cMR. POPPE: My objection is, your Honor, he\u2019s calling for something as if it were an expert witness testifying. There\u2019s been no foundation laid for him to be an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Howell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">\u201cMR. HOWELL: Your Honor, I think I\u2019ve laid a foundation sufficient so that he can render what his experience has been with these children, especially when Mr. Poppe has raised the issue about how Mr. Elking and Roberta Donovan inappropriately interviewed this child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to allow him to answer this question, but we need to move along and focus on his examination of the victim in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">\u201cA: Yes. I would say that approximately half of the victims will be totally honest the very first time you talk to them. The other half will disclose in stages as they feel secure or comfortable enough to talk about it, particularly to a stranger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">While a question about the the tendency of child witnesses to disclose in stages is not itself improper, it is clear on this record that the question was yet another attempt by the state to include Detective Elking\u2019s opinion testimony regarding the truthfulness of child witnesses in general, and hence the child in this case in particular. Detective Elking\u2019s response thus contains the permissible testimony that child abuse witnesses often disclose their stories in stages, but also impermissibly states that those witnesses always tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">The state argues that this testimony was a proper rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s implication that the investigation was untrustworthy. Specifically, the state contends that defendant\u2019s voir dire and opening statement \u201copened the door\u201d to Detective Elking\u2019s testimony on direct by indicating that the investigation in the case was perfunctory and untrustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">In voir dire, defense counsel questioned the venire on their beliefs regarding the possibility of false memories being planted in children\u2019s minds by improper questioning. At one point, counsel does imply that this might be a false memory syndrome case, although he does not say it directly. No direct evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>regarding false memory syndrome was presented at trial. This clearly constituted improper trial conduct on the part of defense counsel that the trial court should have perhaps monitored more carefully. The failure to do so may well have instigated some of the problematic testimony and comments now at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Moreover, while most of defendant\u2019s opening statement merely relates defendant\u2019s history to the jury, there are two distinct passages that raise questions about the investigation into Shaun\u2019s claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cThe next testimony that\u2019s very questionable is people who then talk to a child and then suggest things to a child, and then talk to the child again, and talk to the child again, and talk to the child again, and talk to the child again over a period of time until the story becomes something that cannot be recognized as truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201cWe believe the evidence will then show that back by the time that we get to January, February, March, April, April 18th, that then the story is changing * * *. But this is the testimony you\u2019re going to have to be most careful about, because this is testimony that\u2019s reported by Lena. We\u2019re not talking about something that was reported to the police by Shaun. We\u2019re talking about something that was reported to the police by Lena to Officer Elking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\u201cWhen you hear the testimony, you\u2019re going to see that there\u2019s been a lot of different time sequences, and the thing that we\u2019re going to be asking you to look at and to help us try to figure out is, why is there one story that occurs in January, which is just a matter of being upset \u2018because you didn\u2019t bring him home when you were supposed to bring him home,\u2019 and the next communication is through police two months later, which says, \u2018You\u2019ve touched this child in a certain manner.\u2019 And then another two months later than that, there is, \u2018Now we\u2019re mad because you touched him in a different manner in a different way.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">These statements may have \u201copened the door\u201d to some of Detective Elking\u2019s testimony (such as the tendency of child victims to disclose their stories in stages, noted earlier), but they certainly do not open the door to all of it. In short, most of the testimony elicited from Detective Elking was a disproportionate response to defense counsel\u2019s questions in voir dire and opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">In <em>State v. Whitt </em>(1991), 68 Ohio App.3d 752, 758, 589 N.E.2d 492, 495-496 the Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County faced a similar situation. In that case, a social worker testified that child abuse accusations were false only one percent of the time. Additionally, the detective who worked on the investigation testified that only three of the eighty to one hundred cases of child abuse she had worked on involved false accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Like the testimony at issue in <em>Whitt, </em>Detective Elking\u2019s testimony effectively stated that all children of Shaun\u2019s age who allege sexual abuse are telling the truth, to compel the conclusion that Shaun\u2019s allegations must be truthful as well. As such, the testimony had essentially the same purpose as the testimony deemed inadmissible in <em>State v. Boston. </em>The fact that Detective Elking\u2019s testimony is couched as a factual observation rather than an opinion does not make it any more admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In <em>Whitt, </em>the court concluded that the challenged statements were inadmissible under <em>Boston, </em>but determined that the erroneous admission of the testimony was harmless. However, <em>Whitt </em>was tried to the court rather than to a jury, and the judge stated on the record that he did not believe the testimony. Here, we are faced with a jury trial, a general verdict, and similar prejudicial statements admitted over vigorous and proper objection. The <em>Whitt </em>court, in support of its conclusion that the error was harmless, relied upon the greater latitude granted to bench verdicts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201cThe use by the state of [certain prejudicial evidence] is improper and constitutes error, but while such error may be cause for reversal because of its prejudicial effect on a jury,'it must affirmatively appear that in a bench trial the court relied on such testimony in arriving at its verdict in order for such error to be ground for reversal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>68 Ohio App.3d at 758, 589 N.E.2d at 495-496, citing <em>State v. White </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 146, 44 O.O.2d 132, 239 N.E.2d 65, paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In sum, based upon the entire trial record, including Detective Elking\u2019s testimony as well as the' state\u2019s improper argument in rebuttal, we are forced to conclude that the proceedings were sufficiently tainted by prejudicial error so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Defendant\u2019s two assignments of error are therefore sustained and the judgment and sentence of the Mercer Court of Common Pleas are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-9\">Thomas F.
