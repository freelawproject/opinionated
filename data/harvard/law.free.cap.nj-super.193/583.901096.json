The City argues that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.3, which provides a tax exemption where property is \u201cused for public purposes,\u201d does not apply here because the property it would subject to taxation was only partially used for \u201ca public purpose.\u201d The record discloses that 53% of the property owned by the County in 1981 was leased to the County College for educational purposes; 47% was temporarily subleased to the electric company, concededly not a public purpose. The County contends that this temporary private use was merely incidental to the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>purpose and should not preclude a total exemption under <em>N.J. S.A. </em>54:4-3.3, since the utility\u2019s was a one-year phase-out lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We disagree with both parties and with the decision by the Tax Court that the entire property was exempt \u201cfrom local property tax for 1981.\u201d We conclude that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.6 is applicable and that this is not an \u201call or nothing\u201d situation. The precise language of this statute, as amended by A. 1977, <em>c. </em>370, \u00a7 1, fits the situation and unquestionably resolves the parties\u2019 dispute in a just fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The statute was amended in 1977 to recognize current realities in the use of public property; it stated in pertinent part</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUiq\">The following property shall be exempt from taxation under this chapter: All buildings actually used for colleges, schools, academies or seminaries, provided that if any portion of such buildings are leased to profit-making organizations or otherwise used for purposes which are not themselves exempt from taxation, said portion shall be subject to taxation and the remaining portion only shall be exempt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">... The foregoing exemption shall apply only where the association, corporation or institution claiming the exemption owns the property in question and is incorporated or organized under the laws of this State and authorized to carry out the purposes on account of which the exemption is claimed or where an educational institution, as provided herein, has leased said property to a historical society, or association or to a corporation organized for such purposes and created under or otherwise subject to the provisions of Title 15 of the Revised Statutes. <em>[Ibid,.']</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">We do not believe the fact that the property was leased to the County College, rather than held by it in fee, should negate the partial tax relief obviously intended by the Legislature in these situations. The property was \u201cused\u201d in part for the college; a portion was temporarily \u201cleased to a profit-making organization,\u201d the electric company; the party claiming the exemption, the County, \u201cown[edj\u201d the property and was \u201cincorporated ... under the laws of this State,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:41A-25 (incorporation of county), and was \u201c... authorized to carry out the purposes on account of which the exemption is claimed____,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64A-3 (freeholder board may create a county college); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64A-12(1) (college\u2019s board of trustees may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>lease property \u201cnecessary or desirable for college purposes\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64A-14 (county may lease its property to a county college).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument that the title of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.6\u2014\u201cExemption of property of nonprofit organizations\u201d \u2014compels a different result. The exempt portion of the property was used by a nonprofit organization. Thus, our construction does no violence to the plain language of the statute. The rule is \u201cwell-established\u201d that \u201cthe title cannot control the plain words of the statute.\u201d 2A <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 47.03 at 73 (4th ed. 1973); <em>Swede v.
