We find nothing in the subsequently decided case of <em>Ochs v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>108 (1982) which compels a contrary holding.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b335-14\">BISCHOFF, P.J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6K\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">I find the majority\u2019s adoption and affirmance of the trial court\u2019s opinion unacceptable, thus compelling me to record my dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">The accident which gives rise to this PIP claim occurred Oct. 12, 1974 with Edward O. Lind, III sustaining injuries for which he received treatment. The PIP carrier paid all bills submitted up to Feb. 26, 1975. At that time active treatment terminated. Future surgery was anticipated but deferred due to the age of the claimant (then age 7). In October of 1978 medical examinations were conducted and bills for the examinations submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the PIP carrier. Payment was refused for the reason that more than two years had elapsed since the last treatment. Reliance was placed upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1(a) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">a. Every action for the payment of benefits set forth in sections 4 and 10 of this act, except an action by a decedent\u2019s estate, shall be commenced not later than 2 years after the injured person or survivor suffers a loss or incurs an expense and either knows or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know that the loss or expense was caused by the accident, or not later than 4 years after the accident whichever is earlier, provided however, that if benefits have been paid before then an action for further benefits may be commenced not later than 2 years after the last payment of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">This action against the carrier was filed Feb. 1, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">It is conceded the law suit was instituted more than four years after the accident and more \u201cthan 2 years after the last payment of benefits.\u201d In fact, the trial court concluded plaintiffs\u2019 claim was barred by the clear wording of the statute but applied equitable considerations to reach a result which it thought would \u201cfulfill the clearly defined goals of the statute.\u201d 174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In doing so I believe he erred. The statutory provision under consideration is clear and unambiguous. As Judge Fritz observed in <em>Still v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231 (App.Div.1983) (opinion dated April 21, 1983) \u201cIt would be difficult to improve upon the clarity of words expressing limitation in terms of \u2018not later than 2 years after <em>the last payment </em>of benefits\u2019. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1a (emphasis supplied).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">It is therefore unnecessary to delve deeper than the literal words of the statute to define the legislative intent. <em>State v. Butler, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>220, 226 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Here the suit was not instituted within \u201c4 years after the accident\u201d nor within 2 years after the last payment of benefits. <em>Bell v. Western Employer's Ins. Co., </em>173 <em>N. J.Super. </em>60 (App.Div. 1980) is factually inapposite and the court in <em>Ochs v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>108, 112, n. 1 (1982) identified the general issue but refrained from deciding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is barred by the clear wording of the statute. Amendments and extensions of the statutory scheme should be left to the Legislature and not performed by this Court under the guise of a liberal interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">I would hold plaintiffs\u2019 claim for reimbursement for the cost of the medical examinations is barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
