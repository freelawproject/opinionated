The advertisement states that many of its cars are \u201cpriced well below dealer invoice.\u201d The regulation prohibits \u201c[t]he use in any advertisement of a comparison to the dealer\u2019s cost or inventory price.\u201d Appellant was ordered to cease and desist the practice and pay a penalty of $1,600 and costs. It contends that the regulation falls outside the purposes and policies of the Consumer Fraud Act (the act) <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 <em>et seq.) </em>under which it was promulgated, unconstitutionally abridges the right of free speech, and either does not apply to appellant\u2019s ad or, if it does, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Appellant\u2019s arguments rest on its assertion, which we reject, that the ad is not deceptive and misleading but rather informs the public of a fact helpful in deciding on the purchase of a new car.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Because of product standardization, price is a major competitive factor in the sale of new cars. An advertisement is particularly luring if it persuades the potential buyer that the advertiser\u2019s prices are lower than its competitor\u2019s. Because it is difficult if not impossible for an advertiser to compare each of its prices with those of its competitors, competitive price advertising tends to take a different form. The advertiser tries to persuade the reader that its price compares favorably to a fixed and generally understood point of comparison such as the manufacturer's suggested retail price.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Acting under the rule-making authority of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-4, the Attorney General promulgated regulations regarding comparison price advertising intended to assure the integrity of the point of comparison and a full disclosure of the components of the advertised price with which it is being compared. A dealer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>may advertise that its sales price is a reduction from the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price so long as the sales price includes the same costs, such as dealer preparation and freight charges, as the suggested retail price and the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price is \u201cclearly denominated as such.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a)(2)(iii) and (v). A dealer may advertise that his sales price is a reduction from his usual sales price so long as he can prove by his records at least three occasions during the previous 90-day period when \u201cthe advertised motor vehicle or its substantial equivalent\u201d was \u201csold or offered for sale\u201d at that \u201cusual\u201d price. The reduction must be at least 5% of his \u201cusual retail sale price.\u201d <em>N.J.A. C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a)(4)(i). A dealer may advertise that his sales prices are lower than those of his competitors so long as his prices are in fact \u201creasonably below those usually offered in the business area of the advertiser.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a)(7)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The regulation in question expressly prohibits \u201cany advertisement of a comparison to the dealer\u2019s cost or inventory price.\u201d The regulation is reasonable because a dealer\u2019s cost or what he pays to put or keep a vehicle in inventory is not a fixed, uniform and generally understood point from which meaningful comparisons can be made. When a dealer advertises that he is selling a car for what it cost, a reader can easily be misled into believing that if he purchased the car he would be getting a bargain not realizing that the advertiser\u2019s idea of cost may include a portion of overhead and payments to the manufacturer which will later be refunded. Appellant\u2019s general manager conceded the point. He testified, \u201cVery often it is almost impossible to tell what your true cost of a car will be because of many factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Appellant\u2019s precise point is that \u201cdealer invoice,\u201d the point of comparison used in its ad, is a specific, identifiable dollar amount and therefore may be fairly used. According to its general manager, the invoice price is \u201can amount of money which the dealer pays for the automobile to the factory. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>that is it.\u201d By way of example, appellant put into evidence a typical invoice showing \u201cinvoice total\u201d to be $5,566.81. According to its manager, that is the \u201cdealer invoice\u201d price. However, the invoice itself shows that the figure includes a \u201choldback\u201d of $178.89, \u201cadv. assn.\u201d of $100 and' \u201cSFPIPP\u201d of $25\u2014all of which the factory will return to. the appellant. Nevertheless, appellant insists that it should be free to advertise in effect that $5,566.81 is what it paid the factory for the car. It may be, as the manager testified, that if a customer asked to see the invoice these reductions of the invoice price would be explained. However, we are dealing here with whether the ad is misleading, not with whether its misleading features will later be explained to a customer who is sophisticated enough to ask to see the invoice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In addition to the rebates appearing on the invoice, there was unrefuted evidence that some dealers may expect other payments from the factory in the form of sales bonuses and subsidies to meet various adverse market conditions. One may well argue that some or all of these payments reduce what \u201cthe dealer pays for the automobile to the factory.\u201d We are satisfied that like \u201ccost\u201d and \u201cinventory price,\u201d \u201cdealer invoice\u201d is not a fixed, uniform term generally understood by the public to mean what the advertiser may intend it to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number> Quite apart from our own view of the matter, we must defer to the expertise of the Division which has reasonably concluded that cost-price advertising in general is inherently deceptive and that appellant\u2019s ad is such a prohibited practice. <em>See Gloucester Cty. Welfare Bd. v. N.J. Civ. Serv. Comm\u2019n., </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>384, 389-391 (1983); <em>Fenwick v. Kay American Jeep, Inc., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>372 (1977). A car buyer could easily be misled by an ad featuring cost-price comparisons into believing that the stated cost is what the dealer paid for the car. The same danger exists when the dealer expresses cost as \u201cdealer invoice.\u201d The regulation as interpreted and applied here is consistent with and advances the act\u2019s purpose to declare unlawful an advertising practice which misrepresents \u201cany material fact ... whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"> The constitutional right of commercial speech does not include the right to mislead the public. <em>Central Hudson Gas v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n., </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>557, 566, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2343, 2351, 65 L.Ed.2d 341, 351 (1980); <em>In re Professional Ethics Advisory Comm. Op. 475, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>74, 83 (1982), app. dism. 459 <em>U.S. </em>962, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>285, 74 L.Ed.2d 272 (1982). It should also be noted that commercial speech is accorded less constitutional protection than \u201cpure\u201d noncommercial speech. <em>Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>85, 124-125 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The regulation is not rendered unconstitutionally vague by including \u201cdealer invoice [price]\u201d within the meaning of \u201cdealer\u2019s cost or inventory price.\u201d Those against whom the regulation operates and those who enforce it cannot mistake its prohibitory scope. <em>See Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>104, 108-109, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2294, 2298-2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222, 227-228 (1972). Whether a regulation is unconstitutionally vague must be analyzed from the point of view of those to whom it applies, taking into account their \u201cpeculiar expertise in being able to assess the meanings of [its] terms.\u201d <em>In re Polk License Revocation, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>550, 575 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>A law may be unconstitutionally overbroad if in \u201cproscribing constitutionally protected activity, it ... reach[es] farther than is permitted or necessary to fulfill the state\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, n. 21. We have held that the regulation is reasonable and not vague as applied to appellant. The overbroad objection may be raised only to protect the rights of others. Because \u201cthose affected are apt to challenge overbroad laws that affect their commercial well-being, ... the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">On cross-examination, appellant's manager admitted that even if the customer were shown the invoice, he would not be told that appellant would recoup the holdback:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Q ... And do you think if an ordinary person looked at a document of this sort, that that person would understand that you might recoup the holdback from the invoice total?</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">A It is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Q Do you think it is more\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">A I don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Q Possible than not? .</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">A I don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">Q Let me ask you this question. Would a consumer be told that you would recoup a portion of that holdback from the invoice total?</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">A I would say no.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b652-5\">BOTTER, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"AXiy\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">By preventing advertising in relation to the dealer\u2019s invoice price, a portion of the regulation in question tends to reduce a legitimate mode of competition through advertising and deprives the public of information that would be useful in shopping for a new automobile. In the name of preventing deception and misleading advertising, the regulation goes beyond the means necessary to achieve a lawful, regulatory purpose, and it unduly restricts commercial speech. For these reasons, part of the regulation is unreasonable in my opinion, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The consumer fraud law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 <em>et seq., </em>L. 1960, <em>c. </em>39, makes it unlawful to use fraud, deception or misrepresentation in connection with the sale and advertisement of any merchandise. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2. Regulations may be adopted to further the purposes of the law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-4. Pursuant thereto, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-2.1 <em>et seq. </em>were adopted to regulate motor vehicle advertising practices. The regulations contain many valid provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regulation involved in this case, <em>N.J.A. C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a)(7)(iv), prohibits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The use in any advertisement of a comparison to the dealer\u2019s cost or inventory price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">As interpreted by the Division and upheld by my colleagues, new car dealers cannot advertise and offer to sell motor vehicles in New Jersey at or below \u201cdealer invoice\u201d price or at a given sum, such as $100 or $200, above \u201cdealer invoice\u201d price.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The regulation clearly prohibits advertising in relation to \u201cdealer\u2019s cost.\u201d One obvious reason for this regulation is that the \u201ccost\u201d to a dealer is a variable term that is difficult to define and may mean different things to many people. If a dealer could advertise motor vehicles for sale at \u201ccost,\u201d members of the public may be misled into thinking the advertisement refers to the price a dealer has paid the manufacturer. Instead, the dealer could be referring to all costs, including the cost charged by the manufacturer as well as salesmen\u2019s commissions and various overhead or operating costs that are difficult to ascertain. Because such advertising could be misleading, I would uphold the regulation to the extent that it bars advertising in relation to the ephemeral term \u201cdealer\u2019s cost.\u201d A different problem is posed by the use of the term \u201cinventory price.\u201d It is not clear what is meant by this term. In the case at hand answers to interrogatories supplied by respondent stated that, as used in <em>N.J.A. C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a)(7)(iv):</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">\u201cDealers <em>[sic </em>] cost\u201d and \u201cinventory price\u201d are construed to mean the price the dealer pays the manufacturer for an automobile. Such \u201ccost\u201d or \u201cprice\u201d includes, but is not limited to, the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">a) overhead costs;</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">b) rebates or other cash returns from the manufacturer;</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">c) dealer holdbacks;</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">d) commissions from credit sales;</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>e) discounts;</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">f) freight charges;</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">g) floor plan charges;</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">h) markup for profit; \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">i) allowance from the manufacturer for volume sales;</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">j) advertising costs;</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">k) incentive awards;</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">l) bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">This answer indicates that \u201cdealer\u2019s cost\u201d and \u201cinventory price\u201d were intended to mean the same thing.. This suggests respondent\u2019s lack of expertise and probably also the failure to comprehend what the regulation\u2019s author had in mind. The term \u201cinventory price\u201d does not appear to be. in common usage in the trade. Thus, the initial draftsman may also have lacked expertise. The problem posed by the vague term \u201cinventory price\u201d was perceived by the New Jersey Automobile Dealers\u2019 Association. Its representatives asked the Division of Consumer Affairs (Division) in September 1981 if the term \u201cfactory invoice\u201d could be inserted in the regulation dealing with comparisons to dealer\u2019s cost or inventory price.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>' Although considered, the suggestion has not been adopted. Nevertheless, in another interrogatory answer in this case, respondent stated that \u201cdealer invoice\u201d is considered synonymous with the terms \u201cdealer cost\u201d and \u201cinventory price\u201d as used in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-2.-2(a)(7)(iv). Of course, the term \u201cdealer invoice\u201d is not used in the regulation. Nor is it likely that the term \u201cdealer invoice\u201d would connote a list of costs that include \u201cmarkup for profit,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201coverhead costs,\u201d and \u201cbonuses\u201d which were listed by respondent in the answer mentioned above as items included in \u201cdealer\u2019s cost\u201d and \u201cinventory price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>With this background the case before us can be considered. In November 1980, appellant ran an advertisement which read in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">You will be able to take your brand new Pontiac home with you TONIGHT!</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">NOTE * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Our sales managers will not authorize these Special Prices on any car not in stock (Many will actually be PRICED WELL BELOW DEALER INVOICE.) [Emphasis in original.]</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">In response to this advertisement the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs filed a complaint charging that appellant had violated <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a)(7)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">At the hearing before an administrative law judge appellant contended that advertising in reference to the dealer\u2019s invoice price did not violate the regulation because the term was not synonomous with dealer\u2019s cost or inventory price. Appellant also contended that, if interpreted to preclude reference to the dealer\u2019s invoice price, the regulation unduly interfered with commercial speech and was overbroad. These contentions were rejected by the administrative law judge and his findings and conclusions were adopted in their entirety by respondent. A fine was imposed, and respondent was ordered to cease and desist such advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">At the hearing the witness who testified in support of the complaint was Richard DeLorenzi, a former supervisor of the section which enforced the automotive advertising regulations. He testified that the regulation bars advertising which refers to the dealer\u2019s cost or invoice. Asked what the terms \u201cdealer\u2019s cost or inventory price\u201d mean to him, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-12\">This is very difficult to say because there are a couple of frames of references on that matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\">Dealer\u2019s cost as most dealers use it as I have found out in my experience is they mean the cost that they got on the original invoice from the manufacturer. But that is not the final cost to the dealer for that particular vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-14\">There are such things as holdbacks which the manufacturer after the dealer pays for the cost of the vehicle on the invoice, the manufacturer sets aside a certain amount of money and then returns it to the dealer and the dealer gains anywhere from two to three percent of the value that was on the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>invoice. So the invoice and the costs that they refer to on their advertisements is [sic ] not a true cost.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">DeLorenzi testified also that the terms \u201cdealer\u2019s cost\u201d and \u201cinventory price\u201d meant the invoice or bill received by a dealer from the manufacturer. He conceded that it differed from the description given in the answer to interrogatories because the invoice did not contain items showing overhead costs and markup for profit as well as other items indicated in that answer. He also conceded that the terms \u201cdealer\u2019s cost\u201d and \u201cinventory price\u201d include certain items that do not appear on the dealer\u2019s invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The testimony in the case from Division\u2019s witness and appellant\u2019s witness establishes that \u201cdealer invoice\u201d is a commonly used term which refers to a document showing what the manufacturer has billed the dealer for a particular ear.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The term may be contrasted with the terms used in the regulation, \u201cdealer\u2019s cost\u201d or \u201cinventory price,\u201d which have no fixed, generally accepted meaning in the trade. Whether respondent and its agents meant to equate dealer\u2019s cost and dealer invoice is immaterial; they did not expressly do so in the regulation, and the terms used in the regulation do not include a term of art in the trade, namely, dealer invoice. Thus, appellant should not have been found guilty of violating the regulation, whether or not it is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>However, if the regulation is deemed to include a prohibition of advertising in relation to the dealer\u2019s invoice price, I would hold it invalid to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The record before us contains a sample invoice from the Pontiac Motor Division of General Motors Corporation to appellant. It refers to a specific automobile. It shows the suggested retail price for the basic car, the optional items included, and the suggested retail price of the options. The total of these costs plus delivery and freight charges are shown as the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price. The invoice also shows a lower sum designated \u201cinvoice total.\u201d This is the dealer invoice price.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s witness testified that this is \u201cthe amount of money that is paid by the dealership to General Motors for the vehicle.\u201d The invoice also shows a lower figure representing the \u201cinvoice total\u201d less amounts deducted for \u201chold back,\u201d \u201cSFPIPP\u201d (Supplemental Floor Plan Interest Protection Program), and \u201cAdv.Assn.\u201d (advertising fees). The evidence shows that the hold back sum ($178.89 on a vehicle that carried a manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price of $6,170.85) is regularly returned to the dealer by the manufacturer, and that other designated items which are included in the dealer\u2019s invoice price are also recouped by the dealer from the manufacturer. Indeed, the invoice itself bears the legend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG4\">INVOICE MAY NOT REFLECT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THE VEHICLE IN VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE REBATES, ALLOWANCES, DISCOUNTS AND INCENTIVE AWARDS FROM MANUFACTURER TO DEALER.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Appellant\u2019s expert testified that appellant would show a customer the invoice upon request if appellant advertised on the basis of dealer invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">As interpreted in the majority opinion, the regulations allow advertising that shows discounts from the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price <em>(see N.J.A. C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a)(2)(v)), but do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>allow advertising that would, for example, offer a given price above the dealer\u2019s invoice price. The reason given is that an unsophisticated buyer may take the \u201cdealer invoice\u201d price to suggest the actual cost to the dealer, without realizing that the actual cost is reduced by holdbacks and other charges that the dealer recoups from the manufacturer as well as by other sums that may reward the dealer for high sales volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">There are several answers to these concerns. In the first place, the means used by the regulation\u2014a total ban on advertising in relation to the dealer\u2019s invoice price\u2014is excessive. It applies a remedy that is worse than the disease. If car buyers do not know that the dealer invoice price does not show the actual cost to the dealer, the regulations could simply require advertisements to announce that fact. It is advantageous for buyers to know <em>at least </em>the amount of the dealer\u2019s invoice price. If the fear is that they will not avail themselves of information in the public domain, namely, that dealer invoice price does not mean actual cost, a simple remedy can be supplied by tailoring the regulation to meet this need. It is worth repeating that the invoice in evidence contains this notice to prospective buyers. The invoice also shows the \u201cmemo amount less H/B &amp; Adv.\u201d as $5,262.92 in addition to the \u201cInvoice Total\u201d of $5,566.81. Thus, a buyer who examines the invoice\u2014the regulation can also require that the invoice be given to the buyer when dealer-invoice advertising is employed\u2014would be able to compare the initial invoice price with the net invoice charge to the dealer. Whether contained on the invoice or not, the regulation can require that buyers be advised of holdbacks, rebates and other discounts from dealer invoice price. After all, buyers normally do not expect dealers to sell cars at cost. Everyone knows that a retail seller must have a markup over cost to stay in business. The idea that this regulation is needed to protect the public is fanciful. The record before us does not justify giving uncritical deference to the supposed expertise of Division on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>It is axiomatic that regulations must not only serve a legitimate governmental purpose, but the means chosen must be reasonable and appropriate to that end and \u201cin keeping with the public need.\u201d <em>Roselle v. Wright, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>400, 410 (1956); <em>see Collingswood v. Ringgold, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>350, 359 (1975), App. dism. 426 <em>U.S. </em>901, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2220, 48 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>826 (1976). The regulation may not be entirely arbitrary and capricious, but \u201can exercise of power that exceeds the bounds of reasonable necessity would run afoul\u201d of common rights. <em>Reingold v. Harper, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>182, 191 (1951). The state may regulate commercial speech to prevent misleading the public. But speech is not entirely \u201cunprotected merely because ... it serves the economic purposes of [a] corporate entity.\u201d <em>Collingswood v. Ringgold, supra, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>at 363. Advertising in relation to dealer invoice price is not inherently misleading; it is not a misrepresentation; it is not deceptive or false. What is feared is that portions of the public may not know enough. The problem is not that the advertising tells too much about dealer invoice price but that it may not tell enough. If this is so, the remedy ought to require more disclosure rather than the suppression of all advertising on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of N.Y., </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>557, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2343, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>341 (1980), the United States Supreme Court invalidated a regulation of the New York Public Service Commission that banned advertising which promoted the use of electricity. The ban was adopted to serve the state\u2019s interest in conserving energy and insuring fair rates for electricity. The court held that the regulation violated the rights of free speech protected by the First Amendment. Commercial speech, the court said, is protected against \u201cunwarranted governmental regulation\u201d; it not only serves the economic interest of the speaker, but \u201calso assists consumers and furthers the societal interest in the fullest possible dissemination of information.\u201d 447 <em>U.S. </em>at 561-562, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2349, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 348. The court espoused enlarging communication, not contracting it. \u201cEven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>when advertising communicates only an incomplete version of the relevant facts, the First Amendment presumes that some accurate information is better than no information at all\u201d (citing <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>350, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2691, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977)). 447 <em>U.S. </em>at 562, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2349, 65 L.Ed.2d at 348. The court said that permissible regulation of commercial speech must be \u201cin proportion to\u201d the regulatory interest and \u201cmust be designed carefully to achieve the State\u2019s goal.\u201d Thus, the First Amendment requires that speech restrictions be \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d; \u201cif the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot survive.\u201d 447 <em>U.S. </em>at 564, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2350, 65 L.Ed.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"Azgv\">In holding the ban invalid, the court in the <em>Central Hudson </em>case noted that the advertising was neither inaccurate nor unlawful. The court also said that the commission did not demonstrate that the public purpose it sought to advance \u201ccannot be protected adequately by more limited regulation of [the] commercial expression.\u201d 447 <em>U.S. </em>at 570, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2354, 65 L.Ed.2d at 354. As noted in <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>at 374-375, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2704, 53 L.Ed.2d at 830, in connection with advertising by attorneys, omissions that tend to give an inaccurate impression should be cured by affording greater disclosure rather than a complete ban. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Bates, </em>it is strange to deny the dissemination of relevant information to the consumer on the ground that it is incomplete; for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE1\">... the argument assumes that the public is not sophisticated enough to realize the limitations of advertising, and that the public is better kept in ignorance than trusted with correct but incomplete information. We suspect the argument rests on an underestimation of the public. In any event, we view as dubious any justification that is based on the benefits of public ignorance. [Ibid.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgU\">For the stated reasons I would hold the regulation invalid. It suppresses useful information; the means chosen to avoid misconceptions unduly encroaches on rights of free speech; and the remedy for the perceived danger of deception is to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>more disclosure rather than the suppression of relevant information. The regulation stifles a legitimate, honest means of competition and deprives the public of the benefit of truthful advertising. Therefore, I dissent from my colleagues\u2019 decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">For example, the regulations provide that when a new or used motor vehicle is advertised for sale, as distinguished from advertising \u201cthe general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>availability or qualities\u201d of a make, model or series of new motor vehicles, the \"specific dollar amount indicating the total retail selling price,\u201d exclusive of taxes and licensing costs, must be stated. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a)(2)(ii).
