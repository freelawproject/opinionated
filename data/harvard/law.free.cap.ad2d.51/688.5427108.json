The state of the record relative to the value of services of counsel does not warrant an additional award at this juncture. The award of additional counsel fees, if any, would best be evaluated by the trial court. Concur\u2014Kupferman, J. P., Murphy, Lupiano, Birns and Lane, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
