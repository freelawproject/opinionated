(3 Rivers) on 3 Rivers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in granting 3 Rivers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">\u00b63 3 Rivers, a cooperative nonprofit membership corporation, is authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to install, operate, and maintain telephone services within certain areas of Montana. On May 7, 2001, 3 Rivers entered into an \u201cAid to Construction Agreement\u201d (the Agreement) with Firelight, a limited liability company, whereby Firelight agreed to pay 3 Rivers $85,497.88 to aid 3 Rivers in the costs it would incur in installing, operating and maintaining telephone facilities for services to Firelight\u2019s subdivision in Big Sky, Montana. The Agreement required 3 Rivers to refund to Firelight all or part of the monies in accordance with the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">a. If the actual cost is less than the estimated cost, the excess will be refunded when construction is complete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>b. A cost per lot, housing unit or condo (units) will be determined by dividing number of units (216) into the total cost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-3\">c. The developer will receive one-fifth of the cost per unit back each year provided that the unit takes continuous service for five consecutive years. The five-year clock starts January 1, 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b64 Pursuant to the Agreement, Firelight paid 3 Rivers $42,748.94 on July 9, 2001, and an additional $37,801.54 on February 6, 2002, for a total of $80,550.48. On July 7,2004, Firelight demanded that 3 Rivers pay interest on the monies Firelight had paid to 3 Rivers in the amount of 10% per annum. When 3 Rivers rejected Firelight\u2019s demand for payment of interest, Firelight brought this action asking the District Court to declare that the Agreement constituted a loan and that 3 Rivers must pay interest on all money advanced to 3 Rivers under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b65 Firelight filed its Complaint in this matter on December 30,2004. Attached to Firelight\u2019s Complaint and referenced within the Complaint as Exhibit 1, was a copy of the May 7, 2001 Agreement between the parties. Firelight subsequently amended its complaint seeking recovery of the principal amount paid as well as interest on that amount. Firelight filed this First Amended Complaint on January 5, 2005. While this First Amended Complaint contained a reference to the Agreement as Exhibit 1, Firelight did not attach a copy of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b66 On July 15, 2005, 3 Rivers filed its Answer to First Amended Complaint arguing that it had paid Firelight \u201cmonetary amounts in full satisfaction and discharge of\u2019 Firelight\u2019s claim. In addition, 3 Rivers disputed and denied liability to Firelight with respect to the amount Firelight claimed it was due. Thereafter, 3 Rivers filed its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(c) arguing that the Agreement was not a loan because repayment of the monies advanced to 3 Rivers by Firelight was conditional, not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai-\">\u00b67 In its June 1, 2006 order granting 3 Rivers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, the District Court pointed out that there was no dispute about what the Agreement said, whether both parties willingly signed it, or any other factual issue. Thus, the court determined that the only disputed issue-whether the Agreement constituted a loan under Montana law-was a question of law. In deciding that question, the court concluded that the Agreement did not constitute a loan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>consequently Firelight was not entitled to interest on the money it paid to 3 Rivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b68 Firelight now appeals the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b69 M. R. Civ. P. 12(c) provides that \u201c[a]fter the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d In <em>Clayton by Murphy v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>221 Mont. 166, 717 P.2d 558 (1986), this Court adopted the articulation in <em>Doleman v. Meiji Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>727 F.2d 1480 (9th Cir. 1984), of the showing a movant must make under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Specifically, \u201c[t]he movant must \u2018clearly establish that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clayton, </em>221 Mont. at 169-70, 717 P.2d at 560 (quoting <em>Doleman, </em>727 F.2d at 1482, in turn quoting Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil </em>\u00a7 1368 at 690 (1st ed., West 1969)). This articulation, however, does not embrace all of the relevant considerations for evaluating a Rule 12(c) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b610 A motion for judgment on the pleadings</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">is designed to provide a means of disposing of cases when the material facts are not in dispute between the parties and a judgment on the merits can be achieved by focusing on the content of the competing pleadings, exhibits thereto, matters incorporated by reference in the pleadings, whatever is central or integral to the claim for relief or defense, and any facts of which the district court will take judicial notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil </em>vol. 5C, \u00a7 1367 at 206-07 (3d ed., Thomson-West 2004) (footnote omitted). The motion \u201conly has utility when all material allegations of fact are admitted or not controverted in the pleadings and only questions of law remain to be decided by the district court\u201d-e.g., where the sole question is the interpretation of a statutory provision. <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1367 at 207-10. If all material issues cannot be resolved on the pleadings, then a summary judgment motion or a full trial is necessary. <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1368 at 248-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">\u00b611  Therefore, when considering a Rule 12(c) motion, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>must assume that all of the well-pleaded factual allegations in the nonmovant\u2019s pleadings are true and that all contravening assertions in the movant\u2019s pleadings are false. <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1368 at 230; <em>accord Paulson v. Flathead Conservation Dist., </em>2004 MT 136, \u00b6 17, 321 Mont. 364, \u00b6 17, 91 P.3d 569, \u00b6 17 (\u201cThe pleadings are to be construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whose allegations are taken as true.\u201d (citing <em>Hedges v. Woodhouse, </em>2000 MT 220, \u00b6 8, 301 Mont. 180, \u00b6 8, 8 P.3d 109, \u00b6 8)). The motion is properly granted when, taking all of the well-pleaded factual allegations in the nonmovant\u2019s pleadings as true, the material facts are not in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Paulson, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Bosch v. Town Pump, Inc., </em>2004 MT 330, \u00b6 4, 324 Mont. 138, \u00b6 4, 102 P.3d 32, \u00b6 4; <em>Neil Consultants, Inc. v.

State, </em>2002 MT 58, \u00b6 18, 309 Mont. 106, \u00b6 18, 46 P.3d 42, \u00b6 18 <em>(citing Hedges, </em>\u00b6 8); <em>see also Sikorski v.

First, Firelight contends that the District Court erred in failing to notify Firelight that the court would consider matters outside of the pleadings and thereby convert 3 Rivers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings into a Motion for Summary Judgment. Firelight maintains that it should have been provided with notice and an opportunity to present facts outside the pleadings in response to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b615 Rule 12(c) does expressly allow the conversion of a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>judgment on the pleadings to one for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">However, contrary to Firelight\u2019s contentions, the District Court did not consider matters outside of the pleadings in this case, nor did it convert 3 Rivers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings into a Motion for Summary Judgment. All exhibits and materials referred to in a pleading are incorporated into the pleading.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Adoption by reference - exhibits. Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading or in another pleading or in any motion. <em>A copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">M. R. Civ. P. 10(c) (emphasis added). Consequently, any such exhibits may be considered by a court for purposes of deciding a Rule 12(c) motion. In this case, the Agreement appended to and referenced in Firelight\u2019s Complaint constituted part of the pleadings and the District Court did not go beyond the pleadings when granting 3 Rivers\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">\u00b616 Firelight also contends that the court should not have taken any regard of 3 Rivers\u2019 Answer when determining whether or not to grant 3 Rivers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. However, the Answer is a pleading pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 7(a), therefore, it is part of what a court may consider under a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings. Thus, in making its determination, the District Court properly reviewed the following documents on file in this matter: the Complaint; the First Amended Complaint; the Answer; and the Agreement appended to Firelight\u2019s Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b617 Next, Firelight contends that the District Court erred in disregarding the well accepted and longstanding legal principle that a court is required to accept the allegations of a complaint as true for purposes of deciding a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Here, Firelight contends that because it alleged in its Complaint that the Agreement was a loan, the District Court had to accept that allegation as true for purposes of deciding 3 Rivers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u00b618 Contrary to Firelight\u2019s contentions, the legal principle that a court is required to accept the allegations of a complaint as true for purposes of deciding a motion for judgment on the pleadings is confined to \u201cwell-pleaded <em>factual </em>allegations.\u201d <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1368 at 230 (emphasis added). In this case, Firelight attempts to convert a matter of law into one of fact. However, Firelight\u2019s contention that the Agreement is a loan is not a factual allegation; it is a question of law-a legal determination for a court to decide based upon well-established legal precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b619 Although Firelight attempts to argue to the contrary, Firelight recognizes in its brief on appeal \u201cthat in analyzing a Rule 12(c) motion, a court is not required to defer to a party\u2019s legal conclusions, including those which advocate or claim interpretations of a contract provision which the contract itself does not support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b620 Finally, Firelight contends that the District Court erred in granting 3 Rivers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings because 3 Rivers failed in its burden to establish the lack of any material facts in dispute. To that end, Firelight argues that the material facts still in dispute include the Agreement\u2019s silence as to the issue of interest on repayment. Firelight also contends that because the Agreement is silent on the issue of interest, the Agreement is ambiguous and must be construed against the drafter, 3 Rivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b621 Firelight has raised nothing in its pleadings alleging that the language of the Agreement is unclear or not explicit. Contrary to Firelight\u2019s assertions, the fact that the Agreement does not mention interest militates in favor of the Agreement not being a loan. Moreover, Firelight\u2019s simple assertion that the Agreement constitutes a loan does not establish, nor create, either the existence of a fact or a material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b622 Section 31-1-101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">Loan of money - what constitutes. A loan of money is a contract by which one delivers a Siam of money to another and the latter agrees to return at a future time <em>a sum equivalent to </em>that which he borrowed. A loan for mere use is governed by the law on loan for use. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In construing this statute, this Court has held that \u201c[i]f the obligation to return is based on a contingency or on a certain condition which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>may or may not happen or occur, the transaction is not a loan.\u201d <em>Rae v. Cameron, </em>112 Mont. 159, 167, 114 P.2d 1060, 1064 (1941). In <em>Rae, </em>a party to a contract sought repayment of an alleged \u201cloan\u201d from the other contracting party. We held in <em>Rae </em>that for an agreement to be a loan, there must be a temporary letting of money for temporary use. <em>Rae, </em>112 Mont. at 166, 114 P.2d at 1063. Furthermore, the \u201cessential and characteristic feature\u201d of a loan is that the money must be absolutely returnable. <em>Rae, </em>112 Mont. at 166, 114 P.2d at 1063. We revisited our decision in <em>Rae in Nyquist v. Nyquist, </em>255 Mont. 149, 153, 841 P.2d 515, 518 (1992), where we affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the parties\u2019 agreement in <em>Nyquist </em>\u201cwas not a loan agreement because it did not contain an unconditional obligation to repay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b623 Pursuant to the Agreement in this case, if a unit does not take continuous service for five consecutive years, Firelight is not entitled to be paid the cost for that unit. Thus, there is a condition precedent to 3 Rivers\u2019 obligation to refund any portion of the per unit cost to Firelight. The words of the Agreement clearly indicate that any refunding obligation is purely conditional and not absolute, i.e., a conditional refund and not an absolute repayment of principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b624 Moreover, the Agreement refers to Firelight\u2019s obligation to \u201cpay\u201d a sum of money to 3 Rivers as an aid to construction, not \u2018lend\u201d a sum of money. Under the plain words of the Agreement, there is no loan, only potential \u201crefunds,\u201d but only upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The only unconditional payment obligation in the Agreement is in paragraph II. 1. referring to Firelight\u2019s obligation to pay 3 Rivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">II. The Developer [Firelight] agrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">1. To <em>pay </em>the Cooperative [3 Rivers] the sum of $85,497.88, as ATP TO CONSTRUCTION for construction of above mentioned lines and facilities. <em>Payment </em>shall be made by company check. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b625  The hallmark of a \u201cloan\u201d is an \u201cabsolute\u201d right to repayment of funds advanced. <em>In re Bellanca Aircraft Corp., </em>850 F.2d 1275, 1277 (8th Cir. 1988). \u201cThe word \u2018loan\u2019 implies an advance of money with an absolute promise to repay.\u201d <em>Bankers Mortgage Co. v. Commissioner of Int. Rev., </em>142 F.2d 130, 131 (5th Cir. 1944). Consequently, while the Agreement at issue here may be an investment, a purchase of services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>by Firelight, or a joint venture, it is by no means a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b626 Based on the foregoing, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting 3 Rivers\u2019 Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"AxM\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-4\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
