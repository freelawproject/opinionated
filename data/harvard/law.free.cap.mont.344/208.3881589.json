Harris (Harris) appeals from the order of the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, affirming Harris\u2019s conviction in Missoula Municipal Court of minor in possession of an intoxicating substance (MIP). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b63 Did the Municipal Court err when it allowed Officer Shermer to testify as an expert on the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\u00b64 On October 14, 2006, at approximately 1:20 a.m., a Missoula police officer pulled over a vehicle for a traffic violation. Officer Manraksa soon arrived to assist. Officer Manraksa spoke with Harris, one of the vehicle\u2019s passengers, and determined that she was less than twenty-one years of age. Officer Manraksa smelled a heavy odor of alcohol on Harris\u2019s breath, and he asked her to perform a breath test. Unable to obtain a proper breath sample, Officer Manraksa began to administer the HGN test. Officer Manraksa observed four of the six HGN indicators of possible alcohol impairment, though he was unable to complete the HGN test. Based on his observations, Officer Manraksa issued Harris a citation for MIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\u00b65  At trial, Officer Shermer testified as an expert witness regarding the HGN test. Officer Shermer testified that a relationship exists between alcohol consumption and observable presence of nystagmus, an involuntary jerking of the eyes. Harris objected to Officer Shermer\u2019s testimony and argued that Officer Shermer failed to meet the expert-witness qualifications to testify about HGN as set forth in <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2003 MT 118, 315 Mont. 480, 68 P.3d 848. The court initially sustained Harris\u2019s objection, but allowed his testimony after the prosecutor recalled Officer Shermer and elicited further information regarding his training and experience. Officer Manraksa then testified regarding his administration of the HGN test at the scene and the results of the HGN test. The Missoula Municipal Court convicted Harris of MIP, and Harris appealed to the District Court, which affirmed her conviction. Harris appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">\u00b66 We review for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s determination regarding the qualification and competency of an expert witness. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 8. A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>without employing conscientious judgment, or \u201cexceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Matz, </em>2006 MT 348, \u00b6 34, 335 Mont. 201, \u00b6 34, 150 P.3d 367, \u00b6 34 (citations omitted). Trial courts possess considerable latitude when ruling on the admissibility of expert witness testimony. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b67 Did the Municipal Court err when it allowed Officer Shermer to testify as an expert on the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b68 The rules of evidence allow \u201ca witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d to offer an opinion at trial if the witness\u2019s \u201cspecialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue ....\u201d M. R. Evid. 702. Thus, to admit expert testimony, a court must determine (1) that the subject matter requires expert testimony, and (2) that the witness qualifies as an expert in the particular area on which the witness intends to testify. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 24. We require expert testimony to explain the relationship between alcohol consumption and the presence of nystagmus. <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 69, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 69, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b69 Harris argues that the Municipal Court erred when it allowed Officer Shermer to testify that a correlation exists between alcohol in the human body and nystagmus in the eye. Harris asserts that Officer Shermer did not possess the requisite scientific and medical training to testify as an HGN expert because Officer Shermer\u2019s qualifications fell short of the baseline established in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b610 In <em>Crawford, </em>we rejected the premise that only medical professionals could provide expert testimony regarding the HGN test\u2019s reliability, and we concluded that the district court did not err in allowing a police officer to testify as an HGN expert. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 30. We determined that the officer\u2019s \u201clitany of credentials\u201d demonstrated his qualifications to testify as an expert on HGN, and we specifically listed seven that we considered significant. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 28. We did not, however, set forth seven essential requirements that a witness must possess to testify as an expert on HGN. On the contrary, we stated that trial courts are \u201cvested with <em>great </em>latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony,\u201d and we concluded that, in light of the officer\u2019s training, the court acted within its discretion in allowing the officer\u2019s expert witness testimony. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 30 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u00b611 Here, Officer Shermer presented credentials similar to those accepted in <em>Crawford </em>and demonstrated that he qualified as an expert to testify regarding the HGN test. Officer Shermer testified that he holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology and criminology and has been a Missoula police detective for seven years. Officer Shermer testified that he completed an eight-hour course in field sobriety tests, including HGN, at the Montana Law Enforcement Academy and that he later became an instructor in standard field sobriety tests. Officer Shermer also testified that he had completed an eight-hour course on the anatomy of the eye, which focused specifically on HGN.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b612 Additionally, Officer Shermer testified that he completed a three-week Drug Recognition and Evaluation (DRE) program and was a certified DRE officer. Officer Shermer testified that the DRE program trains officers in the physiological effects that occur when a person ingests certain drugs, including alcohol. Officer Shermer testified that he received training to detect drugs through divided attention tests; physiological tests, including blood pressure and vital signs; and through observing the human eye. Finally, Officer Shermer testified that he previously had testified as an expert witness before the Missoula Municipal Court and as a DRE expert in Missoula district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b613 At trial, Officer Shermer explained the concept of nystagmus and discussed the correlation between a person\u2019s consumption of alcohol and observable presence of nystagmus. Officer Shermer distinguished between HGN and vertical gaze nystagmus and explained the causes for each. According to Officer Shermer, when coupled with other tests and observations, HGN can help an officer determine if a person is under the influence or if the person has a medical problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b614  The Municipal Court allowed Officer Shermer to testify as an expert witness on HGN after hearing testimony of his extensive training and education. Based on our review of Officer Shermer\u2019s training and education, we cannot say that the Municipal Court acted arbitrarily, without employing conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Matz, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
