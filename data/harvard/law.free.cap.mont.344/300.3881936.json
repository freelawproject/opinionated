Davis (Davis) appeals from the order of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, denying his motion to toll on equitable grounds the one-year time bar on post-conviction relief. We reverse and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court correctly deny Davis\u2019s motion to toll on equitable grounds the one-year time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, so that Davis could file a petition for post-conviction relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\u00b64 Davis fled Ennis in a 1991 Ford Taurus after shooting seven people in the early morning hours of June 14, 2003. Madison County authorities immediately broadcast an \u201cattempt to locate\u201d Davis to all State and regional law enforcement. Ravalli County Sheriffs Deputy Bernie Allestad (Deputy Allestad) clocked Davis\u2019s car traveling at a high rate of speed, six hours after the shooting, just south of Florence. Deputy Allestad did not recognize Davis\u2019s car as the Taurus described in the \u201cattempt to locate\u201d bulletin, however, until he had pulled the car over and was reading the license plate to his dispatcher. Deputy Allestad looked up from the license plate to discover that Davis had gotten out of his car, and was rapidly approaching Deputy Allestad\u2019s patrol car with a pistol in his hand. Davis opened fire on Deputy Allestad, wounding him in the shoulder, and initiating a prolonged gun battle that ended with Davis again fleeing the scene with police in close pursuit. Idaho and Montana authorities later nabbed Davis at the Montana-Idaho border after a violent, high-speed car chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u00b65 The State filed an information in Ravalli County on April 1,2004, charging Davis with various offenses committed during his gunfight with Deputy Allestad, including (1) attempted deliberate homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-103,45-5-102, MCA (Count I); (2) assault on a peace or judicial officer, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-210, MCA (Count II); and (3) criminal endangerment, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, (Count III). Davis appeared with his trial counsel, Mark McLaverty (McLaverty), at his April 22,2004, arraignment and entered a plea of not guilty to these charges. Davis subsequently entered into a plea agreement with the State on September 30, 2004. The plea agreement stated that Davis would plead guilty to all charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>in the information and waive his right to withdraw the guilty plea, or to challenge his sentence via direct appeal, habeas corpus, or post-conviction relief. The plea agreement also stated that Davis agreed that by pleading guilty to Count I he could be punished by life imprisonment without parole, or by imprisonment in the Montana State Prison for a term of not fewer than 10 years or more than 100 years. The plea agreement stated that Davis acknowledged that the State was free to argue, and the court was free to impose, the maximum judgment allowed by the law. The State agreed that any judgment imposed by the court on Counts II and III would run concurrently with the judgment imposed on Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b66 Davis entered his plea of guilty to all charges on September 30, 2004. The court immediately proceeded to sentencing. The court sentenced Davis on Count I to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, to run consecutively with any other sentence. The court sentenced Davis to 10 years in Montana State Prison on Count II, and 10 years in Montana State Prison for Count III, both to run concurrently with the sentence for Count I. Davis did not appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b67 Davis filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for appointment of counsel for post-conviction proceedings on September 28, 2005. The court issued a minute entry on October 3, 2005, stating that the court had received Davis\u2019s motion and that McLaverty remained as Davis\u2019s appointed counsel. Neither Davis nor McLaverty received notice, however, that McLaverty had been reassigned as Davis\u2019s counsel for the post-conviction proceedings. Davis later was appointed counsel, William Boggs (Boggs), through a related proceeding in Missoula County. Boggs discovered during his inquiry into Davis\u2019s case that neither Davis nor McLaverty had received notice of McLaverty\u2019s appointment, and that, in the meantime, the one-year time bar on post-conviction relief contained in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b68 Davis filed a separate motion on March 23, 2006, through Boggs, asking the District Court to toll the one-year time bar as of the court\u2019s October 3, 2005, minute entry in light of the fact that McLaverty had never received notice that the court had reappointed him as Davis\u2019s counsel for the post-conviction proceedings. The District Court entered an order on April 11, 2006. The court noted in its order that the State had failed to file a response brief to Davis\u2019s motion. The court recognized that it usually would deem the State\u2019s failure to respond as an admission that Davis\u2019s motion should be granted. The court stated, however, that it felt compelled to raise <em>sua sponte </em>the issue of its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction over Davis\u2019s untimely petition in light of this Court\u2019s precedent that the one-year time bar on post-conviction relief represents a \u201cjurisdictional limit on litigation.\u201d The Court concluded that a hearing should be held on Davis\u2019s motion for equitable relief. The State filed a response to Davis\u2019s motion agreeing with the court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Davis\u2019s petition and pointing out, among other things, that Davis had waived his right to post-conviction relief when he signed the September 30, 2004, plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b69 The court held a hearing on May 9, 2006, regarding Davis\u2019s motion. McLaverty informed the court that he had received a copy of Davis\u2019s request for counsel, and that he had sent an inquiry to Davis regarding possible grounds for post-conviction relief. McLaverty stated, however, that he had not received notice of the court\u2019s October 3,2005, minute entry reappointing McLaverty as counsel of record for the post-conviction proceedings. McLaverty conceded that the one-year time bar for post-conviction relief had expired in the interim. The court denied Davis\u2019s motion on the grounds that the one-year time bar was jurisdictional and could not be tolled absent some new evidence of a \u201cconstitutional violation [that] has probably resulted in the conviction of one who was actually innocent.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b610 We review <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for equitable tolling where the underlying facts are undisputed. <em>Brambles v. Duncan, </em>412 F.3d 1066, 1069 (9th Cir. 2005); <em>Spitsyn v. Moore, </em>345 F.3d 796, 799 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>see also Chance v. Harrison, </em>272 Mont. 52, 899 P.2d 537 (1995) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on the sole issue of equitable tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court correctly deny Davis\u2019s motion to toll on equitable grounds the one-year time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, so that Davis could file a petition for post-conviction relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\u00b612 The State argues that the District Court has no authority to toll the one-year time bar on post-conviction relief because the time bar is a \u201cjurisdictional limit on litigation.\u201d The State relies on <em>State v. Wells, </em>2001 MT 55, 304 Mont. 329, 21 P.3d 610, and Pe\u00f1a <em>v. State, </em>2004 MT 293, 323 Mont. 347, 100 P.3d 154, for the proposition that \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, deprives district courts of subject matter jurisdiction over petitions for post-conviction relief that are filed more than one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>after the date that the conviction became final. This Court stated in <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>that \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, \u201cis jurisdictional because it constitutes the time frame during which a district court has the \u2018power\u2019 or \u2018capacity\u2019 to \u2018entertain, hear[,] and determine\u2019 \u201d a petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b613 Davis argues that our holding in <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>contradicts analogous federal law. The Supreme Court in <em>Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 126 S. Ct. 403 (2005), for example, determined that Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Rule 33) did not represent a limit on the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal district courts. <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 13, 126 S. Ct. at 403. Rule 33 requires that \u2018\u201c[a]ny motion for a new trial grounded on any reason other than newly discovered evidence must be filed within 7 days after the verdict or finding of guilty, or within such further time as the court sets during the 7-day period.\u2019\u201d <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 13, 126 S. Ct. at 403. The Supreme Court determined that Rule 33\u2019s seven-day limit on post-trial motions represented an \u201cinflexible claim-processing rule,\u201d rather than a rule that excludes a class of cases from a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority, or subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 13, 126 S. Ct. at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b614 The seven-day limit that the Supreme Court deemed non-jurisdictional in <em>Eberhart </em>is indistinguishable from the one-year limit this Court deemed jurisdictional in <em>Pe\u00f1a. </em>Both rules prevent a party from asserting a claim that the party fails to raise within a certain amount of time. Davis also points out that the Ninth Circuit in <em>Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Cent. Dist. of Cal., </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir. 1997), also has recognized that the analagous one-year time bar on federal habeas petitions is not a limit on the federal courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction. Our holdings in <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>and <em>Wells, </em>thus, appear to contradict the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of analogous federal law. <em>See also Amalgamated Trans. Loc. 1309 v. Laidlaw Tran. Serv., </em>435 F.3d 1140, 1147 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that the time to petition for permission to appeal under Fed. R. App. P. 5(a) is a claim-processing rule and not jurisdictional); <em>In re Onecast Media, Inc., </em>439 F.3d 558, 562 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that the ten-day rule for filing a motion for a new trial under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 \u201cis as much a claim-processing rule as the rule at issue in <em>[Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 124 S. Ct. 906 (2004)].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b615 Minnesota appellate courts similarly have observed that the use of the word \u201cjurisdictional\u201d to refer to a statute of limitations does not carry the same meaning as it does when used to refer to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>constitutional grant of judicial power or a legislative classification of a court\u2019s power to adjudicate a class of cases. <em>Bode v. Minn. Dept. of Nat. Resources, </em>594 N.W.2d 257, 259-60 (Minn. App. 1999) (cautioning against misuse of the term subject-matter jurisdiction), <em>aff'd, </em>612 N.W.2d 862 (Minn. 2000). The court in <em>In re Civil Commitment of Giem, </em>727 N.W.2d 198, 203 (Minn. App. 2007), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>742 N.W.2d 422 (Minn. 2007), concluded that the statutorily prescribed time periods for conducting a hearing in a mental commitment proceeding \u201care rigid time prescriptions for constitutionally significant purposes, but these restrictions do not define or limit subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d As a result, the court determined that a party could waive the time prescriptions by failing to raise the issue. <em>Giem, </em>727 N.W.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b616 We recognize that the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of federal law does not bind our interpretation of Montana Law. We likewise recognize that another state court\u2019s interpretation of its law has no binding authority over our interpretation of Montana law. Federal courts and other state courts present binding authority for this Court only \u201cto the degree that the reasoning of the decision appears compelling.\u201d <em>Matter of Sinclair, </em>197 Mont. 29, 32, 640 P.2d 918, 920 (1982); <em>see also State v. Osborne, </em>2005 MT 264, 329 Mont. 95, 124 P.3d 1085 (Leaphart, J., dissenting from this Court\u2019s denial of a petition for rehearing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Eberhart). </em>This Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>and the related cases, in contrast to the federal and other state authority cited above, lack compelling reasoning or support for the proposition that \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, limits a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b617 The Court inPe\u00f1a, for example, noted that \u201cpost[-]conviction relief is not a constitutional right under Montana law, but rather a statutory right.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 35. The Court reasoned that \u201c[b]ecause a post[jconviction petitioner cannot claim more rights, and, likewise, the courts cannot provide more rights, than granted by statute, the statutory rules which circumscribe the post[-]conviction process are jurisdictional in nature.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 35. The <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>Court provides little analysis of the jurisdictional provisions in the Constitution or the Montana Code to support its assertion that the one-year time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, pertains to district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction. The Court instead relies on a line of cases beginning with <em>Petition of Gray, </em>274 Mont. 1, 908 P.2d 1352 (1995), for the proposition that this Court \u201crepeatedly\u201d has held that the time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, represents a \u201cjurisdictional limit on litigation.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u00b618 The Court in <em>Gray </em>in turn held that \u201c[t]he post-conviction statute of limitation is a jurisdictional limit on litigation and its waiver may only be justified by a clear miscarriage of justice, one so obvious that the judgment is rendered a complete nullity.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>274 Mont. at 2, 908 P.2d at 1352. <em>Gray </em>also fails to point to any jurisdictional provision in the Montana Constitution or the Montana Code to support its conclusion that \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, limits the subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts. Moreover, the only controlling case cited by the <em>Gray court-State v. Perry, </em>232 Mont. 455, 758 P.2d 268 (1988)-contains no discussion of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b619 The Court\u2019s characterization in <em>Gray </em>of the post-conviction statute of limitation as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d contrasts with our recent decision in <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46, 337 Mont. 488, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46, 162 P.3d 121, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. We concluded in <em>Miller </em>that a provision requiring the State to notify the defendant of its intent to seek the death penalty within 60 days of the filing of the information \u201cis, necessarily, a categorical time prescription and not a jurisdictional provision.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 46. We determined that a prosecutor\u2019s failure to comply with the 60-day time prescription does not create \u201ca jurisdictional defect\u201d that precludes the State from seeking the death penalty and precludes the district court from imposing the death penalty as a sentence. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 46. Like other time prescriptions, the rule simply \u201cassurefs] relief\u2019 to a defendant who properly raises it, but it does not compel the same result if the defendant forfeits it. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b620 The Court in <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>and the related cases interpreted the effect of the post-conviction statutory time bar in terms of the district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>Osborne, </em>\u00b6 12. We held in <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>that a party never waives the post-conviction statutory time bars because they \u201cconstitute!] the time frame during which a district court has the power or capacity to entertain, hear and determine petitions for post[-]conviction relief.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 35 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Osborne, </em>\u00b6 17. We repeatedly have held that a party never waives subject matter jurisdiction and that a party or the court may raise subject matter jurisdiction at any time during the course of a proceeding. <em>E.g. State v. Walker, </em>2007 MT 205, \u00b6 35, 338 Mont. 529, \u00b6 35, 167 P.3d 879, \u00b6 35; <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32; <em>In re Marriage of Miller, </em>259 Mont. 424, 426-27, 856 P.2d 1378, 1380 (1993). Indeed, we have stated that subject matter jurisdiction \u201ccan never be forfeited or waived, nor can it be conferred by the consent of a party.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u00b621 The State, by urging this Court to construe the time prescription set forth in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, as a limit on district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction, asserts that a petitioner may dictate a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction on the timeliness of his petition. The Supreme Court has described subject matter jurisdiction, however, as authority that \u201ccannot be expanded to account for the parties\u2019 litigation <em>conduct...\u201d Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 456, 124 S. Ct. at 916. The State fails to identify a provision in either the Montana Constitution or the Montana Code that allows this Court to hinge a district court\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d to entertain a post-conviction petition on the timeliness of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AdO\">\u00b622 Davis argues that the holding in <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>arose \u201csimply out of linguistic inadvertence.\u201d He contends that the Court mistakenly has inferred limits on the subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts from the casual use of the word \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in our precedent. Recent decisions in the United States Supreme Court echo Davis\u2019s concern. The Supreme Court recently noted in <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 511, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 1242 (2006), for example, that the Supreme Court and other courts have been less than meticulous with the use of the term \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d Similarly, in reversing the Seventh Circuit\u2019s lower decision, the Supreme Court in <em>Eberhart </em>admitted that imprecise use of the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in Supreme Court precedent in large part had caused the Seventh Circuit\u2019s confusion. <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 19, 126 S. Ct. at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b623  We agree with Davis that <em>Gray, Pe\u00f1a, </em>and <em>Wells </em>represent cases where this Court also has been less than meticulous in its use of the term \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S. at 511, 126 S. Ct. at 1242. We conclude that the statutory time-bar set forth in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, does not circumscribe a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. Section 46-21-102, MCA, constitutes a rigid, categorical time prescription that governs post-conviction petitions. <em>See Miller, </em>\u00b6 48. We must reverse <em>Gray, Pe\u00f1a, Wells, </em>and other cases to the extent they have held that the Legislature limited district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction by codifying a one-year time bar on post-conviction relief at \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. We also must reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that the one-year time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, limits its subject matter jurisdiction over Davis\u2019s motion to toll the one-year time bar on equitable grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b624 We hasten to add, however, that nothing in our ruling precludes a court from raising, <em>sua sponte, </em>the timeliness of the petition. For example, the Court in <em>Day v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 209, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 1684 (2006), concluded that district courts \u201care permitted, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>not obliged, to consider, <em>sua sponte, </em>the timeliness of a state prisoner\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d The Court stressed that nothing compels a trial court \u201cto double-check the State\u2019s math.\u201d <em>Day, </em>547 U.S. at 209-10, 126 S. Ct. at 1684. Like Day, we also stress that a district court\u2019s decision to raise the timeliness of a petition on its own initiative invokes due process considerations. The court must afford the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions before acting on its own initiative to dismiss a petition as untimely. <em>Day, </em>547 U.S. at 210, 126 S. Ct. at 1684. The court also must determine whether \u2018\u201cthe interests of justice would be better served\u2019 by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred.\u201d <em>Day, </em>547 U.S. at 210, 126 S. Ct. at 1684.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b625  Although the District Court provided alternative rationales for its ruling, it ultimately decided Davis\u2019s motion solely on the basis that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In light of our decision and its changes to the law regarding the one-year time bar contained in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, we deem it appropriate to remand this matter to allow the District Court to consider in the first instance Davis\u2019s motion to toll on equitable grounds the one-year time bar contained in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. The District Court must determine whether the failure to toll on equitable grounds would work \u201c\u2018a clear miscarriage of justice, one so obvious\u2019\u201d that the imposition of the time bar would compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v.

However, I believe this is a misunderstanding of our precedent. The term \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d was not mentioned nor addressed in those cases. The word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was used therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>to convey the nature and effect of the contours upon post-conviction relief enacted by the Legislature, with the conclusion being that the district court lacked the authority to grant relief outside those statutory boundaries. As we stated, \u201cthe statutory rules which circumscribe the postconviction process are <em>jurisdictional in </em>nature.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 35 (emphasis added). Further, we have recently explained that \u201cjurisdictional in nature\u201d does not necessarily equate to \u201csubject matter jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b629 In <em>Molnar v. Public Service Commission, </em>2008 MT 49, 341 Mont. 420, 177 P.3d 1048, we reviewed an appeal to the district court from an agency decision which had been filed beyond the 30-day statutory appeal period. We affirmed the dismissal of the appeal, reasoning that \u201cthe District Court was without jurisdiction... to entertain the request for judicial review,\u201d <em>Molnar, </em>\u00b6 9, but further elaborated on the principle at issue here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">Of course, the District Court possessed general subject matter jurisdiction to review the agency decision, but did not have authority \u201cjurisdictional in nature,\u201d [citing <em>In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 357, \u00b6 12, 983 P.2d 968, \u00b6 12] from the Legislature to entertain a petition for review filed beyond the time limit provided in the governing statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-6\"><em>Molnar, </em>\u00b6 9. This distinction is commonly recognized. <em>See State v. Moore, 225 </em>S.W.3d 556, 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (\u201cunder some circumstances the lack of \u2018authority in a trial court, as distinguished from its \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 can render its purported actions \u2018void.\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b630 While we may well have been \u201cless than meticulous,\u201d as the Court notes, in our use of the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in these cases, that does not abrogate the jurisdiction-like principles at work which required the outcome therein. Whether we label it \u201cjurisdiction\u201d or some other term, a court must have authority to act upon the particular matter before it. We have so held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201cJurisdiction is the power to hear and determine the particular action or proceeding <em>as well as to make such orders and render such judgment therein as the law authorizes </em>in the class of actions or proceedings to which it belongs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\"><em>State ex rel. Johnson v. District Court, </em>147 Mont. 263, 267, 410 P.2d 933, 935 (1966) (quoting <em>State ex rel. Lay v. District Court, </em>122 Mont. 61, 70, 198 P.2d 761, 766 (1948)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\u00b631 Montana districts courts do indeed have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain post-conviction petitions-they have \u201cthe power to hear and determine\u201d post-conviction matters. <em>Johnson, </em>147 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>at 267, 410 P.2d 935. However, courts must also have the power or authority to \u201cmake such orders and render such judgments therein as the law authorizes.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>147 Mont. at 267, 410 P.2d 935. Although the Court wants to avoid over-use of the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d and rightfully so, principles of authority nonetheless exist and must be recognized, whatever we choose to call them. Here, I do not believe the District Court had authority to act on Davis\u2019 petition, because it was filed beyond the one year time-bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b632 That leads to my second disagreement, that the one-year time-bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, is merely a \u201cclaim processing rule,\u201d as intimated by the Court by its discussion and reliance on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Eberhart. See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 22. \u201cClaim processing rules\u201d are a creation of the federal courts and arise from unique federal experience: the jurisdiction of Article III courts is determined by Congress. To distinguish judicially promulgated process rules from congressional jurisdictional mandates, the federal courts have designated the former as \u201cclaim processing rules\u201d which are not jurisdictional. As appropriate as this notion may be for the federal courts, to import it wholesale into our law overlooks the peculiar basis for such rules, which does not exist in Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b633 Further, the post-conviction time-bar is clearly distinguishable from the rules at issue in the federal cases relied upon by the Court. The <em>Eberhart </em>decision addressed Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which required a motion for new trial to be filed within seven days after a verdict. Interestingly, the Supreme Court in <em>Eberhart </em>did not explain why it thought Rule 33 was a claim processing rule. It simply stated that the Rule was similar to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4004(a), which it had determined to be a claim processing rule in <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 124 S. Ct. 906 (2004) (\u201cAfter <em>Kontrick, </em>it is difficult to escape the conclusion that Rule 33 motions are similarly nonjurisdictional.\u201d <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 19, 126 S. Ct. at 407). Thus, to understand the reasoning of the federal authority which determined that these rules were \u201cclaim-processing rules,\u201d one must turn to <em>Kontrick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b634 <em>Kontrick </em>addressed a bankruptcy rule which provided a time period in which a debtor could object to a creditor\u2019s complaint contesting the debtor\u2019s discharge. <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 446, 124 S. Ct. at 910. The <em>Kontrick </em>Court first explained the source of the rule in question: \u201cThe time constraints ... are contained in bankruptcy rules prescribed by the United States Supreme Court for \u2018the practice and procedure in cases under Title 11.\u2019\u201d It then noted, as a general legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>principle, that \u201c \u2018[i]t is axiomatic\u2019 that such rules \u2018do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d but, more specifically, that the Bankruptcy Rules themselves clearly stated that the Rules \u201c \u2018shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 453, 124 S. Ct. at 914. It noted that the Court had previously held in <em>Schacht v. United States, </em>398 U.S. 58, 90 S. Ct. 1555 (1970), that the Rules \u201cadopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business are not jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 454, 124 S. Ct. at 914. Critically, the Court emphasized that \u201c[n]o statute, however, specifies a time limit for filing a complaint objecting to the debtor\u2019s discharge.\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 448, 124 S. Ct. at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"AJP\">\u00b635 The distinctions between the statutory time-bar and the procedural rules at issue under the cited federal authority are significant. We are not dealing here with a \u201crule\u201d adopted by the court for the \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d in cases before the district court. We have here no companion \u201crule\u201d explaining that these \u201crules\u201d as a whole \u201cdo not create or withdraw\u201d jurisdiction. Nor do we have a long line of cases declaring that the time-bar at issue is nonjurisdictional-indeed, we have a long line of cases declaring just the opposite. And, most critically, in contrast to the federal cases, we do have a statute which \u201cspecifies a time limit for filing\u201d a petition. Because the time-bar is a statutory restriction upon post-conviction relief, it is fundamentally different from the rules at issue in the cases relied upon by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">\u00b636 Further, as the Court notes, the <em>Kontrick </em>Court explained that a jurisdictional rule \u201ccannot be expanded to account for the parties\u2019 litigation conduct,\u201d while a claim processing rule \u201ccan... be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the <em>point.\u201dKontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 456, 124 S. Ct. at 916. My reading of \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, provides no indication that the Legislature intended the time-bar to be \u201cexpanded to account for the parties\u2019 litigation conduct\u201d or that it can be forfeited if ignored. The time-bar, reduced several years ago by the Legislature from five years to one year, reflects the desire for a certain, mandatory time limit for the original filing of petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b637 I fear the Court\u2019s decision may be ill-conceived on other grounds as well. This holding could engender various claims seeking equitable release from the time-bar. Discarding a clear legislative contour of the post-conviction process may well convince the federal courts that the time-bar is no longer a firmly established and regularly followed state practice necessary to prevent subsequent federal court review of federal constitutional claims. <em>See Barr v. Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 146, 149, 84 S. Ct. 1734, 1736 (1964) (\u201c[sjtate procedural requirements which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>not strictly or regularly followed\u201d will not be honored in later federal review).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b638 As we have held in our previous post-conviction cases, and in similar contexts in other cases, I would likewise conclude here that, while not a limitation on subject matter jurisdiction, the one-year time-bar in the post-conviction statute is \u201cjurisdictional in nature,\u201d requiring dismissal of the petition. <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 35; <em>Molnar, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 12.1 would therefore affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the dissenting opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
