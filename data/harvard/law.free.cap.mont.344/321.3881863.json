Olson (Olson) appeals from the judgment entered by the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, on a jury verdict in favor of Crail Creek Associates, LLC (Crail Creek), and from a later order denying Olson\u2019s motion to quash a writ of execution. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">\u00b62 The restated issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Olson\u2019s challenges for cause against two prospective jurors?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by submitting a second supplemental verdict form to the jury, after the jury returned its special verdict form and first supplemental verdict form and was polled?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\"><em>\u00b65 </em>3. Did the District Court err by denying Olson\u2019s, and granting Crail Creek\u2019s, motion for judgment as a matter of law on Crail Creek\u2019s construction lien claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err by determining Crail Creek was entitled to attorney fees, costs, and prejudgment interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b67 5. May Crail Creek retain in a lawyer trust account the funds it obtained from the title company via a writ of execution on the judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b68 In 1997 and 1998, Crail Creek contracted with Westfork Development Company, Inc. (Westfork) to construct condominiums on Crail Creek\u2019s property near Big Sky, Montana. In 1998, Crail Creek entered into a buy-sell agreement with Olson for a condominium unit. Closing occurred in March of 1999, before construction of the unit was complete, and the parties signed documents providing that the title company would hold back $69,000 of the purchase price in an account. A dispute arose, and Crail Creek ultimately sued Olson, asserting claims for breach of contract and foreclosure of a construction lien, among other things. Olson counterclaimed, asserting several different causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b69 The case proceeded to trial in 2004. Shortly before jury voir dire, the District Court orally denied the parties\u2019 cross-motions for partial summary judgment. During voir dire, the District Court denied Olson\u2019s challenges for cause of two prospective jurors. Before submission of the case to the jury, the court orally granted Crail Creek\u2019s, and denied Olson\u2019s, motion for judgment as a matter of law on Crail Creek\u2019s construction lien claim. Notwithstanding that ruling, the special verdict form included a question regarding Crail Creek\u2019s entitlement to the construction lien. During deliberations, the jury submitted a question regarding the holdback funds, and the District Court sent a supplemental verdict form to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b610 The jury returned the special verdict form and first supplemental verdict form (together, the \u201cinitial verdict\u201d) and was polled. After hearing arguments outside the presence of the jury regarding the total amount the jury intended to award, the District Court submitted a second supplemental verdict form to the jury. The jury completed the second supplemental verdict form, indicating its intent to award a total of $77,409.99 to Crail Creek. The District Court subsequently entered judgment on the verdict, awarding $77,409.99, together with costs totaling $2,870.40, prejudgment interest in the amount of $24,768.32, and attorney fees totaling $94,072.17. The judgment also specified that the $69,000 of held back funds in the title company account be disbursed to Crail Creek and applied to the judgment and, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to the parties\u2019 stipulation, any interest \u201caccruing\u201d on those funds be disbursed to Crail Creek for application to the prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"AnN\">\u00b6 11 Crail Creek obtained a writ of execution, a levying officer collected from the title company account the funds and interest accrued up to that time, and Crail Creek placed the funds and accrued interest in a lawyer trust account. Olson disputed the legality of these actions and, after filing his notice of appeal, moved to quash the writ of execution. The District Court determined it lacked jurisdiction to rule on Olson\u2019s motion due to the pending appeal. We set forth additional facts as necessary below.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b612 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Olson\u2019s challenges for cause of two prospective jurors?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b613 Section 25-7-223, MCA, sets forth the bases for a challenge for cause in a civil case. We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause for abuse of discretion. <em>Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 87, 319 Mont. 307, \u00b6 87, 84 P.3d 38, \u00b6 87 (citing <em>Reff-Conlin\u2019s, Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>2002 MT 60, \u00b6 16, 309 Mont. 142, \u00b6 16, 45 P.3d 863, \u00b6 16). Olson contends that the District Court abused its discretion by denying his challenges for cause of prospective jurors Rita Foster and Paige Weirich.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b614 Regarding Foster, Olson asserts her voir dire responses showed she \u201cha[d] an unqualified opinion or belief as to the merits of the action\u201d and a \u201cstate of mind... evincing enmity against or bias in favor of either party,\u201d which are bases for removing a prospective juror for cause under \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-223(6) and (7), MCA. The following exchange occurred during voir dire between one of Crail Creek\u2019s attorneys and Foster:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">MR. ANDRIOLO: Mrs. Foster, is there anything here that would create any problems for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">MS. FOSTER: A couple things. I\u2019m an office manager for a plumbing company and I\u2019m the only person who does that job. You know, eight days is a lot to be away from the company. On top of that, I work in construction and always have, and I\u2019m not really fond of contractors and owners doing the whole court thing. Also, Ms. Refling [co-counsel for Crail Creek] represented me with a matter when my mother was in the county rest home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">MR. ANDRIOLO: Is she representing you at the present time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">MS. FOSTER: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>MR. ANDRIOLO: And is there anything in that that would cause you to be more favorable or more inclined to her than the rest of the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">MS. FOSTER: Probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">MR. ANDRIOLO: Probably? And do you feel you could be fair and impartial in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">MS. FOSTER: Probably not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">MR. ANDRIOLO: And I think I ask this question sometimes because you get more of an answer than-but why don\u2019t you feel you could be fair and impartial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">MS. FOSTER: I kind of feel like I already made up my mind about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">MR. ANDRIOLO: Well, what are the facts of this case do you know [sic]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">MS. FOSTER: Just I\u2019m more prone to contractors than owner, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">MR. ANDRIOLO: So, it\u2019s just a general bias you have as a whole. And you think that would take evidence to remove that particular bias from your-you couldn\u2019t just listen to the evidence here and based on that evidence, make a fair assessment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">MS. FOSTER: I really don\u2019t know if I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">MR. ANDRIOLO: Would you be willing to try to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">MS. FOSTER: I could try but I\u2019m also, like I say, thinking about my job, but I don\u2019t know if I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">MR. ANDRIOLO: I take it from-you\u2019re not sure you could but you\u2019re not sure you can\u2019t. Would that be a correct way to say it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">MS. FOSTER: Right. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-17\">MR. ANDRIOLO: Well, you know, I think that when we get a jury, we\u2019re not looking for people that haven\u2019t got some experience in the world. I mean, you\u2019ve come here with your worldly experiences and your good common sense and that\u2019s what makes you a good jury, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re not looking for people that have lived in a-just in an environment that they haven\u2019t experienced life and-because we need that input into the process. You all come from different walks and you all have different things to offer. So, I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re going.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">Crail Creek\u2019s counsel then proceeded to question other prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-19\">\u00b615 Olson\u2019s attorney later had the following exchange with Foster:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>MS. BANICK: Could you tell me a little bit about the matter that Dorie Refling represented you in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">MS. FOSTER: She just did some paperwork for me for my mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As_h\">MS. BANICK: For your mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">MS. FOSTER: Um-hum (yes).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">MS. BANICK: And was it like a transaction or a [w]ill, or something like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">MS. FOSTER: It was a legal document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">MS. BANICK: Do you feel uncomfortable telling me what that was or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">MS. FOSTER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">MS. BANICK: Judge, could I maybe go in chambers and just find out what that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s relevant if it was for her mom. I mean, she\u2019s indicated that-I believe she indicated that it wouldn\u2019t affect her ability to consider things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">MS. BANICK: Well, I\u2019d just like to explore a little bit more-she said Dorie Refling had represented her and I\u2019m just trying to-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4E\">THE COURT: She said she prepared some legal documents for her mother. I don\u2019t know that-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-13\">MS. FOSTER: She didn\u2019t represent me per se in a court action or anything like that. She just prepared some legal documents for my mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-14\">MS. BANICK: And how did you go about going to Dorie Refling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZG\">MS. FOSTER: One of my best friends works in her office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-15\">MS. BANICK: And who is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-16\">MS. FOSTER: Sonya Rogers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-17\">MS. BANICK: Could you repeat that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-18\">MS. FOSTER: Sonya Rogers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-19\">MS. BANICK: And when-this is your best friend that works in Dorie Refling\u2019s office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-20\">MS. FOSTER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-21\">MS. BANICK: And when you say \u201cDorie Refling\u2019s office,\u201d you\u2019re talking about Andriolo and Refling, the law firm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-22\">MS. FOSTER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-23\">MS. BANICK: And do you have other contact with Dorie or Mr. Andriolo through Sonya? \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-24\">MS. FOSTER: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-25\">MS. BANICK: And how often do you see Sonya or speak with Sonya?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>MS. FOSTER: I talk to her as often as once a week and sometimes every other week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">MS. BANICK: And have you spoken with Sonya about this case at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">MS. FOSTER: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">MS. BANICK: And does Sonya know that you\u2019ve been called as a juror to sit on this case that the law firm where she works at is representing one of the parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">MS. FOSTER: No. I didn\u2019t know until I got here this morning what the case was about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">MS. BANICK: And what kind of friendship do you have with Sonya? Is it a social type thing, you go out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">MS. FOSTER: We used to work together and, yeah, we go out to lunch, dinner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">MS. BANICK: How frequently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">MS. FOSTER: Lunch, once a month minimum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">MS. BANICK: And you consider her a good friend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">MS. FOSTER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-14\">MS. BANICK: And is there a possibility that you might be influenced or feel like you\u2019re rooting for one side because Sonya works at the law firm that\u2019s representing one of the parties here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ53\">MS. FOSTER: Probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-15\">MS. BANICK: Your Honor, I would challenge this juror for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">\u00b616 The District Court then questioned Foster:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-16\">THE COURT: Ms. Foster, are you saying you can\u2019t put aside whatever information you might have received in the past from your friend and be fair and listen to Ms. Banick equally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-17\">MS. FOSTER: I haven\u2019t heard anything from her regarding this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-18\">THE COURT: Nor have you heard anything from the other side regarding this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-19\">MS. FOSTER: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-20\">THE COURT: So, are you saying that because of your friendship with Sonya that you cannot be fair to Ms. Banick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-21\">MS. FOSTER: Well, not only am I partial to that law firm, I also lean more towards the general contractor than the owner in these type of situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-22\">THE COURT: These type of situations, which you haven\u2019t heard anything about yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>MS. FOSTER: Well, working in construction as long as I have, I\u2019ve actually been involved in a lot of change orders and contract disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">THE COURT: And in all that time, you\u2019ve never had a problem with a contractor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">MS. FOSTER: No. We usually work it out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t ask whether you worked them out, but you\u2019ve had-I mean you understand that issues come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">MS. FOSTER: Right, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Andriolo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">MR. ANDRIOLO: I don\u2019t take any position on it, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWs\">THE COURT: Ms. Foster, I\u2019m going to ask that you stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">MS. BANICK: Judge, I\u2019d just like you to note it\u2019s not-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">THE COURT: It\u2019s noted on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Olson subsequently used a peremptory challenge to remove Foster, and exhausted all of his peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">\u00b617 Regarding the \u201cunqualified opinion or belief as to the merits\u201d and \u201cstate of mind ... evincing enmity against or bias in favor of either party\u201d language in \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-223(6) and (7), MCA, Olson advances <em>Mahan v. Farmers Union Cent. Exchange, </em>235 Mont. 410, 768 P.2d 850 (1989). There, we determined the trial court improperly denied challenges for cause of two prospective jurors, one who expressed a fixed scruple against punitive damages and another who stated he preferred the \u201cmanagement side\u201d and appeared to have difficulty speaking and hearing. Noting the trial court\u2019s questions were general in nature and not directed to whether the prospective jurors had a state of mind evincing enmity or bias, we determined a party\u2019s attorney was wrongly forced to waste peremptory challenges. <em>Mahan, </em>235 Mont. at 418, 768 P.2d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">\u00b618 Olson maintains the present case is similar to <em>Mahan </em>with respect to Foster\u2019s inclination to favor contractors. He also asserts Foster demonstrated an unqualified opinion or belief, as well as a state of mind evincing enmity or bias, as contemplated in \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-223(6) and (7), MCA, by stating she had made up her mind about the case, generally favored contractors over owners, and would probably favor Crail Creek because her friend worked at the firm representing Crail Creek and Refling had done some legal work for her mother. In addition, Olson asserts Foster\u2019s responses to the District Court\u2019s questions confirmed her bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">\u00b619 Crail Creek responds that Foster was merely an apparently angry and reluctant prospective juror whose mother had a prior attorney-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>client relationship with Refling, and the District Court assessed Foster\u2019s demeanor and properly denied the challenge. Advancing <em>Anderson v. Burlington Northern, Inc., </em>218 Mont. 456, 709 P.2d 641 (1985), and <em>Williams v. Rigler, </em>234 Mont 161, 164, 761 P.2d 833, 835 (1988), Crail Creek further asserts that neither general animosity nor a prior attorney-client relationship is sufficient grounds for granting a challenge for cause. We note that, in <em>Anderson, </em>the prospective juror denied feeling animosity. <em>Anderson, </em>218 Mont. at 463, 709 P.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"AC0\">\u00b620  In any event, as set forth above, Foster consistently stated she felt she had made up her mind about the case, her friendship with Rogers and prior interaction with Refling would probably influence her, she was inclined to favor contractors and she did not know if she could set aside her beliefs. Foster\u2019s responses to the District Court\u2019s questions-acknowledging that construction disputes occur and she did not know the facts of this case-failed to cure, undo or \u201crehabilitate\u201d her earlier-stated biases. We conclude Foster expressed more than general animosity or reluctance to serve as a juror, and her responses provided sufficient \u201cunqualified opinion\u201d and \u201cstate of mind evincing bias\u201d grounds for Olson\u2019s challenge for cause under \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-223(6) and (7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b621 Crail Creek also argues, however, that Olson did not sufficiently assert and preserve his challenge for cause of Foster. In this regard, Crail Creek advances various cases, including <em>Simons v. Jennings, </em>100 Mont. 55, 60, 46 P.2d 704, 706 (1935), for the proposition that a party challenging a prospective juror for cause must specify the statutory basis of the challenge. Neither Simons-a case in which a party articulated one statutory basis for a challenge at trial and asserted a different statutory basis on appeal-nor any other case advanced by Crail Creek addressed a situation like that in the present case. Here, the District Court expressly afforded the party <em>opposing </em>the challenge the opportunity to state a position, counsel responded that he took no position, and the court cut off any further response by the party <em>asserting </em>the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b622  On a related note, Crail Creek asserts, without citation to authority as required under M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f), that Olson was required to contest the District Court\u2019s denial of the challenge for cause after the court ruled. Absent authority, we decline to address this assertion. We conclude Olson sufficiently preserved his challenge for cause regarding Foster, and we further conclude the District Court abused its discretion in denying the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u00b623 Relying on <em>Reff-Conlin\u2019s, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-31, Olson asserts that, when a trial court improperly denies a challenge for cause regarding a prospective juror in a civil case and a party is required to use a peremptory challenge to remove that prospective juror, prejudice is presumed as a matter of law and the appropriate disposition is automatic reversal and remand. In response, Crail Creek requests that we overrule the \u201cautomatic reversal\u201d rule in <em>Reff-Conlin\u2019s, </em>and instead adopt the \u201crebuttal\u201d standard proposed in the dissenting opinion in that case. <em>See Reff-Conlin\u2019s, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-43 (Cotter, J., dissenting). We observe, however, that Crail Creek does not attempt to meet the test for the \u201crebuttal\u201d standard, which is that the prevailing party must demonstrate the lack of any reasonable possibility that the denial of the challenge for cause contributed to the verdict. <em>See Reff-Conlin\u2019s, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-38 (Cotter, J., dissenting). Because Crail Creek has not attempted to meet the \u201crebuttal\u201d standard, we decline to further address the request that we adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b624 Alternatively, Crail Creek contends we have limited application of the \u201cautomatic reversal\u201d rule to those cases in which-unlike Olson in the present case-the challenging party moved for a new trial based on the denied challenge for cause. It advances <em>Armstrong v. Gondeiro, </em>2000 MT 326, 303 Mont. 37, 15 P.3d 386, and <em>Bueling v. Swift, </em>1998 MT 112, 288 Mont. 472, 958 P.2d 694. In each of those cases, a plaintiff asserted in a motion for a new trial that the district court had improperly granted additional peremptory challenges to multiple defendants upon erroneously determining the defendants\u2019 interests were \u201chostile\u201d to one another. In <em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 18, we set forth the \u00a7 25-11-102(7), MCA, basis on which a new trial may be granted, involving error during trial and excepted to by the party moving for a new trial. In <em>Bueling, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22, we noted-and followed-earlier jurisprudence requiring a new trial when one party has erroneously been granted additional peremptory challenges. In neither case did we even hint that the \u201cautomatic reversal\u201d rule applies only if the jury issues were preserved both contemporaneously and in a post-trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b625  We conclude the District Court abused its discretion in denying Olson\u2019s challenge for cause regarding Foster and, applying the automatic reversal rule, we reverse and remand for farther proceedings. Accordingly, we need not address the District Court\u2019s denial of Olson\u2019s challenge for cause regarding prospective juror Weirich.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u00b626 2. Did the District Court err by submitting a second supplemental verdict form to the jury, after the jury returned its initial verdict and was polled?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b627 On the special verdict form submitted as part of the initial verdict, the jury determined Crail Creek was entitled to recover $29,671.86 for breach of contract. The jury also found Crail Creek was entitled to a construction lien. In a space following the phrase \u201c[t]he total amount of Plaintiff Crail Creek Associates [sic] Construction Lien is,\u201d the jury answered \u201c$47,738.17.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b628 After the jury was polled, Crail Creek raised a question regarding the total amount of damages. During arguments outside the presence of the jury, both parties contended the construction lien claim could not stand alone as a basis for damages. Olson requested the District Court to enter a verdict for $29,671.86 in damages and reduce the amount of the lien to the amount of damages; alternatively, he moved for a new trial. Crail Creek asserted the special verdict form was confusing, the jury did not understand the \u201clegal technicalities\u201d and the jury intended to award damages of $29,671.86 plus $47,738.17. Crail Creek asked the court to submit a second supplemental verdict form requesting clarification. The District Court denied Olson\u2019s motion for a new trial and submitted a second supplemental verdict form to the jury. The jury responded that it intended to award $29,671.86 plus $47,738.13 [sic], for a total of $77,409.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b629 The parties present numerous arguments about the second supplemental verdict form. Because we have reversed and remanded on Issue 1 and this unique situation is unlikely to recur on remand, we need not resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b630 3. Did the District Court err by denying Olson\u2019s, and granting Crail Creek\u2019s, motion for judgment as a matter of law on Crail Creek\u2019s construction lien claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b631 As noted above, the District Court submitted a question to the jury in the initial verdict form regarding Crail Creek\u2019s entitlement to the construction lien, after having granted judgment as a matter of law on that question. More specifically, after the last witness testified, the events occurred in the following sequence: (1) the parties settled jury instructions, with the District Court denying requests to decide the parties\u2019 motions for judgment as a matter of law before settling jury instructions; (2) the District Court heard argument on the motions for judgment as a matter of law; (3) the next day, the parties discussed the special verdict form, without mentioning anything regarding the construction lien-related question on the form; (4) the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>orally granted Crail Creek\u2019s, and denied Olson\u2019s, motion for judgment as a matter of law regarding the legality of the construction lien and a related waiver issue; (5) the District Court noted that it would use Crail Creek\u2019s \u201cnewly proposed verdict form\u201d with minor modifications, and neither party mentioned the construction lien at that point; (6) the District Court instructed the jury, including instructions regarding when a party is entitled to a construction lien; (7) the parties presented closing arguments, with neither party mentioning the lien 'until Crail Creek\u2019s rebuttal argument that \u201c[t]he Court has already found that there\u2019s a valid construction lien here. So what you need to do is determine the amount\u201d; and (8) the District Court submitted the case to the jury, stating among other things that the jury was \u201cto proceed through and answer the questions\u201d on the special verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b632 Advancing construction lien statutes and case law, the parties make numerous arguments regarding whether either of them was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We note that, throughout the underlying proceedings, the parties and the District Court articulated various positions on whether issues of fact existed regarding the validity of the construction lien, Crail Creek\u2019s entitlement to enforce it, the interpretation of certain documents, and the existence of one or more agency relationships allegedly related to the lien claim-including a possible agency relationship between Crail Creek and Westfork.</p>\n<p id=\"AEW\">\u00b633 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo. <em>Schuff v. Jackson, </em>2008 MT 81, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 156, \u00b6 14, 179 P.3d 1169, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Judgment as a matter of law is only appropriate when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting the issue to the jury. Judgment as a matter of law is not proper if reasonable persons could differ regarding conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 24 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b634 In this extraordinary case, we simply cannot review pursuant to <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 24, whether any evidence would justify submitting the issue to the jury, because it appears the issue was submitted to-and decided by-the jury. In this regard, notwithstanding the representation of Crail Creek\u2019s counsel during its rebuttal closing argument that the validity of the lien had already been decided in its favor, we must presume the jury followed the District Court\u2019s, and not counsel\u2019s, instructions in answering the construction lien-related question on the special verdict form. <em>See State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 168, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6 168, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6 168 (citations omitted). Moreover, our ability to review the District Court\u2019s ruling is significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>constrained because of the absence of any written order or memorandum by the District Court setting forth legal analysis supporting its hen-related determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b635 In light of the unusual circumstances surrounding this issue and having reversed and remanded on Issue 1, we decline to address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the applicability and effect of construction lien statutes and case law. We further decline to address whether the District Court erred in granting Crail Creek\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the construction lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b636 In addition to our reversal and remand on Issue 1, we vacate the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law on the construction lien claim without expressing any view on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqqd\">\u00b637 4. Did the District Court err by determining Crail Creek was entitled to attorney fees, costs, and prejudgment interest?</p>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">\u00b638 As noted above, the District Court awarded attorney fees, costs and prejudgment interest. In light of our reversal and remand on Issue 1, we reverse these awards and decline, at this juncture, to address the District Court\u2019s reasoning or the parties\u2019 arguments regarding who was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d and other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b639 5. May Crail Creek retain in a lawyer trust account the funds it obtained from the title company via a writ of execution on the judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b640 As noted above, a title company held back $69,000 of the purchase price in an interest-bearing account until, after judgment, a levying officer collected the funds and Crail Creek placed them in an Interest on Lawyers Trust Account (IOLTA). Olson asserts, and Crail Creek does not dispute, that interest on funds held in an IOLTA is not recoverable by a party. Indeed, Rules 1.18(c)(2)(E)(i) and 1.18(c)(2)(B) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct provide, respectively, that interest or dividends on an IOLTA must be remitted to the Montana Justice Foundation, and no client may receive interest or dividends earned on funds in an IOLTA. Olson asks this Court to require Crail Creek, on remand, to immediately pay the funds currently in the IOLTA to the Clerk of the District Court until final disposition of this case and that we also order Crail Creek to pay to the Clerk 10% interest on those funds for the time they have been in the IOLTA to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b641 The parties make numerous arguments about whether Crail Creek properly executed on the judgment, as well as the District Court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction to address this matter. We decline to address these arguments because, whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>determinations we might reach in those regards, the ultimate question at this juncture is whether the funds may <em>remain </em>in the IOLTA. We exercise our equitable powers in resolving that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b642 In a somewhat different context, we have reasoned that a party who takes property by force of a judgment not yet final is a trustee, subject to making restitution as a court of equity might order if the judgment is overturned. <em>See Aye v. Fix, </em>192 Mont. 141, 147, 626 P.2d 1259, 1263 (1981). \u201c \u2018The right to recover what one has lost by enforcement of a judgment subsequently reversed is well established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reil v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>254 Mont. 274, 278, 837 P.2d 1334, 1337 (1992) (quoting <em>Waggoner v. Glacier Colony of Hutterites, </em>131 Mont. 525, 528, 312 P.2d 117, 118 (1957)); <em>see also Hansen v. Hansen, </em>134 Mont. 290, 295, 329 P.2d 791, 793 (1958). In <em>Waggoner, </em>we recognized a split of authority regarding the necessity of a final judgment before a court may order restitution of property or funds obtained via a judgment reversed on appeal. We then stated \u201cyet we believe that most authorities agree that restitution should be granted when to do otherwise would give offense to equity and good conscience.\u201d <em>Waggoner, </em>131 Mont. at 529, 312 P.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b643  As set forth above, prejudgment interest-related issues-the merits of which we have declined to address in Issue 4-arose in the proceedings leading to this appeal. Before Crail Creek\u2019s execution on the judgment, the title company held the funds in an interest-bearing account and, indeed, it appears Crail Creek obtained approximately $8,000 in interest from the title company account along with the $69,000 in holdback funds. At this juncture, placing the funds in an interest-bearing account and under neutral control would return the parties to a status more akin to their status prior to the judgment and execution thereon. Moreover, if a party ultimately is awarded prejudgment interest, any interest accrued after remand in an account administered by the Clerk of the District Court could be applied to that award, rather than requiring the party against whom final judgment is entered to produce any interest out-of-pocket. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude it would be inequitable to allow Crail Creek to retain the funds in an IOLTA, and we order Crail Creek to pay the funds to the Clerk of the District Court, to be held in an interest-bearing account until final disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b644 We decline, however, to address Olson\u2019s request that we order Crail Creek to submit 10% interest on the funds for the time they already have been in the IOLTA. If it becomes necessary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>appropriate for that issue to be resolved on remand, we are confident the parties or the District Court will do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b645 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER, RICE, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b359-6\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AdJ\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b646 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion because it correctly applies the law to the facts of this case.
