We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Did the WCC err in rescinding the settlement agreement based upon mutual mistake of fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">\u00b63 In August 1988, Henry suffered a serious head injury while employed with Blue Range Mining of Butte, when an ore bucket struck Henry on the side of the face. At the time of Henry\u2019s injury, Blue Range Mining was enrolled under Compensation Plan No. 2 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA), and was insured by Old Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"ASqr\">\u00b64 The blow to Henry\u2019s head caused a cave-in to the right orbital rim with the orbital floor and left lateral orbit being pushed up into the frontal lobe of his brain. He underwent surgery to repair and reconstruct his fractured skull. Henry was 37 years old at the time of the accident. He and his wife Kathy had been married for five years and had two small children.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">\u00b65 Shortly after the accident, Old Republic accepted liability for Henry\u2019s injury and began paying temporary total disability and medical benefits. Old Republic retained the services of Industrial Injury Claims Services (Industrial) to adjust the claim. While the extent of Henry\u2019s disability was initially unclear, the parties ultimately agreed that Henry was permanently totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">\u00b66 In March 1990, Henry traveled to the Virginia Mason Clinic in Seattle for additional testing to determine the extent of his brain injury. These tests revealed that Henry had reductions in speed and flexibility of thinking, and in fine motor speed and grip strength in his right hand; significant problems with visual spatial memory and with complex tactual spatial problem solving; and a tendency to lose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>complex visual spatial information. The clinic also noted that Henry suffered from constant headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b67 In February 1991 and over the next two years, Henry\u2019s doctors suggested that Henry needed a minimum of eight to ten hours of domiciliary care daily and that, in all likelihood, he required 24-hours-a-day domiciliary care. The doctors opined that without such care, Henry was at a significant risk for additional injuries, continued depression, and possible suicide. While Henry could bathe and dress himself, Kathy explained that Henry engaged in unsafe behaviors when he was unsupervised, such as forgetting to turn off stove burners or leaving the door to the wood stove open.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b68 Since the accident, Kathy had operated a small day care out of her home which also provided her the opportunity to supervise Henry. In October 1991, Kathy closed her day care to take employment outside the home in order to obtain health insurance coverage for her family. Neighbors and family members checked in on Henry during the day, but he struggled to function on his own. Henry\u2019s doctors believed that Henry required more structure, hence Kathy quit her job to stay home and care for Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b69 Kathy was appointed as Henry\u2019s conservator on June 9, 1992. After months of negotiations, the parties reached an agreement that required Old Republic to pay Kathy $5.30 per hour, 70 hours per week, for her to stay home and care for Henry. Old Republic began paying for this domiciliary care in January 1993 at the agreed upon rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b610 In June 1994, Henry and Old Republic entered into a Compromise and Settlement Agreement, which was approved by the Department of Labor and Industry on July 26, 1994. Under the terms of this agreement, Henry\u2019s claims for permanent total disability benefits and domiciliary care benefits were settled for $132,701.28 (of which $125,000.00 represented new money and $7,701.28 represented the waiver of an overpayment). In conformance with the parties\u2019 agreement, an exhibit was attached to the settlement agreement which expressly closed \u201cfully and forever ... any and all present and future domiciliary care\u201d benefits while specifically reserving medical and hospital benefits. To that end the exhibit provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">Such benefits shall include all costs and charges associated with any type of supervised care that claimant may need or desires as a result of his industrial injury including, but not limited to, domiciliary (attendant) care as presently provided by claimant\u2019s wife and paid for by the Insurer, rest home care, rehabilitation center or attended care (and its equivalent), and paid supervision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>of daily activities in or outside of the home. In closing out all domiciliary care medical benefits, the parties agree that all other medical care benefits for medical conditions caused by the industrial injury shall remain in force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">\u00b611 In December 1995, Henry no longer required domiciliary care, hence Kathy was able to return to work outside the home. As before, their neighbors checked on Henry from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b612 In 2004, Henry began to exhibit symptoms of a movement disorder. His doctors variously described his condition as Parkinsonism, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s-plus. It was determined that the Parkinson\u2019s disease was most likely the result of the traumatic brain injury sixteen years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b613 On February 17, 2005, Henry filed a petition with the WCC seeking to rescind the settlement agreement. Henry argued that the parties\u2019 failure to anticipate that he would ultimately contract Parkinson\u2019s disease as a result of his injury was a mutual mistake of fact justifying rescission of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b614 A hearing was held in the matter on January 23, 2006. On June 1,2006, the WCC entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and J udgment wherein it determined that because a mutual mistake of fact regarding the nature of Henry\u2019s injuries had occurred, the settlement agreement must be set aside and Henry\u2019s claim reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u00b615 Old Republic appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u00b616 We conduct de novo review of the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct. <em>Harrison v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2008 MT 102, \u00b6 11, 342 Mont. 326, \u00b6 11, 181 P.3d 590, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>Flynn v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2005 MT 269, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 122, \u00b6 11, 122 P.3d 1216, \u00b6 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">\u00b617 Our review of the WCC\u2019s findings of fact, on the other hand, is both deferential and limited in scope. We simply review the WCC\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Harrison, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>In re Abfalder, </em>2003 MT 180, \u00b6 10, 316 Mont. 415, \u00b6 10, 75 P.3d 1246, \u00b6 10). Substantial credible evidence is that which a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Harrison, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Simms v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 511, \u00b6 11, 116 P.3d 773, \u00b6 11). Because of the high level of deference we accord to the WCC\u2019s factual findings, we will consider evidence to be substantial even if it is contradicted by other evidence, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>somewhat less than a preponderance and it is inherently weak. However, it must be more than a mere \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence and it must rise above the level of \u201ctrifling or frivolous.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>EBI/Orion Group v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>249 Mont. 449, 453, 816 P.2d 1070, 1073 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b618 As for the scope of our review, we confine our review to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the findings actually made by the WCC. We do not resolve conflicts in the evidence, and we do not consider whether evidence supports findings that are different from those made by the WCC. <em>Harrison, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Kloepfer v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>276 Mont. 495, 498-99, 916 P.2d 1310, 1312 (1996); <em>Montana State Fund v. Murray, </em>2005 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 326 Mont. 516, \u00b6 19, 111 P.3d 210, \u00b6 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b619 <em>Did the WCC err in rescinding the settlement agreement based upon mutual mistake of fact?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b620 Old Republic argues that the WCC erred in concluding that the parties\u2019 made a material and mutual mistake when they failed to predict that Henry would contract Parkinson\u2019s disease several years after the settlement. Old Republic provides the following four reasons for its contention. First, Old Republic asserts that the mutual mistake-of-fact doctrine rejects the notion that a mistake of fact can consist of a failure to predict future events. Second, Old Republic asserts that even accepting the WCC\u2019s conclusion that a failure to anticipate future events can be a mistake, such failure in this case is not a mutual mistake because, at the time of settlement, Old Republic was aware that Henry\u2019s condition would worsen over time. Third, Old Republic asserts that even assuming that the parties\u2019 failure to predict Parkinson\u2019s disease was a mutual mistake, the WCC erred by concluding that the mistake was material. Finally, Old Republic asserts that in concluding that the parties\u2019 failure to predict the future was a mutual mistake of fact, the WCC erred by setting forth a rule that jeopardizes the enforceability of settlement agreements, thereby disregarding the public policy of encouraging settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\u00b621 Henry argues, on the other hand, that at the time of the settlement, his condition was stable and he had no problems with motor function. Thus, neither Henry, his wife, nor Old Republic\u2019s adjuster knew that Henry would develop a movement disorder. On that basis, Henry argues that the WCC correctly relied on the long standing rule that a mistake about the nature and extent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>claimant\u2019s physical condition is a \u201cmaterial\u201d mistake of fact justifying the rescission of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b622 Henry fails to recognize, however, that it is precisely because his condition was stable and he had no problems with motor function at the time he entered into the settlement agreement that a mutual mistake did not occur. It is on this basis that we reverse the WCC. While substantial credible evidence does support the WCC\u2019s finding that Henry\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease was caused by his 1988 injury, it is undisputed that the Parkinson\u2019s disease did not exist when the parties entered into their settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b623 This Court has adopted the widely accepted rule that a failure to predict the future is not a mistake of fact as contemplated by the mutual mistake-of-fact doctrine. <em>See Gamble v. Sears, </em>2007 MT 131, \u00b6 46, 337 Mont. 354, \u00b6 46, 160 P.3d 537, \u00b6 46 (\u201cit is undisputed that if Gamble\u2019s odontoid fracture <em>existed at the time of settlement, </em>the parties were mutually mistaken regarding a material fact, and the settlement agreement must therefore be rescinded.\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, the parties\u2019 failure to predict Henry\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease was not a mutual mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b624 Because a settlement agreement is a contract, we apply contract law to determine whether the agreement is valid and enforceable. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>Wolfe v. Webb, </em>251 Mont. 217, 223, 824 P.2d 240, 244 (1992)). The parties must give their consent to enter into a contract and that consent must be given freely. However, consent cannot be given freely when it is based on a mistake. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"Agu\">\u00b625 \u201cEither a mistake of fact or a mistake of law will preclude freely given consent.\u201d <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 25. Section 28-2-409, MCA, defines what constitutes a mistake of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">Mistake of fact is a mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake and consisting in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">(1) an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, <em>past or present, </em>material to the contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">(2) belief in the <em>present </em>existence of a thing material to the contract which does not exist or in the <em>past </em>existence of such a thing which has not existed. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Thus, as Old Republic points out, parties to a contract make a mutual mistake of fact only if they are unconsciously ignorant or forgetful of a fact that existed <em>prior to or at the time of </em>settlement. Ignorance of a future event does not amount to a mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">\u00b626 Henry notes in his brief on appeal, that while the parties agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that the movement disorder was caused by Henry\u2019s 1988 injury, \u201c[t]he parties also agree that <em>prior to and at the time of settlement </em>neither knew that there was any connection between head injuries and Parkinson\u2019s and neither expected [Henry] would develop such a condition, (emphasis added).\u201d That is precisely the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b627 \u201c[T]he erroneous belief must relate to the facts <em>as they exist at the time of the making of the contract. </em>A party\u2019s prediction or judgment as to events to occur in the future, even if erroneous, is not a \u2018mistake\u2019 as that word is defined here.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 151 cmt. a (1981) (emphasis added). \u201c[I]n order to relieve a party from liability on the contract, the mistake must relate to a material fact, <em>past or present, </em>and not to a future contingency.\u201d 17A C. J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 149a (1999) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">Mutual mistake results when both parties to a contract share a common assumption about a vital <em>existing </em>fact upon which they based their bargain and that assumption is false, and because of the mistake, a quite different exchange of values occurs from the exchange of values the parties contemplated.... [A] mutual mistake of fact cannot lie against a <em>future </em>event. Mutual mistakes must concern past or present facts, <em>not unexpected facts that occur after the document is executed.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">17A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 202 (2004) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u00b628 In <em>United States v. Southwestern Elec. Co-op., Inc., </em>869 F.2d 310, 314 (7th Cir. 1989), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated that the doctrine of mutual mistake does not cover an erroneous \u201cprediction or judgment as to events to occur in the future ... it must be a mistake of a present or a past fact.\u201d The Court of Appeals further stated that \u201cthe rules governing rescission for either mutual or singular mistake are inapplicable where ... a party\u2019s erroneous prediction or judgment as to future events is involved.\u201d <em>Southwestern, </em>869 F.2d at 315 (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 151 cmt. a).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u00b629 Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit cited with approval two prior Pennsylvania cases that held that \u201ca party who underestimates the future severity of her injuries will not be permitted to avoid the consequences of a settlement agreement based on mutual mistake.\u201d <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Portlight, Inc., </em>188 F.3d 93, 97 (3rd Cir. 1999) (citing <em>Emery v. Mackiewicz, </em>240 A.2d 68 (Pa. 1968); <em>Leyda v. Norelli, </em>564 A.2d 244 (Pa. Super. 1989)). The Court of Appeals determined that this rule was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">entirely consistent with the more general principle of mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>mistake doctrine that erroneous predictions of future events do not qualify as a mistake.... Were there not such a rule, the effectiveness of settlement agreements would be greatly diminished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><em>Consolidated, </em>188 F.3d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b630 Numerous other jurisdictions have held the same. For example, the Supreme Court of West Virginia held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">a contract may not be reformed or rescinded based upon a mutual mistake of fact if the mistake relates to a mistaken belief, judgment, or expectation as to future, rather than past or present, facts, occurrences or events. If a party to a contract could reform or rescind a contract on the ground that an expectation as to future results or occurrences was mistaken, the stability and binding force of many contracts would be destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>Ryan v. Ryan, </em>640 S.E.2d 64, 69 (W. Va. 2006). The court in <em>Ryan </em>quoted with favor the following excerpt from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">In determining whether there has been a mutual mistake of fact, we must examine the facts <em>as they existed at the time of the </em>agreement.... A mutual mistake in prophecy or opinion may not be taken as a ground for rescission where such mistake becomes evident through the passage of time. What is today only a conjecture, an opinion, or a guess, might by tomorrow, through the exercise of hindsight, be regarded then as an absolute fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlB\"><em>Ryan, </em>640 S.E.2d at 69 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>United States v. Garland, </em>122 F.2d 118, 122 (4th Cir. 1941), <em>cert denied, </em>314 U.S. 685, 62 S. Ct. 189 (1941)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u00b631 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Henry cites to several Montana cases which he contends illustrate that his development of Parkinson\u2019s disease sixteen years after his accident was a mutual mistake of fact requiring rescission of the settlement agreement. However, the cases Henry cites, <em>Kienas v. Peterson, </em>191 Mont. 325, 624 P.2d 1 (1980); <em>Weldele v. Medley Development, </em>227 Mont. 257, 738 P.2d 1281 (1987); <em>Kimes v. Charlies Fam. Din. &amp; Donut Shop, </em>233 Mont. 175, 759 P.2d 986 (1988); <em>Wolfe v. Webb, </em>251 Mont. 217, 824 P.2d 240 (1992); and <em>South v. Transportation Ins. Co., </em>275 Mont. 397, 913 P.2d 233 (1996), are fatal to Henry\u2019s argument because they clearly establish that a failure to predict a future condition is not a mistake regarding the nature and extent of a claimant\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b632 In <em>Kienas, </em>the claimant sustained a back injury in an industrial accident for which he received compensation benefits from the State Fund. After nine months of receiving benefits, the claimant signed a settlement agreement with the State Fund. Eighteen months later, however, the claimant filed a petition in the WCC for a hearing to reopen his file and to set aside the settlement agreement. At the time of the accident, the claimant was suffering from cerebral palsy. He argued that the accident aggravated this pre-existing condition and that the settlement did not take this factor into account. The WCC denied claimant\u2019s petition. <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont. at 326-28, 624 P.2d at 1-2. This Court reversed on the basis of a mutual mistake of material fact. However, contrary to Henry\u2019s assertions in the instant case, the mutual mistake of fact found by this Court in <em>Kienas </em>was the parties\u2019 ignorance of the fact that the claimant\u2019s workplace accident could have aggravated his <em>pre-existing </em>cerebral palsy-a condition that existed and of which the parties were aware at the time they entered into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>settlement agreement. <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont. at 329-30, 624 P.2d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">\u00b633 Similarly, in <em>Weldele, </em>the claimant was initially diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and rotator cuff syndrome. While thoracic outlet syndrome<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was suspected by the two treating physicians, both failed to verify that condition and dismissed it as a diagnosis. After settlement, the claimant\u2019s shoulder and neck pain continued and he was ultimately diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome requiring further surgery. <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 257-60, 738 P.2d at 1281-83. On appeal, this Court affirmed the WCC\u2019s decision to rescind the agreement based upon mutual mistake of fact. This Court found that the claimant had thoracic outlet syndrome <em>at the time of the settlement. Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 260-61, 738 P.2d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b634 In <em>Kimes, </em>the claimant injured his knee when he fell down some steps at work. He underwent surgery to repair a ruptured cruciate ligament in his knee. Following surgery, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. The claimant continued to have knee problems and further diagnostics revealed that, in addition to rupturing his cruciate ligament, the claimant had torn a cartilage in his knee during his fall which the original treating physician had failed to detect. <em>Kimes, </em>233 Mont. at 176-77, 759 P.2d at 987. This Court agreed with the WCC\u2019s decision to set aside the settlement agreement on the basis that both parties were ignorant of an injury <em>that actually existed at the time of settlement. Kimes, </em>233 Mont. at 178, 759 P.2d at 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b635 In <em>Wolfe, </em>the claimant was injured when the ditch in which he was installing pipe caved in and buried him up to his neck. As a result of this accident, he sustained crushing injuries across his upper body, including a fracture of his left clavicle and dislocation of his right clavicle where it formed a joint with the sternum. He also reported pain in his shoulders. Claimant underwent two surgeries to his clavicle, but because the pain in his shoulder was not his primary complaint, no treatment for his shoulder was rendered at that time. <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 220, 824 P.2d at 241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b636 Three years after his injury, the claimant in <em>Wolfe </em>entered into a settlement agreement with the State Fund. However, he continued to experience problems with his shoulder. He returned to his treating physician who discovered a defect in the shoulder joint. Thereafter, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>claimant underwent two surgeries on his shoulder. He petitioned the WCC to reopen his case and the WCC agreed concluding that there had been a mutual mistake of material fact sufficient to justify setting aside the settlement agreement. <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at <em>221-22, </em>824 P.2d at 242-43. On appeal, we stated that \u201c[o]ur review then is necessarily limited to whether the testimony of one qualified and credible witness established that claimant\u2019s [shoulder] was injured <em>at the time of his settlement agreement </em>with appellant.\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont at 230, 824 P.2d at 248 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b637 And, in <em>South, </em>the claimant sustained an on-the-job injury to her back. Following two separate back surgeries, she settled her claim. The settlement agreement listed several jobs which had been approved by the claimant\u2019s doctor and which the parties believed the claimant could perform. In accordance -with the terms of the agreement, the claimant elected to begin training as a massage therapist, one of the approved jobs listed in the agreement. While in training, she began to experience worsening back pain hence she was forced to quit the training program and undergo additional surgery. The WCC denied the claimant\u2019s request to rescind the settlement agreement on the grounds that the claimant\u2019s post-settlement back problems provided no proof that the parties were mistaken as to the nature and extent of the claimant\u2019s condition at the time of settlement. <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 399-400, 913 P.2d at 234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b638 On appeal, we found no error in the WCC\u2019s conclusion in <em>South </em>that the parties were not mistaken regarding the nature and extent of claimant\u2019s injury <em>at the time the contract was formed. </em>We did not end our inquiry there, however, as we did find error in the WCC\u2019s failure to consider the claimant\u2019s contention of mutual mistake regarding the propriety of the job approved for her to do. <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 403, 913 P.2d at 236. Thus, we did not rescind the settlement agreement in <em>South </em>based on a mutual mistake as to the claimant\u2019s injury, but on the mistaken belief that massage therapist was an appropriate job for the claimant to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b639 Therefore, contrary to Henry\u2019s assertions, these cases establish that, in order to constitute a mistake of fact justifying rescission, a mistake regarding the nature and extent of a claimant\u2019s condition must be with respect to a claimant\u2019s condition <em>as it exists at the time of settlement </em>and not with respect to a condition that develops at some point in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b640 In the instant case, it is undisputed that Henry did not have Parkinson\u2019s disease until approximately ten years after he signed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>settlement agreement. And, at the time the parties entered into the settlement agreement, no one could have foreseen that Henry would develop Parkinson\u2019s disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b641 Judith Hosford, who had been employed by Industrial in 1988 to handle the adjusting of Henry\u2019s claim, testified by deposition and at trial that prior to 2004, Henry\u2019s main complaints dealt with cognitive problems and pain issues. Hosford, who was a former Certified Nurse Assistant with a background in dealing with brain-injured patients, testified that she was aware of deterioration in people who suffered brain injuries, but that she did not expect Parkinson\u2019s. Hence, she testified that in her experience, head injuries always get worse, they never get better. Moreover, Hosford asserted that in 1994, when the parties entered into the settlement agreement, not only was she unaware of any connection between head injuries and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Henry\u2019s medical records indicated that he was stable. Hosford further testified that it was the Kruziches and their attorney who wanted to close domiciliary care as part of settlement because they \u201cwanted Work Comp basically out of their life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b642 Kathy testified that at the time the parties\u2019 were attempting to settle Henry\u2019s claim, she also believed that Henry\u2019s condition had stabilized. She had done some research and reading concerning brain injuries, but she did not learn anything about long-term deterioration following a brain injury. Nether did she discuss long-term deterioration with any of Henry\u2019s doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b643 Kathy also testified that in November 1990, Community Medical Center in Missoula provided Kathy with some articles on brain injuries, but those articles made no mention of long-term deterioration. She also testified that she and Henry belonged to a head injury support group for about a year. While this group occasionally had doctors as guest speakers, Kathy did not recall receiving any information from the group or from any of its guest speakers indicating that Henry\u2019s condition might worsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b644 Furthermore, Henry was examined by a neurologist in January 1993 who noted that Henry had \u201cnormal strength, tone and cerebellar function.\u201d And, in August and September 2003, Henry saw a physiatrist who noted that Henry had normal upper and lower extremity strength, normal coordination, and normal gait and balance. In addition, one of Henry\u2019s treating physicians indicated that Henry\u2019s condition had stabilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u00b645  Thus, because Henry\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease did not exist at the time of settlement, the parties\u2019 failure to anticipate that future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>condition was not a mistake as to the nature and extent of Henry\u2019s condition at the time of settlement. In order to justify rescission, the mistake must have occurred at the time of settlement, and must thus relate to the claimant\u2019s condition <em>as it existed at that time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b646 In rescinding the settlement agreement, the WCC stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARS\">there is a clear distinction between the deterioration or worsening of a condition and the development of an entirely distinct disorder. While a deterioration or worsening of [Henry\u2019s] cognitive abilities would perhaps have been foreseeable, that is not the case before this Court. Rather, [Henry] developed a distinct physical ailment as a direct result of his industrial accident, <em>the possibility of which neither party was aware at the time the claim was settled. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Although the court recognized that at the time the parties executed the settlement agreement, neither party could have foreseen that Henry would develop Parkinson\u2019s disease, the court then went on to erroneously conclude that this constituted a mutual mistake of fact. As we have already determined, the doctrine of mutual mistake applies only to known facts that existed at the time the settlement agreement was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b647 The public policy of this State is to encourage settlement and avoid unnecessary litigation. <em>Augustine v. Simonson, </em>283 Mont 259, 266, 940 P.2d 116, 120 (1997) (citing <em>Holmberg v. Strong, </em>272 Mont. 101, 106, 899 P.2d 1097, 1100 (1995)). Thus, we have stated that to encourage settlement and preserve the sanctity of workers\u2019 compensation settlement agreements, we will reopen such agreements only \u201crarely and reluctantly.\u201d <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 406, 913 P.2d at 238 (Erdman, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Whitcher v. Winter Hardware Co., </em>236 Mont. 289, 769 P.2d 1215 (1989)). If we were to uphold the WCC and fashion a new rule that unanticipated future medical conditions could retroactively create mutual mistakes at the time of settlement, then settlement agreements would not be worth the paper they are written on because any unanticipated medical condition would justify rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b648  Accordingly, we hold that the WCC erred in rescinding the settlement agreement based upon mutual mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\u00b649 That said, the Dissent has raised several contentions that deserve a response. First, the Dissent complains that we have parted ways \u201cwith three decades of mutual mistake of fact analysis in the context of workers\u2019 compensation law,\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 59, as though a separate doctrine applies to WC cases than applies to other types of cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Contrary to this assertion, the mutual mistake of fact doctrine is the same no matter what type of case is involved \u2014 WC cases are not governed by a separate body of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b650 Second, the Dissent faults this Court for \u201cdisregarding] the limited scope of our review of findings made by the WCC.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 59. Based on our decision in <em>Gamble v. Sears, </em>2007 MT 131, 337 Mont. 354, 160 P.3d 537, the Dissent argues that because substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s finding that \u201cHenry\u2019s injury was present at the time of the 1994 settlement agreement,\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 60, we may not consider contrary findings. However, the WCC made no such finding. Rather, the WCC found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">In January 1993, [Henry] was examined by a neurologist, Dr. Scott D. Callaghan, at the request of [Old Republic], Dr. Callaghan noted, among other findings, \u201cIn regards to this patient motorically, this seems to be normal function in that he has normal strength, tone and cerebellar function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">[Henry] saw physiatrist Dr. Allen M. Weinert, Jr. on August 29, 2003, and again on September 22, 2003. On both visits, Dr. Weinert noted normal upper and lower extremity strength, normal coordination, and normal gait and balance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Thus, unlike <em>Gamble </em>where the WCC\u2019s findings were based on medical evidence establishing that Gamble\u2019s injury <em>existed at the time of the settlement agreement, </em>the medical evidence in the instant case established that Henry\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease <em>did not </em>exist at the time of the settlement agreement. To that end the WCC concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOZ\">there is a clear distinction between the deterioration or worsening of a condition and the development of an entirely distinct disorder. While a deterioration or worsening of [Henry\u2019s] cognitive abilities would perhaps have been foreseeable, that is not the case before this Court. Rather, [Henry] <em>developed a distinct physical ailment </em>as a direct result of his industrial accident, <em>the possibility of which neither party was aware at the time the claim was settled. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b651 Third, the Dissent states that the \u201csource of the Court\u2019s reasoning ... remains far from clear.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 66. What could be clearer than Montana\u2019s mistake-of-fact doctrine, quoted in \u00b6 25 of this Opinion, which specifically states that a mistake of fact is \u201can unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, <em>past or present, </em>material to the contract\u201d or a \u201cbelief in the <em>present existence </em>of a thing material to the contract which does not exist or in the <em>past existence </em>of such a thing which has not existed.\u201d Section 28-2-409, MCA (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Indeed, the Court\u2019s reasoning is mandated by the black-letter law of this State which the Dissent does not so much as mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b652 Fourth, the Dissent contends that we have failed to distinguish Henry\u2019s claim from the factual scenarios in <em>Kienas, Weldele, Kimes, Wolfe </em>and <em>South. </em>Nothing could be further from the truth. As we have stated, the injury complained of in <em>each </em>of these cases existed <em>at the time of the </em>settlement agreement. In the instant case, it is undisputed that Henry\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease did not exist at the time of the settlement agreement and no one-not his doctors, not the insurance adjustor, not Henry, and not his wife-foresaw that Henry would develop Parkinson\u2019s disease sixteen years after his accident. Additionally, while the Dissent contends that \u201cwe address an <em>undetected </em>injury that had occurred in 1988,\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 82 (emphasis added), Henry\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease was not \u201cundetected\u201d in 1988. It did not exist in 1988-there was nothing there to detect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABg\">\u00b653 Furthermore, there is absolutely no evidence in the record before this Court that, <em>at the time the settlement agreement was executed, </em>Henry suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d of Parkinson\u2019s disease or even that Henry would develop that disease sixteen years later. The WCC reached that very conclusion. In attempting to craft a theory to undo the settlement agreement and to compensate Henry, the Dissent refuses to acknowledge that the legal issue before this Court is whether the settlement agreement was entered into under a mutual mistake of <em>past </em>or <em>existing </em>fact. Section 28-2-409, MCA. Quite simply, the parties could not be mutually mistaken about a fact that did not exist then and exists now only because Henry developed Parkinson\u2019s disease a decade and a half after his industrial accident. If, as the Dissent posits, the mutual mistake-of-fact doctrine could be undone at a later date because of20/20 hindsight, then the doctrine would cease to have any legal utility at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b654 Fifth, the Dissent complains that we incorrectly lump cases involving injured workers together with cases involving electric co-ops, railroads, and ex-spouses. Dissent, \u00b6 85. The Dissent continues to harbor the mistaken belief that a separate doctrine regarding mutual mistake of fact applies to WC cases than applies to all other types of cases. The cases cited in the Opinion that the Dissent takes issue <em>withSouthwestern, Consolidated </em>and Ryan-are all cases involving the doctrine of mutual mistake of fact and are cited and examined to shed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>further light on this doctrine and to illustrate how it has been applied in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">\u00b655 Finally, the Dissent points out that the intent and purpose of workers\u2019 compensation law involves the \u201cneed to fairly compensate the injured worker.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 59. We agree. However, one\u2019s subjective perception of \u201cfairness\u201d cannot be achieved by simply ignoring governing statutory law and our dispositive jurisprudence-at least in the absence of some other legal challenge not at issue here. We sympathize with the plight of the Kruziches. And, if repeating the horrific circumstances of Henry\u2019s industrial accident in mantra-like fashion could change the law, then the outcome of this appeal might well be different. The legal issue before us, however, is not complex. It involves the doctrine of mutual mistake of fact, the law of which is well-established. Old Republic, like any other litigant appearing before this Court, is entitled to our impartial application of the law-an approach that can hardly ever be fairly characterized as a \u201cwindfall,\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 85, to the prevailing party, regardless of the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b656  On the undisputed facts of this case, we hold that the WCC erred in its application of the law of mutual mistake of fact. Accordingly, we must reverse the court\u2019s legal determination in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b657 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b165-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, RICE and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b165-7\">JUSTICE MORRIS dissents.</judges>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b658 The WCC concluded that neither party contemplated at the time of the settlement that Henry would develop a movement disorder directly attributable to being hit in the face with an ore bucket in 1988. The Court determines that the WCC unjustifiably reached this conclusion in light of the fact that a mutual mistake that would justify rescinding a settlement agreement \u201cmust be with respect to a claimant\u2019s condition <em>as it exists at the time of settlement </em>and not with respect to a condition that develops at some point in the future.\u201d \u00b6 39 (emphasis in original). I disagree with the Court's analysis of mutual mistake of fact as applied here. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b659 The Court\u2019s analysis parts ways with three decades of mutual mistake of fact analysis in the context of workers\u2019 compensation law. The Court\u2019s analysis also defeats the very intent and purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation law-the \u201cneed to fairly compensate the injured worker ... .\u201d <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 261, 738 P.2d at 1283. Finally, the Court\u2019s analysis disregards the limited scope of our review of findings made by the WCC. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u00b660 As noted by the Court in <em>Gamble, </em>we must determine only whether substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s finding that Henry\u2019s movement disorder was caused by the 1988 accident and that Henry\u2019s injury was present at the time of the 1994 settlement agreement. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 28. The claimant in <em>Gamble </em>alleged that she had suffered symptoms since the time of her accident, but she conceded that she had never reported the symptoms to her treating physician. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 29. The defendant argued that the claimant\u2019s failure to report her symptoms demonstrated that the injury had not existed at the time of the settlement. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 29. The Court\u2019s limited standard of review precluded it, however, from rendering its own judgment regarding this alleged inconsistency. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 30. We face no similar inconsistency here. The WCC found, and Old Republic concedes, that Henry\u2019s 1988 industrial accident caused his movement disorder. We also know that Henry\u2019s movement disorder was present at the time of the 1994 settlement, as the 1988 accident caused the movement disorder. \u00b6 22. Henry suffered no head trauma before or after his accident in 1988, thereby eliminating other possible causes. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b661 The Court concedes that substantial credible evidence supported this finding and numerous other findings made by the WCC. \u00b6\u00b6 22,40-44. The ore bucket crushed Henry\u2019s skull. Doctors had to remove bone fragments from Henry\u2019s brain. The Virginia Mason Clinic in Seattle, Washington, conducted a battery of tests on Henry in March 1990. The Clinic\u2019s testing revealed that Henry had sustained a number of cognitive impairments as a result of having his skull crushed by the ore bucket. The Clinic specifically determined that Henry \u201chad reductions in speed of thinking, reductions in the flexibility of thinking, significant problems with visual spatial memory, reductions in fine motor speed, reductions in grip strength in the right hand, problems with complex tactual spatial problem-solving, and a tendency to lose complex visual spatial information.\u201d The Clinic did not diagnose any movement disorder in Henry at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b662 Henry\u2019s medical records reveal that before 1994 he suffered from problems \u201csuch as headaches and facial pain, depression, irritability, and difficulties with concentration and memory.\u201d Although Henry\u2019s medical records documented these symptoms, Kathy believed that Henry\u2019s cognitive condition had stabilized by February 1994. Old Republic agreed that Henry\u2019s medical records indicated that he had stabilized by 1994. Dr. Scott D. Callaghan, a neurologist, had examined Henry in January 1993 at Old Republic\u2019s request. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Callaghan noted, among other findings, \u201c[i]n regards to this patient motorically, this seems to be normal function in that he has normal strength, tone, and cerebellar function.\u201d Dr. Stone also had noted that \u201c[t]hings appear to be very stable.\u201d The mistaken belief that Henry\u2019s condition had stabilized led the parties to enter a settlement in June 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">\u00b663 By 2004, however, Henry began to exhibit symptoms of a movement disorder. Dr. Allen M. Weinert, Jr., a physiatrist, or rehabilitation physician, examined Henry on June 30, 2004. Dr. Weinert\u2019s physical examination revealed a pill rolling tremor in Henry\u2019s left hand. Dr. Weinert also diagnosed left-sided Parkinsonism, \u201cmost likely as a late sequela of traumatic brain injury.\u201d Further examinations by Dr. Weinert revealed a worsening of Henry\u2019s Parkinsonism symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b664 Old Republic\u2019s representative, Judith Hosford, testified that she was aware of \u201cdeterioration\u201d in people who have suffered a brain injury. Hosfort added, however, that she \u201cdidn\u2019t expect Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Hosford further conceded that in 1994 she was unaware of any connection between head injuries and Parkinson\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s plus. Hosford did not contest Dr. Weinert\u2019s determination that having his skull crushed by the ore bucket had caused Henry\u2019s movement disorder. The WCC specifically found that Henry\u2019s movement disorder, diagnosed in 2004, \u201cis related to and caused by [Henry\u2019s] industrial injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b665 The Court takes issue with none of these findings. In fact, the Court concedes that \u201csubstantial credible evidence does support the WCC\u2019s finding that Henry\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease was caused by his 1988 injury ....\u201d \u00b6 22. The Court nevertheless rejects Henry\u2019s claim. The Court characterizes its decision as an adherence to the widely accepted rule that a failure to predict the future does not constitute a mistake of fact as contemplated by the mutual mistake doctrine. \u00b6 23. The Court notes that Henry did not suffer from Parkinson\u2019s symptoms at the time of the settlement in 1994. \u00b6 22. As a result, the Court concludes that \u201cthe parties\u2019 failure to predict Henry\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease was not a mutual mistake of fact.\u201d \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b666 The Court\u2019s conclusion rests upon the notion that the mistake must have occurred at the time of the 1994 settlement, and the mistake must relate to Henry\u2019s condition as it existed at that time. \u00b6 45. The source of the Court\u2019s reasoning, however, remains far from clear. The Court discusses at length other workers\u2019 compensation cases, but fails to distinguish Henry\u2019s claim from the factual scenarios <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>upon which the Court rescinded the settlement agreements. \u00b6\u00b6 31-38.</p>\n<p id=\"A1f\">\u00b667 For example, the Court reasons that the parties in <em>Kienas </em>were ignorant of the fact that the claimant\u2019s workplace accident <em>could </em>have aggravated his pre-existing cerebral palsy. \u00b6 32. In fact, the <em>Kienas </em>Court noted that neither party at the time of entering the settlement \u201cknew of the exact nature or extent of the injury suffered by claimant.\u201d <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont, at 329, 624 P.2d at 3. In other words, the treating medical providers had failed to diagnose fully the extent of the claimant\u2019s injuries. \u00b6 32. The Court in <em>Kienas </em>accepted as a mutual mistake the parties\u2019 ignorance of the possible aggravation, or the extent, of a known injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b668 Here, however, we do not face a question concerning the aggravation of a known injury. Henry\u2019s case presents the issue of an injury unknown to the parties at the time of the settlement. Dr. Weinert determined that having his skull crushed in by the ore bucket in 1988 had caused Henry\u2019s movement disorder that had remained latent until 2004. The WCC and this Court adopted this determination without objection from Old Republic. Dr. Weinert\u2019s 2004 examination demonstrates, at the very least, that the parties did not know in 1994 the \u201cexact nature or extent of the injury\u201d suffered by Henry. <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont, at 329, 624 P.2d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b669 Similarly, the Court characterizes the mutual mistake in <em>Weldele </em>as arising from the fact that the treating medical providers had failed to diagnose that the claimant suffered from thoracic outlet syndrome as a result of his industrial accident. \u00b6 33. The Court in <em>Weldele </em>relied upon the fact that doctors who had treated the claimant for thoracic outlet syndrome \u201cbelieved the syndrome was caused by his 1978 accident.\u201d <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 261, 738 P.2d at 1283. The WCC in this case, of course, specifically found that getting hit in the face with an ore bucket in 1988 had caused Henry\u2019s movement disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b670 The Court distinguishes <em>Kimes </em>on the basis that medical providers had failed to diagnose an injury that existed at the time of the settlement. \u00b6 34. The Court in <em>Kimes </em>relied on the fact that Kimes had a tear in his medial meniscus, and that this injury remained unknown to the parties at the time of the settlement. <em>Kimes, </em>233 Mont. at 177, 759 P.2d at 987. The Court in <em>Kimes </em>determined that a mutual mistake existed despite the fact that Kimes knew at the time of the settlement that potentially permanent problems existed with the injured knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b671 The Court in <em>Kimes </em>found support in the fact that Kimes\u2019s disability rating had increased as a result of the post-settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>surgery to remove a torn meniscus and that Kimes\u2019s prognosis now includes probable degenerative changes in the knee joint. The Court also cited the fact that Kimes now required pain medication and had been advised after the settlement not to return to his former line of work as a cook. <em>Kimes, </em>233 Mont. at 178, 759 P.2d at 988. Here, as found by the WCC, everyone knew that Henry suffered from cognitive disorders as a result of getting hit in the face with an ore bucket. Nobody, neither Henry\u2019s wife, nor Old Republic, nor any of the medical providers who had examined Henry, knew that Henry also suffered from a movement disorder as a result of getting hit in the face with an ore bucket. Furthermore, no party disputes that Henry\u2019s medical reports revealed a much worse condition today than at the time of the settlement agreement in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">\u00b672 The Court confines its analysis of <em>Wolfe </em>based on the fact that our review was limited to the question of whether the claimant\u2019s shoulder \u201cwas injured <em>at the time of his settlement agreement...\u201d </em>\u00b6 36 (emphasis in original). The Court in <em>Wolfe </em>determined that substantial evidence demonstrated that the \u201cclaimant\u2019s injury to his right shoulder was caused by his industrial accident....\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 231, 824 P.2d at 248. This Court omits the fact that the Court in <em>Wolfe </em>reached its determination based upon the claimant\u2019s clear and unequivocal testimony that he \u201csustained no trauma to his right shoulder either before or after his industrial injury.\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 231, 824 P.2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b673 Henry, too, sustained no trauma to his head either before or after his industrial accident in 1988. This elimination of other potential causes of Henry\u2019s movement disorder represents an important element in determining whether sufficient evidence supports the WCC\u2019s decision to rescind the settlement agreement. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 44. The WCC found, and this Court concedes, as it must, that getting hit in the face with an ore bucket in 1988 caused Henry\u2019s movement disorder. \u00b6 22. Like the claimant in <em>Wolfe, </em>Henry had sustained this injury at the time of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b674 The Court struggles to distinguish <em>South </em>from the situation presented here. The distinction that the Court attempts to draw between Henry\u2019s claim and the cited mutual mistakes regarding a claimant\u2019s condition at the time of the settlement-(\u201cignorance of the fact that claimant\u2019s workplace accident could have aggravated his preexisting cerebral palsy,\u201d \u00b6 32), (\u201cclaimant had thoracic outlet syndrome at the time of the settlement,\u201d \u00b6 33), (\u201cboth parties were ignorant of an injury that actually existed at the time of settlement,\u201d \u00b6 34); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>(\u201cclaimant\u2019s shoulder was injured at the time of his settlement,\u201d \u00b6 36)-founders in the face of <em>South. </em>In <em>South, </em>the parties \u201cwere not mistaken regarding the nature and extent of claimant\u2019s injury at the time the contract was formed.\u201d \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b675 The claimant in <em>South </em>aggravated her existing lower back injury while training to work as a massage therapist. <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 403, 913 P.2d at 236. Neither party in <em>South </em>suffered any illusions regarding the fact that the claimant had suffered a lower back injury. A doctor had advised the parties, however, that the claimant could work as a massage therapist despite her injury, and the parties settled the claim. The Court rescinded the settlement based upon the fact that the parties believed at the time of the settlement, erroneously as it turned out, that the claimant could work as a massage therapist. <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 404-05, 913 P.2d at 237. Similarly, a number of Henry\u2019s doctors also had advised the parties at the time of the settlement in 1994, erroneously as it also turned out, that Henry\u2019s condition had stabilized?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b676 The medical providers did not know \u201cof the exact nature or extent of the injury suffered by [Henry],\u201d as a result of getting hit in the face with an ore bucket. <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont. at 329, 624 P.2d at 3. Henry\u2019s previously undiagnosed movement disorder cannot be dismissed reasonably as a mere \u201cvariance in the symptom level.\u201d <em>Kimes, </em>233 Mont. at 178, 759 P.2d at 988. Various medical providers may have warned Kathy that the symptoms of Henry\u2019s cognitive disorders could vary over time. Nothing in the record indicates, however, that any medical providers, or Old Republic, for that matter, ever warned Kathy that an undiagnosed movement disorder could arise directly from Henry having gotten hit in the face with an ore bucket.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b677 The Court compounds its crabbed interpretation of Montana\u2019s mutual mistake cases by injecting into its analysis a series of mutual mistake cases outside the context of the workers\u2019 compensation system. The Court cites <em>United States v. Southwestern Elec. Co-op, Inc., </em>869 F.2d 310, 314 (7th Cir. 1989), for the proposition that a failure to predict the future cannot constitute a mutual mistake. \u00b6 28. The Court in <em>Southwestern Electric </em>examined an unexpected increase in the cost of building power plants that bore no relation to the wholesale power contract entered by the parties. This Court equates the unexpected increase in the cost of building power plants with Henry\u2019s unexpected development of a movement disorder. The unexpected increase in cost in <em>Southwestern Electric </em>had no relation to the parties\u2019 contract, whereas Dr. Weinert and the WCC determined that Henry\u2019s movement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>disorder arose as a direct result of the industrial accident that formed the basis for the parties\u2019 settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b678 The Court also cites <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Portlight, Inc., </em>188 F.3d 93, 97 (3rd Cir. 1999), for its reliance on two Pennsylvania cases where the courts held that \u201ca party who underestimates the future severity of her injuries will not be permitted to avoid the consequences of a settlement agreement based on mutual mistake.\u201d \u00b6 29. The court in <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>considered Conrail\u2019s attempt to rescind a settlement agreement with Portlight regarding a dispute over lost freight. Conrail argued that neither party had any knowledge at the time of the settlement agreement of a controlling limitation on Conrail\u2019s liability for lost goods. <em>Consolidated Rail </em>Corp., 188 F.3d at 95. Conrail filed an action to rescind the settlement agreement with Portlight based upon this claimed mutual mistake of fact. The district court dismissed the action on the pleadings. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>188 F.3d at 95. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the district court mistakenly had determined that Conrail\u2019s mutual mistake claim was not viable as a matter of law. <em>Consolidated Rail </em>Corp., 188 F.3d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b679 The Court finally relies upon the West Virginia supreme court\u2019s resolution of an alimony dispute in <em>Ryan v. Ryan, </em>640 S.E.2d 64 (W. Va. 2006). \u00b6 30. The wife in <em>Ryan </em>contended that both parties mistakenly had assumed that certain investments would generate enough income to avoid the need of the husband to pay alimony. The investments failed to generate sufficient income and the wife sought to rescind the property settlement agreement under the mutual mistake doctrine. <em>Ryan, </em>640 S.E.2d at 68. Not surprisingly, the court held that the parties\u2019 mistaken expectation regarding the amount of income that the investments would generate did not warrant rescinding the property settlement agreement. <em>Ryan, </em>640 S.E.2d at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag1\">\u00b680 <em>Ryan </em>simply stands for the reasonable proposition that the parties\u2019 expectation of future events cannot support a mutual mistake claim. The parties may have held unrealistic expectations at the time of the settlement regarding the amount of income that the investments would generate. The investment fund managers may have made mistakes after the parties\u2019 settlement and entirely unrelated to the parties\u2019 settlement that depressed the investments\u2019 returns. Here the parties knew at the time of the settlement that Henry suffered from cognitive impairments and pain as a result of getting hit in the face with an ore bucket. In contrast to the parties in <em>Ryan, </em>however, the parties did not know that Henry also would suffer from a movement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>disorder as a direct result of having his skull crushed by the ore bucket. Henry \u201csustained no trauma\u201d to his head \u201ceither before or after his industrial injury\u201d that would cause him to develop a movement disorder. <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 231, 824 P.2d at 248. The die had been cast in 1988 when the ore bucket struck Henry in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b681 Henry sustained injuries in 1988. The symptoms of some of Henry\u2019s injuries appeared immediately. Henry\u2019s medical providers identified additional injuries in the period following the accident through testing and from the appearance of new symptoms. Henry\u2019s medical providers failed to identify, however, the injury to Henry\u2019s brain that constituted the direct cause of his movement disorder until 2004, ten years after the parties had settled Henry\u2019s claim. The movement disorder constituted a \u201clate sequela of [a] traumatic brain injury\u201d that had occurred in 1988. Henry sustained no new injuries to his brain after the 1988 accident. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b682 For Henry, any cognitive deterioration or increase in pain could constitute a variance in the symptom level or an inaccurate expectation regarding a condition known at the time of the settlement. Both circumstances could fall outside the mutual mistake doctrine. In this case, on the other hand, we address an undetected injury that had occurred in 1988. The undetected injury remained unknown to the parties, however, at the time of the settlement in 1994. The Court rejects the notion that Henry\u2019s injury remained undetected at the time of the settlement. It argues that Henry\u2019s injury \u201cdid not exist\u201d at that time and thus \u201cthere was nothing there to detect.\u201d \u00b6 52. The Court\u2019s reasoning misapprehends the concept of injury as contemplated by Montana Worker\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b683 According to the Act, an \u201cinjury\u201d means, among other matters, an \u201cinternal or external physical harm to the body that is established by objective medical findings.\u201d Section 39-71-119(1)(a), MCA. Dr. Weinert diagnosed Henry\u2019s movement disorder as having been caused by Henry\u2019s industrial accident in 1988. Old Republic does not refute this objective medical finding. The WCC specifically found that Henry\u2019s movement disorder \u201cis related to and caused by [Henry\u2019s] industrial injury.\u201d The Court concedes that substantial credible evidence supports this finding. \u00b6 22. As in <em>Gamble, </em>our limited standard of review precludes us from reaching any other conclusion. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"A7F\">\u00b684 The Act further provides that an \u201cinjury\u201d is caused by an accident. Four separate components comprise an \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of the Act. Henry\u2019s claim satisfies all four. First, an accident is an unexpected traumatic incident. Section 39-71-119(2)(a), MCA. Henry certainly did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>not expect to suffer the trauma of getting hit in the face with an ore bucket. An accident must be identifiable by time and place of occurrence. Section 39-71-119(2)(b), MCA. Henry\u2019s accident occurred at his place of work for Blue Range Mining Co. on August 16,1988. An accident must be identified by \u201cmember or part of the body affected.\u201d Section 39-71-119(2)(c), MCA. Besides crushing Henry\u2019s skull, his accident injured his brain in a manner that caused immediate cognitive impairments and pain and later manifested itself in the form of a movement disorder. Finally, an accident must be caused by a specific event on a single day or during a single work shift. Section 39-71-119(2)(d), MCA. Dr. Weinert determined that getting hit in the face with an ore bucket on August 16, 1988, caused Henry\u2019s movement disorder. The WCC agreed and the Court concedes that substantial evidence supports the WCC\u2019s finding. \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b685 The consequences of Henry\u2019s tragic accident reverberate to this day. The consequences include the fact that Henry suffers from a severe movement disorder that no one contemplated at the time of the settlement in 1994. Now the Court forces Kathy and Henry to suffer the burden of the parties\u2019 ignorance regarding Henry\u2019s actual condition at the time of the settlement in 1994. Old Republic will reap the windfall of the parties\u2019 ignorance. The Court\u2019s mutual mistake analysis lumps injured workers with incomplete diagnoses with electric coops who underestimate the cost of building new power plants, <em>Southwestern Electric, </em>with railroads who fail to investigate liability agreements before settling claims, <em>Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>and with ex-spouses disappointed by bear markets, <em>Ryan. </em>Henry deserves the same treatment as the fragile massage therapist in <em>South, </em>as the retail stocker in <em>Gamble, </em>and as the other injured workers properly covered by the worker\u2019s compensation system for the full extent of their injuries.
