We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u00b62 On February 1, 2006, officers with the Havre Police Department responded to a report of disturbance in a residence. Upon arriving, they encountered an upset girl who stated that a man had tried to kill her. The girl identified Deserly as the assailant and indicated that he was still inside the residence. The officers then spoke with the girl\u2019s mother, who stated that Deserly had \u201cpulled a knife on my girl.\u201d The officers located Deserly in the bathroom, where he had apparently pulled a knife on a second individual. The officers eventually subdued Deserly and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">\u00b63 The State charged Deserly with two counts of felony assault with a weapon, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213(1), MCA (2005). A person convicted of this offense may be imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed 20 years. Section 45-5-213(2)(a), MCA. On August 21, 2006, Deserly and the State entered into a plea agreement, pursuant to which Deserly agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>with a weapon, and the State, in exchange, agreed to dismiss the second assault charge and forego a bail-jumping charge. In addition, the State agreed to recommend commitment to the Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) \u201cfor a period of ten (10) years,\u201d and Deserly acknowledged that he would be designated a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b64 The District Court accepted Deserly\u2019s guilty plea and ordered a presentence investigation. The court also scheduled a bond-reduction hearing, at which time the court released Deserly on a number of conditions. On September 5, 2006, the State filed a Petition for Revocation of Release, alleging that Deserly had violated the terms and conditions of his release. Meanwhile, the probation/parole officer preparing the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) determined that a commitment to the DOC \u201cfor a period of ten (10) years,\u201d which Deserly and the prosecutor had agreed to recommend at sentencing, was not allowed by statute. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(d)(i), MCA, \u201call but the first 5 years of [a] commitment to the department of corrections must be suspended.\u201d Thus, a commitment to the DOC \u201cfor a period of ten (10) years\u201d was not a sentence that the District Court could impose. Until the probation/parole officer filed the PSI on September 21,2006, it appears that the prosecutor, defense counsel, Deserly, and the trial judge were not cognizant of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b65 At the sentencing hearing on September 27, 2006, the State announced that it was withdrawing from the plea agreement based on Deserly\u2019s violation of the conditions of his release. At the same time, Deserly stated that he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea. As he later explained in his written motion to withdraw his guilty plea, he had \u201centered into the plea bargain unaware of the fact that he could not get the benefit of the bargain - a sentence the Court could not impose under Montana law.\u201d He argued on this basis that good cause existed for the District Court to permit the withdrawal of his guilty plea. The court denied Deserly\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b66 The District Court entered judgment on January 3, 2007. The court adjudged Deserly guilty of felony assault with a weapon and designated him a persistent felony offender. The court sentenced Deserly to the Montana State Prison for a period of fifteen years with five years suspended. Deserly now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b67 Deserly sets forth three issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>1. Did the District Court err in denying Deserly\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">2. Was the factual basis for Deserly\u2019s guilty plea sufficient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">3. Did Deserly receive ineffective assistance of counsel because his lawyer advised him to enter into a plea bargain that contemplated an illegal sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b68 Because we reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment under Issue 1, we do not address Issues 2 or 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea de novo. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 17, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6 17. The question of whether a plea was entered voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 8, 341 Mont. 166, \u00b6 8, 176 P.3d 1057, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Deserly\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">\u00b611  At any time before judgment or within one year after judgment becomes final, a trial court may, \u201cfor good cause shown,\u201d permit a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty substituted. Section 46-16-105(2), MCA (2005). \u201cGood cause,\u201d as used in \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA, includes the minimal constitutional requirement that a guilty plea be voluntary and intelligent. <em>See State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17, 326 Mont. 214, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17, 108 P.3d 500, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17. Furthermore, we determined in <em>Lone Elk </em>that \u201cgood cause\u201d may include criteria in addition to voluntariness. <em>See Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 19 (\u201cInvoluntariness and discovery of new exculpatory evidence constitute good causes for withdrawal of a plea under \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA (2001), but others may exist.\u201d); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA (referring to \u201ca claim of innocence . .. supported by evidence of a fundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">\u00b612 We need not consider any additional criteria for \u201cgood cause\u201d in the case at hand since the issue here is the voluntariness of Deserly\u2019s plea. In <em>Lone Elk, </em>we observed that this Court had been following a voluntariness standard that was <em>less </em>protective of individual rights than the United States Constitution. <em>See Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 22 (discussing <em>State v. Miller, </em>248 Mont. 194, 810 P.2d 308 (1991)). We thus overruled that standard, under which a plea of guilty would be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>involuntary \u201c \u2018where it appears that the defendant was laboring under such a <em>strong inducement, fundamental mistake, or serious mental condition </em>that the possibility exists he may have pled guilty to a crime of which he is innocent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>248 Mont. at 197, 810 P.2d at 310) (emphasis in <em>Miller). </em>In its stead, we adopted the following standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1472 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">[A] plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel, must stand unless induced by threats (or promises to discontinue improper harassment), misrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises), or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper as having no proper relationship to the prosecutor\u2019s business (e.g. bribes). [Brackets in original, internal quotation marks omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><em>See Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21 (summarizing this standard).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AW0\">\u00b613 In adopting the <em>Brady </em>standard, we also jettisoned the balancing test articulated in <em>State v. Huttinger, </em>182 Mont. 50, 595 P.2d 363 (1979). <em>See Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 23. Under that test, we balanced the following three factors to determine whether good cause existed to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea: (1) whether the district court adequately interrogated the defendant to determine his understanding of his plea; (2) whether the defendant promptly filed his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>withdraw the prior plea; and (3) whether the defendant\u2019s plea was the result of a plea bargain in which the prosecutor dismissed another charge. <em>See Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Huttinger, </em>182 Mont. at 54, 595 P.2d at 366. This test, we noted, \u201cneither lists all the factors [bearing on voluntariness], nor are all the factors it lists necessary.\u201d <em>See Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 14. Yet, although we \u201crelegate[d] that test to history,\u201d we nevertheless stated that \u201ctwo of the criteria from the <em>Huttinger </em>test (the adequacy of colloquy and the existence of plea bargain) bear on the question of voluntariness.\u201d <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>accord State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 26, 341 Mont. 166, \u00b6 26, 176 P.3d 1057, \u00b6 26. We also stated that \u201cnumerous other case-specific considerations may also bear on that question.\u201d <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 23. One consideration, for example, is the defendant\u2019s mental competency to enter a plea, including any medication he or she is taking. <em>See Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b614 In the case at hand, Deserly contends that his guilty plea was not voluntary because he was induced into entering the plea \u201cby a promise that could not be performed.\u201d Although the plea agreement stated that the sentencing judge \u201cis not bound\u201d by the parties\u2019 sentencing recommendation <em>(see </em>\u00a7 46-12-211(1)(c), MCA), and although the judge also advised Deserly of this fact before he entered his guilty plea, Deserly still understood that the sentence agreed upon by the parties and set out in the agreement was at least <em>possible. </em>In other words, he pleaded guilty with the expectation that the sentence not only <em>would </em>be recommended by the prosecutor and defense counsel, but also <em>could </em>be imposed by the District Court; yet, it was subsequently determined that the sentence was illegal and could not be imposed. On this basis, Deserly maintains that his guilty plea was involuntary and that he should have been allowed to withdraw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b615 We agree that Deserly should have been allowed to withdraw his plea. A defendant\u2019s plea is not voluntary if \u201cthe court, the prosecutor, his own counsel, or some other party, induced the plea, however slightly, by... misrepresentation, including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises.\u201d <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing Brady, 397 U.S. at 753, 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1471-72). Here, Deserly was induced, at least in part, by the prospect of being able to receive the sentence that he and the prosecutor had negotiated and agreed to recommend. Yet, that sentence, because it was an illegal sentence, could not have been imposed by the District Court-a fact which came to the parties\u2019 attention <em>after </em>Deserly had entered his plea. It is true that, except in circumstances not at issue here, sentencing courts are not bound by plea agreements and that Deserly was advised of this fact. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the critical issue here is the <em>inducement, </em>and it is not enough to say that Deserly knew he might not receive the specific sentence recommended by the parties. At the time he entered his guilty plea, it was reasonable for Deserly to expect that the District Court could at least consider, if not actually impose, the recommended sentence. This expectation informs the question of inducement. Notably, once he learned that the sentence was not statutorily authorized, he promptly moved the court to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b616  Our conclusion is consistent with the general rule that a defendant, who has entered a guilty plea pursuant to a plea bargain which contemplates a particular sentence, is entitled to withdraw the plea if it is subsequently determined that the sentence is illegal or unauthorized. <em>See </em>Christopher Vaeth, <em>Guilty Plea as Affected by Fact That Sentence Contemplated by Plea Bargain Is Subsequently Determined to Be Illegal or Unauthorized, </em>87 A.L.R.4th 384, 388 (1991). In <em>United States v. Greatwalker, </em>285 F.3d 727 (8th Cir. 2002), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">There can be no plea bargain to an illegal sentence. Even when a defendant, prosecutor, and court agree on a sentence, the court cannot give the sentence effect if it is not authorized by law. Thus, when a defendant has entered a plea bargain contemplating an illegal sentence, the defendant is generally entitled to withdraw the guilty plea. Because the plea bargain is based on a promise the trial court lacks authority to fulfill, and the defendant was induced to plead guilty by that promise, plea withdrawal is necessary to return the parties to their initial positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arl\"><em>Greatwalker, </em>285 F.3d at 729-30 (citations omitted). Similarly, <em>in State v. Brown, </em>606 N.W.2d 670 (Minn. 2000), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">A guilty plea cannot be induced by unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises, including a promise of a sentence unauthorized by law. Where a sentence is illegal and therefore invalidly imposed, the voluntariness of the plea is drawn into question. But a plea agreement calling for an unauthorized sentence cannot be specifically enforced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>Brown, </em>606 N.W.2d at 674 (citations omitted). Along these same lines, the court observed in <em>Ford v. State, </em>69 P.3d 407 (Wyo. 2003), that \u201c[i]f the prosecutor\u2019s performance of the terms of a plea agreement is not possible, a withdrawal of the plea is the correct remedy.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>cf. Thomas v. State, </em>327 So. 2d 63, 63-64 (Fla. 1st Dist. App. 1976) (holding that the defendants had bargained not just for the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmere act of recommending probation,\u201d but also for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>court\u2019s either imposing that sentence or allowing them to withdraw their guilty pleas). Other courts are in accord with these general principles. <em>See e.g. People v. Ramirez, </em>39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 374, 384 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1995) (\u201cSince defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding he would receive a seven-year sentence [which is not authorized], he must be given the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea, if he chooses to do so.\u201d); <em>Shelton v. State, </em>739 So. 2d 1235, 1237 (Fla. 4th Dist. App. 1999) (\u201c[A] defendant cannot be bound to an agreement to accept an illegal sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b617 The State asserts that Deserly\u2019s claim is \u201cmoot.\u201d The State opines that Deserly only wanted to withdraw his guilty plea because the State decided to withdraw from the plea agreement, thereby preventing him from receiving the agreed-upon sentence. According to the State, because it was entitled to withdraw from the plea agreement, \u201cDeserly cannot now argue that his guilty plea should be withdrawn due to the illegal recommendation because once he violated his conditions of release, no Agreement existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b618 That the parties were no longer bound by the plea agreement once the State withdrew from it is inapposite. The issue in this case is whether, <em>at the time Deserly entered his guilty plea, </em>he was induced to do so by any of the circumstances contemplated by <em>Brady </em>or <em>Lone Elk. </em>What occurred subsequent to Deserly\u2019s change of plea does not determine whether the plea was voluntary at the time it was entered. Thus, the fact that the State later withdrew from the plea agreement has no bearing on whether Deserly\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b619 The State also maintains that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that shows Deserly was laboring under strong inducement or fundamental mistake.\u201d As stated above in \u00b6 12, however, this is not the correct standard for determining the voluntariness of a plea. Where,' as in the case at hand, a defendant is induced, \u201chowever slightly,\u201d by a misrepresentation, including an unfulfilled or unfulfillable promise, the plea is not voluntary. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b620  Lastly, the State observes that the parties were not aware that the recommended sentence was illegal until the author of the PSI pointed out that it was not authorized by statute. It is of no consequence, however, that the recommended sentence was not an <em>intentional </em>misrepresentation. Deserly was induced to plead guilty by what amounts to an 'unfulfillable promise: that the District Court could consider and impose the sentence which the prosecutor agreed to recommend. Accordingly, his plea was not voluntary, and good cause existed for the District Court to permit him to withdraw his guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b621 Before concluding, it is necessary to acknowledge that there are exceptions to the general rule discussed above, i.e., the rule that a defendant is entitled to withdraw his guilty plea if he entered the plea pursuant to a plea bargain which contemplated a sentence subsequently determined to be illegal or unauthorized. As described in <em>Greatwalker:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Withdrawal of the plea may be unnecessary when the agreed-on sentence exceeds the sentence authorized by law and the government accepts a sentence reduced to the legal term, when the sentence can be reconciled with the plea agreement or otherwise corrected to give the defendant the benefit of the bargain, or when the defendant is willing to accept a legal sentence in place of the promised one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\"><em>Greatwalker, </em>285 F.3d at 730. One justification for these exceptions is the concern that, should the defendant withdraw his plea and stand trial, \u201cthe State may no longer be able to produce witnesses or other evidence necessary to proceed with a prosecution.\u201d Vaeth, 87 A.L.R.4th at 388. Another rationale is the fact that the defendant may not wish to withdraw his plea. <em>See </em>Vaeth, 87 A.L.R.4th at 388, 397-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b622 While it may be appropriate to adopt and apply these exceptions in some future case, we conclude that doing so here is unwarranted. Given that the State has already withdrawn from the parties\u2019 plea agreement, it is appropriate simply to return the parties to their initial positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00b623  Deserly was induced to enter into the plea agreement by a misrepresentation-albeit, one which was unintentional. We conclude, therefore, that Deserly\u2019s guilty plea was not voluntary. Involuntariness constitutes good cause for withdrawal of a plea under \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 19. Accordingly, Deserly is entitled to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u00b624  The District Court erred in denying Deserly\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand this matter to the court with instructions to grant Deserly\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">\u00b625 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> We note here that in overruling the <em>Miller </em>standard, we did not identify all of the cases in which that standard had been set out as the applicable law. As a result, the standard has appeared in subsequent cases.
