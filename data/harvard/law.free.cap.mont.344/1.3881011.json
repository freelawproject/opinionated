Marbut (Marbut) appeal from an order of the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, denying Montana Sports Shooting Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b62 Montana Sports Shooting Association presents the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) did not violate the statutory prohibition against political activity under \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">\u00b64 The Montana Sports Shooting Association is a Montana non-profit corporation. Gary Marbut is the Montana Sports Shooting Association\u2019s president. We will refer in this opinion to Montana Sports Shooting Association and Gary Marbut collectively as \u201cMSSA\u201d for purposes of clarity. MSSA asserts that it lobbies the Montana Legislature to protect its members\u2019 rights and interests. MSSA alleges that FWP\u2019s competing lobbying efforts often conflict with its own lobbying efforts. MSSA filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and a request for preliminary and permanent injunction in the District Court. MSSA requested a declaratory judgment that FWP may not lobby the Legislature, may not appear before it as either a proponent or opponent of proposed legislation, or otherwise act to influence legislative decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b65 MSSA relied on the language in \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, concerning the political activity of FWP employees, that provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-13\">While retaining the right to vote as he may please and to express his opinions on all political questions, no employee of [FWP] may use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the results thereof or for the purpose of coercing or influencing the political actions of any person or body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">MSSA argued that this prohibition on FWP employee political activity includes lobbying the Legislature or its members and appearing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>legislative committees to represent FWP\u2019s position on proposed legislation. FWP responded that the Legislature intended \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, to cover only political elections, like the general prohibition on public employees\u2019 political activity under \u00a7 2-2-121, MCA, and \u00a7 13-35-226, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b66 MSSAmoved for summaryjudgment. MSSA supported the motion with an affidavit submitted by Marbut. Marbut\u2019s affidavit noted specific instances in which FWP employees had testified in support of a proposed senate bill and otherwise had attempted to influence the Legislature. FWP admitted that it routinely lobbies the Legislature and that its employees appear at legislative hearings. MSSA contended that the plain language of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, expressly placed stricter limitations on FWP political activity than the general limitations placed on the public employees of other executive agencies. FWP countered that canons of statutory construction and long-standing FWP practice support its contention that \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, does not result in stricter limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b67 The District Court examined the history of statutory limitations on FWP political activity. The court examined the meaning of the word \u201cpolitics\u201d and its treatment in other jurisdictions. The court also examined the operation of other Montana and federal statutes limiting executive political activity. The court concluded that MSSA\u2019s interpretation would restrict too narrowly FWP\u2019s internal and external activities. The District Court denied MSSA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Although not stated expressly, the court\u2019s order, in effect, granted summaryjudgment to FWP. Neither party asserted that any genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment. Consistent with this interpretation, FWP filed a notice of entry of judgment. MSSA appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b68 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, using the criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Farmers Co-op. Ass\u2019n v. Amsden, LLC, </em>2007 MT 286, \u00b6 24, 339 Mont. 445, \u00b6 24, 171 P.3d 690, \u00b6 24. A district court properly grants a motion for summary judgment when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Farmers </em>Co-op., \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that FWP did not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>violate the statutory prohibition against political activity under \u00a787-1-204, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b610 The parties disagree over the proper interpretation of the term \u201cpolitical actions\u201d under \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. MSSA argues that \u201cpolitical actions\u201d clearly and unambiguously applies to the activities of FWP and its employees before the Legislature. MSSA cites to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>for the proposition that \u201cpolitical actions\u201d broadly means \u201cof or relating to the conduct of government.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1196 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004). MSSA asserts that we must construe the statute\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccoercing or influencing the political actions of any person or body\u201d as prohibiting FWP from lobbying the Legislature, appearing before it as a proponent or opponent of legislation, or otherwise influencing the decisions of legislative members. FWP contends that \u201cpolitical actions\u201d relates only to political elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b611 We interpret a statute first by looking to its plain language. <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 178, \u00b6 11,152 P.3d 1288, \u00b6 11. We construe a statute by reading and interpreting the statute as a whole, \u201cwithout isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature.\u201d <em>City of Great Falls v. Morris, </em>2006 MT 93, \u00b6 19, 332 Mont. 85, \u00b6 19, 134 P.3d 692, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). We will not interpret the statute further if the language is clear and unambiguous. <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11. We look to legislative intent if the language is not clear and unambiguous, and give effect to the legislative will. <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11. Statutory construction should not lead to absurd results if a reasonable interpretation can avoid it. <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11. We must harmonize statutes relating to the same subject, as much as possible, giving effect to each. <em>Yellowstone Federal Credit Union v. Daniels, </em>2008 MT 111, \u00b6 18, 342 Mont. 451, \u00b6 18, 181 P.3d 595, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b612 Section 87-1-204, MCA, provides no clear or unambiguous meaning for the phrase \u201cpolitical actions.\u201d The statute first addresses an FWP employee\u2019s attempts to influence or interfere with elections in the course of their employment with FWP. Section 87-1-204, MCA. The language at issue, contained in the statute\u2019s final clause, prohibits FWP employees from using their \u201cofficial authority or influence ... for the purpose of coercing or influencing the political actions of any person or body.\u201d Section 87-1-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b613 MSSA urges this Court to construe the modifier \u201cpolitical\u201d to connote all activities \u201cof or relating to the conduct of government.\u201d MSSA argues that the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cpolitical actions\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>includes lobbying and testifying before the Legislature, as well as attempts to influence individual legislators. In fact, MSSA reads \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, as prohibiting any FWP employee from influencing any action relating to the conduct of any governmental body. We decline to adopt MSSA\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b614 MSSA\u2019s broad interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, would conflict directly with the numerous statutory obligations imposed on FWT. For example, in 1987, more than sixty years after the Legislature enacted the initial version of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, the Legislature commanded that FWT \u201cshall <em>report to the fish and game committee of each house </em>of the legislature concerning upland game bird enhancement activities undertaken ... together <em>with any recommendations </em>concerning the operation of the program.\u201d Section 87-1-250, MCA (emphasis added). MSSA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, would bar FWT employees from fulfilling this statutory duty. More recently, the Legislature in 1995 enacted \u00a7 87-1-272, MCA. This statute, likewise, requires FWT to \u201cpresent a detailed report to each regular session of the legislature ...\u201d regarding the progress of the future fisheries improvement program. Section 87-1-272, MCA (1995). MSSA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, once again, would prohibit FWT from fulfilling its statutory obligations to report to the legislature with this information. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 87-5-107, MCA (authorizing FWP to propose specific legislation for the purpose of expanding the State\u2019s list of endangered species).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b615 We must presume in construing these statutes that the Legislature intended to make some change in existing law by passing it. <em>Cantwell v. Geiger, </em>228 Mont. 330, 333-34, 742 P.2d 468, 470 (1987). MSSA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, would render these later-enacted statutes idle acts. We must presume that the Legislature would not pass useless or meaningless legislation. <em>Oster v. Valley County, </em>2006 MT 180, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 76, \u00b6 17, 140 P.3d 1079, \u00b6 17. \u00b616 MSSA\u2019s argument regarding political actions would not be limited, moreover, to a particular branch of government, or a particular kind of governmental conduct. MSSA\u2019s interpretation would prevent FWT and its employees from fulfilling the agency\u2019s statutory obligations to cooperate and make agreements with other state agencies, federal agencies, tribes, and state and local governments. For example, \u00a7 87-1-279, MCA, provides that FWT \u201cshall <em>promote </em>the use of publicly owned land...\u201d for shooting ranges and \u201cmay negotiate with federal, state, and local agencies <em>to encourage </em>land trades ....\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 87-1-216, MCA, provides that FWT \u201cshall consult and cooperate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the department of livestock...\u201d regarding bison management. Finally, \u00a7 87-l-201(9)(a)(iii), MCA, provides that FWP \u201cshall ... <em>request </em>that land management agencies open public lands and public roads ...\u201d when implementing an elk management plan. (Emphasis added). MSSA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, would bar FWP from fulfilling its extensive list of statutory obligations to influence the decisions of other governmental organizations. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7 87-1-257, MCA (requiring FWP to work cooperatively with state, local, private, tribal, and federal organizations in administering the river restoration program); \u00a7 87-5-504, MCA (FWP shall provide recommendations to state, county, municipal, or other Montana agencies to eliminate adverse effects to fish and game habitat when reviewing project applications); \u00a7 23-2-641, MCA (requiring the attorney general, upon the request of FWP, to sue to recover snowmobiling penalties).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b617 Indeed, MSSA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpolitical actions,\u201d when read together with the statute\u2019s application to <em>any </em>body, would prohibit FWP employees from influencing any action within FWP itself. This interpretation would eliminate FWP\u2019s ability to make policy decisions and carry out executive branch mandates. MSSA\u2019s interpretation would limit FWP to conducting only the most basic, clerical functions. This interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, would render FWP unable to perform its statutorily mandated obligations. We decline to adopt an interpretation that leads to such an absurd result. <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b618 The Dissent similarly urges an untenable construction of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. The Dissent contends that, at the very least, \u201cinfluencing the political action\u201d includes \u201clobbying the Legislature, appearing before it as a proponent or opponent of legislation, and otherwise influencing the decisions of individual legislators ....\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 20. The Dissent provides no outer limit, however, to its plain meaning construction of the phrase \u201cinfluencing the political actions.\u201d The Dissent\u2019s interpretation provides no \u201cat most\u201d stopping point that defines the scope of restrictions on FWP employees set forth in \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b619 The Dissent concedes that the employees of executive agencies need to lobby and testify before the Legislature. Dissent, \u00b6 19. The Dissent acknowledges that construing \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, as a prohibition on FWP\u2019s ability to influence legislative members makes no sense. Dissent, \u00b6 19. The Dissent nevertheless would construe the statute in a manner that precludes FWP from fulfilling its necessary and statutorily mandated obligations to report and make recommendations to the legislature. The Dissent\u2019s plain language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>construction of the statute leads to absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b620 We must construe \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, in a manner that avoids the absurd result that stems from the interpretation urged by MSSA and the Dissent. <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11. In an effort to harmonize \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, with statutes relating to the same subject, we examine the statute and its terms in their legislative context and attempt to give effect to the legislative will. <em>Yellowstone Federal Credit Union, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>City of Great Falls, </em>\u00b6 19. The structure and language within \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, provide no clear guidance, however, regarding the proper construction of \u201cpolitical actions.\u201d The statute\u2019s last clause does not limit inherently the phrase \u201cpolitical actions\u201d to any particular kind of government conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b621 Section 87-1-204, MCA, is a unique statute. No other Montana statute or case refers to a public employee\u2019s ability to \u201ccoerce\u201d or \u201cinfluence\u201d \u201cpolitical actions.\u201d Montana law nowhere else singles out the political activity of a specific executive agency. Section 13-35-226, MCA, sets forth general limitations that govern the political activity of other agency employees. Montana law prohibits public employees, in the course of their employment, from soliciting support for, or opposition to, a political candidate or issue, or lobbying on behalf of another organization. Sections 13-35-226(4), 2-2-121, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b622 The Legislature has amended \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, several times since it was originally codified at \u00a7 3658, RCM, in 1921. The statute always has contained, however, the essential components at issue. Section 3658 originally provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">While retaining the right to vote as he may please, and to express his opinions on all political questions, no Fish and Game Warden or Deputy shall take any active part in political management or political campaigns, nor shall he use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election, or effecting the results, thereof, or <em>for the purpose of coercing or influencing the political actions of any person or body. </em>Section 3658, RCM (1921) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u00b623 This Court examined the 1921 version of the statute in <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. 425, 40 P.2d 995 (1935). <em>Sullivan </em>concerned outgoing Governor Erickson\u2019s appointment of several fish and game commissioners. Erickson appointed four men to the commission in 1932 to serve in staggered terms through 1936. <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 434-35, 40 P.2d at 996. Erickson resigned and F.H. Cooney replaced him as governor in 1933. <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 435, 40 P.2d at 996. Governor Cooney revoked Erickson\u2019s appointments and removed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>appointees in 1934. Governor Cooney appointed his own candidates. Both Erickson\u2019s and Cooney\u2019s appointees claimed to be the rightful office-holders. <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 436, 40 P.2d at 996-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b624 The sole issue before the Court in <em>Sullivan </em>concerned whether the Governor had authority to remove Erickson\u2019s appointees without notice and opportunity to be heard in their defense. <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 437, 40 P.2d at 997. The Court looked in part to legislative intent to reach its conclusion. The Court examined the history of FWP and the statutes that governed the agency. <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 442, 40 P.2d at 999-1000. The Court determined that the Legislature had enacted \u00a7 3658, RCM, to ensure that FWP is \u201cat all times ... [made up of] a majority of experienced members-a continuing body removed from political control and manipulation.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 443, 40 P.2d at 1000. The Court concluded that the statute \u201cclearly denotes the intention of the Legislature to remove [FWP] from the control of the Governor ....\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 443, 40 P.2d at 1000. The District Court in this case determined, in light of <em>Sullivan, </em>that the Legislature intended \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, to remove FWP and its employees from the influence of \u201cpartisan politics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b625 We previously have looked to other jurisdictions having similar statutes to guide our interpretation in the absence of sufficient Montana law on an issue. <em>E.g. In re Custody and Parental Rights of A.P., </em>2007 MT 297, \u00b6 24, 340 Mont. 39, \u00b6 24, 172 P.3d 105, \u00b6 24. The U.S. Supreme Court has encountered language similar to the language in \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, in decisions upholding federal and state restrictions on employees\u2019 political activities. The Court upheld an early Congressional provision that prohibited federal employees from giving a \u201cthing of value for political purposes.\u201d <em>Ex Parte Curtis, </em>106 U.S. 371, 1 S. Ct. 381 (1882).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b626 Congress enacted the Civil Service Act of 1883 a year after <em>Curtis, </em>and, in language nearly identical to that of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, prohibited employees from using their \u201cofficial authority or influence to coerce the political action of any person or body.\u201d Civil Service Act of 1883, ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403, 404 (1883). The Court cited the Civil Service Act as part of a movement \u201cagainst the mixing of partisan politics ...\u201d when it reaffirmed the constitutionality of the Hatch Act, Congress\u2019s most comprehensive regulation of the political activities of federal employees. <em>U.S. Civil Service Com\u2019n v. National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. 548, 557-58, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 2886-87 (1973). The Court determined in <em>Letter Carriers </em>that the congressional and executive regulations of federal employees targeted partisan political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>activities. <em>Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. at 564, 93 S. Ct. at 2889-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b627 The Court, on the same day that it decided <em>Letter Carriers, </em>upheld an Oklahoma statute modeled after the Hatch Act, in <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 93 S. Ct. 2908 (1973). The Court upheld Oklahoma\u2019s prohibition on employee \u201cassessments, subscriptions, or contributions for any ... political purpose.\u201d <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 603 n. 1, 93 S. Ct. at 2911 n. 1. The Court upheld the Oklahoma statute insofar as it forbid partisan political associations. The Court took additional support from the Oklahoma Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the statute as restricting only \u201cclearly partisan political activity.\u201d <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 617, 93 S. Ct. at 2918-19.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">\u00b628 The Court determined that Congress intended restrictions on the political activities of federal employees to refer to employee involvement in partisan politics. <em>Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. at 564, 93 S. Ct. at 2889-90. The Court emphasized in <em>Letter Carriers </em>the fact that Congress had exempted from regulation \u201cnonpartisan political activity ... not identified with national or state political parties ... including issues with respect to constitutional amendments, referendums, approval of municipal ordinances, and the like.\u201d <em>Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. at 575-76, 93 S. Ct. at 2895-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b629 <em>Letter Carriers </em>and <em>Broadrick </em>comport with this Court\u2019s determination in <em>Sullivan </em>that the Legislature enacted \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, to \u201cremoveG [FWP] from political control and manipulation.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 443, 40 P.2d at 1000. The Comb\u2019s construction of the federal and state restrictions on employees\u2019 political activities supports the District Court\u2019s decision to limit the phrase \u201cpolitical actions\u201d to partisan politics. Limiting the statute\u2019s reach to partisan politics also avoids the absurd result logically emanating from the broad definition of \u201cpolitical actions\u201d urged by MSSA and the Dissent. <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b630 [1] We conclude that the statutory prohibition on using \u201cofficial authority or influence ... for the purpose of coercing or influencing the political actions of any person or body,\u201d under \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, applies to FWP employees only in the partisan political sense. <em>Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. at 443, 40 P.2d at 1001. The District Court properly determined that \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, does not prohibit FWP employees from lobbying the Legislature or appearing before it as proponents or opponents of legislation. <em>Farmers Co-op, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"ApK\">\u00b631 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b33-9\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AdG5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00b632 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b633 Section 87-1-204, MCA, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">Political activity of employees. While retaining the right to vote as he may please and to express his opinions on all political questions, no employee of the department [of fish, wildlife, and parks] may use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the results thereof or for the purpose of coercing or influencing the political actions of any person or body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b634 In construing this statutory language, I begin with three fundamental canons of statutory construction. First, \u201c[i]n construing a statute, this Court will look first to the language used. If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and there is nothing left for the Court to construe.\u201d <em>Mont. Contractors\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Dept. of Highways, </em>220 Mont. 392, 394, 715 P.2d 1056, 1058 (1986); <em>accord Miller v. District Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 38, 337 Mont. 488, \u00b6 38, 162 P.3d 121, \u00b6 38. Second, in the construction of a statute, this Court\u2019s job is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Lastly \u2014 and this principle follows from the other two-we may not create an ambiguity where none exists, nor may we rewrite a statute, by ignoring clear and unambiguous language, in order to accomplish what we may feel is a more sensible or palatable purpose. <em>See State ex rel. Palagi v. Regan, </em>113 Mont. 343, 351-52, 126 P.2d 818, 824 (1942); <em>cf. Heggem v. Capitol Indem. </em>Corp., 2007 MT 74, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 429, \u00b6 22, 154 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u00b635 With these principles in mind, \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, clearly and unambiguously prohibits the following: use by an FWP employee of his or her official authority or influence (1) \u201cfor the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the results thereof\u2019 or (2) \u201cfor the purpose of coercing or influencing the political actions of any person or body.\u201d At issue in this case is the second clause, i.e., the prohibition on \u201ccoercing or influencing the political actions of any person or body.\u201d MSSA contends that this clause prohibits FWP employees from lobbying the Legislature, appearing before it as a proponent or opponent of legislation, and otherwise influencing the decisions of individual legislators.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u00b636 It is patently obvious that each of these activities falls under the rubric of \u201cinfluencing the political actions of any person or body.\u201d This conclusion is supported by the commonly understood meanings of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>relevant terms. \u201cAction\u201d is \u201c[t]he process of doing something\u201d or \u201c[a] thing done.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>31 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004). \u201cPolitical\u201d means \u201c[pjertaining to politics; of or relating to the conduct of government.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1196. Correspondingly, a \u201cpolitical action\u201d is something done in relation to politics or the conduct of government-e.g., voting for or against a particular measure. \u201cLobby\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">1. To talk with a legislator, sometimes in a luxurious setting, in an attempt to <em>influence </em>the legislator\u2019s vote &lt;she routinely lobbies for tort reform in the state legislatures 2. To <em>support or oppose </em>(a measure) by working to <em>influence </em>a legislator\u2019s vote &lt;the organization lobbied the bill through the Senates 3. To try to <em>influence </em>(a decision-maker) &lt;the lawyer lobbied the judge for a favorable rulings</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>956 (emphases added, citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b637 Notably, the definition of \u201clobby\u201d is synonymous with the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, namely, \u201cinfluencing the political actions of any person or body.\u201d It cannot reasonably be argued that \u201ca legislator\u2019s vote\u201d on a measure is not a \u201cpolitical action.\u201d Accordingly, MSSA is correct that \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, prohibits FWP from lobbying the Legislature, appearing before it as a proponent or opponent of legislation, or otherwise influencing the decisions of individual legislators.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b638 The Court tacitly concedes this point, acknowledging that \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, \u201cdoes not limit inherently the phrase \u2018political actions\u2019 to any particular kind of government conduct.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. Nevertheless, apparently not willing to accept the clear mandate of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, the Court decides that the statute does not quite mean what it says. The Court\u2019s approach in this regard is reminiscent of the exchange between Alice and Humpty Dumpty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by \u2018glory,\u2019 \u201d Alice said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously, \u201cOf course you don\u2019t-till I tell you. I meant \u2018there\u2019s a nice knock-down argument for you\u2019!\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">\u201cBut \u2018glorj^ doesn\u2019t mean \u2018a nice knock-down argument,\u2019 \u201d Alice objected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">\u201cWhen <em>I </em>use a word,\u201d Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, \u201cit means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">Lewis Carroll, <em>Alice Through the Looking-Glass </em>128 (Candlewick Press 2005) (originally published in 1871 as <em>Through the Looking-Glass and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>What Alice Found There). </em>Reflecting a similar philosophy, the Court proclaims that \u201cpolitical actions\u201d means just what this Court chooses it to mean: \u201cpartisan politics,\u201d which we are told does not include lobbying the Legislature or appearing before it as proponents or opponents of legislation. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b639 To justify its approach, the Court recites a parade of horribles that supposedly would ensue under MSSA\u2019s plain-language interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. Specifically, the Court opines that under the plain language of the statute, FWP and its employees are prevented from fulfilling various statutory obligations and from conducting anything more than \u201cthe most basic, clerical functions.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16 17. Even if this is true, however, the Court\u2019s assumption that we may rewrite a statute because we think that the statute has created an \u201cuntenable\u201d situation is incorrect. The task of rectifying legislatively created \u201cabsurdities\u201d falls on the Legislature, not us.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b640 In any event, the Court\u2019s fear that \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, prevents FWP from fulfilling its statutory obligations is unfounded. We have before us a statute that broadly prohibits FWP employees from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of influencing the political actions of any person or body. Section 87-1-204, MCA. The Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has found a number of statutes that arguably are inconsistent with \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14,16. In such circumstances, our approach is dictated by the following well-settled canons of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b641 First, the Legislature is presumed to act with deliberation and with full knowledge of all existing laws on a subject; as a result, it is further presumed that the Legislature does not intend to interfere with or abrogate a former law relating to the same matter unless the repugnancy between the two is irreconcilable. <em>Ross v. City of Great Falls, </em>1998 MT 276, \u00b6 17, 291 Mont. 377, \u00b6 17, 967 P.2d 1103, \u00b6 17. Second, it is our duty to reconcile statutes if it appears possible to do so, consistent with legislative intent. <em>Fletcher v. Paige, </em>124 Mont. 114, 119, 220 P.2d 484, 487 (1950). Third, when there is a statute dealing with a subject in general and comprehensive terms, and another statute dealing with a part of the same subject in a more minute and definite way, the two should be read together and harmonized, as much as possible, giving effect to each. <em>State ex rel. Boone v. Tullock, </em>72 Mont. 482, 486, 234 P. 277, 278-79 (1925); <em>Schuman v. Bestrom, </em>214 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Mont. 410, 415, 693 P.2d 536, 538-39 (1985); <em>Oster v. Valley County, </em>2006 MT 180, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 76, \u00b6 17, 140 P.3d 1079, \u00b6 17. Lastly, where a specific statute conflicts with a general statute and cannot be harmonized to give effect to both, the specific statute controls over the general statute \u201cto the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d <em>State v. Langan, </em>151 Mont. 558, 564, 445 P.2d 565, 568 (1968); <em>accord Matter of Williams, </em>219 Mont. 6, 9, 709 P.2d 1008, 1010 (1985); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1-2-102, MCA (\u201cWhen a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former, so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Special Road Dist. No. 8 v. Mills, </em>81 Mont. 86, 98, 261 P. 885, 890 (1927) (\u201cWhere the special statute is later, it will be regarded as an exception to or qualification of the prior general one.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b642 The Court points out that FWP is required by \u00a7\u00a7 87-1-250 and - 272, MCA, to report on specific matters to the Legislature, Opinion, \u00b6 14; that FWP is authorized by \u00a7 87-5-107, MCA, to propose legislation related to a specific subject matter (namely, endangered species), Opinion, \u00b6 14; that FWP is authorized or required by \u00a7\u00a7 87-1-279,216, and -257, MCA, to negotiate, consult, or cooperate with specific agencies on specific matters, Opinion, \u00b6 16; and that FWP is authorized or required by \u00a7\u00a7 871201(9)(a)(iii), 87-5-504, and 23-2-641, MCA, to make specific requests of, or provide specific recommendations to, specific agencies concerning specific matters, Opinion, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b643 Whereas \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, deals with the political activities of FWP employees in general and comprehensive terms, the foregoing statutes cited by the Court deal with a part of the same subject but in a more minute and definite way. All of these statutes must be read together and harmonized, as much as possible, giving effect to each. <em>Boone, </em>72 Mont. at 486, 234 P. at 278-79; <em>Schuman, </em>214 Mont. at 415, 693 P.2d at 538-39; <em>Oster, </em>\u00b6 17. To the extent one of the specific statutes cannot be harmonized with the general statute (\u00a7 87-1-204, MCA), the specific statute controls, but <em>only to the extent of the inconsistency. Langan, </em>151 Mont. at 564, 445 P.2d at 568; <em>Williams, </em>219 Mont. at 9, 709 P.2d at 1010. Applying these rules, I disagree with the Court\u2019s assertion that the statutory scheme created by the Legislature is \u201cabsurd.\u201d Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19, 20. The scheme prohibits FWP employees from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of influencing the political actions of any person or body, except as authorized or required by statutes such as those the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>found during its perusal of the Montana Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b644 Rather than attempt to harmonize these statutes, the Court decides simply to insert the word \u201cpartisan\u201d into the clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. Opinion, \u00b6 30. Such an approach flies directly in the face of our duty \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained [in the statute], not to insert what has been omitted ....\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. This rule of construction clearly instructs that this Court may not insert the word \u201cpartisan\u201d into \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. The fact that the statute may prohibit a wide range of activities-both partisan and nonpartisan-does not establish that the statute is \u201cabsurd.\u201d Rather, it establishes that the Legislature intended the statute\u2019s reach to be broad and include all such activities, except as otherwise provided in more specific statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u00b645 Notably, the Court fails to explain what conduct by an FWP employee would constitute \u201cuse [of] his official authority or influence ... for the purpose of coercing or influencing the [partisan] political actions of any person or body.\u201d However, the Court\u2019s suggestion that the legislative process is anything <em>but </em>partisan defies the reality of Montana\u2019s Legislature. It is common knowledge that legislators generally vote along party lines in support of, or in opposition to, statutes drafted to implement the planks in the parties\u2019 respective platforms. Similarly, the suggestion that lobbyists-of whatever ilk-do not play to this partisan polarization is specious. Consequently, even under the Court\u2019s remanufactured version of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA-which applies only to \u201cpartisan\u201d political actions-the legislative activitiesengaged in by FWP and challenged in this case by MSSA are prohibited; and the District Court, therefore, erred in granting judgment in favor of FWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b646 The Court offers one additional justification for its approach-namely, that \u00a7 87 1-204, MCA, \u201cprovides no clear or unambiguous meaning for the phrase \u2018political actions.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 12. Yet, ambiguity presupposes that the language is susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings. <em>See Mary J. Baker Revoc. Trust v. Cenex Harvest, </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 20, 338 Mont. 41, \u00b6 20, 164 P.3d 851, \u00b6 20; <em>Missoula High School Legal Defense Ass'n v. Superintendent of Public Instruction, </em>196 Mont. 106, 108-12, 637 P.2d 1188, 1189-92 (1981). No such reasonable but conflicting meanings are demonstrated in the Court\u2019s Opinion. Indeed, the Court does not even attempt to demonstrate that the term \u201cpolitical actions\u201d is susceptible to more than one reasonable but conflicting meaning-possibly due to the fact that nothing about this term is ambiguous. For this reason, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Court\u2019s resort to other sources in order to define \u201cpolitical actions\u201d is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b647 In this regard, the Court relies on <em>State ex rel. Nagle v. Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. 425, 40 P.2d 995 (1935) (per curiam), to explain the meaning of \u201cpolitical actions.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 29. However, <em>Nagle </em>did not involve the issue of whether lobbying and appearing before the Legislature was \u201cpolitical action\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. Rather, <em>Nagle </em>involved a quo warranto proceeding to determine which one of two appointed individuals was lawfully entitled to sit on the State Fish and Game Commission. <em>See Nagle, </em>98 Mont. at 434-37, 40 P.2d at 996-97. The sole issue presented was whether the Governor had authority to remove Sullivan without notice and an opportunity to be heard in his defense. <em>Nagle, </em>98 Mont. at 437, 40 P.2d at 997. Construing \u00a7\u00a7 3651 and 3658, RCM (1921),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court stated simply that the intention of the Legislature was \u201cto remove the Fish and Game Department from the control of the Governor and to create a commission entirely divorced from political activity, and of which there will be, at all times, a majority of experienced members-a continuing body removed from political control and manipulation.\u201d <em>Nagle, </em>98 Mont, at 443, 40 P.2d at 1000. The Court did not define what \u201cpolitical actions\u201d means, much less conclude that this term did not encompass lobbying and appearing before the Legislature. <em>Nagle </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">\u00b648 I do agree with the Court that \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, is \u201cunique.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21. The statute is also very clear in prohibiting FWP employees from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of \u201cinfluencing the political actions of any person or body.\u201d Accordingly, it is not necessary to resort to statutes dealing with general limitations governing the political activity of other agency employees or to cases dealing with federal or other states\u2019 statutes. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 21,25-28. As we stated in <em>Small v. Board of Trustees, </em>2001 MT 181, 306 Mont. 199, 31 P.3d 358, \u201cMontana\u2019s teacher tenure statute is not ambiguous. Thus, appeal to policy arguments or decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting different tenure statutes to aid our interpretation of Montana\u2019s tenure statute is unnecessary.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Small, </em>\u00b6 22. Likewise, \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, is not ambiguous. Thus, appeal to policy arguments and decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting different political-activity statutes to aid our interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b649 That said, in light of the Court\u2019s reliance on decisions from other jurisdictions, I note that in Slate <em>ex rel. Green v. City of Cleveland, </em>33 N.E.2d 35 (Ohio App. 1940), the court considered a prohibition similar to \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. The prohibition stated: \u201cNo person in the service of the city shall use his official authority to influence or coerce the political action of any person or body ....\u201d <em>Green, </em>33 N.E.2d at 36. Asking itself, \u201cWhat is the meaning of the words \u2018political action\u2019 in this sentence?\u201d the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">It seems clear to us that whenever a voter casts his ballot, such an action is \u201cpolitical action,\u201d on his part, whether he votes on candidates or for or against some issue submitted on the ballot. Therefore,'if any city official should threaten with a loss of his job any employee refusing to vote for or against a special levy, bond issue or charter amendment, such a threat would constitute within the meaning of the above provision an attempt to use the official authority of such official \u201cto influence or coerce the political action\u201d of the employee so threatened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em>Green, </em>33 N.E.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b650 The Ohio court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpolitical action\u201d is no less persuasive than the various interpretations offered by this Court in \u00b6\u00b6 25-28 of the Opinion. <em>Green </em>supports the proposition that whenever a legislator casts his or her vote with respect to some issue before the Legislature, such an action is a \u201cpolitical action,\u201d and if any FWP employee uses his official authority or influence for the purpose of influencing that vote, then the employee is engaged in the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u00b651 Does \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, make sense? Probably not. Of necessity, the employees of Executive Branch agencies need to lobby and appear before the Legislature on budgetary and legislative issues affecting their operations and the public. No one is denying that. Rather, the point here is that amending or \u201cfixing\u201d \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, is the Legislature\u2019s job. It is not this Court\u2019s province to interpret the statute in a way that allows what it specifically prohibits, in order to achieve a more palatable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u00b652 In sum, lobbying the Legislature, appearing before it as a proponent or opponent of legislation, and otherwise influencing the decisions of individual legislators are included within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>unambiguous proscriptions of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA. Accordingly, because the plain language of \u00a7 87-1-204, MCA, includes the activities of FWP that are challenged by MSSA in this appeal, we should stop there and reverse the District Court\u2019s decision. We need not and should not judicially create an ambiguity where none exists so as to avoid what the statute clearly prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b653 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> This theory relied on by the Court in reaching its holding was not argued by FWP in its appellate briefs.
