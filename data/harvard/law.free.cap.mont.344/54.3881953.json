We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u00b62 The Board raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in holding the statute of limitations barred the Board\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in granting Empire\u2019s motion for summary judgment because a genuine issue of material fact existed concerning whether Empire ever denied a claim brought by its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"A-2\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred when it denied the Board\u2019s motion to engage in discovery following conversion of Empire\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss to a M. R. Civ. P. 56 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">\u00b66 Because our resolution of the first issue is dispositive, we need not discuss the other issues raised by Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">\u00b67 The Montana Petroleum Tank Release Compensation Board is a state environmental advisory board whose purpose is to protect \u201cthe public health and safety and the environment by encouraging prompt cleanup of petroleum releases.\u201d <em>Safeway, Inc. v. Mont. Petroleum Release Compen. Bd., </em>281 Mont. 189, 195, 931 P.2d 1327, 1330 (1997) (citing \u00a7 75-11-301(5)(a), MCA). Among other things, the Board administers the Petroleum Tank Release Cleanup Fund. Owners and operators of petroleum storage tanks contribute to the Fund, which, in turn, provides reimbursement for specified cleanup costs when their underground tanks leak or spill. When the Board reimburses owners or operators for their cleanup costs, it may be entitled to subrogate against any insurance carriers whose policies covered the owners or operators for spills or leaks from their petroleum storage tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">\u00b68 This is the latest in a series of cases brought by the Board seeking payment from insurance companies to reimburse it for payments it made to petroleum distributors and retailers. In each of the cases, including our opinion in <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Compen. Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>v. Fed. Serv., </em>2008 MT 194, 344 Mont. 45, 185 P.3d 998, Supreme Court cause number 06-0837, the Board reimbursed the owners of the facilities for the costs associated with cleanup of petroleum spills.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b69 Between January 1, 1986, and March 27, 1991, Empire provided insurance coverage to Neil and Flora Paxson (Paxsons), who operated a gas station in Jordan doing business as \u201cSix D\u2019s.\u201d Empire also provided coverage to the Paxsons\u2019 successor, John Currey (Currey), who owned and operated the Six D\u2019s business for one year beginning September 9, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b610 In September, 1991, while Currey owned Six D\u2019s, he discovered that petroleum had leaked into the surrounding soil and groundwater from underground storage tanks and from surface spills during fueling operations at Six D\u2019s. Under Montana law, Currey was obligated to investigate and remediate the spills. Six D\u2019s complied and paid all necessary cleanup costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b611 The Board reimbursed Six D\u2019s for its costs of the cleanup. According to the District Court, through July 11, 2006, the Board had reimbursed Six D\u2019s approximately $216,528. Pursuant to Admin. R. M. 17.58.332(5), upon payment to Six D\u2019s for cleanup costs, the Board obtained the right to seek reimbursement from Six D\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b612 According to Empire, Currey sent a claim to them in February, 1992. According to the Board, Empire failed to act on the claim and almost a year later, on February 9, 1993, the Montana State Auditor opened a file on the case in response to a complaint of non-payment made by Currey\u2019s lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u00b613 On March 5,1993, Empire wrote two separate letters. In the first letter, addressed to the Montana Department of Insurance, Empire disclaimed coverage, stating: \u201cWe have determined that there is no coverage for the damages, fines, or costs ... under any policy issued to the client, John Currey, d/b/a 6 Ds, Inc., ....\u201d The letter was \u201ccc-ed\u201d to Currey\u2019s attorney. However, in the second letter addressed directly to Currey\u2019s attorney, Empire stated, \u201cWe are continuing to research our coverage, particularly under prior policies issued by this company to Mr. and Mrs. Paxson.\u201d Empire made no payment to Currey.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u00b614 No more happened in reference to this claim for over nine years, until August 2002, when, according to the Board, it first learned that it was eligible for reimbursement of cleanup costs from Empire. The Board tendered a claim to Empire on August 14, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u00b615 On August 6, 2003, a year after filing its demand for reimbursement against Empire, the Board filed suit. Empire denied the Board\u2019s claim a year later, on August 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">\u00b616 The Board moved for partial summary judgment in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Court and Empire moved to dismiss the Board\u2019s complaint pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The District Court referred to matters outside the pleadings in considering Empire\u2019s motion to dismiss and thus treated the motion as one for summary judgment. The District Court granted Empire\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the Board\u2019s summary judgment motion. The Board now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same criteria as the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). <em>Oster v. Valley Cnty., </em>2006 MT 180, \u00b6 9, 333 Mont. 76, \u00b6 9, 140 P.3d 1079, \u00b6 9. Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b618 By virtue of Admin. R. M. 17.58.332(5), the Board is Six D\u2019s subrogee. As subrogee, the Board stands in the shoes of the subrogor. <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Compen. Bd. v. Crumley\u2019s, Inc., </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 61, 341 Mont. 33, \u00b6 61, 174 P.3d 948, \u00b6 61. Thus, the Board is subject to the same statute of limitations as Six D\u2019s. <em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. Glassing, </em>269 Mont. 76, 81, 887 P.2d 218, 221 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u00b619 The Board argues that pursuant to footnote 4 in <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Compen. Bd. v. Capitol Indemnity, </em>2006 MT 133, 332 Mont. 352, 137 P.3d 522, the statute of limitations for its indemnification claim against Empire was tolled until Empire denied the claim. Footnote 4 in <em>Capitol Indemnity </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">As a practical matter, for the insured to bring an action for payment under an insurance policy, the insurer would first need to deny payment. Thus upon the submission of a claim by the insured party, the statute of limitations is tolled until the claim is denied by the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\u00b620  In granting summary judgment to Empire, the District Court followed our holding in <em>Capitol Indemnity, </em>wherein we concluded that the statute of limitations for an indemnity claim by the Board began to run when the claim had accrued-e.g., when Currey discovered the leak - not when the insurer denied the claim. The basis for our holding in <em>Capitol Indemnity </em>was that if the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the insurer had denied the claim it would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the purpose of a statute of limitations and the plaintiff could sue at any time in the future simply by delaying presentation of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>claim. <em>Capitol Indemnity, </em>\u00b6 18. This holding is affirmed in <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Compen. Bd. v. Fed. Serv., </em>2008 MT 194, 344 Mont. 45, 185 P.3d 998, Supreme Court cause number 06-0837.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b621 However, according to the Board, in this case the District Court was required to apply the above-quoted footnote 4 from <em>Capitol Indemnity. </em>The Board argues that footnote 4 constitutes a statement of the law to the effect that the statute of limitations was tolled because although a claim had been made against the insurer, Empire, Empire had not yet denied it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b622 Footnote 4 constitutes <em>obiter dicta. </em>Such dicta is not persuasive authority for deciding an issue before this Court. <em>State v. Marble, </em>2005 MT 208, \u00b6 26, 328 Mont. 223, \u00b6 26, 119 P.3d 88, \u00b6 26. Indeed, footnote 4 conflicts with the holding of <em>Capitol Indemnity-Ihat </em>the statute of limitations for an indemnification claim begins to run from the time the actual claim accrues. The Board asks us to apply dicta from a footnote which directly conflicts with the actual holding of the case. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b623 The Board argues that if a period of limitations commences when a claim accrues and the limitations period is not tolled during the time between when a claim is made and when it is denied, insurers would be encouraged to drag out claims as long as possible until the period of limitations expires, thereby preventing a prospective plaintiff from filing suit. However, the Board cites no authority which says that an insured may not file suit until a claim is denied. Control over when to commence an action to recover under an insurance policy is in the hands of the insured, who may file a complaint at virtually any time within the requisite period of limitations. In the event an insurer attempts to prolong the claim review process, the onus is on the insured to file a complaint before the statute of limitations runs.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b624  The District Court correctly applied our holding in <em>Capitol Indemnity </em>that the period of limitations began when the claim accrued. Thus, the Board\u2019s complaint, which was filed in August, 2003-almost 12 years after Currey discovered the leak and the claim accrued-was barred by the eight-year statute of limitations for a contract action. Because this issue is dispositive, we need not reach the other issues the Board raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
