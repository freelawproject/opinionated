The District Court granted the motion. Jeanette Swanson appeals.

Do \u00a7 72-2-813(7) and \u00a7 72-2-813(10), MCA, read together, create a statutory presumption that conclusively establishes that Jeanette acted \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">\u00b66 Jeanette Swanson (\u201cJeanette\u201d) shot and killed two of her children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Louisa Ann and Swen Paul. Immediately afterwards, Jeanette called 911 to report that she shot the children. Jeanette was charged with two counts of deliberate homicide, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102(1), MCA. She pled guilty to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b67 As part of the pre-sentencing investigation report (PSI), Jeanette underwent a series of psychological examinations. All of the doctors agreed that she was suffering from a severe mental disorder; specifically, she was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which ran in her family, as well as agnosia, depression, and psychosis. The doctors also agreed that she had been suffering from this mental illness for quite some time-well before the crimes were committed. Jeanette suffered from the delusion that someone in the Augusta area wanted to harm her children. In the days before the shootings, her hallucinations and delusions intensified. Jeanette believed she had to shoot the children in order to protect them from this impending and imminent harm. She believed that by shooting them, she was sending them to heaven where they would be safe. Since the time of the shooting, Jeanette has consistently maintained that she killed the children to protect them.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b68 At the sentencing hearing, the State recommended that Jeanette be sentenced under \u00a7 46-14-312, MCA. This section provides that defendants suffering from a mental disease or defect may be committed to the custody of the director of the department of public health and human services for treatment in lieu of imprisonment. The State conceded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">[T]he evidence before the Court is that we have really no choice but to believe she was mentally ill at the time these crimes were committed, and that as a product of that mental illness she was unable either to appreciate the criminality of her actions or to conform her conduct to the requirements of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The District Court agreed, and for each count of deliberate homicide, committed Jeanette to the custody of the director of the department of public health and human services for placement and treatment at the state hospital for the term of her natural life.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b69 Gene Swanson (\u201cGene\u201d), the children\u2019s father, served as the personal representative for Louisa Ann\u2019s and Swen Paul\u2019s estates. Gene petitioned the District Court to forfeit Jeanette\u2019s interest in the children\u2019s estates, pursuant to \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA. Section 72-2-813(2), MCA, provides that one who \u201cfeloniously and intentionally kills\u201d another may not inherit from the decedent\u2019s estate. The District Court granted the petition and found that as a matter of law Jeanette had forfeited her rights of inheritance to the children\u2019s estates. Jeanette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>appeals this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute for correctness. <em>In re Estate of Kuralt, </em>2001 MT 153, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 73, \u00b6 11, 30 P.3d 345, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in concluding, as a matter of law, that Jeanette forfeited her right to inherit from the children\u2019s estates under \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b612 Gene invokes \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA, Montana\u2019s \u201cslayer statute,\u201d to prevent Jeanette from inheriting or otherwise benefiting from her deceased children\u2019s estates. Section 72-2-813(2), MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">An individual who feloniously and intentionally kills the decedent forfeits all benefits under this chapter with respect to the decedent\u2019s estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, and omitted spouse\u2019s or child\u2019s share, a homestead allowance, exempt property, and a family allowance. If the decedent died intestate, the decedent\u2019s intestate estate passes as if the killer disclaimed the killer\u2019s intestate share.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">This section is part of the Uniform Probate Code, substantially revised in 1990, and adopted by the Legislature in 1991. Section 72-2-813(2), MCA; Unif. Probate Code \u00a7 2-803, 8 U.L.A. 211 (1998). This statute codifies the long-standing common law principle that a killer should not profit from his own wrongdoing. <em>See e.g. In re Marriage of Kotecki, </em>2000 MT 254, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 460, \u00b6 14, 10 P.3d 828, \u00b6 14. Section 72-2-813(2), MCA, provides that a slayer who \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u201d kills another may not take from the decedent\u2019s estate. Thus, the statute would not apply to accidental manslaughter. Similarly, the plain language of the statute excludes slayers who lack the requisite intent and homicides that are not \u201cfelonious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">\u00b613 On appeal, Jeanette argues that the District Court erred as a matter of law by giving conclusive effect to her guilty plea in the previous criminal case and by extending the presumption found in \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, beyond the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">\u00b614 <em>1. Does the fact that Jeanette pled guilty to the charges of deliberate homicide in a previous criminal case conclusively establish that she killed the children \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">\u00b615 The District Court\u2019s order summarily denied Jeanette the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>inherit by treating her guilty plea as conclusive evidence that she \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u201d killed her children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">To be convicted of deliberate homicide, the person must have purposely or knowingly caused the death of another human being. Section 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA.... The language in these statutes could not be more clear. Jeanette Swanson pled guilty to deliberate homicide and admitted that she purposely killed her children. The conviction is conclusive. She, therefore, as a matter of law has forfeited her rights of inheritance and benefits related to her children\u2019s estates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The District Court\u2019s conclusion effectively precluded Jeanette from litigating two issues in this civil case: whether she acted with the requisite intent, and whether the killings were felonious. However, the District Court neglected to analyze whether it was appropriate to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel to either issue in this case. \u00b616 We have previously considered whether a guilty plea in a prior criminal case has preclusive effect on a subsequent civil suit, and have stated that \u201c[t]he law in Montana on this issue could not be more clear.\u201d <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Liss, </em>2000 MT 380, \u00b6 46, 303 Mont. 519, \u00b6 46, 16 P.3d 399, \u00b6 46. We only recognize the applicability of collateral estoppel where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">(1) [T]he issue decided in the prior adjudication is identical with the one presented in the action in question;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">(2) there was a final judgment on the merits; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">(3) the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\"><em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 46. In <em>Safeco, </em>as in the instant case, the District Court gave conclusive effect to a guilty plea without \u201cexpressly addressing the issue of collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\u00b617 <em>Safeco </em>is squarely on point -with the case at bar. In <em>Safeco, </em>we considered the issue of whether a <em>nolo contendere </em>guilty plea in a criminal case collaterally estopped the defendant from litigating the issue of intent in a subsequent civil case. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 45. The defendant Liss had been charged with aggravated assault for shooting a woman. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 9. Liss entered a <em>nolo contendere </em>guilty plea, all the while maintaining she shot the woman by accident. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 9. Safeco argued that Liss\u2019s guilty plea prevented her from claiming that the shooting was unintentional in the subsequent civil suit. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"A2M\">\u00b618 We emphatically rejected Safeco\u2019s argument, and held that \u201ca guilty plea as a matter of law fails the second prong of the three-part [collateral estoppel] test, because a guilty plea does not constitute a judgment on the merit.... Liss\u2019s <em>nolo contendere </em>guilty plea to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>aggravated assault carries no collateral estoppel effect in the civil proceedings.... Whether Liss acted intentionally or committed an illegal act has therefore not been determined as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b619 Our holding in <em>Safeco </em>is not distinguishable, as Gene suggests, simply because it concerns insurance benefits rather than an inheritance. The identical issue is presented in both <em>Safeco </em>and the instant case: whether a guilty plea in a prior criminal case precludes the accused from litigating the issue of intent in a subsequent civil case. Nothing in our analysis of this issue is specific or limited to insurance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b620 Nor is our holding in <em>Safeco </em>limited to cases involving <em>nolo contendere </em>pleas. In <em>Safeco, </em>we cited then-Justice Traynor\u2019s opinion in <em>Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. v. Dominion Ins. Co., </em>375 P.2d 439 (Cal. 1962), to explain the public policy underlying this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">When a plea of guilty has been entered in the prior action, no issues have been drawn into controversy by a full presentation of the case. It may reflect only a compromise or a belief that paying a fine is more advantageous than litigation. Considerations of fairness to civil litigants and regard for the expeditious administration of criminal justice combine to prohibit the application of collateral estoppel against a party who, having pleaded guilty to a criminal charge, seeks for the first time to litigate his cause in a civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\"><em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 49 (citing <em>Teitelbaum, </em>375 P.2d at 441 (citations and internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b621  The importance of the distinction Chief Justice Traynor draws between a guilty plea and a guilty verdict cannot be overstated. When a criminal defendant enters a plea of guilty to the charge of deliberate homicide, the issues of whether a killer acted with intent and whether the killing was felonious are not \u201cestablished\u201d through litigation. By contrast, when a defendant undergoes a bench or jury trial, these elements are proven beyond a reasonable doubt. A guilty verdict establishes these elements, but a guilty plea does not. Thus, a guilty verdict has a conclusive effect for the purposes of the slayer statute that a guilty plea does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\u00b622  This distinction between a guilty verdict and a guilty plea is recognized by the Legislature in \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZd\">After all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction <em>establishing criminal accountability </em>for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively establishes the convicted individual as the decedent\u2019s killer for purposes of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Section 72-2-813(7), MCA (emphasis added). The Legislature has defined \u201cconviction\u201d to include either a plea or a verdict from a jury or court of competent jurisdiction. Section 46-1-202(7), MCA. However, not all convictions satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA. Eather, the Legislature has specifically stated that only a \u201cjudgment of conviction <em>establishing criminal accountability\u201d </em>may conclusively establish the convicted individual as the killer for the purposes of the slayer statute. Section 72-2-813(7), MCA (emphasis added). The language in this section distinguishes between a conviction obtained through a plea, and a conviction obtained by a verdict after a jury or bench trial. As discussed above, a guilty plea does not establish, in an evidentiary sense, criminal accountability for a felonious and intentional killing. As a result, under the plain language of \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, a guilty plea does not conclusively establish that a killer acted feloniously and intentionally for the purposes of the slayer statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b623 The case at bar illustrates the purpose of distinguishing a guilty plea from a guilty verdict. As Chief Justice Traynor noted, <em>Teitelbaum, </em>375 P.2d at 441, it is difficult to discern a defendant\u2019s motive for pleading guilty. Jeanette pled guilty to the shootings, but all the while maintained that she intended to protect the children, not to hurt them. Jeanette\u2019s guilty plea may have been a strategic decision, or perhaps even a choice to spare her family the added trauma of a public trial. Due to the fact that she entered a guilty plea, the issues of whether she intended to kill the children and whether the killings were felonious were never fully examined at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b624  In sum, we conclude that there has not been a trial resulting in a final judgment on the merits of whether Jeanette acted \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u2019 when she shot her children. Thus, her guilty plea in the previous criminal action does not preclude her from raising these issues in the instant civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b625 <em>2. Do \u00a7 72-2-813(7) and \u00a7 72-2-813(10), MCA, read together, create a statutory presumption that conclusively establishes that Jeanette acted \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b626 Gene next argues that the statutory presumption found in \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, conclusively establishes that Jeanette acted feloniously and intentionally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">After all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively establishes the convicted individual as the decedent\u2019s killer for purposes of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Section 72-2-813(7), MCA. He reaches this interpretation of the statute by reading \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, together with \u00a7 72-2-813(10), MCA. Section 72-2-813(10), MCA, provides that \u201c[f]or the purposes of this section, a felonious and intentional killing includes a deliberate homicide as defined in 45-5-102 and a mitigated deliberate homicide as defined in 45-5-103.\u201d Gene argues that, read together, these subsections establish a conclusive presumption that one who has been convicted of deliberate homicide is presumed to have acted feloniously and intentionally for the purposes of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b627 We disagree. The Official Comment to \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, clearly expresses the purpose of the section\u2019s presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">Subsection (g) [72-2-813(7)] leaves no doubt that, for purposes of this section, a killing can be \u201cfelonious and intentional,\u201d whether or not the killer has actually been convicted in a criminal prosecution. Under subsection (g) [72-2-813(7)], after all right to appeal has been exhausted, <em>a judgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively establishes the conflicted individual as the decedent\u2019s killer for purposes of this section. </em>Acquittal, however, does not preclude the acquitted individual from being regarded as the decedent\u2019s killer for purposes of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ato\">Section 72-2-813(7), MCAcmt. (emphasis added). The section\u2019s purpose is to establish that a killer may be barred civilly from inheriting under this statute even if he or she was acquitted in a criminal proceeding. \u00b628 In doing so, the Legislature has expressly rejected the logic of some of our sister states, who have held that the acquittal of a killer bars the application of the slayer statute. <em>See e.g. Turner v. Estate of Turner, </em>454 N.E.2d 1247 (Ind. App. 1 Dist. 1983). Instead, the Legislature has set forth a clear statutory directive: if there has been a judgment of conviction <em>which establishes criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent, </em>the convicted individual is presumed to be the killer for the purposes of this section. In the absence of such a conviction, \u201cthe court, upon the petition of an interested person, shall determine whether, under the preponderance of evidence standard, the individual would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent.\u201d Section 72-2-813(7), MCA. The \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, presumption only pertains to those cases where, as a result of litigation, a conviction has established a killer\u2019s criminal responsibility for the felonious and intentional killing of another. If a killer\u2019s criminal accountability for these issues has not yet been established through litigation, the section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>explicitly directs the courts to consider the issues of intent and whether the killing was felonious in a civil proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b629 Similarly, the purpose of the statutory caveat found in \u00a7 72-2-813(10), MCA, is to distinguish Montana\u2019s slayer statute from those in other states, where courts have narrowly interpreted slayer statutes to apply only where the homicide is deliberate and unmitigated. <em>See e.g. Quick v. United Benefit Life Ins. Co., </em>213 S.E.2d 563, 568 (N.C. 1975) (noting that the slayer statute does not apply to justifiable or excusable homicide). The plain language of our statute provides that a \u201cfelonious and intentional killing\u201d may include both a deliberate homicide and a mitigated deliberate homicide. Section 72-2-813(10), MCA. Gene, however, apparently interprets the statute to mean that all deliberate homicides are \u201cfelonious and intentional killings\u201d for the purposes of the slayer statute. Nothing in the plain language of the statute supports this reading, and Gene has not advanced any other authority in support of his interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b630 Gene\u2019s strained interpretation of this statute implicates the identical arguments raised and rejected in Part 1 of this opinion, and for that reason, must fail. As discussed above, we conclude that \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, makes a purposeful distinction between homicide convictions based on guilty pleas and those based on jury or bench trial verdicts. When, as here, a defendant enters a plea of guilty, the issues of whether the killing was \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201cfelonious\u201d have not been tried and established. Nothing in \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, or \u00a7 72-2-813(10), MCA, read together or alone, would permit a court to presume that a guilty plea to a deliberate homicide charge conclusively establishes that the killing was \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201cfelonious\u201d for the purposes of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b631 On remand, Gene has the burden of proving that Jeanette acted \u201cintentionally\u201d and \u201cfeloniously\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA. We take this opportunity to note the difference between the term \u201cfeloniously\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA, and the statutory definition of a felony set forth in \u00a7 45-2-101(23), MCA. Section 45-2-101(23), MCA, defines a \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201can offense in which the sentence imposed upon conviction is death or imprisonment in a state prison for a term exceeding 1 year.\u201d Section 45-2-101(23), MCA. Technically, Jeanette was not sentenced to any prison time. If courts were to measure whether a killer acted \u201cfeloniously\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA, by whether or not the killer\u2019s sentence comported with the definition of \u201cfelony\u201d found in \u00a7 45-2-101(23), MCA, then the slayer statute could not be applied to any killer who was not sentenced to death or imprisoned for more than a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u00b632 Other states to grapple with this question have noted that, in the specific context of the slayer statutes, the term \u201cfeloniously\u201d has been historically construed as a synonym for \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cwrongful.\u201d <em>See e.g. Matter of Estates of </em>Josephson, 297 N.W.2d 444, 448 (N.D. 1980). Several of our sister states have refused to presume that a killer acted \u201cfeloniously\u201d simply because the homicide was statutorily classified as a felony. <em>See e.g. Ford v. Ford, </em>512 A.2d 389, 398 (Md. 1986) (\u201cFundamentally, a killing is \u2018felonious\u2019 when the homicide is a felony. In the frame of reference of the slayer\u2019s rule, however, the legislative policy regarding criminal responsibility leads to a qualification of this meaning. We believe that for a homicide to be \u2018felonious\u2019 in the context of the slayer\u2019s rule, it must be a felony for which the killer is criminally responsible under Maryland\u2019s criminal insanity test. Therefore, if a killer is \u2018insane\u2019 at the time he killed, the killing is not felonious in the contemplation of the slayer\u2019s rule. If the killing is not felonious, even though it may be intentional, the rule does not apply.\u201d); <em>Dowdell v. Bell, </em>477 P.2d 170, 172 (Wyo. 1970) (\u201cSuch contention by reliance on comparative definitions of words which are not truly analogous avoids coming to grips with the real problem and cannot be accepted.\u201d); <em>Rosenberger v. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>176 F. Supp. 379, 382 (D. Kan. 1959), <em>modified by, </em>182 F. Supp. 633 (D. Kan. 1960) (\u201cIt is obvious from the many definitions attributed to the word \u2018feloniously\u2019 that the manner in which a court defines it in one instance will not control the definition to be applied in a different situation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A4nf\">\u00b633  Like Montana, North Dakota\u2019s slayer statute is derived from \u00a7 2-803 of the Uniform Probate Code. N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 30.1-10-03 (2007); Unif. Probate Code \u00a7 2-803, 8 U.L.A. 211 (1998). In a recent decision interpreting \u00a7 2-803(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the North Dakota Supreme Court explicitly rejected the notion that the term \u201cfeloniously\u201d encompassed only those intentional acts statutorily designated as felonies. <em>Matter of Estates of Josephsons, </em>297 N.W.2d at 448. Instead the court defined the term more broadly, and held that in the specific context of the slayer statute, the term \u201cfeloniously\u201d \u201crefers to a killing that is wrongful, that is without legal excuse or justification.\u201d <em>Matter of Estates of Josephsons, </em>297 N.W.2d at 448. This definition of \u201cfeloniously\u201d comports with the construction we have given to the term in prior cases. <em>See e.g. State v. Souhrada, </em>122 Mont. 377, 385, 204 P.2d 792, 797 (1949) (defining \u201cfelonious\u201d to mean \u201can act which is done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>with a mind bent on doing wrong\u201d) (citing <em>State v. Rechnitz, </em>20 Mont. 488, 52 P. 264 (1898)). We conclude that for purposes of \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA, the definition of the term \u201cfeloniously\u201d is not limited to the definition of \u201cfelony\u201d set forth in \u00a7 45-2-101(23), MCA, but includes all killings \u201cdone with a mind bent on doing wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b634  Finally, on remand, Gene also has the burden of proving that Jeanette acted with the requisite intent under \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA. Evidence of Jeanette\u2019s guilty plea is admissible on the independent ground that it is an admission, but it may not be given conclusive effect. <em>See e.g. Teitelbaum, </em>375 P.2d at 441. In considering whether Jeanette was capable of forming the requisite intent, the District Court must take into account the evidence concerning Jeanette\u2019s mental condition, as required by \u00a7 46-14-101(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b635 In sum, we hold that the District Court erred by concluding, as a matter of law, that Jeanette was precluded from inheriting from her children\u2019s estates. A guilty plea to a charge of deliberate homicide does not create a presumption that a killer acted \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u201d for the purposes of the slayer statute. We draw no conclusions today as to whether or not Jeanette is entitled to inherit from her children\u2019s estates in this civil proceeding. That determination will be made by the District Court, which, on remand, must consider whether Jeanette acted \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 72-2-813, MCA. Thus, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b300-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-4\"> Codified in North Dakota at N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 30.1-10-03(2) (2007), and in Montana at \u00a7 72-2-813(2), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b300-8\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"Amq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b636 I believe the Court makes several analytical errors in resolving this appeal. First, the Court states that \u00a7 72-2-813(7), MCA, \u201cdistinguishes between a conviction obtained through a plea, and a conviction obtained by a verdict after a jury or bench trial.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22. I submit that a reading of the plain language reveals no such distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">After all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively establishes the convicted individual as the decedent\u2019s killer for purposes of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Section 72-2-813(7), MCA. A \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d which satisfies this provision makes the slayer statute operative, whether that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>judgment is premised upon a guilty plea or trial verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b637 This error in the reading of the statute leads the Court to analyze at length the preclusive effect of a guilty plea in a later civil suit, and the application of the law of collateral estoppel. All of this is irrelevant. Application of the general law of collateral estoppel is unnecessary because, if the slayer\u2019s judgment of conviction satisfies the slayer statute, then the slayer\u2019s claim is estopped by the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b638 Analysis of the preclusive effect of a guilty plea in a later civil action does not help, either. Jeanette did indeed enter a guilty plea to the charge of deliberate homicide. That charge satisfies the requirement of a \u201cfelonious and intentional\u201d killing because it is a felony with an intentional mental state. This is confirmed by \u00a7 72-2-813(10), MCA: \u201cFor the purposes of this section, a felonious and intentional killing includes a deliberate homicide as defined in 45-5-102 ...\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, there is more involved here than merely a guilty plea to the charge. Jeanette was thereafter sentenced for this felonious and intentional crime, judgment was entered against her for the crime, and she did not challenge this judgment by appeal. At that point, a \u201cjudgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent\u201d against Jeanette became final. Section 72-2-813(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b639 The slayer statute then provides that \u201c[a]fter all right to appeal has been exhausted\u201d from such a judgment, the judgment of conviction of this crime \u201cconclusively establishes the convicted individual as the decedent\u2019s killer for purposes of this section.\u201d Section 72-2-813(7), MCA. Jeanette should thus be foreclosed from pursuing her claims against her children\u2019s estates as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b640 I believe the Court has gone far afield in its analysis and failed to apply the plain language of the statute. I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> The Court\u2019s extensive analysis of what constitutes a \u201cfelony\u201d is likewise unnecessary under the facts of this case. The slayer statute clearly incorporates the charge at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
