Our Order of March 13, 2008, directed Engel and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) to file briefs addressing the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to impose a discipline upon Engel. Engel and ODC filed their briefs and we now deny Engel\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">\u00b62 We determined in <em>Engel I </em>that Engel had violated Rules 1.5,1.15, and 1.18, of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC). <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 48. In <em>Engel II, </em>we declined to follow the recommendation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Commission on Practice of the Supreme Court of the State of Montana (the Commission) that Engel\u2019s discipline be limited to a public censure and the cost of the disciplinary proceedings. <em>Engel II, </em>\u00b6 2. We instead determined that Engel\u2019s conduct also warranted a sixty-day suspension from practice. <em>Engel II, </em>\u00b6 38. We directed Engel to appear before the Court on March 18, 2008, for administration of the public censure and further directed that Engel\u2019s sixty-day suspension would commence as of the date of the public censure. <em>Engel II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b63 Engel filed a motion for leave to file a petition for withdrawal of opinions in <em>Engel I </em>and <em>Engel II, </em>dismissal, and a request for oral argument. Engel alleged that the process by which the Court has reviewed his disciplinary proceeding has deprived the Court of subject matter jurisdiction over the formal complaint filed by ODC against Engel. Engel also raises procedural due process issues. ODC filed a brief in opposition to Engel\u2019s motion. We vacated Engel\u2019s scheduled public censure and directed the parties to file briefs addressing the issue of the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b64 Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction presents a question of law. We review a fact finder\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Boe v. Court Adm\u2019r for the Mon. Jud. Branch, </em>2007 MT 7, \u00b6 5, 335 Mont. 228, \u00b6 5, 150 P.3d 927, \u00b6 5. Whether a party has been denied a due process right presents a constitutional law question. We exercise plenary review of constitutional law questions. <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 13, 339 Mont. 218, \u00b6 13, 168 P.3d 685, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b65 The Court finds it difficult to square Engel\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction argument with the nature of the Court\u2019s role in the attorney discipline system. As we have noted on several occasions, this Court \u2018\u201cpossesses original and exclusive jurisdiction and responsibility\u2019\u201d in all matters involving the disciplining of lawyers in the state of Montana. <em>See In re Potts, </em>2007 MT 81, \u00b6 31, 336 Mont. 517, \u00b6 31, 158 P.3d 418, \u00b6 31 (quoting Introduction, Montana Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (MRLDE)); <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 18 (same); <em>In re Potts, </em>2007 MT 236, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 186, \u00b6 14, 171 P.3d 286, \u00b6 14 (same); and <em>Engel II, </em>\u00b6 3 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u00b66 This authority derives from the 1972 Montana Constitution. Article VII, Section 2(3) provides that the Court may make rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>governing \u201cadmission to the bar and the conduct of its members.\u201d Moreover, the regulation of lawyers in Montana \u201cis a matter peculiarly within the inherent powers of this Court, subject, of course, to constitutional guaranties ....\u201d <em>Goetz v. Harrison, </em>153 Mont. 403, 404, 457 P.2d 911, 912 (1969). Rule 7, MRLDE, further provides that any lawyer admitted to practice in the State of Montana \u201cis subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of Montana.\u201d Engel challenges only the process by which the Court came to review the complaint against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b67 A brief review of that process is in order. Rule 11(5), MRLDE, empowers the Commission to request that ODC prepare and file a formal complaint. <em>See also </em>Rule 3(B)(5), MRLDE. At the request of a review panel of the Commission, ODC filed a formal complaint against Engel on March 25, 2005. Once ODC initiated the formal disciplinary proceeding, the Commission\u2019s authority ended to resolve the complaint against Engel without a review by the Court. For example, Rule 13, MRLDE, allows the Commission, in its discretion, to give a lawyer a private admonition \u201cin the name of the Supreme Court ....\u201d Rule 13, MRLDE, limits the Commission\u2019s discretion, however, to \u201cany time before initiation of formal disciplinary proceedings ....\u201d ODC filed a formal complaint at the Commission\u2019s request and thereby triggered the Court\u2019s review of any disposition of the complaint against Engel.</p>\n<p id=\"AJN\">\u00b68 The complaint proceeded through a hearing. An adjudicatory panel of the Commission issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation on November 16, 2006. The Commission recommended that the complaint against Engel be dismissed. Rule 12(C)(3), MRLDE, authorizes the Commission to recommend \u201cfor discipline or other disposition ...\u201d of formal complaints. <em>See also </em>Rule 4(B)(2), MRLDE. The Commission opted for the \u201cother disposition\u201d in the form of recommending that the complaint be dismissed. Engel makes no complaint of the process afforded to him through that point. Engel challenges what happened next.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b69 Engel contends that the disciplinary process should have ended upon the Commission recommending that the complaint be dismissed. He points to the fact that Rule 16, MRLDE, contemplates that the Court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s proceeding will be limited to a recommendation of discipline. The Commission recommended no discipline here, and, therefore, Engel contends that the Court has no power to review the Commission\u2019s proposed disposition. Engel correctly notes that Rule 16, MRLDE, first discusses serving the lawyer with a copy of the Commission\u2019s \u201crecommendation of discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>....\u201d This service provides the lawyer with the chance to file any objections to the Commission\u2019s recommendation. Rule 16, MRLDE. Rule 16 makes no provision for ODC filing an objection to the Commission\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b610 Rule 16 provides, however, that the Court \u201cshall determine the appropriate discipline, if any, authorized by these rules\u201d upon expiration of the time for the lawyer filing an objection to the Commission\u2019s recommendation. Rule 16 further provides that the Court \u201cshall consider the matter, issue its written decision, and impose such discipline if any, <em>as it considers appropriate.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Thus, Rule 16 imposes two limitations on the Court\u2019s power to impose discipline: (1) discipline authorized by the rules; and (2) discipline that the Court considers appropriate. The Court determined that a public censure, sixty-day suspension, and imposition of the costs of the proceedings against Engel would constitute the appropriate discipline. Rule 9, MRLDE, specifically authorizes suspension, public censure, and imposition of the costs of the proceedings as appropriate forms of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b611 The directive in Rule 12(C)(3) that the Commission shall make \u201ca recommendation to the Supreme Court for discipline or other disposition of the case\u201d further undermines Engel\u2019s claim that the Commission\u2019s dismissal recommendation should have ended the case. The Commission elected to recommend for \u201cother disposition\u201d in the form of the dismissal of the complaint against Engel. The Commission\u2019s authority stops upon making a recommendation of a proposed disposition. The Court retains the ultimate authority to determine the appropriate discipline. Rule 16, MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b612 Engel relies largely on cases where a court reversed disciplinary charges where some sort of procedural due process violation had infected the proceedings. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Simecek, </em>699 N.E.2d 933, 934 (Ohio 1998), the Ohio Supreme Court upheld three misconduct charges against a lawyer, but dismissed three others. The dismissed charges stemmed from the determination of a disciplinary panel that the lawyer\u2019s conduct violated not only the three charges originally contained in the complaint, but that the lawyer\u2019s conduct also violated three additional provisions of the disciplinary rules not contained in the complaint. The court refused to condone what it deemed to be a serious violation of the lawyer\u2019s right to procedural due process. <em>Simecek, </em>699 N.E.2d at 934-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b613 The court in <em>Simecek </em>analogized the procedural due process violation to the one addressed <em>in In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 88 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>1222 (1968). Engel also relies upon <em>Ruffalo. </em>The lawyer disciplinary board in <em>Ruffalo </em>added a misconduct charge after it had heard the testimony against a lawyer. The Court stated that a lawyer in a disciplinary proceeding is \u201centitled to procedural due process, which includes fair notice of the charge.\u201d <em>Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. at 550, 88 S. Ct. at 1226. The charge must be known before the proceedings begin to avoid laying a trap for the accused. The Court held that the absence of fair notice \u201cas to the reach of the grievance procedure and the precise nature of the charges ...\u201d had deprived the lawyer of procedural due process. <em>Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. at 552, 88 S. Ct. at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b614 The proceedings against Engel suffer from no similar infirmity. ODC filed the formal complaint against Engel. ODC\u2019s original complaint alleged that Engel had committed four counts of professional misconduct. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 15. At no time did ODC or the Commission add new charges of misconduct. Engel takes issue, however, with the fact that the Commission determined that no clear and convincing evidence supported the allegations in ODC\u2019s complaint. The Commission initially had recommended that this Court dismiss the complaint. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 17. Engel contends that the proceedings should have ended upon the Commission\u2019s initial recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"A_m\">\u00b615 Engel points to the fact that Rule 14, MRLDE, provides that a complainant unsatisfied with the Commission\u2019s disposition of a complaint may petition for reconsideration within thirty days of receipt of notice of the Commission\u2019s disposition of the complaint. He argues that ODC failed to file a petition for reconsideration within thirty days of the Commission\u2019s recommendation that the complaint against Engel be dismissed. ODC\u2019s failure, he argues, ended the matter. We rejected this claim in <em>Engel I. </em>We noted the problems with the language of Rule 14, MRLDE, but concluded that Rule 14\u2019s reconsideration requirements applied only to informal complaints filed by a private party rather than a formal complaint pursued by ODC. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b616 Engel also points to other cases in which the court rejected the recommendation of a lawyer disciplinary board when the board sought to apply a rule retroactively to the past conduct of a lawyer. The lawyer disciplinary board in <em>In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Haley, </em>126 P.3d 1262 (Wash. 2006), recommended that a lawyer, proceeding pro se, had violated a rule that limited contact between a lawyer representing a party and an opposing party. The lawyer had written a letter directly to the opposing party and had left a message on the telephone answering machine at the opposing party\u2019s home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Haley, </em>126 P.3d at 1264. The Washington supreme court dismissed this count even though it agreed with the board\u2019s interpretation of the no contact rule. The court determined that the \u201cabsence of a prior decision from this court, along with presence of conflicting or equivocal authority from other jurisdictions and legal commentaries...\u201d rendered the rule impermissibly vague and, thus, subject only to prospective application. <em>Haley, </em>126 P.3d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b617 The rule at issue in <em>Haley </em>went to the permissibility of the lawyer\u2019s underlying conduct. We face no similar ambiguity in the clarity of the rules that Engel violated regarding the reasonableness of his fee or his failure to put a client\u2019s retainer fee into a trust account. Nothing changed with respect to the application of Rule 1.5, MRPC, regarding the reasonableness of Engel\u2019s fee, or to the application of Rules 1.15 and 1.18, MRPC, regarding Engel\u2019s failure to deposit a client\u2019s retainer fee into a trust account. Likewise, nothing in these rules or their application raises constitutional concerns similar to those presented in <em>Matter of Keller, </em>213 Mont. 196, 693 P.2d 1211 (1984). There the Court held that First Amendment concerns trumped ethical rules relating to statements by lawyers regarding pending cases. <em>Keller, </em>213 Mont. at 202, 693 P.2d at 1214. No competing constitutional provision protects Engel\u2019s right to charge an unreasonable fee or undermines Engel\u2019s duty to deposit client retainer fees into a trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b618 Finally, Engel contends that the Court adopted the MRLDE and that the Court should be bound strictly by them. The court in <em>Matter of Thalheim, </em>853 F.2d 383 (5th Cir. 1988), dismissed a suspension against a lawyer based upon the district court\u2019s failure to follow its own procedural rules in a disciplinary proceeding. <em>Thalheim, </em>853 F.2d at 390. The federal judicial district in question had adopted procedural rules that called for a district judge to appoint a panel of three lawyers from its standing committee to investigate allegations of misconduct by a lawyer. <em>Thalheim, </em>853 F.2d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b619 The three-lawyer panel recommended that the evidence of misconduct did not warrant formal disciplinary proceedings. The district court nevertheless appointed a special counsel to prosecute the alleged misconduct and proceeded to hold a two-and-a-half hour hearing. The presiding district court judge issued a memorandum after the hearing in which he stated that he had found the allegations of misconduct to be true. <em>Thalheim, </em>853 F.2d at 386. The district court\u2019s memorandum further recommended that the lawyer be suspended for a year on the basis of his misconduct. A majority of the district judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>in the federal judicial district agreed with the memorandum\u2019s finding of misconduct and increased the suspension to two years. <em>Thalheim, </em>853 F.2d at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b620 The Fifth Circuit reversed. The court announced that federal district courts are bound by their own disciplinary rules when proceeding against lawyers for violations of ethical standards. <em>Thalheim, </em>853 F.2d at 390. The court ruled that the district court had usurped its authority when it disregarded the discretion of the three-lawyer panel as to whether to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the lawyer. The court concluded that the rules did not authorize the district court to appoint a special counsel to prosecute disciplinary cases \u201cif the investigative attorney panel has <em>not </em>recommended institution of formal disciplinary proceedings ....\u201d <em>Thalheim, </em>853 F.2d at 388 (emphasis in original); <em>see also In re Bird, </em>353 F.3d 636 (8th Cir. 2003) (district court\u2019s deviation from its procedural rules in a lawyer disciplinary proceeding constituted harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b621 Engel\u2019s challenge presents no similar usurpation of the prosecutorial function by the court. A review panel of the Commission, which performs a role similar to the three-lawyer panel in <em>Thalheim, </em>requested ODC to initiate a formal complaint against Engel. ODC filed the formal complaint and proceeded to prosecute the claim against Engel before an adjudicatory panel of the Commission. The adjudicatory panel serves as a fact finder and issues conclusions of law in a manner similar to a trial court. This Court reviews the adjudicatory panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended disposition of the case. Rule 16, MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b622 This Court deviated from the MRLDE only to the extent that it directed ODC to file a brief setting forth its view on the adjudicatory panel\u2019s recommendation that the complaint against Engel should be dismissed. The MRLDE nowhere contemplates ODC filing an objection to the adjudicatory panel\u2019s recommendation. In fact, Rule 16, MRLDE, directs the lawyer subject to the discipline to file an objection to the adjudicatory panel\u2019s recommendation. The rule further provides that ODC may file a response to the lawyer\u2019s objections. Rule 16, MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"ADiP\">\u00b623 We reversed the process here. We directed ODC to file objections to the adjudicatory panel\u2019s recommendation. We also provided Engel with the chance to respond to ODC\u2019s objections. No absolute standard exists for what constitutes due process. <em>McDermott v. McDonald, </em>2001 MT 89, \u00b6 10, 305 Mont. 166, \u00b6 10, 24 P.3d 200, \u00b6 10. The process due in any given case varies according to the factual circumstances of the case, the nature of the interests at stake, and the risk of making an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>erroneous decision. <em>Sage v. Gamble, </em>279 Mont. 459, 465, 929 P.2d 822, 825 (1996). We have stated previously in the context of a lawyer disciplinary proceeding that due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Goldstein v. Commission on Practice, </em>2000 MT 8, \u00b6 40, 297 Mont. 493, \u00b6 40, 995 P.2d 923, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b624 Our order of December 6,2006, provided notice to Engel that ODC would be granted the opportunity to present its objections to the adjudicatory panel\u2019s recommendation. Our same order provided Engel with an opportunity to be heard. Engel took advantage of that opportunity to be heard. Engel first filed a motion to reconsider on December 14, 2006. We denied Engel\u2019s motion in an order dated December 28, 2006. Engel then filed his response to ODC\u2019s objections to the adjudicatory panel\u2019s recommendation on February 20,2007. We rejected the adjudicatory panel\u2019s recommendation of dismissal in <em>Engel I </em>and remanded the matter to the Commission \u201cfor its consideration and recommendation of an appropriate sanction <em>...\u201d Engel I, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"Arq\">\u00b625 Engel participated in the proceedings on remand to the Commission. He appeared with counsel and testified personally. We rejected the Commission\u2019s recommendation of a private admonition in <em>Engel II. </em>We directed Engel to appear before the Court for a public censure, that Engel be suspended for sixty days, and that Engel bear the costs of the disciplinary proceedings. <em>Engel II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36-38. This decision prompted Engel to file his current petition. We granted Engel leave to file briefs addressing the question of whether the Court still possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the disciplinary proceeding against Engel.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b626  We still possess subject matter jurisdiction over these disciplinary proceedings. Nothing in the process by which the Court came to review Engel\u2019s disciplinary proceeding deprived the Court of its constitutionally endowed authority to regulate the conduct of lawyers. Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 2(3). We also now determine that Engel enjoyed the full panoply of rights afforded to lawyers facing disciplinary proceedings, including notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to be heard to contest those charges. <em>Goldstein, </em>\u00b6 40. Engel took full advantage of his opportunity and we determine that the Court\u2019s order directing ODC to file its objections to the adjudicatory panel\u2019s recommendation of dismissal did not violate any of Engel\u2019s procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b627 Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u00b628 1.
