Ryan\u2019s, d/b/a Applebee\u2019s, (Applebee\u2019s) motion to dismiss his personal injury claim. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"ALjX\">\u00b62 The single issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that Filip\u2019s \u201cDram Shop Act\u201d claim, brought under \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA (1999)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, is governed by a two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\u00b63 The salient facts concerning this appeal are straightforward and uncontested. On December 10, 2000, Filip was a passenger in an automobile driven by defendant Alden Lee Jordan (Jordan). They were in an auto accident in which Filip suffered injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">\u00b64 Filip alleges that prior to the accident on December 10, 2000, Jordan was served alcohol at Applebee\u2019s restaurant in Billings. Filip also alleges that Applebee\u2019s served Jordan alcohol despite knowing he was a minor and that he was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">\u00b65 Filip filed his complaint November 7, 2003. Count I of the complaint alleges negligence by Jordan. Count II alleges liability on the part of Applebee\u2019s, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA (1999), Montana\u2019s \u201cDram Shop\u201d Act. Count III alleges actual malice on the part of the defendants, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u00b66 The District Court concluded that Filip\u2019s claim under \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA (1999), constituted a liability created by statute, and thus the two-year period of limitations provided in \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA, applied. Because Filip filed his complaint approximately two years and eleven months after the accident, the District Court granted Applebee\u2019s motion to dismiss. From that order, Filip now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b67 \u2018\u201cThe question of whether a district court properly granted a motion to dismiss is a conclusion of law which we review to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct.\u2019\u201d <em>Public Lands Access Assn., Inc. v. Jones, </em>2008 MT 12, \u00b6 9, 341 Mont. 111, \u00b6 9, 176 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 9 <em>(quoting Fleenor v. Darby Sch. Dist., </em>2006 MT 31, \u00b6 6, 331 Mont. 124, \u00b6 6, 128 P.3d 1048, \u00b6 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b68 In 1986, the Montana Legislature passed legislation concerning civil liability for individuals and businesses serving alcohol. Section 27-1-710, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">(1) The purpose of this section is to set statutory criteria governing the liability of a person or entity that furnishes an alcoholic beverage for injury or damage arising from an event involving the person who consumed the beverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">(2) Except as provided in 16-6-305, a person or entity furnishing an alcoholic beverage may not be found liable for injury or damage arising from an event involving the consumer wholly or partially on the basis of a provision or violation of a provision of Title 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">(3) Furnishing a person with an alcoholic beverage is not a cause of, or grounds for finding the furnishing person or entity liable for, injury or damage wholly or partly arising from an event involving the person who consumed the beverage unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">(a) the consumer was under the legal drinking age and the furnishing person knew that the consumer was underage or did not make a reasonable attempt to determine the consumer\u2019s age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">(b) the consumer was visibly intoxicated; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">(c) the furnishing person forced or coerced the consumption or told the consumer that the beverage contained no alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">\u00b69 However, prior to passage of \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA(1999), a dram shop action grounded in the common law existed in Montana. <em>See e.g. Nehring v. LaCounte, </em>219 Mont. 462, 712 P.2d 1329 (1986); <em>Jevning v. Skyline Bar, </em>223 Mont. 422, 726 P.2d 326 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">\u00b6 10 The District Court concluded that because the Legislature enacted \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA (1999), Filip\u2019s claim was created by statute, and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the period of limitations is two years under \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">Actions to enforce penalty or forfeiture or other statutory liability. (1) Within 2 years is the period prescribed for the commencement of an action upon:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">(c) a liability created by statute ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b611 This case turns on a determination of whether \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA (1999), and its criteria for liability constitutes a liability created by statute. The phrase \u201cliability created by statute\u201d has a settled meaning in Montana law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">This Court has construed the phrase to mean \u2018a liability which would not exist but for the statute <em>....\u2019Abell v. Bishop </em>(1930), 86 Mont. 478, 486, 284 P. 525, 528 (quoting 37 C.J. <em>Limitations of Actions </em>\u00a7 123). Put differently, the test is whether liability would exist absent the statute in question. <em>State ex rel. Fallon County v. District Court </em>(1972), 161 Mont. 79, 81, 505 P.2d 120, 121. Therefore, a liability created by statute is one which \u201cestablishes a new rule of private right unknown to the common law.\u201d <em>Butler v. Peters </em>(1922), 62 Mont. 381, 384, 205 P. 247, 248. See also 51 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Limitations of Actions </em>\u00a7 82 (1962) (\u201cClearly, an action is not based upon a liability created by statute if the right is one which would exist at common law in the absence of statute.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzI\"><em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Roadarmel, 2000 MT </em>259, \u00b6 17, 301 Mont. 508, \u00b6 17, 11 P.3d 105, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u00b612  The District Court erred when it concluded that potential dram shop liability, now proscribed by \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA (1999), is a liability created by statute, and thus subject to a two-year period of limitations. The District Court\u2019s analysis focused on the authority of the Montana Legislature to craft exclusive and specific remedies and the Legislature\u2019s plenary power to alter common law causes of action. <em>See e.g. Meech v. Hillhaven West, Inc., </em>238 Mont. 21, 776 P.2d 488 (1989). The Legislature has plenary power to alter common law causes of action, but this is not the same as saying that when the Legislature does so the resulting cause of action is created by statute. As we first stated in <em>State ex rel. Fallon County v. District Court, </em>161 Mont. 79, 81, 505 P.2d 120, 121 (1972), the test for whether a liability is created by statute is whether liability would exist absent the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"AIlF\">\u00b613 In this instance, as noted above, Montana recognized a cause of action based on negligently providing alcohol to an intoxicated person prior to the passage of \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA (1999). <em>See Nehring, </em>219 Mont. 462, 712 P.2d 1329; <em>Jevning, </em>223 Mont. 422, 726 P.2d 326. Thus, \u00a7 27-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>1-710, MCA (1999), did not \u201cestablish^ a new rule of private right unknown to the common law.\u201d <em>Butler v. Peters, </em>62 Mont. 381, 384, 205 P. 247, 248 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b614  Under Montana common law prior to the passage of \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA (1999), Applebee\u2019s was potentially liable to Filip for illegally providing alcohol to Jordan. Therefore Filip\u2019s cause of action is not a liability created by statute. Accordingly, the three-year period of limitations provided in \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, applies to this action and Filip timely filed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b615 We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, NELSON, RICE And MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-12\"> We note that although the current version of \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA, provides for a two-year statute of limitations on Dram Shop claims, the version of the statute in effect at the time of the accident in 2000 did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
