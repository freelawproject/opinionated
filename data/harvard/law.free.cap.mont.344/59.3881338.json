Braunreiter raises numerous issues on appeal. We address only the District Court\u2019s denial of Braunreiter\u2019s challenge for cause of a potential juror. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">\u00b62 The State charged Braunreiter with burglary, assault with a weapon, and intimidation in March of 2005. The State alleged that Braunreiter burglarized a residence and stole three rifles, a shotgun, and a vintage knife. The State further alleged that Braunreiter assaulted a woman with a hammer during the State\u2019s investigation of the burglary and threatened to kill her if she contacted law enforcement regarding Braunreiter\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">\u00b63 Braunreiter filed a motion to sever the burglary charge from the assault and intimidation charges on August 30, 2005. The District Court granted the motion, and trial on the burglary charge commenced on November 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u00b64 The prosecutor posed questions to the jury panel regarding the presumption of a defendant\u2019s innocence during voir dire. The prosecutor received no inappropriate responses from the panel. Braunreiter\u2019s counsel referred the panel to the prosecutor\u2019s discussion of the presumption of innocence during her opening remarks for voir dire. Braunreiter\u2019s counsel asked if \u201cMr. Braunreiter [has] to prove anything in this case?\u201d Prospective juror Kremer replied that a defendant should testify to prove that he or she did not commit the crime charged. Braunreiter\u2019s counsel asked juror Kremer additional questions regarding the presumption of innocence and a juror\u2019s obligation to follow instructions. Kremer maintained his belief that a defendant should be required to testify notwithstanding court instructions to the contrary. Braunreiter\u2019s counsel requested that the court dismiss Kremer for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b65 The District Court provided the State with an opportunity to examine Kremer before deciding Braunreiter\u2019s challenge for cause of prospective juror Kremer. The prosecutor questioned Kremer. Kremer\u2019s responses to the prosecutor\u2019s questions coincided with Kremer\u2019s earlier statements to Braunreiter\u2019s counsel. The District Court then discussed Kremer\u2019s obligations as a juror to follow the court\u2019s instructions. Kremer agreed to follow the instructions. The court denied the motion to dismiss Kremer for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b66 Braunreiter used a peremptory challenge to remove Kremer from the jury panel. Braunreiter exhausted his peremptory challenges. The jury convicted Braunreiter of burglary following a two-day trial. Braunreiter appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his challenge for cause of Kremer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a challenge for cause to a juror for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Falls Down, </em>2003 MT 300, \u00b6 17, 318 Mont. 219, \u00b6 17, 79 P.3d 797, \u00b6 17. We will reverse the judgment and order a new trial if a court abuses its discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s challenge for cause, the defendant removes the challenged prospective juror with a peremptory challenge, and the defendant exhausts his peremptory challenges. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>2008 MT 34, \u00b6 7, 341 Mont. 300, \u00b6 7, 177 P.3d 488, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b68 Braunreiter argues that the District Court committed error when it declined to excuse for cause prospective juror Kremer. Braunreiter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>asserts that Kremer\u2019s \u201cspontaneous and honest\u201d responses revealed that Kremer could not act without bias with regard to Braunreiter\u2019s right to a presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b69  A defendant may challenge a juror for cause if the juror has a state of mind that prevents the juror from acting impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the defendant. Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. We review a prospective juror\u2019s voir dire responses as a whole when reviewing a challenge for cause. <em>State v. Hausauer, </em>2006 MT 336, \u00b6 23, 335 Mont. 137, \u00b6 23, 149 P.3d 895, \u00b6 23. We emphasize a prospective juror\u2019s spontaneous responses as we determine whether a serious question exists concerning the juror\u2019s ability to remain impartial. <em>Hausauer, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b610  District courts need not remove a prospective juror for cause where the juror expresses concerns about remaining impartial but believes that he or she will fairly weigh the evidence. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 10. Courts should resolve serious questions about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and to remain impartial in favor of excusing the juror. <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, \u00b6 25, 292 Mont. 325, \u00b6 25, 972 P.2d 816, \u00b6 25 (citation omitted) (overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, 309 Mont. 113, 43 P.3d 948).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b611 Section 46-16-114(2), MCA, allows district courts to examine potential jurors. A district court may clarify a juror\u2019s statements and ask questions in order to better ascertain whether a juror has biases. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 11. District courts should not attempt to rehabilitate prospective jurors, however, by placing jurors in a position from which they will not disagree with the court. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 54. Coaxed recantations prompted by the trial court, or either counsel, fail to demonstrate that a prospective juror enters the trial without bias or prejudice. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b612 The prosecutor discussed the presumption of innocence with the jury panel and had a brief exchange with prospective juror Kremer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">PROSECUTOR: So if I were to ask you folks right now, without hearing any evidence at all, is the defendant guilty or innocent, what do you folks have to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">KREMER: Innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">PROSECUTOR:... [ajndifwe show to you beyond a reasonable doubt and we show you the facts and the circumstances such that Mr. Kremer has no doubt in his mind, what would you return a verdict of then, Mr. Kremer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">KREMER: If you could prove that he was guilty, I would say guilty, yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u00b613 Braunreiter\u2019s counsel, after referring the jury panel to the prosecutor\u2019s discussion of the presumption of innocence, asked the jury panel if \u201cMr. Braunreiter [has] to prove anything in this case?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">KREMER: Well, [Braunreiter] has been charged. He has to prove he didn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">* * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Do you feel, Mr. Kremer, then, that every defendant who is charged needs to get up there and explain why he has been charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">KREMER: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: You do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">KREMER: (Nods head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: So if the defendant chose not to take the stand, standing under his constitutional right to not incriminate himself should any testimony he would give be incriminating, you would think that he needs to get up here and explain himself; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">KREMER: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: So even if the Court were to instruct you that you should not hold a defendant\u2019s choice not to testify against him, you still believe that it would be appropriate for him to get up there and testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">KREMER: He doesn\u2019t have to if he doesn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s his choice. But I feel that he should get up and do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: If he chose not to testify, you would take that into account in considering the-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">KREMER: I would have to hear all the evidence first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">\u00b614 Braunreiter\u2019s counsel challenged juror Kremer for cause. The District Court provided the State with an opportunity to voir dire Kremer before deciding Braunreiter\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-17\">PROSECUTOR: Mr. Kremer, you understand that the judge, at the end of the trial, is going to tell you how to do your deliberations; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-18\">KREMER: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-19\">PROSECUTOR: If the judge tells you that, if the defendant does not testify and exercises his right not to testify, which everybody here is able to, that you are not to consider that, could you set that aside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-20\">KREMER: Probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-21\">PROSECUTOR: If the judge tells you that you are not to consider it, you can set that aside and not let that enter into your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">KREMER: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The State then asked the court to deny Braunreiter\u2019s challenge for cause of juror Kremer.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b615 The District Court directly addressed Kremer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">THE COURT: Mr. Kremer, at the end of this, if you are selected for this jury, I\u2019m going to tell you the law. And I\u2019ll explain the law, and it\u2019s not what you see on [television]; it\u2019s not what you hear elsewhere. It\u2019s what I tell you. Will you be able to follow that law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">KREMER: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">THE COURT: Regardless of what you heard elsewhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANW\">KREMER: Right. I could follow the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">The District Court denied Braunreiter\u2019s challenge for cause of prospective juror Kremer.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">\u00b616 Juror Kremer\u2019s initial responses to the prosecutor\u2019s questions raised no concerns with regard to his ability to perform as a juror without prejudice to Braunreiter\u2019s rights. We must examine, however, Kremer\u2019s responses as a whole. <em>Hausauer, </em>\u00b6 23. Furthermore, we emphasize a prospective juror\u2019s spontaneous response when reviewing a challenge for cause. <em>Hausauer, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">\u00b617 Kremer\u2019s spontaneous response to a question that Braunreiter\u2019s counsel had posed to the entire jury panel raised serious questions regarding Kremer\u2019s ability to act without prejudice to the presumption of innocence and Braunreiter\u2019s right to refrain from testifying. Braunreiter\u2019s counsel and the prosecutor provided Kremer with opportunities to clarify his position. Kremer\u2019s responses to these follow-up questions failed to alleviate the serious concerns that arose from his earlier statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">\u00b618 The Dissent faults the prosecutor and Braunreiter\u2019s counsel for asking unclear questions. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 27-30. The Dissent asserts that these unclear questions failed to shed light on Kremer\u2019s state of mind regarding Braunreiter\u2019s right to refrain from testifying and the presumption of innocence. Dissent, \u00b6 30. The Dissent contends, for example, that Kremer merely evinced a preference to hear directly from the defendant when Kremer stated \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to [testify] if he doesn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s his choice. But I feel that he should get up and do it.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 28. Kremer\u2019s repeated statements regarding Braunreiter\u2019s rights, however, belie the Dissent\u2019s characterization of Kremer\u2019s position as a mere preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">\u00b619 Kremer set himself apart from the other members of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>panel when Braunreiter\u2019s counsel asked the panel whether \u201cMr. Braunreiter [has] to prove anything in this case?\u201d Kremer stated that \u201c[Braunreiter] has been charged. He has to prove he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d This statement amounts to more than a mere preference to hear a defendant\u2019s testimony. Braunreiter\u2019s counsel next asked Kremer if \u201cevery defendant who is charged needs to get up there and explain why he has been charged?\u201d Kremer\u2019s unequivocal answer, \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d to this straightforward question, raised a serious question about Kremer\u2019s ability to perform as a juror without bias against Braunreiter\u2019s right to refrain from testifying and the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b620 Kremer\u2019s responses to the follow-up questions asked by Braunreiter\u2019s counsel and the prosecutor, when viewed in isolation, arguably present an unclear picture of Kremer\u2019s position with regard to Braunreiter\u2019s rights. Dissent, \u00b6 30. These statements followed on the heels, however, of unequivocal answers from Kremer that raised serious questions about Kremer\u2019s ability to remain impartial. The colloquy between Kremer and Braunreiter\u2019s counsel and the prosecutor that took place after Kremer\u2019s unequivocal responses failed to resolve these serious questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b621 Kremer\u2019s statements reveal the kind of fixed state of mind that this Court repeatedly has deemed appropriate for a dismissal for cause. We concluded in <em>DeVore, </em>for example, that the prospective jurors\u2019 adherence to the belief that the defendant \u201cis guilty of something\u201d demonstrated a serious question about the jurors\u2019 ability to remain impartial and to afford properly the presumption of innocence to the defendant. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 24. Likewise, we examined in <em>Good </em>two prospective jurors and their predisposition to favor the testimony of a teenage victim of sexual abuse. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 53. We concluded that the jurors\u2019 adherence to their respective positions demonstrated a serious question about the jurors\u2019 abilities to act with impartiality. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b622 We also determined in <em>Good </em>that the jurors\u2019 recantations, given after the district court delivered a \u201ccivics speech\u201d on the presumption of innocence, shed no light on the jurors\u2019 abilities to remain impartial. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 55. We again cautioned district courts to refrain from rehabilitation efforts that place jurors in a \u201cposition where they will not disagree with the court.\u201d <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b623 The prospective jurors in <em>Falls Down </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>by contrast, admitted having doubts about the defendant\u2019s innocence, but gave responses that allowed the district court reasonably to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>they could set aside their concerns. The prospective jurors in <em>Falls Down </em>did not express fixed opinions about the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Falls Down, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 32, 35. The potential jurors also indicated that they had the ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions or remain fair and impartial in the absence of the type of district court questioning that we warned against in <em>Good. Falls Down, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25, 28, 31, 33. Similarly, we deferred in <em>Robinson </em>to the trial court\u2019s decision not to excuse the juror for cause when the court had considered the juror\u2019s conflicting statements regarding the presumption of innocence. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 13. We determined that the trial court\u2019s questioning of the prospective juror constituted an attempt to clarify the juror\u2019s thoughts and did not lead to a coaxed recantation. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b624  Kremer stated that he would require Braunreiter to testify to prove his innocence even after rehabilitation attempts by Braunreiter\u2019s counsel and the State. Kremer relinquished this position only after the District Court informed him that the law \u201c[is] not what you see on [television]; it\u2019s not what you hear elsewhere. It\u2019s what I tell you.\u201d Kremer\u2019s response, \u201cSure,\u201d in light of his previous responses and coming directly after the court\u2019s admonition, leaves a serious question as to Kremer\u2019s ability to perform impartially as a juror. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 55. We hold that the District Court could not conclude reasonably that Kremer had a state of mind that would allow him to perform as a juror free from prejudice to Braunreiter\u2019s right to refrain from testifying and to the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b625  The District Court abused its discretion when it denied Braunreiter\u2019s challenge for cause of prospective juror Kremer. Braunreiter removed Kremer with a peremptory challenge and exhausted his peremptory challenges. We reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b90-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"An1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b626 The Court reverses Braunreiter\u2019s conviction by concluding that Juror Kremer\u2019s responses \u201cdemonstrate a fixed state of mind prejudicial to the presumption of innocence and Braunreiter\u2019s right not to testify.\u201d I disagree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b627 Kremer\u2019s initial, spontaneous responses clearly demonstrate a proper understanding of the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof and should be given more weight than the later answers he gave to uncertain questions, the meaning of which was less than clear until the District Court clarified his answers. At that point Kremer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>again clearly endorsed the proper legal principles, as demonstrated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b628 In \u00b6 13, the Opinion quotes the question from defense counsel, \u201cSo even if the Court were to instruct you that you should not hold a defendant\u2019s choice not to testify against him, you still believe that it would be appropriate for him to get up there and testify?\u201d The thrust of this question is far from clear, but it appears that defense counsel is asking, that even if a defendant has a right not to testify, does the juror feel it would nonetheless \u201cbe appropriate\u201d for the defendant to do so. Kremer gives a perfectly correct response to this two part question as framed: (First part-right not to testify) \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to if he doesn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s his choice.\u201d (Second part-but do you feel the defendant should testify?) \u201cI feel he should get up and do it.\u201d Defense counsel essentially asked Kremer whether he personally preferred to hear from the defendant directly. Kremer gave a precise answer to the particular question posed, indicating that while the defendant had the right not to testify, he believed that the defendant should. It is commonly assumed that jurors would like to hear from the defendant personally and, given the phrasing of this question, it should come as no surprise that Kremer\u2019s answer reflected this common assumption. However, his expression of this common view was not an error about the right of the defendant not to testify, and even if incorrect, it is not unusual for jurors to come to the process with an incorrect or mistaken view. The critical concern is whether they are willing to lay their personal view aside and apply the law as given. Kremer clearly was. \u00b629 The Court maintains that \u201cKremer maintained that he would require a defendant to testify notwithstanding court instructions to the contrary.\u201d However, I do not believe that the record supports this statement. This conclusion is based on the question and answer quoted in \u00b6 14 of the Opinion, but the Court\u2019s quote does not reveal the entire context. First, the prosecutor asked Kremer a double-negative question: \u201cIf the judge tells you that you are not to consider [the defendant\u2019s failure to testify], you can set that aside and not let that enter into your deliberations?\u201d The meaning of Kremer\u2019s answer to these double-negatives-a simple \u201cNo\u201d-was not clear but, without asking any clarifying questions, the prosecutor then immediately stated, \u201cI ask that he not be excused, Your Honor.\u201d The District Court, apparently noticing the lack of clarity, asked two clarifying questions about Kremer\u2019s willingness to follow the instructions and Kremer gave strong, clear answers to both, explaining he would follow the law-consistent with the proper answers he gave initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u00b630 I do not believe the answers of the juror here rise to the level of a \u201cserious question about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial,\u201d which we noted in <em>Hausauer, </em>\u00b6 29. The prospective juror\u2019s answers in <em>Hausauer </em>were clearly incorrect from the beginning, and were surrendered only in virtually the last question she was asked, after extensive questioning. <em>Hausauer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-27. In contrast, Kremer gave initially correct answers, followed by unclear answers to unclear questions from both counsel, and then gave correct answers to clear questions by the Court. To be sure, the cold record could leave some doubt, depending on what one draws from the transcript, but this is why we have held \u201c[bjecause the trial court is best able to observe the jurors and to decide the potential for prejudice ... the trial court has <em>significant latitude </em>when ruling on such matters. [Citation omitted.] This Court gives the trial court\u2019s determination <em>considerable weight </em>and will defer to that determination ....\u201d <em>State v. Hatten, </em>1999 MT 298, \u00b6 28, 297 Mont. 127, \u00b6 28, 991 P.2d 939, \u00b6 28 (emphasis added). Here, it is not clear to me that Kremer had a bias or improper view which he would not surrender. I would thus defer to the observations of the District Court and conclude that it did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b631 I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
