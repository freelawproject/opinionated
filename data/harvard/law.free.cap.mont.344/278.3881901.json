We reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">\u00b62 On June 13,2002, a twenty-six-year-old man named Phillip Smith was killed when his automobile collided with a BNSF train at the Hesper railroad crossing outside of Billings, Montana. On August 25, 2004, his daughter, appellant Amelia Smith (Smith), filed a wrongful death and survival action against BNSF in the District Court of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County. Smith\u2019s suit sought compensatory and punitive damages based on BNSF\u2019s alleged negligence in the maintenance of the Hesper crossing and its negligent operation of the train involved in the collision. A significant portion of Smith\u2019s claims revolved around allegations that BNSF was negligent in the installation of warning devices at the Hesper crossing which would adequately protect people who were traveling along the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b63 On April 26, 2006, BNSF moved for partial summary judgment seeking an order that Smith\u2019s state law claims concerning the adequacy of the warning devices at the Hesper crossing were preempted by federal law in accordance with <em>Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Shanklin, </em>529 U.S. 344, 120 S. Ct. 1467 (2000). In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that when federal funds are used to install warning devices at railroad crossings, the Federal Railway Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA), Pub. L. No. 91-458, 84 Stat. 971 (1970), preempts state law tort claims. <em>Shanklin, </em>529 U.S. at 357, 120 S. Ct. at 1476. It was BNSF\u2019s contention that federal funds had been used to upgrade the Hesper crossing under project RRP 4139, ajoint statewide project between the Montana Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) under the Federal Rail-Highway Crossings Program (Crossings Program). Project RRP 4139 was designed to replace existing crossbucks at designated railway crossings with double reflectorized crossbucks-i.e., crossbucks with reflective material on the back and front of both the crossbucks-in accordance with the standards set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. BNSF maintained that double reflectorized crossbucks had been installed at Hesper crossing under project RRP 4139, and thus Smith\u2019s state law tort claims were preempted by federal law as set forth in <em>Shanklin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b64 The District Court held a hearing on the motion on July 21, and granted partial summary judgment to BNSF on August 3, 2006. The District Court found that those state law tort claims which were premised upon the adequacy of the warning devices at Hesper crossing were federally preempted under <em>Shanklin </em>because: (1) the federal government had approved a project to install warning devices at several hundred railroad crossings in Montana; (2) these improvements were actually completed; and (3) federal funds were actually used to complete these projects, including the installation of double reflectorized crossbucks at the Hesper crossing. Although Smith had alleged some state law claims which were unaffected by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ruling, the grant of partial summary judgment effectively disposed of a huge portion of Smith\u2019s case against BNSF. Therefore, on August 14, 2006, the District Court certified its ruling on the federal preemption issue as a final judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b65 A notice of appeal was filed with this Court on August 26, 2006. On August 8, 2007, after the case was fully briefed, Smith petitioned this Court for leave to file supplemental briefs. Smith argued that Section 1528 of the \u201cImplementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007\u201d (9/11 Act), Pub. L. No. 110-53,121 Stat. 266 (2007), signed into law by President Bush on August 3, 2007, essentially rendered moot the <em>Shanklin </em>preemption analysis upon which the District Court based its decision to grant partial summary judgment. Smith asked us to reexamine the continued viability of the <em>Shanklin </em>preemption analysis, and, consequently, the legal basis for the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. We granted Smith\u2019s motion, allowing BNSF and Smith to simultaneously file supplemental briefs \u201cdirected solely to the ramification of the [9/11] Act upon this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b66 Both parties have filed supplemental briefs on this issue, and the matter is now properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b67 We state the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u00b68 Issue One: Does Section 1528 of the 9/11 Act overrule the federal preemption analysis from <em>Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Shanklin </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\u00b69 Issue Two: Did the District Court err when it granted partial summary judgment to BNSF?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">\u00b610 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, using the same standards applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Rich v. Ellingson, </em>2007 MT 346, \u00b6 12, 340 Mont. 285, \u00b6 12, 174 P.3d 491, \u00b6 12. The moving party has the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Rich, </em>\u00b6 12. Once the moving party has met this burden, the non-moving party must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of the case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Rich, </em>\u00b6 12. \u201cThe non-moving party must set forth specific facts and cannot simply rely upon their pleadings, nor upon speculative, fanciful, or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Hiebert v. Cascade Co., </em>2002 MT 233, \u00b6 21, 311 Mont. 471, \u00b6 21, 56 P.3d 848, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>21 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b611 We review the conclusions of law upon which the district court bases its decision to determine if they are correct. <em>Rich, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b612 Issue One: <em>Does Section 1528 of the 9 111 Act overrule the federal preemption analysis from Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Shanklin?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b613 In <em>Shanklin </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]hen the FHWA approves a crossing improvement project and the State installs the warning devices using federal funds ... [federal law] establishes] a federal standard for the adequacy of those devices that displaces state tort law addressing the same subject ... [and] pre-empts state tort actions.\u201d <em>Shanklin, </em>529 U.S. at 357-58, 120 S. Ct. at 1476. In addition to the preemptive force of the Supremacy Clause to the U.S Constitution, U.S. Const. Art. IV. cl. 2, the <em>Shanklin </em>decision rested on two statutory grounds: (1) the \u201cpreemption clause\u201d of FRSA, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20106 (1994); and (2) regulations promulgated by the FHWA under the authority of the Secretary of Transportation-found at 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 646.214(b)(3) and (4) (1999)-conceming the design and adequacy of railway crossing warning devices installed under the Crossings Program. <em>Shanklin, </em>529 U.S. at 347-49, 120 S. Ct. at 1471-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b614 Section 1528 of the 9/11 Act amended the preemption clause of FRSA upon which the holding in <em>Shanklin </em>was premised. From the time <em>Shanklin </em>was decided in 2000 until the passage of the 9/11 Act in 2007, the FRSA preemption clause read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">\u00a7 20106 National uniformity of regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">Laws, regulations, and orders related to railroad safety shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.

After the passage of Section 1528, the FRSA preemption clause reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkB\">\u00a7 20106 Preemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-3\">(a) National uniformity of regulation.-(l) Laws, regulations, and orders related to railroad safety and laws, regulations, and orders related to railroad security shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">(2) A State may adopt or continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to railroad safety or security until the Secretary of Transportation (with respect to railroad safety matters), or the Secretary of Homeland Security (with respect to railroad security matters), prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the State requirement.

More importantly, BNSF points out that subsection (b)( 1)(C) of the clarifying amendment specifically states that a state claim survives only if it is \u201cnot incompatible with subsection (a)(2).\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 20106(b)(1)(C) (West Supp. 2007). BNSF maintains that subsection (a)(2) refers directly back to the original preemption clause which was analyzed in <em>Shanklin, </em>meaning that unless one of the local hazard exceptions to preemption from subsections (a)(2)(A), (B), or (C) apply, the original FRSA preemption analysis from <em>Shanklin </em>remains in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b619 As further support of its argument that Section 1528 did not overrule the <em>Shanklin </em>preemption analysis, BNSF points to the House of Representatives Conference Report on Section 1528 which specifically states that the Section 1528 amendment was passed \u201cto rectify the federal court decisions related to the Minot, North Dakota accident that are in conflict with precedent.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rpt. 110-259 at 351 (July 25,2007) (reprinted in 153 Cong. Rec. H8589-90 (daily ed. July 25, 2007)). The Minot accident was an incident where a train derailment near Minot, North Dakota released a cloud of anhydrous ammonia which allegedly caused multiple personal injuries and incidents of property damage. Claims brought against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company by the affected individuals were dismissed by federal district courts on the grounds that they were federally preempted under <em>Shanklin. See e.g., Mehl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Ltd., </em>417 F. Supp. 2d 1104 (D.N.D. 2006); <em>Lundeen v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., </em>507 F. Supp. 2d 1006 (D. Minn. 2007). The claimants <em>in Mehl </em>and <em>Lundeen </em>alleged that Canadian Pacific had breached a federal standard of care, <em>Mehl, </em>417 F. Supp. 2d at 1116, and its own internal procedures, <em>Lundeen, </em>507 F. Supp. 2d at 1013, ultimately leading to the derailment. However, the federal district courts in each case found that these claims were preempted under the FRSA preemption clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The Section 1528 amendments to FRSA remedied these situations by limiting its preemptive effect in cases where the claimant alleges the defendant breached a federal standard of care or its own operating procedures. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201060(b)(1)(A) and (B) (West Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"Aa_m\">\u00b620 In light of the fact that the Conference Report explicitly states that Section 1528 was aimed at overruling these federal court decisions, BNSF argues it makes little sense to maintain that Congress also meant to overrule <em>Shanklin </em>but yet somehow failed to mention it, especially given the fact that <em>Shanklin </em>is a landmark decision that has been followed by numerous courts over the years. As further support for its construction of Section 1528, BNSF points to a proposed provision to the 9/11 Act by House Representative Bennie Thompson (D-MS) which would have eliminated federal preemption of state law claims under FRSA \u201cunless compliance with State law would make compliance with Federal requirements impossible.\u201d H.R. 1401, 110th Cong. \u00a7 3(a) (March 28,2007). As BNSF notes, the Thompson proposal was rejected by the Senate and President Bush in the final version of the 9/11 Act, thus lending further support to its view that Congress did not overrule the <em>Shanklin </em>preemption analysis in enacting Section 1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">\u00b621 In order to demonstrate that Section 1528 has overruled the preemption analysis from <em>Shanklin, </em>Smith has the burden of proving that Congress intended this change when it passed Section 1528. <em>Green v. Bock Laundry Mach. Co., </em>490 U.S. 504, 521, 109 S. Ct. 1981, 1991 (1989); <em>Tome v. United States, </em>513 U.S. 150, 163, 115 S. Ct. 696, 704 (1995). Smith, however, has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b622 The starting point for statutory interpretation is the plain language of the statute itself. <em>United States v. Hanousek, </em>176 F.3d 1116, 1120 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>Sturchio v. Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>2007 MT 311, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 141, \u00b6 10, 172 P.3d 1260, \u00b6 10. In this case, the plain language of Section 1528 supports BNSF\u2019s construction of the statute. Because Smith\u2019s claims allege BNSF violated state tort law, and not a federal standard of care or its own plan, rule or standard, the exceptions listed in subsections (b)(1)(A) or (B) do not apply to her claims <em>(see </em>\u00b6 16); thus, Smith\u2019s state law claims will survive federal preemption only if they are \u201cnot incompatible with subsection (a)(2).\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 20106(b)(1)(C) (West Supp. 2007). Subsection (a)(2), however, makes clear that if a federal law, regulation, or order has been adopted by the Secretary of Transportation, then a state law or standard respecting that subject matter is preempted. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 20106(a)(2) (West Supp. 2007). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Federal regulations concerning the design and adequacy of railway crossing warning devices have been promulgated by the FHWA, which acts under the authority of the Secretary of Transportation. <em>See </em>\u00b6 13. Thus, Smith\u2019s claims will be preempted under Section 1528 provided the criteria discussed in <em>Shanklin </em>have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b623 We find BNSF\u2019s supporting arguments which cite to the legislative history of Section 1528 persuasive as well. The final version of Section 1528 rejected a proposal which would have eliminated federal preemption outright unless it made compliance with federal requirements impossible. <em>See </em>\u00b6 20. As BNSF notes, Congress is generally presumed \u201cknowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation it enacts ....\u201d <em>Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, </em>486 U.S. 174, 184-85, 108 S. Ct. 1704, 1712 (1988). Moreover, Congress \u201cdoes not intend <em>sub silentio </em>to enact statutory language that it has earlier disregarded in favor of other language.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 442-43, 107 S. Ct. 1207, 1219 (1987) (quotation omitted). The Conference Report to Section 1528 explicitly states it is enacted to remedy the rulings from the Minot derailment federal district court cases, and makes no mention of <em>Shanklin. </em>In light of these facts, Smith\u2019s argument that Section 1528 was enacted to overrule <em>Shanklin </em>and its progeny finds scant support and is contrary to settled law. \u201cThe normal rule of statutory construction is that if Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific.\u201d <em>Midlantic Nat. Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of Envtl. Protec., </em>474 U.S. 494, 501, 106 S. Ct. 755, 759 (1986) (citing <em>Edmonds v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, </em>433 U.S. 256, 266-67, 99 S. Ct. 2753, 2759-60 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b624  For these reasons, we hold that Section 1528 of the 9/11 Act did not overrule the FRSA preemption analysis as announced in <em>Shanklin. </em>Therefore, we now turn to the merits of Smith\u2019s original appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b625 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court err when it granted partial summary judgment to BNSF?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b626 In granting partial summary judgment to BNSF, the District Court found BNSF offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that federal funds were expended to upgrade the Hesper crossing. The first piece of evidence relied upon by the District Court was an affidavit submitted by BNSF in conjunction with its summary judgment motion from John Althof (Althof), an employee of MDOT who had the responsibility of overseeing and managing railroad improvement programs throughout Montana. Although Althof did not have personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>knowledge that federal funds were expended at the Hesper crossing, he reviewed a number of documents related to project RRP 4139. Of those documents, only the following were attached to his affidavit: (1) an agreement between the State and BNSF dated September 30,1988 (Agreement), which stated that all public crossings in Montana would receive federal funds for project RRP 4139; (2) an unverified lump sum estimate for project RRP 4139; and (3) a blank railroad crossing installation form.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b627 Based on his review of various records related to the project, Althof stated in his affidavit that the State of Montana undertook project RRP 4139 in 1988, which included the installation of double reflectorized crossbucks at seven hundred and twenty-three crossings in the BNSF Montana division of the State of Montana. He further stated that the federal government approved the use of federal funds for project RRP 4139 through the FHWA. Althof additionally stated that the Hesper crossing was designated United States Department of Transportation Crossing No. 088451Y, and that BNSF had a bill showing that crossing No. 088451Y was included in project RRP 4139. Thus, Althof s review of the records pertaining to this case led him to conclude that federal funds were used in the installation of double reflectorized crossbucks at the Hesper crossing. In its order, the District Court noted that this affidavit was very similar to an affidavit cited in Lee <em>v. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>245 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2001), where Judge Molloy had found that the <em>Shanklin </em>analysis was satisfied and similar claims preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b628 In addition to the affidavit itself, the District Court found persuasive other documentary evidence of the RRP 4139 project which BNSF submitted in conjunction with its summary judgment motion. One piece of evidence, which was attached to BNSF\u2019s reply brief, was a \u201cCertificate of Completion,\u201d dated May 23, 1991, which stated that that project RRP 4139 had been inspected and its completion duly verified by state officials with MDOT. Another piece of evidence, which was originally attached to BNSF\u2019s motion for summary judgment, was a bill from BNSF to the State, dated May 8, 1989, in the amount of $57,327.20, which showed that BNSF billed the State for the installation of double reflectorized crossbucks at the Hesper crossing, which was designated at milepost #4.1, with the number 088-451-Y.</p>\n<p id=\"ALU\">\u00b629 The District Court also relied on an affidavit supplied by BNSF from Verle Ostrander (Ostrander), a former employee of BNSF who stated he was personally familiar with the railroad grade crossbuck update project undertaken in Montana between 1988 and 1989. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Ostrander stated that he also had reviewed the documents related to project RRP 4139, as well as the Althof affidavit and a similar affidavit relied upon by the federal district court in <em>Lee, </em>and concluded that double reflectorized crossbucks were installed at the Hesper crossing by the use of federal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b630 Lastly, the District Court relied on a deposition taken by Smith of Robert Tholt (Tholt), the MDOT construction supervisor who was one of the persons who had signed the Certificate of Completion in 1991. Tholt stated in his deposition that although he did not have any specific memory of the Hesper crossing, his staff would have verified all the documentation related to that project, and that the project at the Hesper crossing would have been properly checked before a Certificate of Completion had been signed and approved by him. Like Althof and Ostrander, Tholt\u2019s deposition was also based on a review of documents supplied by BNSF related to the alleged upgrade at the Hesper crossing under project RRP 4139.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b631 Smith challenges the propriety of the District Court reliance on these affidavits and supporting exhibits, arguing that they should have been stricken from its consideration by virtue of M. R. Civ. P. 56(e). For authority on this point, Smith cites to the plain language of M. R. Civ. P. 56(e) and our decisions addressing the evidentiary requirements of this Rule in <em>Hiebert </em>and <em>Disler v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>2000 MT 304, 302 Mont. 391, 15 P.3d 864. In particular, Smith alleges that none of the affiants actually had personal knowledge that federal funds were spent in upgrading the Hesper crossing and, further, that they did not have personal knowledge sufficient to establish the genuineness and authenticity of many of the documents which were considered by the District Court in the summary judgment proceedings. For instance, in Althof s deposition he conceded that he had no personal knowledge that federal funds actually went into the improvements at Hesper crossing. Althof did, however, testify to the genuineness of the Agreement. Similarly, while Tholt had signed the Certificate of Completion, upon examination in his deposition he stated that his staff had actually prepared the document and he did not have any personal knowledge as to whether the project was completed, but rather assumed his staff had properly reviewed all the project documents. With respect to Ostrander\u2019s affidavit, Smith argues in the first instance that it was improperly considered by the District Court because this affidavit was first presented in BNSF\u2019s reply brief to the partial summary judgment motion and Smith was never given an opportunity to depose him. Additionally, Smith points out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>nowhere in his affidavit does Ostrander state that he had personal knowledge that federal funds were used at the Hesper crossing. More importantly, however, Smith maintains that these affiants lacked the requisite personal knowledge which would allow them to testify to the genuineness and contents of the documents upon which they relied in making their sworn statements as required under M. R. Civ. P. 56(e) and <em>Hiebert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">\u00b632 Thus, Smith argues, because these affidavits and supporting exhibits were not based on the personal knowledge of any of the affiants as required under M. R. Civ. P. 56(e), they were improperly considered by the District Court. Smith maintains that under <em>Duncan v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., </em>773 So.2d 670 (La. 2000), <em>Mo. Pacific R.R. Co. v. Limmer, </em>180 S.W.3d 803 (Tex. App. 14 Dist. 2005), and <em>Bonacorsi v. Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Ry. Co., </em>767 N.E.2d 707 (Ohio 2002), BNSF was required to \u201cconclusively prove\u201d that federal funds were used to upgrade the Hesper crossing, but has failed to meet this evidentiary burden under M. R. Civ. P. 56(e) and thus is not entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b633 Additionally, Smith argues that genuine issues of material fact regarding the use of federal funds at the Hesper crossing exist in this case which preclude the District Court from granting summary judgment to BNSF. For instance, Smith points out that under the terms of the Certificate of Completion, there shall be submitted an \u201cExhibit C\u201d showing that the particular crossing was actually upgraded. In this case, BNSF was unable to provide an Exhibit C for the Hesper crossing. Moreover, Smith contacted officials from MDOT to inquire whether the State ever actually paid BNSF for work done at the Hesper crossing under RRP 4139, or whether the State had any actual knowledge as to when such double reflectorized crossbucks were installed. MDOT, however, did not have in its records a definitive answer to this question. Lastly, Smith maintains that an affidavit it submitted from a Ms. Erna Love, a longtime resident of the area around Hesper crossing, created a genuine issue of material fact because she stated that crossbucks had been at the Hesper crossing since 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b634 Accordingly, Smith argues that the District Court erred in granting partial summary judgment to BNSF because BNSF did not comply with the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 56(e), and failed to demonstrate a complete absence of any genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether federal funds were actually expended to install double reflectorized crossbucks at the Hesper crossing. Smith argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>that, at a minimum, BNSF should be required to prove to a jury that federal funds were expended at the Hesper crossing improvements, thus triggering federal law preemption under Shanklin, and maintains that a grant of partial summary judgment on this issue was error. Accordingly, Smith asks us to reverse the grant of partial summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings. Further, Smith requests that we hold that BNSF has failed as matter of law on its federal preemption argument, and that this defense be stricken, thereby allowing Smith to pursue her state law claims against BNSF.</p>\n<p id=\"AXX\">\u00b635 BNSF urges us to affirm the District Court. BNSF maintains it presented sufficient evidence to prove that federal funds were used at the Hesper crossing through project RRP 4139, thus triggering preemption under <em>Shanklin. </em>BNSF points to a number cases where courts have found that federal preemption under <em>Shanklin </em>was triggered when a party presented evidence that federal funding was approved in a state-wide project, and that a particular crossing was included in that project. <em>E.g., O\u2019Bannon v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., </em>169 F.3d 1088 (8th Cir. 1999); <em>McDaniel v. Southern Pacific Transp., </em>932 F. Supp. 163 (N.D. Tex. 1995); <em>Hargrove v. Missouri Pacific R.R. Co., </em>925 So.2d 25 (La. App. 3 Cir. 2006); <em>Wagoner v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>246 F. Supp. 2d 1002 (N. D. Ind. 2003); <em>Security First Bank v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>213 F. Supp. 2d 1087 (D. Neb. 2002); <em>Lee, </em>245 F.3d 1102. BNSF further asserts that the District Court was correct to refuse to impose a special evidentiary requirement by requiring BNSF to \u201cconclusively prove\u201d that federal funds were actually spent at Hesper crossing. BNSF argues that such an evidentiary ruling would be at odds with other courts that have analyzed federal preemption on summary judgment motions under <em>Shanklin, </em>such as <em>OBannon </em>and <em>Wagoner. </em>In this regard, BNSF argues that <em>Limmer </em>and <em>Duncan </em>are inapposite. BNSF also argues that imposing a higher evidentiary burden on its federal preemption defense would impermissibly defeat the federal policy of preemption as expressed in FRSA, and cites to <em>Davis v. Wechsler, </em>263 U.S. 22, 44 S. Ct. 13 (1923), and <em>Brown v. Western Ry. Of Al., </em>338 U.S. 294, 70 S. Ct. 105 (1950) in support of this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b636 BNSF maintains that by virtue of the affidavits and the documentary exhibits attached thereto, it has met its burden under M. R. Civ. P. 56 and established that federal funds were used to install double reflectorized crossbucks at Hesper crossing. Moreover, BNSF argues that because Althof s testimony was based on matters within the scope of his duties as MDOT manager of grade crossings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>improvements, it should be considered based on his personal knowledge under <em>Barthelemy v. Air Line Pilots Assn., </em>897 F.2d 999 (9th Cir. 1990), and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in considering his affidavit in support of BNSF\u2019s summary judgment motion. Similarly, BNSF objects to Smith\u2019s suggestion that the state and business records attached to BNSF\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be stricken, asserting that they fall within the M. R. Evid. 803 exception to the hearsay rule for public and business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b637 As a result, BNSF argues that it has shifted the burden to Smith to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact, and Smith has failed to do so. BNSF argues that the lack of an Exhibit C, <em>see </em>\u00b6 33, does not raise a genuine issue of material fact because, even though this document cannot be produced, BNSF did produce the Certificate of Completion showing that project RRP 4139 had been completed. BNSF points to the deposition of Tholt, wherein he stated that such a certificate would not have been issued by MDOT and signed by him unless that project had been fully and satisfactorily completed. BNSF argues that the installation of double reflectorized crossbucks at the Hesper crossing was also confirmed by an inventory taken of that site by MDOT on March 1, 1989. BSNF asserts this is confirmed by Ostrander\u2019s affidavit wherein he stated that such an inventory reflects that project RRP 4139 had been completed at the Hesper crossing. BNSF argues that such state documents are entitled to a presumption of regularity, making summary judgment proper. Lastly, BNSF maintains the affidavit of Erna Love does not raise a genuine issue of material fact for the simple reason that her affidavit says nothing about the presence of double reflectorized crossbucks (which BNSF maintains were installed under project RRP 4139, <em>see </em>\u00b6 3), but only that there were crossbucks present at the Hesper crossing prior to the upgrade under RRP 4139.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b638 The threshold question before us is whether BNSF met its evidentiary burden under M. R. Civ. P. 56 by demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Rich, </em>\u00b6 12. As we stated in <em>Hiebert </em>\u201c[i]t is well-settled that during summary judgment proceedings, the parties must limit affidavits to evidence that would be otherwise admissible pursuant to the rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Hiebert, </em>\u00b6 29. For affidavits to be admissible, they must be based on personal knowledge as provided for in M. R. Civ. P. 56(e), which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Rule 56(e). Form of affidavits-further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>testimony-defense required. Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b639  This \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d must be based on \u201cfirsthand observation or experience, as distinguished from a belief based on what someone else has said.\u201d <em>Hiebert, </em>\u00b6 30 (quotation omitted). Affidavits made without personal knowledge and based on hearsay evidence should not be considered in a motion for summary judgment. <em>Hiebert, </em>\u00b6 30. However, exhibits can be submitted in support of an affidavit for purposes of M. R. Civ. P. 56, so long as they are accompanied by an affidavit or sworn discovery response of an individual with personal knowledge of their genuineness, relevance, and contents, or there is a foundation laid for such exhibits \u201cbased on any exception to the rule excluding hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>Hiebert, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-32; <em>Disler, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b640 BNSF suggests in its briefs that a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on summary judgment motions should be reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard; however, it cites no authority which directly supports this proposition save for <em>Barthelemy. Barthelemy </em>does seem to suggest that evidentiary rulings in the summary judgment context are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Barthelemy, </em>897 F.2d at 1018 <em>(citing Kisor v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>783 F.2d 1337, 1340 (9th Cir. 1986)). However, a cursory review of <em>Barthelemy </em>shows that it is flawed precedent on this point for the simple reason that <em>Kisor, </em>upon which <em>Barthelemy </em>is premised, did not involve evidentiary rulings in the summary judgment context, but instead concerned an evidentiary ruling in the course of a normal jury trial. <em>Kisor, </em>783 F.2d at 1338-40. Thus, we do not find <em>Barthelemy </em>persuasive authority. While we acknowledge that some courts have applied the abuse of discretion standard to evidentiary rulings in the context of summary judgment proceedings, <em>e.g., International Biochemical Industries, Inc. v. Jamestown Management Corp., </em>586 S.E.2d 442, 447 (Ga. App. 2003), we believe this approach is at odds with the fact that we review summary judgment decisions under a de novo standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b641 It is true that we do review some ancillary rulings in the summary judgment context under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Envtl. Contractors, LLC v. Moon, </em>1999 MT 178, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 268, \u00b6 19, 983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>P.2d 390, \u00b6 19 (reviewing the denial of a motion to continue discovery filed during summary judgment proceedings for an abuse of discretion). However, we have never held that evidentiary rulings going directly to the propriety of summary judgment are also reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Instead, under our case law, strict compliance with Rule 56(e) is required, and we review de novo whether the evidentiary requirements of Rule 56(e) have been satisfied. In <em>Herron v. Columbus Hosp., </em>284 Mont. 190, 943 P.2d 1272 (1997), for instance, we affirmed a district court grant of summary judgment, finding that the moving party had met its initial burden, but the non-moving party failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact because his affidavit did not comply with Rule 56(e). \u201cAn affidavit submitted in a summary judgment proceeding must be based on the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge of the facts set forth. Rule 56(e), M.R.Civ.P. If an affidavit does not comply with the requirements of Rule 56(e), it does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Herron, </em>284 Mont. at 196, 943 P.2d at 1276 (citing <em>Cooper v. Sisters of Charity, </em>265 Mont. 205, 208, 875 P.2d 352, 354 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b642  This same standard should also apply to a party moving for summary judgment and attempting to demonstrate an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, we hold that if a moving partys affidavit does not comply with the requirements of M R. Civ. P. 56(e), it does not demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b643 In this case, the affiants\u2019 \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d was not from firsthand knowledge or experience, but was based upon a review of documents related to project RRP 4139 and the alleged installation of double reflectorized crossbucks at the Hesper crossing. For instance, the affidavit of Althof was based on his review of several documents which were attached to his affidavit: The Agreement between the State and BNSF for the statewide installation of crossbucks under project RRP 4139; various records produced by BNSF related to project RRP 4139, including the Certificate of Completion; and a bill from BNSF to the State for the installation of double reflectorized crossbucks at the Hesper crossing. Althof establishes an adequate foundation for the Agreement because he states that \u201cit is a true and correct copy of the Agreement for Montana Highway Project RRP 4139.\u201d However, he does not establish a foundation for either the Certificate of Completion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the bill from BNSF, or the other documents upon which he relied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AT\">\u00b644 In his affidavit Ostrander reviewed the Althof affidavit and the affidavit submitted in <em>Lee (see </em>\u00b6 29), as well as a grade crossing inventory form of the Hesper crossing dated March 1,1989. Ostrander did not attest to the genuineness of the exhibits upon which he and the other affiants relied, nor did BNSF lay a foundation for these documents under an exception to the hearsay rule. Similarly, the deposition of Tholt shows that his testimony was based upon a number of documents prepared by BNSF, to which he could not personally testify as to their genuineness and contents, and which also had not been admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule. Because Tholt signed the Certificate of Completion, it is possible that he could properly authenticate this document even though he admitted during his deposition that he had not personally prepared the document and did not personally review the documents related project RRP 4139. With the exception of the Agreement, and the possible exception of the Certificate of Completion, none of the affiants personally attested to the genuineness and veracity of the BNSF bill, and the other documents upon which they relied, based on their personal knowledge, nor did they affirmatively lay a foundation therefore under an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b645 While BNSF claims it could establish a foundation for these documents under the public and business records exception to the hearsay rule, M. R. Evid. 803, the fact is it did not do so, either in its briefs, affidavits, or in oral argument before the District Court. On the other hand, Smith did not allege that the exhibits themselves were fraudulent or inauthentic, nor did Smith move to strike any of the exhibits under the Montana Rules of Evidence. Instead, Smith lodged a generalized objection to the affidavits and their supporting exhibits, based on the lack of the affiants\u2019 personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b646 Moreover, while Smith argues the affiants lack the personal knowledge to give testimony under Rule 56(e), she does not allege that these records upon which they based their testimony would necessarily be inadmissible under the Montana Rules of Evidence. As a result, we are confronted with this question: When the non-moving party argues an affiant lacks the personal knowledge to establish the exhibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>themselves are admissible, must the party moving for summary judgment lay a foundation for each exhibit it asks the court to rely upon in support of its motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">\u00b647 Although we have not yet addressed this precise issue, the rule governing these situations has been stated by the Ninth Circuit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">It is well established that unauthenticated documents cannot be considered on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Canada v. Blain\u2019s Helicopters, Inc., </em>831 F.2d 920, 925 (9th Cir. 1987). To be considered by the court, \u201cdocuments must be authenticated by and attached to an affidavit that meets the requirements of [Rule] 56(e) and the affiant must be a person through whom the exhibits could be admitted into evidence.\u201d Id.; <em>see also </em>10A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2722 at 58-60 (2d ed. 1983). A document which lacks a proper foundation to authenticate it cannot be used to support a motion for summary judgment. <em>Canada, </em>831 F.2d at 925; <em>Hamilton v. Keystone Tankship Corp., </em>539 F.2d 684, 686 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Dibble, </em>429 F.2d 598, 601-602 (9th Cir. 1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\"><em>Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner and Co., Inc., </em>896 F.2d 1542, 1550-51 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b648 It appears this rule is followed by many other courts. <em>E.g., Martin v. John W. Stone Oil Distributor, Inc., </em>819 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir. 1987); <em>Carmona v. Toledo, </em>215 F.3d 124, 131 (1st Cir. 2000); <em>Orsi v. Kirkwood, </em>999 F.2d 86, 92 (4th Cir. 1993); <em>Guidry v. Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>418 F. Supp. 2d 835, 839 (M.D. La. <em>2006);In re Northgate Computer Systems, Inc., </em>240 B.R. 328, 338 (Bankr. D. Minn. 1999); <em>see also </em>Wright, Miller and Kane, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>vol. 10A, \u00a7 2722 n. 40, 382-84 (3d ed. West 1998) (collecting numerous other authorities in support of this proposition). We determine it appropriate to adopt this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b649 There are two exceptions to this general rule which are arguably applicable to the instant case. The first is an exception for self-authenticating documents. \u201cEach document submitted in support of summary judgment must be either properly authenticated, or must be self-authenticating under the Federal Rules [of Evidence].\u201d <em>Goguen v. Textron, Inc., </em>234 F.R.D. 13, 16 (D. Mass 2006). In Montana, M. R. Evid. 902, the counterpart to the federal rule discussed in <em>Goguen, </em>governs self-authenticating documents. M. R. Evid. 902 provides ten categories of documents for which \u201c[e]xtrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to admissibility is not required ....\u201d These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>include: (1) Domestic public documents under seal; (2) Domestic public documents not under seal; (3) Foreign public documents; (4) Certified copies of public records; (5) Official publications; (6) Newspaper and periodicals; (7) Trade inscriptions and the like; (8) Acknowledged documents; (9) Commercial paper and related documents; and (10) Presumptions created by law. M. R. Evid. 902(1) through (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b650 In this case, Althof has properly authenticated the Agreement. The question remains, therefore, whether the other documents relating to project RRP 4139 supplied by BNSF-including the Certificate of Completion and the bill from BNSF-were properly considered. The BNSF bill does not fall into any of categories described in M. R. Evid. 902, and instead is more akin to a business record which may be admitted under M. R. Evid. 803(6). Neither does the Certificate of Completion fall into any of these categories. Although the Certificate was presumptively created and maintained by the State, it was not certified as required in subsection (4), nor does it meet the requirements in subsection (2), because there has been no certification from a \u201cpublic officer having a seal and having official duties in the district or political subdivision of the officer or employee ... under seal that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.\u201d M. R. Evid. 902(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b651 A second exception applies in situations where the moving party fails to lay a proper foundation for an exhibit, but the court\u2019s consideration of that document amounts to harmless error under the circumstances of the case. In <em>Hal Roach Studios, </em>for instance, the Ninth Circuit found that a moving party failed to lay a proper foundation for a particular exhibit, an S-l Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as required under Fed. R. Evid. 901(b) in support of a summary judgment motion. <em>Hal Roach Studios, </em>896 F.2d at 1550-51. Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit concluded this failure was harmless error because: (1) the moving party had submitted a declaration of a corporate officer who could have authenticated the document by virtue of his official position under Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(1) and his personal knowledge regarding the contents of the document; and (2) both parties had submitted copies of the Registration Statement to the district court. <em>Hal Roach Studios, </em>896 F.2d at 1551; <em>accord Bias v. Moynihan, </em>508 F.3d 1212, 1224 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b652 Because, as established above, these documents are not self-authenticating, the only other possible basis for accepting them is that their consideration amounts to \u201charmless error,\u201d meaning that \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>competent witness with personal knowledge <em>could </em>have authenticated the document.\u201d <em>Burch v. Regents of the U. of Cal., </em>433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1120 (E.D. Ca. 2006) (citing <em>Hal Roach Studios, </em>896 F.2d at 1552). Here, none of the affiants could have testified to the genuineness and authenticity of the BNSF bill because none of the affiants had seen the BNSF bill prior to its production by BNSF. The Certificate of Completion presents a slightly different situation because Tholt had actually signed this document in his official state capacity. Thus, Tholt could have authenticated this document under M. R. Evid. 902(2), and so its consideration amounts to harmless error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b653 However, the BNSF bill, and the other documents upon which the affiants relied, are not covered by the harmless error exception to the requirement that documents in support of a summary judgment motion must be properly authenticated by the moving party. Thus, the BNSF bill should not have been considered by the District Court in granting summary judgment to BNSF. Similarly, the affiants and Tholt should not have been permitted to rely on the BNSF bill, and any other unauthenticated and unspecified documents, in support of BNSF\u2019s motion under the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Thus, we cannot affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in this case. \u201cIf there is any doubt as to the propriety of a motion for summary judgment, it should be denied.\u201d <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Cooperative, Inc., </em>271 Mont. 477, 480, 898 P.2d 690, 692 (1995) (citing <em>Rogers v. Swingley, </em>206 Mont. 306, 312, 670 P.2d 1386, 1389 (1983); <em>Cheyenne Western Bank v. Young, </em>179 Mont. 492, 496, 587 P.2d 401, 404 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"A17\">\u00b654 While BNSF has cited to a number of cases which support its position that the quantum of proof it has offered here was sufficient, none of these cases are particularly helpful because they present situations where the underlying admissibility of the affidavits and documents was either assumed or unchallenged. In <em>O\u2019Bannon </em>and <em>McDaniel, </em>for instance, there was no mention of a challenge to the admissibility of the evidence or affidavits under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>O\u2019Bannon, </em>169 F.3d at 1089-91; <em>McDaniel, </em>932 F. Supp. at 167-68. Similarly, in <em>Hargrove, </em>a Louisiana appeals court found that a witness without personal knowledge of the expenditure of federal funds at a railroad crossing gave credible testimony in support of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company\u2019s argument that federal funds had been expended in upgrading that crossing, but there is no indication in that case that the witness lacked personal knowledge of the documents upon which he relied in giving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>testimony. <em>Hargrove, </em>925 So.2d at 30-31; <em>see also Richardson v. Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., </em>923 So.2d 1002, 1009 (Miss. 2006); <em>Security First Bank, </em>213 F. Supp. 2d at 1090 (no discussion of whether documents attached to an affidavit must be admissible under hearsay exception); <em>Lee, </em>245 F.3d at 1106 (same); <em>Wagoner, </em>246 F. Supp. 2d at 1005-07 (no discussion of admissibility of exhibits attached to affidavit, and further, a declaration was presented by an affiant with personal knowledge that federal funds used at a crossing).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b655 In sum, the cases cited by BNSF do not displace the clear evidentiary requirements for summary judgment motions contained in M. R. Civ. P. 56 and the governing case law. While this is arguably a close case, and BNSF may well be correct that it can supply the proof necessary to ultimately prevail, the record establishes it has not yet done so for purposes of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b656  We hold that the District Court erred in concluding that BNSF was entitled to summary judgment, because BNSF failed to comply with the evidentiary requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 56(e). We decline to strike the federal preemption defense, as requested by Smith. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> In his affidavit, Althof states that he has \u201creviewed the records of the Montana Department of Transportation regarding the railroad crossing on Hesper Road in Yellowstone County, Montana.\u201d However, these records are neither further specified nor attached to his affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b322-8\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AHU\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u00b657 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court correctly reverses the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment because the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 56 were not met, for the reasons stated. However, so as to not be misleading I am constrained to state my opinion that Smith\u2019s success on appeal may yet prove to be a hollow victory.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u00b658 The Court\u2019s holding is contrary to Smith\u2019s position that most of her state law claims are not preempted by federal law, even if BNSF can prove that double reflectorized crossbucks were installed at the Hesper crossing using federal funds. As a fail-back position, Smith goes on to argue that in order to establish its preemption defense BNSF must conclusively prove that double reflectorized crossbucks were installed using federal funds. Such is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">\u00b659 There is no rule of evidence or law in Montana that would require that BNSF prove conclusively that double reflectorized crossbucks were installed using federal funds, notwithstanding Smith\u2019s citation to Mo. <em>Pacific v. Limmer, </em>180 S.W.3d. 803 (Tex. App. 2005), which case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>is inapposite.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 26-1-102(2)(b), MCA. The standard of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 26-1-402, 26-1-403(1), MCA, and circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for proof of any fact. <em>Dalbey v. Equitable Life Assur. Socy. of U.S., </em>105 Mont. 587, 599, 74 P.2d 432, 435 (1937); <em>In re Bragg\u2019s Est., </em>106 Mont. 132, 139, 76 P.2d 57, 60-61 (1938); <em>Jacques v. Mont. Natl. Guard, </em>199 Mont. 493, 496-97, 649 P.2d 1319, 1321 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b660 As Smith has presented nothing sufficient to raise a material issue of fact concerning the matter, should BNSF satisfy evidentiary and foundational requirements noted by the Court, after further proceedings on remand it might be entitled to summary judgment or a directed verdict on the issue of preemption.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-5\"> In Appellant\u2019s brief, <em>Mo.
