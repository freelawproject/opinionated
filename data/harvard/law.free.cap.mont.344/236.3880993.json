We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AJW\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by revoking Hinkle\u2019s youth court probation and imposing Hinkle\u2019s previously stayed twenty-year suspended sentence for negligent homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence by restricting Hinkle from playing games of chance or entering casinos?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">\u00b65 In June 2005, Hinkle and his best friend, Kyle McCracken, both age seventeen, were eating lunch in the cab of McCracken\u2019s pickup when a .22 caliber revolver that Hinkle was playing with discharged, striking McCracken in the head and killing him instantly. Hinkle admitted to detectives that he and McCracken were joking around with the gun when McCracken said \u201cgo ahead and shoot me,\u201d at which point the gun accidentally discharged. Hinkle was subsequently charged with negligent homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-104, MCA (2003). Because Hinkle was seventeen years old at the time of the offense, the county attorney filed an information in district court under \u00a7 41-5-206(2), MCA (2003). Thereafter, pursuant to a plea agreement, Hinkle pled \u201cTrue\u201d to the charge of negligent homicide and in return the county attorney agreed to recommend that he be \u201ccommitted to the Youth Court for a suspended placement in a treatment facility until age 18 or sooner released; formal juvenile probation until age 25 or sooner released; and a stayed adult sentence of 20 years to the Montana Department of Corrections ....\u201d The District Court \u201cconditionally accepted the terms of the binding plea agreement\u201d and transferred the matter to the Youth Court as an extended jurisdiction prosecution under \u00a7 41-5-1602, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>\u00b66 A </em>sentencing hearing was held March 6, 2006, and the District Court sentenced Hinkle in accordance with the plea agreement. Pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1604(l)(a)(ii), MCA, Hinkle was supplementally sentenced to an adult sentence of twenty years commitment to the Department of Corrections, with the sentence stayed on the condition that he not violate the provisions of the dispositional order and not commit a new offense. The court ordered Hinkle to fully comply with twenty-two conditions of his juvenile probation and warned him that \u201che would be held strictly accountable for any probation violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b67 Twelve days after the sentencing hearing, Hinkle was cited for being a minor in possession of alcohol. At an evidentiary hearing on April 17,2006, Hinkle admitted that he had violated two conditions of his youth court probation which required him to (1) \u201cobey all laws, court orders, rules of the home, and rules of probation\u201d and (2) \u201cprohibited [him] from possessing or consuming alcoholic beverages or any illicit drug or inhalant, except as prescribed by a licensed physician.\u201d The court revoked Hinkle\u2019s probation under the Youth Court Act and transferred the matter back to the District Court for further proceedings. A new pre-sentence investigation (PSI) was ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b68 During the dispositional hearing, the juvenile probation officer who supervised Hinkle and the adult probation officer who prepared Hinkle\u2019s PSI recommended that Hinkle be placed on adult probation and supervision. The PSI further recommended that Hinkle not be immediately incarcerated, \u201cthereby giving this Defendant another chance, but one with serious consequences should he falter.\u201d The PSI also included a psychological evaluation of Hinkle, stating that Hinkle\u2019s profile was disconcerting in the area of \u201cfearlessness,\u201d because Hinkle \u201cis likely to engage in risky or potentially life-threatening activities .... Perhaps more significantly, he is recklessly foolhardy, seemingly uninhibited by genuine hazards, and disposed to pursue truly perilous ventures.\u201d Last, the court read two letters into the record: a victim impact statement from McCracken\u2019s parents and a letter in support of Hinkle. The court commented that both letters typified the balancing of interests which the court faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b69 In imposing sentence, the court explained that it had considered a number of factors, including: (1) the negotiated agreement between the State and Hinkle that provided for imposition of an adult sentence if the conditions of youth probation were not followed; (2) that Hinkle should be held accountable because he violated the terms of his youth probation \u201cright out of the gate;\u201d (3) that the PSI did not indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Hinkle was unable to comply with the terms of his youth probation; (4) the testimony of the probation officers that the youth court was not \u201cfully equipped to monitor and effectively address probation and probation problems of an adult until age 25;\u201d and (5) the victim impact report submitted by McCracken\u2019s family. The court imposed the twenty-year adult sentence which had originally been stayed, but suspended that sentence subject to nineteen conditions. Condition 4 prohibited Hinkle from entering any casinos or playing any games of chance. Hinkle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b610 An offender who is not sentenced to a term of one year or more of actual incarceration is statutorily ineligible for sentence review by the Sentence Review Division (SRD). Section 46-18-903, MCA (2003). In such cases, we first review the sentence for legality to determine whether it falls within statutory parameters and, if so, we then examine whether the sentencing court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence. <em>State v. Armstrong, </em>2006 MT 334, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 131, \u00b6 8, 151 P.3d 46, \u00b6 8. An abuse of discretion occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>2005 MT 117, \u00b6 22, 327 Mont. 109, \u00b6 22, 112 P.3d 1001, \u00b6 22. The sentencing statutes authorize a district court to impose \u201creasonable restrictions\u201d necessary to rehabilitate the offender or protect the victim and society. <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6 9 (citing \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(n), MCA (2005)). Accordingly, we first review a condition of probation for legality and then review the condition for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b611 Hinkle asserts that we should review sentences that are ineligible for SRD review in a manner that would \u201cpermit the parties the same opportunities afforded in the SRD process, at least to the extent that supplemental briefs may be filed, or additional sentencing data provided, so that this Court could fully review the sentence imposed.\u201d Essentially, Hinkle would have this Court review all SRD ineligible sentences for \u201cuniformity.\u201d However, we have previously stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3v\">[sjentence review is not a constitutional right, but a system the legislature has voluntarily created. As such, there is no due process right to sentence review. It is within the discretion of the legislature to determine under what circumstances and conditions to allow sentence review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\"><em>State ex rel. Holt v. Dist. Ct., </em>2000 MT 142, \u00b6 12, 300 Mont. 35, \u00b6 12, 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>P.3d 608, \u00b6 12. Accordingly, we decline Hinkle\u2019s invitation to review sentences for uniformity and we adhere to the two-tiered review stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b612 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by revoking Hinkle\u2019s youth court probation and imposing Hinkle\u2019s previously stayed twenty-year suspended sentence for negligent homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b613 Hinkle asserts that the District Court abused its discretion by revoking Hinkle\u2019s youth court probation and imposing the previously stayed adult sentence. Hinkle contends that the \u201cDistrict Court took an unduly harsh and punitive approach to [Hinkle\u2019s] drinking violation.\u201d The State responds that the seriousness of the crime, Hinkle\u2019s age at the time it occurred, his demonstrated failure to heed warnings about his actions, and the lack of other options under the youth court system demonstrate that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the suspended adult sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b614 Under the plea bargain agreement, the State originally agreed to recommend youth court probation until age twenty-five as a sentence, conditioned upon Hinkle\u2019s compliance with the conditions of probation, including no commission of new offenses. Upon these terms the State also agreed to recommend a stay of a twenty-year adult sentence in order to provide an incentive for Hinkle to comply with the terms of his sentence. However, twelve days after sentencing, Hinkle violated two conditions of his probation, leaving the District Court with the options of either 1) continuing Hinkle\u2019s youth probation and the stay of the adult sentence or 2) ordering execution of the adult sentence. The court was presented with testimony from two probation officers, both of whom recommended that Hinkle be transferred to adult probation and parole on a suspended sentence, subject to conditions. The court also considered the PSI, the victim impact report, and a letter in support of Hinkle.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b615 The court followed the recommendation of the probation officers, determining that to continue Hinkle\u2019s youth probation would act as little more than a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d that would send Hinkle \u201con [his] way with very little consequence, if any, and with another seemingly hollow statement that this is serious business.\u201d The court concluded that this result would be inappropriate given the underlying offense of negligent homicide. Accordingly, the court imposed a <em>suspended </em>adult sentence, which, as the State asserts, was \u201ca further act of grace\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>because, under the binding plea agreement, the court could have imposed a twenty-year sentence of confinement. Hinkle ignores this \u201cact of grace\u201d when asserting that the District Court acted in an \u201cunduly harsh\u201d manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b616  A review of the record convinces us that the court handled this case in a sensitive and appropriate manner. Consequently, the District Court\u2019s order was neither arbitrary nor without conscientious judgment or exceeding the bounds of reason and was an appropriate exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b617 2. Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence by restricting Hinkle from playing games of chance or entering casinos?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b618 Hinkle\u2019s second argument is that the District Court imposed an illegal condition by prohibiting him from entering casinos and playing games of chance. Hinkle contends that there \u201csimply is no connection between the offense of conviction and the challenged restriction on entry into casinos, or playing any game of chance[,]\u201d making the condition illegal pursuant to the \u201cnexus\u201d requirement of <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b619 However, we recently expanded the <em>Ommundson </em>rule in <em>Ashby. </em>There we determined that \u201ca sentencing judge may impose \u00e1 particular condition of probation so long as the condition has a nexus to either the offense for which the offender is being sentenced, or to the offender himself or herself.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. Additionally, we have held a youth offender\u2019s sentence may appropriately consider the purposes of the Youth Court Act, which is to rehabilitate the Youth by establishing \u201ca program of supervision, care, rehabilitation, detention, competency development, and community protection for youth before they become adult offenders[.]\u201d Section 41-5-102(2)(b), MCA (2003); <em>In re D.A.S., </em>2008 MT 168, \u00b6 15, 343 Mont. 360, \u00b6 15, 184 P.3d 349, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b620  Hinkle\u2019s conviction of negligent homicide stemmed from his handling of a firearm. That crime requires a conscious disregard of a risk involving a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of conduct. Section 45-2-101(42), MCA (2003). The PSI prepared for the revocation proceeding described Hinkle as reckless and foolhardy, unable to appreciate risks and hazards, and predisposed to pursue perilous ventures. These personal characteristics make Hinkle particularly vulnerable to the pitfalls of irresponsible gambling. <em>See State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, \u00b6 31, 322 Mont. 294, \u00b6 31, 95 P.3d 717, \u00b6 31 (\u201cthe lure of easy money has long been a hallmark of gambling\u201d). Further, Hinkle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>is a youth offender who requires supervision and competency development in order to successfully complete his sentence and achieve the obj ectives of rehabilitation under the Y outh Court Act. As such, the District Court appropriately imposed the gambling and casino condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
