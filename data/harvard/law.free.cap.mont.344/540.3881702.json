We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">\u00b62 Peterson and her husband, Richard, reside on property in Lake County, Montana. Their neighbor, Bonnie Basta, resides on adjoining property to the west. A fence (\u201cthe Peterson/Basta fence\u201d) separates the two properties. Beginning in the late 1990s, Eichhorn routinely pastured horses on Basta\u2019s property pursuant to an oral agreement between Eichhorn and Basta\u2019s husband. Basta maintained this arrangement after her husband passed away in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">\u00b63 During the spring of 2002, Eichhorn pastured ten horses, seven of which he owned, on Basta\u2019s property. About a month before the events at issue in this case, a few of the horses entered the Petersons\u2019 property through a break in the Peterson/Basta fence. The Petersons herded the horses back into Basta\u2019s pasture, and Richard repaired the break. In addition, Eichhorn installed an electric fence along the Peterson/Basta fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">\u00b64 Nevertheless, on April 20,2002, two or three of Eichhorn\u2019s horses again entered the Petersons\u2019 property, this time at a point along the northern half of the Peterson/Basta fence where both the fence and the electric fence were broken. The Petersons used oats and a rope to lead the horses back into Basta\u2019s pasture. Thereafter, Richard temporarily secured the Peterson/Basta fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">\u00b65 The Petersons then decided to inform Basta of what had just transpired. From their property, they crossed the Peterson/Basta fence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and entered Basta\u2019s pasture. They then opened a metal gate to access Basta\u2019s gravel driveway, which ran alongside the pasture, and proceeded up the driveway. The driveway also passed by a separately fenced corral connected to the pasture. Upon reaching a bale of hay, the Petersons tossed some of the hay over the fence to the horses, hoping that this would keep them away from the Peterson/Basta fence. Thereafter, the Petersons continued up the driveway to Basta\u2019s house and informed her that some of the horses had again escaped from her pasture onto their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b66 On their way back to their property, the Petersons decided to stop at the corral and toss out more hay for the horses. While doing so, one of the horses in the corral-a mare named Hannah which was owned by Eichhorn-reached over the corral fence and bit Peterson on her breast. It is undisputed that Hannah was not one of the horses that had escaped earlier in the day onto the Petersons\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b67 Peterson filed suit against Eichhorn and Basta on December 11, 2003, asserting claims of negligence, strict liability for an abnormally dangerous domestic animal, and punitive damages. The injuries alleged and the damages sought by Peterson related only to the horse bite-e.g., \u201cexpenses for medical treatment\u201d and \u201ccourse of life damages\u201d-and not to any costs incurred as a direct result of the horses\u2019 breaking through the Peterson/Basta fence and entering the Petersons\u2019 property. Basta and Peterson eventually settled, and the claims against Basta were dismissed with prejudice on November 22, 2004. Accordingly, we discuss Peterson\u2019s allegations only as they relate to Eichhorn.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\u00b68 Under her negligence claim, Peterson alleged that Eichhorn owed her \u201ca duty to exercise reasonable care in the keeping of domestic animals to prevent the horse from causing foreseeable injuries to persons in Plaintiffs position\u201d; that \u201c[i]t was reasonably foreseeable that the horse owned and kept by [Eichhorn] would bite Plaintiff\u2019; that Eichhorn \u201cbreached [his] duty in the keeping of domestic animals by failing to take reasonable measures to protect Plaintiff from being injured by the horse\u201d; and that Eichhorn\u2019s alleged negligence was the actual and proximate cause of Peterson\u2019s injuries. Under her strict liability claim, Peterson alleged that Eichhorn was the owner and keeper of \u201ca domestic animal which had an abnormally dangerous tendency to bite people\u201d; that Eichhorn \u201cknew or should have known that one of the horses [he] owned and kept had an abnormally dangerous tendency to biU people\u201d; and that Eichhorn was strictly liable for Peterson\u2019s injuries. Lastly, Peterson alleged that she was entitled to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u00b69 Peterson filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of Eichhorn\u2019s liability. Eichhorn filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on all of Peterson\u2019s claims. The District Court heard arguments on the motions. Thereafter, on January 7, 2005, the court denied Peterson\u2019s motion and granted Eichhom\u2019s motion. The court entered judgment on March 29, 2005, dismissing Peterson\u2019s claims with prejudice. The court stated that Peterson shall recover nothing from Eichhorn and that Eichhorn shall recover costs from Peterson. Peterson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b610 Additional facts are set forth below where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u00b611 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Eichhorn on the issue of strict liability for an abnormally dangerous domestic animal?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Eichhorn on the issue of negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">3. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Eichhorn on the issue of punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as did the district court. <em>Hughes v. Lynch, </em>2007 MT 177, \u00b6 7, 338 Mont. 214, \u00b6 7, 164 P.3d 913, \u00b6 7. Rule 56(c) provides that \u201c[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Thus, the moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hadford v. Credit Bureau of Havre, Inc., </em>1998 MT 179, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 529, \u00b6 14, 962 P.2d 1198, \u00b6 14. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn therefrom in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Our Lady of the Rockies, Inc. v. Peterson, </em>2008 MT 110, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 393, \u00b6 14, 181 P.3d 631, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">\u00b613 Once the moving party has met its burden, the party opposing summary judgment must present substantial evidence, as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, raising a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Hadford, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Klock v. Town of Cascade, </em>284 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Mont. 167, 174, 943 P.2d 1262, 1266 (1997). The determination that the moving party is or is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law is a legal conclusion, which we review for correctness. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u00b614 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Eichhorn on the issue of strict liability for an abnormally dangerous domestic animal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u00b615 Peterson relies on \u00a7 509 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1977), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">(1) A possessor of a domestic animal that he knows or has reason to know has dangerous propensities abnormal to its class, is subject to liability for harm done by the animal to another, although he has exercised the utmost care to prevent it from doing the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">(2) This liability is limited to harm that results from the abnormally dangerous propensity of which the possessor knows or has reason to know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">According to comment g, \u201c[i]t is not necessary to the application of the rule stated in this Section that the possessor of the domestic animal know of its abnormally dangerous propensities; it is enough that he has reason to know of them.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 509 cmt. g.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">\u00b616 The District Court noted that \u201ca horse by nature possesses the ability, if not the propensity, to bite and kick.\u201d The court decided that \u201csuch dangers [are] normal for its class or category.\u201d On appeal, Peterson maintains that the District Court erroneously \u201cdismissed the evidence\u201d concerning Hannah\u2019s \u201cdangerous tendency to bite\u201d which, in Peterson\u2019s view, was \u201cabnormal for horses in general.\u201d Specifically, Peterson contends that Hannah bit \u201cat least four\u201d other people before biting Peterson. Peterson further asserts that Hannah\u2019s original owners warned Eichhorn that Hannah tried to bite when they fed her. Additionally, although Eichhorn testified that in his 88 years of experience with horses, he had seen only one horse bite someone, Peterson claims that Eichhorn was present when Hannah allegedly bit Basta\u2019s brother-in-law on the hand. In essence, Peterson contends that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to whether Hannah had a dangerous propensity-to bite-which was abnormal for a mare and whether Eichhorn knew or had reason to know of this allegedly abnormally dangerous propensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">\u00b617 At the outset, we note Eichhorn\u2019s arguments concerning the applicability of \u00a7 509. He points out that \u00a7 509 has not been adopted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Montana and is not binding authority. While this is true, it is also true that we have adopted other sections of the <em>Restatement. See e.g. Sunburst School Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 36, 338 Mont. 259, \u00b6 36, 165 P.3d 1079, \u00b6 36 (adopting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 929 and cmt. b); <em>Crisafulli v. Bass, </em>2001 MT 316, \u00b6 23, 308 Mont. 40, \u00b6 23, 38 P.3d 842, \u00b6 23 (adopting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 316); <em>First Bank (N.A.)-Billings v. Clark, </em>236 Mont. 195, 206, 771 P.2d 84, 91 (1989) (adopting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 46, cmt. j); <em>Brandenburger v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., </em>162 Mont. 506, 513-14, 513 P.2d 268, 272-73 (1973) (adopting the language of <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 402A); <em>see also Leichtfuss v. Dabney, </em>2005 MT 271, \u00b6\u00b6 39-42, 329 Mont. 129, \u00b6\u00b6 39-42, 122 P.3d 1220, \u00b6\u00b6 39-42 (citing various sections of the <em>Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes </em>as persuasive authority). Thus, Eichhom\u2019s observation that \u00a7 509 has not been adopted in Montana and is not binding authority does not end our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\u00b618 That being said, we conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which to consider and adopt \u00a7 509. The record before us is utterly void of any evidence, and Peterson\u2019s briefing is likewise wholly deficient of legal authority, on the issues of (1) whether Hannah\u2019s \u201ctendency to bite,\u201d assuming she has one, amounts to a \u201cdangerous propensity,\u201d (2) if Hannah does have a \u201cdangerous propensity\u201d for biting, whether that propensity is \u201cabnormal to [her] class,\u201d and (3) whether Eichhorn knew or had reason to know not that Hannah had bitten in the past, but that she had a \u201cdangerous propensity abnormal to her class.\u201d In this regard, we note that Peterson, who also had extensive experience with horses, admitted in the District Court that horses are \u201cunpredictable\u201d and that \u201cyou never know, with a strange horse, how they\u2019re going to react.\u201d Peterson also concedes on appeal that \u201chorses are capable of biting.\u201d She opines, however, that \u201cit is unusual for a mare to bite.\u201d Yet, \u201cunusual\u201d does not necessarily equate with \u201cabnormal\u201d as contemplated under \u00a7 509. Peterson has not shown with substantial evidence that Hannah\u2019s behavior was anything other than the behavior of a typical horse as described by Peterson herself.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay8\">\u00b619 Peterson contends that \u201cEichhorn provides no answer for Peterson\u2019s argument that a horse can have an abnormally dangerous tendency to bite compared to horses in general.\u201d She claims that \u201c[m]ost horses do not intentionally bite people.\u201d Yet, this conclusory and speculative statement does not constitute substantial evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See e.g. Bonilla v. University of Montana, </em>2005 MT 183, \u00b6 20, 328 Mont. 41, \u00b6 20, 116 P.3d 823, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"AzV\">\u00b620 Peterson\u2019s bald assertions that Hannah\u2019s behavior rose to the level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>of a \u201cdangerous propensity abnormal to her class\u201d are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 56(e); <em>Hughes v. Lynch, </em>2007 MT 177, \u00b6 19, 338 Mont. 214, \u00b6 19, 164 P.3d 913, \u00b6 19. Accordingly, we conclude this is not an appropriate case in which to consider and adopt \u00a7 509 and that Eichhorn was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Peterson\u2019s \u00a7 509 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u00b621  We note the District Court\u2019s reasoning that a propensity to bite is \u201cnormal\u201d for Hannah\u2019s class. Although we agree with Peterson that \u201ca horse might have a tendency to bite that is abnormal for what one would expect of horses,\u201d Peterson has failed to produce any evidence or legal authority that Hannah is such a horse, i.e., that Hannah\u2019s biting constitutes a \u201cdangerous propensity abnormal to her class\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 509. We uphold a district court\u2019s judgment if the court reaches the correct result, regardless of the court\u2019s reasoning. <em>Clark v. Eagle Systems, Inc., </em>279 Mont. 279, 286, 927 P.2d 995, 999 (1996); <em>Richardson v. Corvallis Public School Dist. No. </em>1, 286 Mont. 309, 312, 950 P.2d 748, 750 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u00b622 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Eichhorn on the issue of negligence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u00b623 Negligence is the failure to use the degree of care that an ordinarily prudent person would have used under the same circumstances. <em>Barr v. Great Falls Int\u2019l Airport Authority, </em>2005 MT 36, \u00b6 41, 326 Mont. 93, \u00b6 41, 107 P.3d 471, \u00b6 41. To maintain an action in negligence, the plaintiff must prove four essential elements: (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty, (2) the defendant breached that duty, (3) the breach was the actual and proximate cause of an injury to the plaintiff, and (4) damages resulted. <em>See Willden v. Neumann, </em>2008 MT 236, \u00b6 14, 344 Mont. 407, \u00b6 14, 189 P.3d 610, \u00b6 14; <em>Bonilla v. University of Montana, </em>2005 MT 183, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 41, \u00b6 14, 116 P.3d 823, \u00b6 14; <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6 30, 321 Mont. 210, \u00b6 30, 90 P.3d 394, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u00b624  As noted, actionable negligence arises only from the breach of a legal duty. Therefore, in order for there to be a genuine issue of material fact in a negligence case, there must be a duty imposed on the defendant and allegations which, if proven, would support a finding of a breach of the duty. <em>Richardson v. Corvallis Public School Dist. No. 1, </em>286 Mont. 309, 313, 950 P.2d 748, 751 (1997). Furthermore, although negligence actions ordinarily involve factual issues which make summary judgment inappropriate, if the plaintiff fails to offer proof on any one of the four elements of negligence, then summary judgment in favor of the defendant is proper. <em>Singleton v. L.P. Anderson Supply Co., </em>284 Mont. 40, 43-44, 943 P.2d 968, 970 (1997); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>accord Fabich v. PPL Montana, LLC, </em>2007 MT 258, \u00b6 23, 339 Mont. 289, \u00b6 23, 170 P.3d 943, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Fence Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u00b625 The District Court rejected Peterson\u2019s contention that Eichhorn was strictly liable under \u00a7\u00a7 81-4-215 and -307(1), MCA, for all injuries resulting from the horses\u2019 breaking through the Peterson/Basta fence on April 20, 2002. The court concluded that these statutes were inapplicable in light of the damages claimed by Peterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u00b626 Section 81-4-215, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">If any... horses ... break into any enclosure and the fence of the enclosure is legal, as provided in 81-4-101, the owner of the animals is liable for damages to the owner or occupant of the enclosure if the owner or person in control of the animals was negligent. This section may not be construed to require a legal fence in order to maintain an action for injury done by animals running at large contrary to law. In the case of trespassing animals in a herd district, the liability and damage provisions of 81-4-307 apply.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Section 81-4-307(1), MCA, in turn, states in relevant part: \u201cIf an animal referred to in 81-4-306\u201d-which includes horses-\u201cwrongfully enters the premises of a person within a herd district, the owner or person in control of the animal is liable for care and feeding of the animal and for any damages caused by the animal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">\u00b627 On appeal, Peterson again argues that \u00a7\u00a7 81-4-215 and -307(1), MCA, \u201cpose strict liability on Eichhorn.\u201d Peterson contends that \u201cliability is triggered when a horse breaks through a fence.\u201d Yet, by the plain language of these statutes-which refer to animals that \u201cbreak into\u201d and \u201cwrongfully enter[ ]\u201d another person\u2019s premises or enclosure-Eichhorn\u2019s liability would extend only to damages caused by the horses that escaped from Basta\u2019s pasture, and Peterson has not alleged any damages caused by the escaping horses. Rather, she alleged in her complaint that \u201c[t]his cause of action arises from a horse bite.\u201d Moreover, she alleged that she had suffered injuries and incurred damages in the form of \u201cexpenses for medical treatment,\u201d \u201cphysical pain and suffering,\u201d \u201cmental anguish,\u201d and \u201ccourse of life damages.\u201d None of these injuries have anything to do with damages caused by the escaped horses. In point of fact, the injuries alleged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Peterson were caused when, \u201c[o]n her way back to her house, Plaintiff stopped to throw some hay to the horses,\u201d at which time she was bitten by Hannah. The record establishes (and the parties do not dispute) that Hannah was not one of the horses that had trespassed onto Peterson\u2019s property. The record also reflects that, at the time Peterson was bitten, the escaped horses had been herded back into Basta\u2019s pasture and that the broken portion of the Peterson/Basta fence had been secured. In this regard, we note that counsel for Peterson conceded during oral argument in the District Court that \u00a7\u00a7 81-4-215 and -307(1), MCA, do not apply to animals \u201cinside their own pastures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABp\">\u00b628 In light of these undisputed facts and the stated basis of this lawsuit, \u00a7\u00a7 81-4-215 and -307(1), MCA, seem to be inapplicable to the case at hand. Notwithstanding, Peterson attempts to weave a scenario in which Eichhorn\u2019s supposed liability under these statutes for his horses\u2019 wrongful entry onto the Petersons\u2019 property establishes his liability for the injuries later caused by Hannah alongside the corral. Peterson\u2019s theory is that \u201cEichhorn\u2019s trespassing horses set in motion a foreseeable chain of events that placed Peterson in a position where there was a high likelihood that Hannah would bite her.\u201d This scenario commences with two or three of Eichhorn\u2019s horses breaking through the Peterson/Basta fence onto Peterson\u2019s property and ends some time later with Peterson standing on Basta\u2019s property alongside the corral gratuitously feeding another of Eichhorn\u2019s horses (Hannah), at which point she is bitten. Peterson cites no authority for such an extension of liability -under these statutes, and the plain language of the statutes does not support Peterson\u2019s argument. Accordingly, we reject this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Ordinary Care Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u00b629 The focus in this case, therefore, is properly on the corral and what transpired there, regardless of the scenario with the broken fence and the escaping horses. In this regard, Peterson cites \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">Except as otherwise provided by law, everyone is responsible not only for the results of his willful acts but also for an injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his property or person except so far as the latter has willfully or by want of ordinary care brought the injury upon himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">This statute \u201cprovides the general standard against which negligence or due care can be measured.\u201d <em>Larson-Murphy v. Steiner, </em>2000 MT 334, \u00b6 92, 303 Mont. 96, \u00b6 92, 15 P.3d 1205, \u00b6 92. Based on \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA, Peterson contends that Eichhom had a \u201cduty of ordinary care in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the management of his horses.\u201d According to Peterson, this duty required Eichhorn to keep the horses \u201cas a reasonably prudent horse owner would under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">\u00b630 The District Court decided that \u201cPeterson\u2019s injury resulted from her action in entering Basta\u2019s property and feeding not only the horses that entered her property but also the horses that remained on Basta\u2019s property, including the horse that bit her.\u201d Thus, the court reasoned, \u201cno legal duty exists due to the exception within Section 27-1-701, MCA.\u201d As noted above, that exception states that everyone is responsible for an injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care \u201cexcept so far as the latter has willfully or by want of ordinary care brought the injury upon himself.\u201d Essentially, the District Court found that Peterson was contributorily negligent and that her negligence relieved Eichhorn of any legal duty he had under \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA. In this respect, the District Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\u00b631 Under the old contributory negligence rule, a plaintiff could not recover if the plaintiff were negligent in any degree. <em>Reed v. Little, </em>209 Mont. 199, 205, 680 P.2d 937, 940 (1984). Montana, however, has adopted a comparative negligence scheme. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-1-702, MCA. Under that scheme, a plaintiffs contributory negligence is a defense to the charge of negligence, but contributory negligence does not bar the plaintiff from recovering damages \u201cif the contributory negligence was not greater than the negligence of the person or the .combined negligence of all persons against whom recovery is sought.\u201d Section 27-1-702, MCA. In other words, recovery is barred only if the plaintiff is found to be greater than 50 percent negligent. <em>Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6 45, 338 Mont. 19, \u00b6 45, 162 P.3d 134, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\u00b632  Furthermore, even when a defendant is negligent as a matter of law, the issue of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff and the degree of comparative negligence, if any, is normally an issue for the jury or fact-finder to resolve. <em>Pierce v. ALSC Architects, P.S., </em>270 Mont. 97, 107, 890 P.2d 1254, 1260 (1995); <em>see also Giambra, </em>\u00b6 51 (stating that Montana\u2019s comparative negligence scheme requires \u201cthe fact-finder\u201d to consider the negligence of the claimant, injured person, defendants, and third-party defendants and apportion negligence liability accordingly). Whether a plaintiff was contributorily negligent is a question for the fact-finder, unless reasonable minds could not draw different conclusions from the evidence. <em>See e.g. Stenberg v. Beatrice Foods Co., </em>176 Mont. 123, 126-27, 576 P.2d 725, 727-28 (1978); <em>Hart-Anderson v. Hauck, </em>239 Mont. 444, 447-48, 781 P.2d 1116, 1117-18 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\u00b633  On the facts before us, we conclude that reasonable minds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>could draw different conclusions from the evidence on the question of Peterson\u2019s contributory negligence and the degree of comparative negligence. Accordingly, the District Court erred in concluding that contributory negligence on Peterson\u2019s part relieved Eichhorn of any legal duty he had under \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u00b634 Nevertheless, we conclude that the District Court reached the correct result. Assuming, arguendo, that Eichhorn had the duty alleged by Peterson to exercise ordinary care in the keeping of Hannah so as to prevent the mare from causing foreseeable injuries to persons in Peterson\u2019s position, the question becomes whether Peterson presented evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that would necessitate a trial on Eichhorn\u2019s alleged breach of that duty. <em>Bonilla v. University of Montana, </em>2005 MT 183, \u00b6 17, 328 Mont. 41, \u00b6 17, 116 P.3d 823, \u00b6 17 (\u201cOrdinarily, the determination of whether a defendant breached a legal duty owed is a fact question for the jury, and therefore not susceptible to summary judgment, unless the evidence is undisputed or susceptible to only one conclusion by reasonable people.\u201d). We resolve that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\u00b635 The undisputed facts are that at the time she was bitten, Peterson was returning home after having advised Basta of the horses\u2019 escape. At that point in time, the escaped horses were back in Basta\u2019s pasture, the fence had been secured, the horses had been given some hay, and Basta had been notified. Whatever urgency had been generated by the escape was now resolved and over. Notwithstanding, Peterson took the gratuitous step of stopping to throw some hay to Hannah and the other horses in the corral. (Peterson admitted that neither Basta nor Eichhorn asked her to do this.) Although Peterson explains that she was feeding the horses so that they would stay on Basta\u2019s property, it is undisputed that Hannah was not one of the two or three horses that had entered the Petersons\u2019 property earlier in the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u00b636 Assuming, as we do, that Eichhorn had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the keeping of Hannah, Peterson\u2019s theory of breach is that Eichhorn failed to take the steps a reasonably prudent horse owner would have taken under the circumstances to prevent Hannah from biting a person standing alongside the corral gratuitously throwing hay to her and the other horses. Yet, Peterson has not presented substantial evidence indicating that Hannah was not, at that moment, being kept by Eichhorn in a reasonably safe condition so as to safeguard Peterson from this injury. In other words, Peterson has not established the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Eichhorn\u2019s keeping Hannah in the corral on Basta\u2019s property as he did fell below the degree of care that Peterson alleges (and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>assume, arguendo) he owed her. Peterson has merely proffered the conclusory assertion that Eichhorn breached the duty of care. This is wholly insufficient to withstand summary judgment. <em>Klock v. Town of Cascade, </em>284 Mont. 167, 174, 943 P.2d 1262, 1266 (1997) (\u201cIn order to meet its burden, the party opposing the motion must present substantial evidence, not mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u00b637  Focusing on the evidence presented to the District Court on summary judgment and assuming, arguendo, that Eichhorn had an ordinary duty of care in the maintenance of Hannah, we conclude that reasonable minds could not differ. Peterson has failed to present substantial evidence that would establish Eichhorn breached this duty under the circumstances here. That being the case, summary judgment on Peterson\u2019s negligence claim was proper. As noted above, this Court upholds a district court\u2019s judgment if the court reaches the correct result, regardless of the court\u2019s reasoning. <em>Clark, </em>279 Mont. at 286, 927 P.2d at 999; <em>Richardson, </em>286 Mont. at 312, 950 P.2d at 750. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summaryjudgment in favor of Eichhorn on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u00b638 <em>Issue 3. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor ofEichhom on the issue of punitive damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\u00b639 Given our resolution of Issues 1 and 2, we need not address Issue 3. <em>See Finstad v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>2000 MT 228, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 240, \u00b6 20, 8 P.3d 778, \u00b6 20 (\u201c[PJunitive damages are merely a component of recovery of the underlying civil cause of action.\u201d); \u00a7 27-1-220(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\u00b640 We conclude that the District Court correctly determined that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that Eichhorn was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all of Peterson\u2019s claims. We accordingly affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b575-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-10\"> This is the 2003 version of \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA.
