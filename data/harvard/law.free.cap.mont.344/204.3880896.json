(Lambert) appeals the order of the Seventh Judicial District Court, Richland County, denying Lambert\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment to Appellee Wellington Specialty Insurance Co. (Wellington). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-24\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred by concluding Lambert\u2019s claim was not covered under the Wellington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b63 Lambert is an oil well service company. In September 2006, while removing and reinstalling the rods and tubing of a well in Dawson County, Montana, Lambert\u2019s employees dropped a piece of new tubing they were installing, causing approximately $30,000.00 of damage to the tubing and tubing anchor. The tubing did not belong to Lambert, but rather was provided by Ritter Laber &amp; Associates and was already at the job site when Lambert arrived. Lambert\u2019s subsequent investigation revealed that the tubing was dropped because the elevators either failed to latch or failed to stay latched. There was no indication that Lambert\u2019s employees had done anything wrong. Lambert reported the loss to its insurer, Wellington, which investigated the accident and denied coverage. Wellington concluded that \u201cat the time of the incident the involved piping was in your care, custody and control,\u201d and that such an occurrence was not covered by Lambert\u2019s Commercial General Liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b64 The Wellington policy provided that Wellington would \u201cpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of... \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d There is no dispute that Lambert was an \u201cinsured\u201d and that the damage to the tubing constituted \u201cproperty damage.\u201d However, the Wellington policy expressly excluded coverage for \u2018\u201c[pjroperty damage\u2019 to ... [plersonal property in the care, custody, and control of the insured.\u201d Wellington concluded the damaged tubing fell within this exclusion to coverage. The District Court agreed, denying Lambert\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting Wellington\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. Lambert appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Blair v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>2007 MT 208, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 8, \u00b6 14, 167 P.3d 888, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). We apply the same criteria applied by the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 14. The moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u00b66 The issue currently before the Court is whether, under the terms of the Wellington policy, Wellington was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law. <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00b6 10,293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 10, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 10. Therefore, we determine whether the District Court correctly interpreted the provisions of the Wellington policy. <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err by concluding Lambert\u2019s claim was not covered under the Wellington insurance policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b68 Both parties acknowledge that the Wellington policy provides an exclusion which applies and excludes the damaged tubing from coverage. The policy provides that coverage is inapplicable for \u201c \u2018[property damage\u2019 to... [p]ersonal property in the care, custody, and control of the insured.\u201d The tubing involved was personal property in the care, custody, and control of Lambert\u2019s employees, and thus this provision, if we went no further, would exclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b69 However, Lambert argues that another provision in the Wellington policy essentially cancels out this exclusion. This argument is premised on the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cwho is an insured,\u201d which states that \u201cemployees\u201d are insureds \u201conly for acts within the scope of their employment by [Lambert] or while performing duties related to the conduct of [Lambert\u2019s] business.\u201d However, the policy further states that \u201cnone of these employees ... are insureds for ... [p]roperty damage to property ... in the care, custody, or control of... [Lambert], [or] any of [Lambert\u2019s] \u2018employees.\u2019\u201d In other words, this section provides that employees are not considered insured for purposes of property damage that occurs to property in their care, custody, or control. Lambert argues that this section, when read in combination with the initial exclusion of coverage, essentially amounts to a double negative resulting in coverage, not excluding it. According to Lambert, \u201cit becomes obvious that since the damaged tubing in this case was in the care, custody or control of Lambert employees, and since those employees are not considered \u2018insureds\u2019 for purposes of Lambert\u2019s claim, the exclusionary language does not apply ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b610 The District Court concluded that the exclusion for care, custody, and control of personal property applied because \u201cthe Plaintiff can operate only through its employees and the only logical interpretation of the policy is to impute the care, custody, or control by the employees as the care, custody, and control of the insured corporation.\u201d Lambert argues the District Court erred by applying this commonly accepted principle of contract and tort law to interpret the Wellington policy as excluding coverage. Wellington responds that the exclusion of \u201cemployees\u201d from the definition of \u201cinsureds\u201d with respect to property damage in their care, custody, or control is simply a second exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of coverage for damage to personal property: one exclusion is located under the coverage portion of the policy, and the other exclusion is in the definition of \u201cinsureds.\u201d According to Wellington, Lambert\u2019s attempt to read the \u201cwho is an insured\u201d section as canceling out the coverage exclusion is \u201cconvoluted doubletalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">\u00b611 \u201cWe construe an insurance policy \u2018according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy,\u2019 \u201d meaning that \u201cwe will read the contract as a whole and attempt to reconcile its parts to give each meaning and effect.\u201d <em>Lammers v. Moun, </em>2008 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 341 Mont. 406, \u00b6 11, 177 P.3d 1026, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted). We would infringe on this reconciliation principle if we interpreted the policy to first exclude coverage for personal property damage caused by Lambert\u2019s employees, then to renew such coverage by excluding from the definition of \u201cinsureds\u201d those employees who caused such property damage. While the Wellington policy is not a model of clarity, we agree with Wellington and the District Court that because Lambert is a corporation, it can only act through its employees, and the policy certainly intended to exclude from coverage all personal property damage caused by Lambert-the \u201cinsured\u201d \u2014 through its employees. Lambert argues that as a \u201cfictional\u201d corporate entity, Lambert alone could not be \u201cphysically\u201d in the care, custody, and control of the tubing or cause property damage because it was not \u201cpresent.\u201d However, without addressing the notion of \u201cfictional entities,\u201d the tubing was clearly in Lambert\u2019s \u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d because Lambert\u2019s employees were physically present and working with the tubing when it was dropped and damaged. The tubing was being installed by Lambert\u2019s employees while acting \u201cwithin the scope of their employment,\u201d and thus, it was also in Lambert\u2019s \u201ccare, custody, and control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b612  Lambert was not covered by the Wellington policy for damage to personal property in its care. Under the coverage exclusion, the policy expressly excluded from coverage \u201c \u2018[pjroperty damage\u2019 to ... [pjersonal property in the care, custody, and control of [Lambert].\u201d Under the definition of \u201cwho is an insured,\u201d the policy again expressly excluded \u201c[pjroperty damage to property ... in the care, custody, or control of ... [Lambert], [or] any of [Lambert\u2019s] \u2018employees.\u2019 \u201d The second section does not cancel out the first, but merely supplements it. Under either exclusion, Lambert was not covered for the damage to the tubing.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
