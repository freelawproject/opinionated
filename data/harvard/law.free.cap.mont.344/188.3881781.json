On appeal, he claims that the jury was bound to acquit him in light of the jury instructions given by the District Court and the evidence adduced at trial. We disagree and, thus, affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b62 In 1997, Azure was convicted of robbery in Cascade County and sentenced to the Montana State Prison for 20 years, with 5 years suspended. Following his completion of Boot Camp, the Eighth Judicial District Court modified the sentence to 20 years, with 8 years suspended. Azure was discharged to his suspended sentence in October 2002; however, in May 2004, the court revoked the sentence and sentenced him to the Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) for 8 years, with 2 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u00b63 In December 2004, Azure was released from confinement and placed in the DOC\u2019s Intensive Supervision Program (\u201cISP\u201d) under the supervision of Dave Sonju. According to Sonju (who testified at Azure\u2019s trial on the instant offense), ISP is a sort of \u201cconditional release.\u201d The offender lives in the community but still has the status of \u201cinmate.\u201d ISP officers generally have small caseloads (less than 25 offenders each) involving high-risk offenders. The offenders are monitored with electronic monitoring and daily schedules, so that the ISP officers know where each offender is 24 hours a day. The ISP officers also conduct random home visits, weekly office checks, and urine tests. According to Sonju, \u201cWe do more supervision than what a standard supervision officer can do with a caseload of 100.\u201d As a result, ISP is much more restrictive than standard probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\u00b64 The Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (Title 46, Chapter 23, Part 5, MCA) sets forth the registration requirements for persons convicted of a sexual or violent offense. Azure\u2019s robbery conviction is considered a \u201cviolent\u201d offense under the Act, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-23-502(9)(a), MCA (2003), and Azure does not dispute that the Act applied to him during the time period at issue here, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-23-506(2), MCA. Of relevance to the instant appeal, a violent offender who has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>sentenced to the DOC and placed in confinement must be registered under the Act at least 10 days prior to his release from confinement. Section 46-23-504(l)(b), MCA. The official in charge of the place of confinement must inform the offender of the duty to register and provide the registration information to the Department of Justice and to either the sheriff of the county or the chief of police of the municipality in which the offender intends to reside. Section 46-23-503(1), (2), MCA. In addition, within 10 days of entering a county for the purpose of residing or setting up a temporary domicile there, the offender is required to register with the county sheriff (or the chief of police, if the offender resides in a municipality). Section 46-23-504(l)(c), (2), MCA. Whenever the offender changes residence, he is required within 10 days of the change to give written notification of the new address to the agency with whom he last registered. Section 46-23-505, MCA. Knowingly failing to register, verify registration, or keep registration current is a felony offense punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment. Section 46-23-507, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b65 In early December 2004, in conjunction with his release from confinement and placement in ISP, Azure registered an address on Cozy Court in Lolo, Montana. In mid December, he moved to Mormon Creek Road (also in Lolo) and thereafter registered this change of residence with the Missoula County Sheriffs Department. In early May 2005, Azure moved to an address on South 8th Street. He promptly informed Sonju of this move; however, although Sonju advised Azure on more than one occasion that he needed to register the change of residence with the Sheriffs Department as well, Azure failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b66 The State charged Azure on July 22,2005, with failure to register as a violent offender. The State alleged that Azure had a prior conviction of robbery and that he knowingly had failed, on or about June 7, to keep his registration current with the Missoula County Sheriffs Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b67 The case proceeded to trial on April 4, 2006. The State called two witnesses-Sonju and Jan Dietz (the support services administrator for the Missoula County Sheriffs Department)-to establish that Azure had been convicted of an offense which required registration as a violent offender, that he had changed his residence in Missoula County in May 2005, and that he had not updated his registration with the Missoula County Sheriffs Department when he moved to the address on South 8th Street. Sonju testified in this regard concerning his conversations with Azure. According to Sonju, Azure initially claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>that he did not have identification and that he could not register without I.D., but Azure later stated that he was afraid if he registered the new address, he and his wife would be evicted again. Sonju noted that \u201cquite often\u201d the participants in the ISP program are evicted from their residences after they register.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b68 Azure questioned Sonju concerning the DOC\u2019s Intensive' Supervision Program and, in particular, Azure\u2019s status while in this program. Sonju agreed that during the entire time Azure was in ISP, he was under the DOC\u2019s (more specifically, Sonju\u2019s) \u201csupervision.\u201d Sonju also indicated that Azure had checked in with Sonju \u201cregularly and on a weekly basis\u201d during his time in ISP. Azure then questioned Sonju at length concerning the Probation and Parole Bureau\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures. In particular, Azure elicited testimony from Sonju that under P&amp;P 60-12, when an offender changes his or her address, the probation and parole officer is responsible for contacting local law enforcement to verify that the offender has registered the change and also for notifying the Department of Justice of the address change. Sonju admitted that he did not notify the Department of Justice of Azure\u2019s change. Finally, Azure introduced into evidence a Notice for Address Verification, addressed by the Montana Department of Justice to Azure and dated October 20, 2005, which stated: \u2018You are reminded of your obligation as a registrant to inform your local law enforcement <em>or probation office </em>of any address changes or other pertinent information within 10 days of the change [MCA46-23-505]\u201d (emphasis added, brackets in original). \u00b69 At the close of the evidence, the court read the jury a number of instructions, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">Instruction No. 16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">A person commits the offense of Failure to Register as an Offender if the person is required to register under Montana law and fails to give written notice to the agency with whom he was last registered within ten (10) days, if the person changes his residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">Instruction No. 17</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">Brian Azure is a person required to register as a violent offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">Instruction No. 18</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">To convict the Defendant of the offense of Failure to Register as a Violent Offender, the State must prove the following propositions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">1.

[Ellipses in printed instruction.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b610 During closing arguments, the parties addressed whether Azure\u2019s duty to register as a violent offender had been triggered. The State argued that this duty arose \u201c[a]s soon as this defendant was released from prison.\u201d However, Azure countered that pursuant to Instruction No. 20, violent offenders must register \u201c[u]pon their release from containment and supervision.\u201d Relying on Sonju\u2019s testimony, Azure asserted that he \u201cwas still under [Sonju\u2019s] supervision, not confinement at that point but under his supervision and control,\u201d in May and June 2005. Azure then argued the alternate theory that under the Probation and Parole Bureau\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures, he fulfilled any duty to register by informing Sonju of the change of residence. But, in concluding his argument, Azure told the jury that they did not need to reach this alternate theory unless they got over \u201cthe first hurdle,\u201d which he explained was Instruction No. 20 and the prerequisite that he be released from \u201cconfinement <em>and </em>supervision\u201d before having to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b611 The jury ultimately returned a verdict of guilty. Thereafter, the District Court sentenced Azure to a term of five years in the Montana State Prison to run concurrently with his sentence in the Cascade County case. Azure now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b612 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">1. Did Instruction No. 20 become the law of the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">2. Is the jury\u2019s guilty verdict supported by the evidence under the applicable law?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">\u00b613 District courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions; however, that discretion is ultimately restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 11, 342 Mont. 355, \u00b6 11, 181 P.3d 625, \u00b6 11. We review a question on the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Field, </em>2005 MT 181, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 26, \u00b6 15, 116 P.3d 813, \u00b6 15. Because there either is, or is not, sufficient evidence to convict, our review of a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support the verdict is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>de novo. <em>See State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6 19, 160 P.3d 511, \u00b6 19; <em>Field, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b614 <em>Issue 1. Did Instruction No. 20 become the law of the case?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b615 At the outset, we note that the trial judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel engaged in a lengthy discussion (outside the jury\u2019s presence) about when a violent offender\u2019s duty to register is triggered under \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-503 and -504, MCA (2003). The prosecutor took the position that the duty arises when the offender is released from \u201cphysical confinement.\u201d Defense counsel, by contrast, argued that in this particular case, because Azure was in the DOC\u2019s Intensive Supervision Program in May and June 2005, he was still in the DOC\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d and under its \u201csupervision\u201d and, thus, had not yet been \u201creleased\u201d-the critical event which triggers the duty to register. Defense counsel also pointed out, alternatively, that an offender is required under \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA, to give written notification of a change of residence \u201cto the agency with whom the offender last registered\u201d; and counsel argued that the probation department-more specifically, ISP-was the relevant agency, given Azure\u2019s placement in this program.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b616 The court\u2019s and the parties\u2019 uncertainty on this matter is understandable in light of the varying terminology in the relevant statutes. Section 46-23-503(1), MCA, refers on one hand to release from \u201cthe custody\u201d of the Department of Corrections and on the other hand to \u201cthe official in charge of the place of confinement,\u201d while \u00a7 46-23-504(1), MCA, refers to \u201cconfinement\u201d by the DOC and release therefrom. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 46-23-506(2)(a), MCA (referring to \u201crelease from confinement\u201d). Adding to the confusion is the following sentence from <em>Wagner v. State, </em>2004 MT 31, 319 Mont. 413, 85 P.3d 750: \u201cUpon their release from confinement and <em>supervision, </em>sexual and violent offenders must register in writing with the Montana Department of Justice and the sheriff of the county or chief of police of the city in which the offender intends to reside . . . .\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>\u00b6 9 (emphasis added) (citing \u00a7 46-23-503, MCA). According to Azure, who proposed Instruction No. 20, the language of the instruction derived from \u00b6 9 of <em>Wagner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b6 17 <em>Wagner, </em>however, involved the issue of whether requiring Wagner to register under the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act violated his right to full restoration of rights under Article II, Section 28(2) of the Montana Constitution. <em>See Wagner, </em>\u00b6 2. Thus, the dictum in \u00b6 9 of <em>Wagner </em>is not authority for Instruction No. 20. Moreover, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>appeal, Azure and the State agree that Instruction No. 20 \u201cdid not accurately reflect\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-503 and -504, MCA, because it referred to release from \u201csupervision.\u201d For the following reasons, we likewise conclude that Instruction No. 20 and \u00b6 9 of <em>Wagner, </em>from which it derived, are not accurate statements of when the duty to register under the Act is triggered. We thus overrule <em>Wagner </em>on this particular point.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b618 Section 46-23-503(1), MCA, instructs \u201cthe official in charge of the place of confinement\u201d to inform a violent offender being released from \u201cthe custody\u201d of the DOC of his or her duty to register. Section 46-23-504(l)(b), MCA, states that a violent offender \u201cmust be registered\u201d as provided in \u00a7 46-23-503, MCA, at least 10 days prior to his or her release from \u201cconfinement\u201d by the DOC. Subsections (l)(c) and (2) of \u00a7 46-23-504, MCA, instruct the offender to register with the county sheriff or the chief of police within 10 days of entering a county or municipality, respectively, for the purpose of residing or setting up a temporary domicile. Section 46-23-505, MCA, instructs the offender, within 10 days of changing his or her residence, to give written notification of the new address to \u201cthe agency with whom the offender last registered.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b619 None of these statutes refers to \u201csupervision.\u201d Thus, the only possible basis for construing the statutory scheme as we did in \u00b6 9 of <em>Wagner </em>is the word \u201ccustody\u201d in \u00a7 46-23-503, MCA. However, \u00a7 46-23-503, MCA, imposes a duty on \u201cthe official in charge of the place of confinement\u201d; it does not identify the time when the offender\u2019s duty to register is triggered. Rather, considering the statutory scheme as a whole, we conclude as follows: Because a violent offender \u201cmust be registered\u201d at least 10 days prior to his or her release from \u201cconfinement,\u201d \u00a7 46-23-504(l)(b), MCA, because a violent offender \u201cshall\u201d register within 10 days of entering a county or municipality for the purpose of residing or setting up a temporary domicile there, \u00a7 46-23-504(l)(c), (2), MCA, and because a violent offender could enter a county or municipality for the purpose of residing or setting up a temporary domicile as soon as he or she is released from confinement, the Legislature intended the duty to register to be triggered upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>release from \u201cconfinement,\u201d not \u201ccustody\u201d or \u201cconfinement and supervision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b620 Instruction No. 20, therefore, was not an accurate statement of the law. As noted above, Azure concedes this point, but he contends that since the instruction was given by the District Court, the jury was bound to follow it and acquit him. Azure\u2019s argument is relatively straightforward: The District Court instructed the jury that violent offenders must register \u201c[u]pon their release from confinement <em>and </em>supervision\u201d (emphasis added); a jury instruction becomes law of the case once it is delivered, and the jury is accordingly bound by it; Sonju\u2019s unrefuted testimony was that upon Azure\u2019s release from confinement, he was placed in the DOC\u2019s Intensive Supervision Program and, thus, was under the DOC\u2019s restrictive \u201csupervision\u201d in May and June 2005; consequently, although Azure was convicted of an offense which required registration as a violent offender, his duty to register had not yet been triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b621 As support for this argument, Azure cites <em>State v. Cline, </em>170 Mont. 520, 555 P.2d 724 (1976), and <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2002 MT 117, 310 Mont. 18, 48 P.3d 706. In <em>Cline, </em>one of the defendants contended that under the instructions given to the jury, the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. The State responded that one of the instructions required the State to prove an element that was not part of the charged offense. We observed, however, that the State had offered this instruction, the court had given the instruction to the jury, and at that point, the instruction became the \u201claw of the case\u201d and the jury was bound thereby. <em>Cline, </em>170 Mont. at 526-27, 555 P.2d at 729. \u00b622 In <em>Crawford, </em>the State similarly claimed that one of the jury instructions included an element that was not part of the charged offense. <em>See Crawford, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Yet, during the process of finalizing the instructions, the State had not requested any alterations thereto. <em>See Crawford, </em>\u00b6 11. On these facts, we held that \u201cwhen the State fails to properly object to a jury instruction, the instruction, whether it includes an unnecessary element or not, becomes the law of the case once delivered, and the jury is accordingly bound by it.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 <em>27.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In so doing, we cited approvingly the following statement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>State v. Hickman, </em>954 P.2d 900, 902 (Wash. 1998): \u201cIn criminal cases, the State assumes the burden of proving otherwise unnecessary elements of the offense when such added elements are included without objection in the \u2018to convict\u2019 instruction.\u201d <em>See Crawford, </em>\u00b6 25. We also relied on the following passage from <em>State v. Robbins, </em>1998 MT 297, \u00b6 30, 292 Mont. 23, \u00b6 30, 971 P.2d 359, \u00b6 30, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6 61, 298 Mont. 358, \u00b6 61, 2 P.3d 204, \u00b6 61:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">[W]e agree with Robbins that the State\u2019s failure to object that negligent homicide is not a lesser included offense of deliberate homicide at the settling of jury instructions renders this instruction the law of the case. In the civil context, we have long adhered to the rule that an instruction given without an objection becomes the law of the case. There is no good reason why this same rule should not apply in the criminal context under the circumstances of this case-that is, where the State had ample opportunity to object to a proposed jury instruction before it was given to the jury, but failed to do so. [Citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><em>See Crawford, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b623 <em>Cline, Robbins, </em>and <em>Crawford </em>establish that where the State has the opportunity to object to a proposed jury instruction before it is given to the jury but fails to do so, that instruction, whether or not it includes an unnecessary element, becomes the law of the case once delivered, and the jury is accordingly bound by it. Azure\u2019s reliance on this rule, however, is misplaced because, as the State points out, the prosecutor did, in fact, object to Instruction No. 20 before it was given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b624 We note here the Dissent\u2019s contention that the State is now objecting to Instruction No. 20 on different grounds than it argued to the District Court. Dissent, \u00b6 38. The Dissent is mistaken for two reasons. First, Azure concedes in his opening brief that \u201c[Instruction No. 20], and <em>Wagner, </em>from which it derived, did not accurately reflect \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-503 and 504 because it referred to release from supervision . . . .\u201d In light of this concession, the State does not expend any of its appellate brief debating whether Instruction No. 20 was an accurate statement of the law. There was no need for the State to address this point in detail, given that Azure conceded it from the outset. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the State notes Azure\u2019s concession and then argues that his reading of Instruction No. 20 is \u201ccontrary to the actual law of the case.\u201d Thus, it is not clear why the Dissent believes that the State is raising a legal objection to Instruction No. 20 on appeal, when the point had already been conceded by Azure.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b625 Second, even if the State\u2019s argument could be interpreted as an objection to the legal content of Instruction No. 20, we conclude that the State is not arguing a new theory on appeal. As noted above, the trial judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel engaged in a lengthy discussion about when a violent offender\u2019s duty to register is triggered under \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-503 and -504, MCA. While defense counsel argued that the duty does not apply while an offender is \u201cunder the supervision of DOC,\u201d the State\u2019s position, which it maintained throughout the proceedings, was that the duty arises when the offender is released from \u201cphysical confinement.\u201d Thus, the Dissent\u2019s assertion in \u00b6 41 that the State failed to challenge \u201cthe legal content\u201d of Instruction No. 20 is incorrect. The State did challenge \u201cthe legal content\u201d of the instruction, arguing that an offender under the DOC\u2019s \u201csupervision\u201d does, in fact, have a duty to register-though the State clearly faced an uphill battle on this point, given that the language of the instruction was a direct quote from one of this Court\u2019s published precedents (namely, \u00b6 9 of <em>Wagner).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b626 Moreover, in light of the State\u2019s arguments under \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-503 and -504, MCA, this is not a case in which the District Court was not \u201callow[ed]... to \u2018avoid or correct\u2019 any purported errors.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 36. To the contrary, the court was in a position to correct the error contained in Instruction No. 20. For that matter, the court purported to agree with the State\u2019s position, ruling that \u201cunder the law, Mr. Azure had an obligation to register with either the sheriff or, if he lived within the confines of Missoula City, the chief of police; one or the other.\u201d Yet, shortly thereafter, the court inexplicably announced that it would give Instruction No. 20. Having already made her argument under the statutes, the prosecutor offered the additional argument that the case cited by Azure as authority for Instruction No. 20 involved different factual circumstances than the case at hand and that the language of the instruction, therefore, was not applicable to Azure\u2019s situation. For these reasons, we disagree with the Dissent that the State is advocating a position on appeal that it did not adequately raise in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b627 While Azure asserts in his opening appellate brief that the State did not object to Instruction No. 20, he concedes in his reply brief that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the State did object to it. Notwithstanding, Azure contends that even though Instruction No. 20 was objected to, it became the law of the case and it dictated his acquittal. In essence, Azure would have us extend the rule of <em>Cline, Robbins, </em>and <em>Crawford </em>to situations in which the State has objected to the erroneous jury instruction. Yet, Azure provides no authority supporting such an extension. For its part, the State fails to address this specific question in its brief. However, we note that in the myriad cases which recognize the rule that a jury instruction may become the law of the case, the articulation of this rule invariably includes the qualification that the instruction was not objected to. <em>See e.g. Robbins, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>United States v. Zanghi, </em>189 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Jokel, </em>969 F.2d 132, 136 (5th Cir. 1992) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Romero, </em>136 F.3d 1268, 1273 (10th Cir. 1998); <em>State v. Taggart, </em>430 N.W.2d 423, 425 (Iowa 1988); <em>State v. Martin, </em>565 P.2d 1041, 1044 (N.M. App. 1977), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Wilson, </em>867 P.2d 1175, 1177-78 (N.M. 1994); <em>People v. Leon, </em>643 N.Y.S.2d 262, 263 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996); <em>State v. Rogers, 730 </em>N.W.2d 859, 862-63 (N.D. 2007); <em>State v. Willis, </em>370 N.W.2d 193, 200 (S.D. 1985); <em>State v. Hickman, </em>954 P.2d 900, 902 (Wash. 1998); <em>Sanchez v. State, </em>751 P.2d 1300, 1308 (Wyo. 1988). We not aware of any cases holding that the law-of-the-case rule applies to instructions to which the government did timely object.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b628 Moreover, we are persuaded by the Tenth Circuit\u2019s observations on this subject in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>376 F.3d 1048 (10th Cir. 2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">The law of the case is applied to hold the government to the burden of proving each element of a crime as set out in a jury instruction to which it failed to object, even if the unchallenged jury instruction goes beyond the criminal statute\u2019s requirements. In cases to which the doctrine of law of the case applies, the evidence must conform to the unchallenged jury instructions to support a conviction. The doctrine of law of the case is an equitable remedy whose purpose is to prevent the government from arguing on appeal a position which it abandoned below. In the case at bar, however, the government objected to the supplemental instruction. The supplemental instruction did not become law of this case because the rationale which drives the doctrine in this context, <em>i.e., </em>holding the government to a charge to which it agreed, has no bearing when the government objects to the instruction in the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Williams, </em>376 F.3d at 1051-52 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b629 In the case at hand, the prosecutor objected to the language of Instruction No. 20. We reject Azure\u2019s contention that the instruction nevertheless became the law of the case simply because the District Court erroneously overruled the objection and gave the instruction to the jury. The State did not agree-tacitly or affirmatively-to prove that Azure had been released \u201cfrom confinement <em>and supervision,\u201d </em>nor was the State required to do so under the law, for the reasons discussed above. Thus, the rationale which drives the law-of-the-case doctrine has no bearing here, and we hold that the doctrine is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">\u00b630 <em>Issue 2. Is the jury\u2019s guilty verdict supported by the evidence under the applicable law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b631 The remaining question is whether there was sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In considering this question, we note that while Instruction No. 20 was an incorrect statement of the law, the error was in Azure\u2019s favor. Furthermore, Azure does not claim that the jury instructions, taken as a whole, did not otherwise fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. Thus, we will evaluate the evidence produced against Azure based on the essential elements of the offense as charged, disregarding the erroneous \u201cand supervision\u201d element of Instruction No. 20. <em>Cf. Williams, </em>376 F.3d at 1052 (refusing to constrain its analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence based on the jury instruction to which the government had objected); <em>Zanghi, </em>189 F.3d at 80 (stating that the patently erroneous jury instruction did not establish the standard by which the court would measure the sufficiency of the evidence; rather, the court would disregard the element set forth in the erroneous instruction and evaluate the evidence to determine if it would allow a rational jury to find each essential element of the offense, as charged under the statute, beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b632  Turning then to the evidence presented at trial, Sonju testified that Azure had been convicted of an offense which required registration as a violent offender, that Azure had been released from confinement with the DOC and placed in the Intensive Supervision Program, and that Azure changed his residence to South 8th Street in May 2005. Sonju also testified that he had advised Azure, on more than one occasion, to register the change of residence with the Missoula County Sheriffs Department but that Azure did not do so for fear that he and his wife would be evicted. Finally, Dietz testified that the most recent address update the Missoula County Sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Department had received from Azure was in January 2005 pertaining to his move from Cozy Court to Mormon Creek Road. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we hold that a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Azure knowingly failed to keep his registration as a violent offender current, in violation of \u00a7 46-23-507, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b633  Instruction No. 20 required the State to prove more than the law requires for the offense of failure to register as a violent offender. Because the State timely objected to this instruction, the law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply here. There was sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of failure to register as a violent offender beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> Notably, the Legislature amended the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act in 2005 and again in 2007.

The former is a typographical error. Therefore, lest there be any uncertainty as to whether the <em>Crawford </em>decision garnered a majority of the Court, we note that Justice Cotter\u2019s opinion was joined by Chief Justice Gray, <em>Justice Rice, </em>and Justice Leaphart.

Raising specific objections to jury instructions allows the parties and the district courts to \u201cavoid or correct\u201d any purported errors. <em>State v. Davis, </em>2000 MT 199, \u00b6 38, 300 Mont. 458, \u00b6 38, 5 P.3d 547, \u00b6 38. Assertions of error stand or fall on the grounds raised in the district court. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 39 (citations omitted). In <em>State v. Crawford, </em>we held that \u201cwhen the State fails to <em>properly </em>object to a jury instruction, the instruction, whether it includes an unnecessary element or not, becomes the law of the case once delivered, and the jury is accordingly bound by it.\u201d 2002 MT 117, \u00b6 27, 310 Mont. 18, \u00b6 27, 48 P.3d 706, \u00b6 27 (emphasis added). For a trial objection to be \u201cproper,\u201d the objection must be based on the same grounds as asserted on appeal. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">\u00b637 The above principles requiring a party to preserve issues for appeal through \u201cproper\u201d objections pertain to appellants. In a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>case, the State cannot appeal from a district court\u2019s jury instructions. Here, although the State is not the appellant, it is nonetheless contending that Azure should not receive the benefit of an erroneous instruction. The State cannot, however, argue legal error at the appellate level unless it raised the error at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b638 The prosecutor, defense counsel, and the court discussed the proposed jury instructions prior to voir dire, and, as the majority notes, they presented the court their differing views as to when a violent offender\u2019s duty to register is triggered. When settling the final jury instructions prior to closing, however, the State objected to Instruction 20 on the sole grounds that the factual circumstances present in the case that Azure relied on for Instruction 20\u2019s language differed from those presented by Azure\u2019s case. On appeal, the State objects to the instruction because it is not an accurate statement of the law. Thus, because the State now objects to Instruction 20 on different grounds than it argued to the District Court, its objection is not proper. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 38. Because the State failed to properly object to the jury instruction, by raising a factual objection at trial and not a legal objection, the jury instruction becomes the law of the case. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"AtB\">\u00b639 Other courts have allowed challenged jury instructions that misstate the law to constitute the law of the case when the basis for the trial objection differed from the grounds raised on appeal. For example, in <em>King v. Sowers, </em>471 S.E.2d 481 (Va. 1996), the trial court gave a jury instruction over the plaintiff\u2019s objection. The plaintiff objected at trial that the instruction was inapplicable to the evidence presented, but argued on appeal that the instruction misstated the law. The Virginia Supreme Court held that the instruction, though an incorrect statement of the law, became the law of the case because the trial objection did not challenge the instruction\u2019s legal content. <em>King, </em>471 S.E.2d at 484 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b640 In <em>Iowa v. Maghee, </em>573 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 1997), the criminal defendant objected on general grounds to a State\u2019s jury instruction. On appeal, however, the defendant argued that the jury instruction had no authority in Iowa law. The Iowa Supreme Court refused to allow the defendant to \u201camplify the grounds for the objection at trial or assert the specific objection for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Maghee, </em>573 N.W.2d at 8. The court held that \u201cthe challenged instruction-right or wrong \u2014 became the law of the case\u201d because the defendant\u2019s trial objection failed to preserve error. <em>Maghee, </em>573 N.W.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b641 The holdings of <em>King </em>and <em>Maghee </em>comport with our jurisprudence regarding appellate review of jury instructions and the law-of-the-case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>doctrine. At trial, the State failed to challenge the legal content of Instruction 20. Nonetheless, the State now argues that the instruction was a misstatement of the law. I conclude that since the State failed to raise a proper legal challenge to Instruction 20 at trial, the in struction becomes the law of the case, even though it does misstate the law. Considering the evidence and the applicable law of the case, including Instruction 20,1 conclude that sufficient evidence does not support the jury\u2019s verdict, and I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b642 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
