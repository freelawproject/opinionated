We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by affirming STAB\u2019s determination that the Department of Revenue\u2019s assessment requiring Frontier to pay additional taxes and interest for tax years 1995 and 1996 was timely?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\u00b64 The parties agree that the following facts are undisputed. Frontier is a Montana taxpayer and subject to corporate license tax. In 1998 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Notice of Deficiency to Frontier with respect to its federal tax liability for tax years 1994, 1995, and 1996. Frontier disputed the deficiency and initiated litigation in the United States Tax Court (Tax Court), claiming it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>amortize a non-compete agreement over a five-year period, rather than a fifteen-year period as argued by the IRS. In May 2001, the Tax Court rejected Frontier\u2019s claim. <em>See Frontier Chevrolet, Co. v. Commr, </em>116 T.C. 289 (2001). Subsequently Frontier stipulated to the financial figures subject to adjustment by way of Frontier\u2019s claim, and on August 31, 2001, the Tax Court issued its final decision, concluding therein that Frontier owed additional federal income tax for the years 1995 and 1996 in the amounts of $38,720 and $9,289 respectively. Frontier appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which subsequently affirmed the Tax Court decision on May 28, 2003. <em>Frontier Chevrolet, Co. v. Commr, </em>329 F.3d 1131 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b65 In July of 2004, the Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) received two Revenue Agent Reports from the IRS. Both reports reflected changes in Frontier\u2019s federal taxable income for tax years 1995 and 1996. On September 23, 2004, DOR issued Frontier an assessment of additional tax owing for tax years 1994,1995, and 1996. DOR and Frontier subsequently agreed to adjustments of the financial figures at issue in the initial assessment and DOR issued a revised assessment on April 4,2005, which addressed only tax years 1995 and 1996. The revised assessment indicated that Frontier owed an additional $7,687 in taxes for 1995 and $1,844 in taxes for 1996, plus interest accruing at a rate of one percent per month from the due date of each return to the payment date, for a total balance owed of $15,858.83 for 1995 and $3,614.32 for 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b66 Frontier appealed DOR\u2019s assessment to the DOR Office of Dispute Resolution (ODR), arguing that DOR had issued the assessment beyond the statute of limitation set forth in \u00a7 15-31-509, MCA (1997). DOR moved for dismissal of Frontier\u2019s appeal, which was granted by the hearing examiner, and Frontier appealed the dismissal to STAB. On October 3, 2006, STAB upheld the assessment, determining that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, issued May 28,2003, constituted \u201cthe final determination by a \u2018competent authority\u2019 pursuant to \u00a7 15-31-506, MCA[.]\u201d Accordingly, STAB concluded that \u201c[bjecause Frontier Chevrolet failed to timely file an amended Montana Return at the time it filed amended federal returns, and such a return was required by \u00a7 15-31-506, MCA, the DOR may assess tax liability pursuant to \u00a7 15-31-544, MCA, and is not barred by statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b67 Frontier then petitioned the District Court for review of STAB\u2019s decision, asserting that STAB \u201cmade incorrect conclusions of law related to the effects of the tax statutes of limitations on the time available to the [DOR] to assess taxes.\u201d The District Court affirmed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>concluding that \u201c\u00a7 15-31-544, MCA, operated to toll the general statute of limitations found at \u00a7 15-31-509, MCA.\u201d Frontier challenges this conclusion on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b68 A district court reviews an administrative decision to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the agency correctly interpreted the law. <em>O\u2019Neill v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 130, \u00b6 10, 310 Mont. 148, \u00b6 10, 49 P.3d 43, \u00b6 10. We employ the same standards when reviewing a district court order affirming or reversing an administrative decision. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>\u00b6 10. If we reach the same conclusion as the district court but on different grounds, we may still affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, \u00b6 21, 332 Mont. 303, \u00b6 21, 137 P.3d 545, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err by affirming STAB\u2019s determination that the Department of Revenue\u2019s assessment requiring Frontier to pay additional taxes and interest for tax years 1995 and 1996 was timely?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b6 10 Frontier contends that its stipulation with the Tax Court, whereby it agreed to adjust its reported federal taxable income, was not a \u201cchange or correction by the United States Internal Revenue Service or other competent authority\u2019 and therefore \u00a7 15-31-506, MCA (1997), does not apply and Frontier was not required to report a change to DOR. Accordingly, Frontier argues that the general three-year statute of limitation set forth in \u00a7 15-31-509, MCA (1997), began when its tax returns were filed for the respective years at issue and had expired by the time DOR issued its assessment in September, 2004, rendering it time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b611 DOR responds that \u201c[t]he plain language of \u00a7 15-31-506, MCA (1995), requires a corporate taxpayer to file with the Department a report of changes or corrections to its federal taxable income\u201d and Frontier\u2019s failure to do so tolled the limitations period, which it asserts is the five year statutory period set forth in \u00a7 15-31-509, MCA (1995). DOR concedes that it mistakenly relied on the 2005 MCA in the previous proceedings herein and mistakenly argued that the statute of limitation was tolled by \u00a7 15-31-544, MCA. While both STAB and the District Court determined that \u00a7 15-31-544, MCA, tolled the limitation period, DOR asks this Court to \u201canalyze the timeliness of the assessments pursuant to \u00a7 15-31-509(l)(b), MCA (1995), not \u00a7 15-31-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>544, MCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b612 The parties rely on different versions of the MCA, Frontier on the 1997 MCA and DOR on the 1995 MCA, without any explanation for their respective choices. Because the 1995 MCA was in effect at the time Frontier\u2019s 1995 and 1996 state taxes were incurred, review pursuant to the 1995 MCA is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b613 Section 15-31-506, MCA (1995), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">If the amount of a corporation\u2019s taxable income reported on its federal income tax return or the computation schedule filed for any taxable year is changed or corrected by the United States internal revenue service or other competent authority, the corporation shall report such proposed change or correction to the department within 90 days after receiving official notice thereof. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Although the Tax Court concluded that Frontier had \u201cdeficiencies in income tax due ... for the taxable years 1995 and 1996[,]\u201d Frontier contends that the Tax Court\u2019s decision does not constitute a \u201cchange or correction\u201d to its taxable income because the Tax Court\u2019s order arose by way of a stipulation entered by Frontier and the IRS. Frontier argues that it must report only those changes which result from litigation and, given the circumstances here, the obligation to report the change in its taxable federal income was not triggered. DOR replies that Frontier\u2019s federal taxable income \u201cincreased from the amounts stated on line 28, Federal Form 1120 for each of those years\u201d-the starting point for calculation of Frontier\u2019s state tax-and that these changes \u201cresulted from an IRS audit which led to the initiation of the federal litigation[,]\u201d which triggered the requirement to report to the DOR pursuant to \u00a7 15-31-506, MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b614 Section 15-31-506, MCA (1995), provides that a corporate taxpayer \u201cshall report\u201d to the DOR when \u201cthe amount of a corporation\u2019s taxable income reported on its federal income tax return ... is changed or corrected\u201d by the IRS or \u201cother competent authority.\u201d The statute does not require that the change or correction \u201cresult from litigation\u201d in order to trigger the obligation to report, as argued by Frontier. We believe that such a rendering would insert a requirement not contained within the plain language of the provision and would violate our duty, when construing a statute, \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b615  It is uncontested that Frontier\u2019s federal tax liability for tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>years 1995 and 1996 increased. This increase occurred after an IRS audit, issuance of a Notice of Deficiency, and the subsequent Tax Court order issued in August of 2001, which was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in May of 2003. The increase was thus occasioned by the IRS, whose position in this matter was further confirmed by the Tax Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which are unquestionably \u201ccompetent authorities\u201d as envisioned by the statute. Accordingly, Frontier was required to report the change in its 1995 and 1996 federal taxable income to DOR within ninety days of receiving notice of the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\">\u00b616  Although Frontier concedes it failed to report, it next argues that the statute of limitations expired prior to DOR\u2019s issuance of an assessment for these tax years. Both STAB and the District Court concluded that \u00a7 15-31-544, MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> tolled the statute of limitation set forth in \u00a7 15-31-509, MCA (1995), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and in 15-31-544, no deficiency shall be assessed or collected with respect to the year for which a return is filed unless the notice of additional tax proposed to be assessed is mailed within 5 years from the date the return was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In turn, \u00a7 15-31-544, MCA (1995), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">Whenever a return is required to be filed and the taxpayer files a fraudulent return or fails to file the return, the department may at any time assess the tax or begin a proceeding in court for the collection of the tax without assessment. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The District Court concluded from these provisions that \u201cSTAB appropriately determined [that Frontier] was required to file an amended Montana tax return setting forth the changes or corrections\u201d and because Frontier \u201cdid not file any such amended returns[,]\u201d \u00a7 15-31-544, MCA, tolled the limitation period within \u00a7 15-31-509, MCA. However, as explained above, \u00a7 15-31-506, MCA (1995), required only that Frontier \u201creport\u201d the changes to its federal taxable income, not that it file an amended return.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We cannot conclude that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>requirement to \u201creport\u201d is synonymous with \u201cfiling a return\u201d and thus, the District Court erred in reaching this conclusion. Section 15-31-544, MCA (1995), does not toll the statute of limitation in this case because that provision only applies when a taxpayer fails to \u201cfile a return\u201d or files a fraudulent return.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b617  Acknowledging this error, DOR asks us to review the tolling provisions within \u00a7 15-31-509(l)(b), MCA (1995), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">(1)... The limitations prescribed for giving notice of a proposed assessment of additional tax shall not apply when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">(b) a taxpayer has failed to file a report of changes in federal taxable income or an amended return as required by 15-31-506 until 5 years after the federal changes become final or the amended federal return was filed, whichever the case may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">As discussed above, Frontier failed to report the changes in its federal taxable income as required by \u00a7 15-31-506, MCA (1995). Accordingly, \u00a7 15-31-509(1)(b), MCA (1995), effectively tolled or extended the limitation period until \u201c5 years after the federal changes became final ....\u201d The parties thus argue about when the federal changes to Frontier\u2019s 1995 and 1996 federal tax liability became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b618 Frontier asserts that the federal \u201cchanges became final when the stipulation was reached[.]\u201d Frontier does not provide the date of the stipulation between it and the IRS, but offers that it occurred sometime \u201cbefore May of 2000 ....\u201d DOR contends that the federal changes became final on May 28, 2003, the date of the Ninth Circuit decision, and we agree with this position. Frontier explains in its briefing that had Frontier \u201cprevailed on the amortization issue raised at the Tax Court and appealed to the Court of Appeals, the taxes for the years 1995 and 1996 would have been decreased and not increased.\u201d Though this is offered to explain that the litigation did not produce the increase in its taxes, it also serves to acknowledge that the federal changes were not final until the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion on May 28, 2003, and thereby resolved the disputed tax liability. As such, DOR\u2019s September 23, 2004, assessment was issued well within the five year limitation period as provided within \u00a7 15-31-509(l)(b), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u00b619  Although the District Court erred by relying on \u00a7 15-31-544, MCA, to conclude the limitation period had been tolled, we reach the same conclusion under application of a different statute. Upon that alternative ground, <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 21, we conclude that DOR\u2019s assessment was timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-4\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> It is unclear on which version of \u00a7 15-31-544, MCA, STAB and the District Court relied.
