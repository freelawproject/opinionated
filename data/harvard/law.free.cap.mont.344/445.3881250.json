We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it denied Wagner-Ellsworth and Tiffany\u2019s motions for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Allstate?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">\u00b64 On February 22, 2000, Wagner-Ellsworth caused an automobile-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>pedestrian collision, striking Matthew Rusk (Matthew) as he and his brother, Brandon, crossed the street together in front of their elementary school. Matthew\u2019s mother, Tiffany, while not immediately present at the time of the accident, was arriving to pick up her sons from school and came upon Matthew while he was still lying injured on the street. Matthew suffered severe trauma and was hospitalized for an extended period of time. All of Matthew\u2019s claims stemming from the accident have been fully and finally settled and released in exchange for Allstate\u2019s payment of the per-person limit of $50,000 under Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">\u00b65 Tiffany filed a negligence action against Wagner-Ellsworth on her own behalf and as guardian of Brandon, claiming emotional and physical injuries to herself and to Brandon. Tiffany and Brandon contend they were traumatized and suffered injury, not by being struck by the car, but rather as a result of Matthew being run over and injured. Brandon\u2019s injuries were allegedly the result of seeing his brother run over; Tiffany\u2019s injuries allegedly resulted from her arrival at the accident scene, the subsequent ambulance ride to the hospital, and her continued care of Matthew as he recovered. The complaint alleged that they both suffered physical and emotional injuries. Brandon allegedly became withdrawn and Tiffany allegedly suffered from stress, migraine headaches, a rapid heart beat when she hears sirens, physical pain, and depression. Both Brandon and Tiffany underwent therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b66 In response to the suit, Wagner-Ellsworth sought coverage from her liability insurer, Allstate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Allstate then filed this action, seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to provide a defense or coverage to Wagner-Ellsworth for Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s claims of emotional and psychological injuries and any resulting physical manifestations. The District Court granted Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b67 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>Hern v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Illinois, </em>2005 MT 301, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 347, \u00b6 18, 125 P.3d 597, \u00b6 18 (citations omitted). Our standard of review for an appeal from a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is de novo. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u00b68 Here, the issue before this Court is whether, under the terms of Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s insurance policy, Allstate was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \u201cThe interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 72, \u00b6 9, 320 Mont. 375, \u00b6 9, 87 P.3d 995, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 10, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 10). Consequently, we review whether the District Court correctly interpreted the provisions of Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s insurance policy. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err when it denied Wagner-Ellsworth and Tiffany\u2019s motions for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Allstate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b610 At the time of the accident, Wagner-Ellsworth was covered by Allstate automobile Policy No. 020343927. The policy\u2019s General Statement of Coverage declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Bodily Injury Liability Coverage and Property Damage Liability Coverage, Allstate will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">a. bodily injury sustained by any person ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The policy defined \u201cbodily injury\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">\u201cBodily Injury\u201d means physical harm to the body, sickness, disease, or death, but does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">a. Any venereal disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">b. Herpes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-13\">c. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-14\">d. AIDS Related Complex (ARC);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-15\">e. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); or any resulting symptom, effect, condition, disease or illness related to a. through e. listed above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-17\">\u00b611 The District Court held that the policy language contained in Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s liability policy did not cover Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s claimed injuries, relying on <em>Jacobsen v. Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. </em>In <em>Jacobsen, </em>the plaintiff attempted to collect under his own uninsured coverage for alleged emotional injuries he had suffered. Jacobsen was driving his vehicle when he encountered another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction. That vehicle suddenly crossed the center median and eventually came to rest in a wheat field on the other side of the roadway. Jacobsen stopped to help and found the driver lying unconscious in his vehicle, with blood flowing from a wound in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>head. Jacobsen administered aid for several minutes, but was later supplanted by a team of paramedics. As the paramedics removed the driver from his vehicle, Jacobsen noticed a handgun underneath the driver\u2019s body. The cause of death was later determined to be a suicide. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Jacobsen claimed that his emotional injuries as well as his resulting physical manifestations were covered under his uninsured coverage for \u201cbodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">\u00b612 After concluding there was no ambiguity in the meaning of \u201cbodily injury,\u201d and with no prior Montana case addressing whether emotional or psychological injuries constituted \u201cbodily injury,\u201d this Court looked to the United States District Court\u2019s holding in <em>Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. v. First Sec. Bank of Bozeman, 662 F. </em>Supp. <em>1126 </em>(D. Mont. 1987), and concluded that the emotional injury suffered by Jacobsen, including the physical manifestations resulting therefrom, did not constitute \u201cbodily injury\u201d as defined in that policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b613 Here, the District Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">The language in the Farmers\u2019 Union policy and the Allstate policy in question are too similar to allow this Court to overlook the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jacobsen. </em>The language defining \u201cbodily injury\u201d is unambiguous and does not include the injuries Brandon and Tiffany have claimed or any physical manifestations that may result from the psychological damages. The Court will not extend itself to create an ambiguity where there is none. While Montana law concerning insurance contracts has developed with the intention of providing fundamental protection to consumers, this does not allow this Court to simply ignore the clear terms of a contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We commend the District Court for its close adherence to precedent. However, after a careful review of the policy language at issue here, and of the analysis employed in <em>Jacobsen, </em>we ultimately conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>herein that our decision in <em>Jacobsen </em>was incorrectly analyzed and should be overruled, requiring reversal of the District Court. For purposes of promoting clarity, we discuss the issues raised in the following three parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">I. Coverage of Third-Party Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b614 Tiffany argues the District Court erred by not applying the plain language of the contract because it provides coverage for \u201cdamages\u201d more generally, and not strictly for bodily injury. She notes that the policy requires Allstate to pay for \u201cdamages which an insured person is legally responsible to pay because of bodily injury sustained by any person ....\u201d Tiffany contends this language is broader than the policy language at issue <em>in. Jacobsen. </em>Therefore, since Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s damages were incurred \u201cbecause of\u2019 Matthew\u2019s bodily injury, she argues that their damages were covered whether or not they suffered the bodily injury themselves. Wagner-Ellsworth agrees, and likewise contends that the District Court failed to consider these material differences between the policy language in <em>Jacobsen </em>and her policy with Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b615 In response, Allstate argues this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jacobsen </em>controls the outcome of this action because, as in <em>Jacobsen, </em>the unambiguous definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s Allstate policy does not include emotional or psychological injuries or resulting physical manifestations. Citing <em>Graber v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>244 Mont. 265, 270, 797 P.2d 214, 217 (1990), which held an insurer was not obligated to indemnify an insured where the claims do not come within the coverage of the policy, Allstate reasons that Appellants\u2019 proffered interpretation defies common sense and ignores the \u201cunbroken connection\u201d in the policy language requiring the \u201cbodily injury\u201d to be sustained by the \u201cany person\u201d for whose damages the insured person may be legally obligated. Appellants\u2019 interpretation, Allstate argues, severs the link between the person who suffers the bodily injury and the person claiming damages and re-writes the policy to mean that \u201cAllstate will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: bodily injury sustained by any person, <em>whether the damages are suffered by the person who sustained the bodily injury or by any other person ...\u201d </em>(emphasis in Allstate\u2019s brief). Consequently, Allstate urges that Appellants\u2019 argument be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b616 \u201cThis Court is bound to interpret the terms of this insurance policy according to their usual, common sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance products.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (1997). We \u201cmay not rewrite the contract at issue, but must enforce it as written if its language is clear and explicit.\u201d <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">\u00b617 We disagree with Allstate\u2019s position. The language in the opening General Statement of Coverage in Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s policy is indeed broader than the policy language at issue in <em>Jacobsen. </em>The policy here states: \u201cAllstate will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of... a. bodily injury sustained by any person.\u201d In contrast, the uninsured coverage provision in <em>Jacobsen </em>stated that \u201cdamages must result from \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by the \u2018insured.\u2019\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 12. While the policy in <em>Jacobsen </em>required that the insured be the person who suffered the bodily injury, Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s policy requires payment for damages that an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury sustained by <em>any person </em>in a covered accident, whether to the claimant directly or to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b618 The language here provides coverage to Wagner-Ellsworth for Matthew\u2019s damages, as he sustained a bodily injury. However, Tiffany and Brandon also allege that they sustained damages \u201cbecause of\u2019 Matthew\u2019s bodily injury, and thus their claims necessarily fall within the language which provides that \u201cAllstate will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of... a. bodily injury sustained by any person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b619 This interpretation is supported by the policy\u2019s Limitation of Liability section, which provides that \u201c[t]he limit stated for each person for bodily injury is our total limit of liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by one person, <em>including all damages sustained by anyone else </em>as a result of that bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language contemplates third party claims such as those made here by Tiffany and Brandon and reinforces Allstate\u2019s obligation to insure Wagner-Ellsworth against those claims for damages-within the applicable monetary limits of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b620  In summary, the broad language used in the policy\u2019s General Statement of Coverage and the Limits of Liability section provide Wagner-Ellsworth with coverage for the claims made by Tiffany and Brandon resulting from Matthew\u2019s bodily injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">II. Monetary Limits for Derivative Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b621 Allstate notes that because Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s initial argument premises their claims upon Matthew\u2019s bodily injury, and not on their own bodily injuries, their claims necessarily derive from Matthew\u2019s bodily injury. As such, Allstate argues that, even under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>interpretation of the policy rendered above in Section I, no funds are available for Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s derivative claims, because the policy limits for coverage have already been exhausted for Matthew\u2019s claim, citing to <em>Bain v. Gleason, </em>223 Mont. 442, 451-52, 726 P.2d 1153, 1158-59 (1986). In <em>Bain, </em>this Court considered whether a consortium claim was subject to the \u201ceach person\u201d limit of liability in an insurance policy, and, in doing so, examined both the policy and the mandatory motor vehicle liability insurance law, \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA (1981). In determining that the consortium claim came within the each person limitation, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">Our interpretation of the Farmers\u2019 policy in the case at bar must follow our interpretation of the statutes as they apply to mandatory motor vehicle liability insurance. It is plain under our statutes, and under the policy provisions here that the \u201ceach person\u201d limitation refers to all damages imposed by law by whomever suffered resulting from one bodily injury and one accident; the \u201ceach accident\u201d limitation applies when two or more persons suffer bodily injury in the same accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><em>Bain, </em>223 Mont. at 451, 726 P.2d at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b622  The statute governing the liability policy at issue here, \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA (2003), requires that the policy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">insure the ... insured ... against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages . . . subject to limits ... as follows: ... (i) $25,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and subject to said limit for one person; (ii) $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident[.]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Thus, the statute requires that the owner or operator be insured for losses from liability imposed by law subject to the limits stated for a single bodily injury or for bodily injuries to two or more persons. The coverage language of the statute is similar to the language in the Allstate policy, which provides coverage for \u201cdamages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of... bodily injury sustained by any person,\u201d and which we have interpreted in Section I to include Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s claims stemming from Matthew\u2019s bodily injury. However, the statute also requires that the coverage provided for claims arising \u201cbecause of\u2019 the bodily injury of another be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201csubject to said limit for <em>one </em>person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the statutory monetary coverage limit specified for a bodily injury to one person applies to others who have suffered losses arising from the bodily injury to that one person.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b623 An examination of the Allstate policy at issue reveals that it tracks the statutory coverage language. Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s policy states, with regard to \u201cLimits of Liability,\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">The limits shown on the Policy Declarations are the maximum we will pay for any single accident involving an insured auto. <em>The limit stated for each person for bodily injury is our total limit of liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by one person, including all damages sustained by anyone else as a result of that bodily injury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Subject to the limit for each person, the limit stated for each accident is our total limit of liability for all damages for bodily injury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">(Emphasis added.) Like the statute, the Allstate policy applies the \u201ceach person\u201d monetary limit to not only the damages suffered by the person who suffered the bodily injury, but also to the damages suffered by anyone else as a result of that bodily injury. The \u201ceach accident\u201d or, as stated in the policy, \u201ceach occurrence\u201d monetary limitation applies only when two or more persons suffer bodily injury in one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ5h\">\u00b624 Therefore, Allstate is correct that, even though Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s claims for damages because of Matthew\u2019s bodily injury are covered under Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s policy, those damages are subject to the \u201ceach person\u201d monetary limit applicable to Matthew, which amount was exhausted in Matthew\u2019s settlement. Therefore, despite coverage, there are no additional funds available under this policy for Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s derivative claims. Only if Tiffany and Brandon can establish that their claims likewise fall within the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury,\u201d thus establishing that there are two or more bodily injury claims in this accident, will the higher \u201ceach accident\u201d monetary limits of the policy be triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">III. Emotional Distress with Physical Manifestations as \u201cBodily Injury\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u00b625 We then turn to Appellants\u2019 argument that Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s emotional injuries, with resulting physical manifestations, fall within the Allstate policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cphysical harm to the body, sickness, disease, or death ... [listing exceptions].\u201d As noted, the District Court relied on <em>Jacobsen </em>in granting summary judgment in favor of Allstate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">[t]he language in the Farmers\u2019 Union policy and the Allstate policy in question are too similar to allow this Court to overlook the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jacobsen. </em>The language defining \u201cbodily injury\u201d is unambiguous and does not include the injuries Brandon and Tiffany have claimed or any physical manifestations that may result from the psychological damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayoq\">\u00b626 Tiffany argues that she and Brandon suffered \u201cshock and fright\u201d when Matthew was run over, leading to physical symptoms that should constitute a \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Wagner-Ellsworth agrees, and contends the Allstate policy is distinguishable from the policy in <em>Jacobsen, </em>providing broader coverage. Wagner-Ellsworth argues that because \u201cbodily injury\u201d is defined in the Allstate policy as \u201cphysical harm to the body, sickness, disease, or death,\u201d this definition creates a disjunctive list based on the use of commas which creates coverage for Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s asserted emotional injuries as a \u201csickness\u201d or \u201cdisease.\u201d Alternatively, she argues that if the definition did not create a disjunctive list, then the definition is ambiguous and, either way, Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s emotional injuries should be covered without an underlying physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b627 Allstate responds that the mere use of the word \u201cor\u201d in the definition of bodily injury does not make the definition disjunctive or otherwise turn the individual components of the definition into separate bases for coverage. Moreover, Allstate argues that, consistent with <em>Jacobsen, </em>the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the policy is unambiguous and does not include emotional or psychological injuries or resulting physical manifestations. In reply, Appellants respectfully suggest that the Court \u201crevisit\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>noting that <em>stare decisis </em>does not require the Court to follow \u201ca manifestly wrong decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b628 We agree with Allstate and the District Court that the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in this case is substantially similar to the definition at issue in <em>Jacobsen </em>(\u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person including death resulting from any of these\u201d). We are not persuaded by Wagner-Ellsworth\u2019s argument that the policy\u2019s use of commas and the word \u201cor\u201d within the definition requires a different outcome than we reached in <em>Jacobsen. Jacobsen </em>thus requires a decision for Allstate if it was correctly decided. However, we accept Appellants\u2019 invitation to revisit and reconsider our holding in <em>Jacobsen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b629 In reaching our decision in <em>Jacobsen, </em>this Court relied heavily on the United States District Court\u2019s 1987 <em>Aetna </em>decision. In <em>Aetna, </em>the insurer brought a declaratory action seeking judgment that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>liability insurance policy it had issued to a bank did not provide coverage for certain damages claimed by an employee who had been discharged, including damages for emotional distress. <em>Aetna, </em>662 F. Supp. at 1127. The parties argued over whether a claim for emotional distress came within the term \u201cbodily injury.\u201d <em>Aetna, </em>662 F. Supp. at 1128. After noting that Montana law contained no authority on point, the United States District Court stated: \u201c[w]here it appears that the highest court of Montana has not squarely addressed a particular question, this court must forecast what the Montana Supreme Court would do were it confronted with the same question.\u201d <em>Aetna, </em>662 F. Supp. at 1127 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b630 <em>The Aetna </em>court first stated that courts which had interpreted the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d as used in comprehensive general liability insurance policies \u201chave determined that it limits coverage to physical injury to the body\u201d and cited to several cases. <em>Aetna, </em>662 F. Supp. at 1128. The court then observed that \u201c[i]n tort actions alleging mental suffering, the Montana Supreme Court has distinguished mental and emotional harm from physical harm.\u201d <em>Aetna, </em>662 F. Supp. at 1128 (citation omitted). The court thus concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">In light of the Montana court\u2019s recognition that \u201cthere is a difference between (physical) injury and (mental) distress,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>[v. <em>Supersave Markets, Inc., </em>211 Mont. 465, 472, 686 P.2d 209, 212 (1984)], it is likely the Montana Supreme Court would follow the lead of the above-cited decisions and hold that the term \u201cbodily injury,\u201d as used in the liability insurance policy at issue, limits coverage to <em>physical </em>injury, sickness or disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>Aetna, </em>662 F. Supp. at 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b631 In <em>Jacobsen, </em>we concurred with the rationale set forth in <em>Aetna </em>and concluded that \u201cthe term \u201cbodily injury,\u2019 as defined in Farmers Union UM policy, is limited to physical injury to a person caused by an accident and does not include emotional and psychological injuries stemming therefrom.\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 29. We thus held that Jacobsen\u2019s emotional injuries, <em>\u201cincluding his physical manifestations resulting therefrom, </em>do not constitute \u201cbodily injury\u2019 as that term is defined in the contract of insurance between Farmers Union and Jacobsen ....\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 29 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u00b632 We are troubled by the analysis we employed in <em>Jacobsen </em>in a couple respects. First, <em>Aetna </em>was decided prior to the development of a significant body of court decisions which perceived a distinction between mental injuries and mental injuries with physical manifestations. <em>See e.g. Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Colonial Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>124 F. Supp. 2d 1243, 1247 (M.D. Ala. 2000) (applying South <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Carolina law, emotional trauma can constitute \u201cbodily injury\u201d unless the complaint contains no allegations of physical damages); <em>Am. Motorists Ins. Co. v. S. Sec. Life Ins. </em>Co., 80 F. Supp. 2d 1280, 1283 (M.D. Ala. 2000) (under Florida law, allegation of physically manifested mental anguish met insurance policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d); <em>Gen. Star Indem. Co. v. Sch. Excess Liability Fund, </em>888 F. Supp. 1022, 1027 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (\u201cPhysical injury resulting from emotional distress, however, constitutes \u2018bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Nikitow, </em>924 P.2d 1084, 1089 (Colo. App. 1995) (although the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d in insurance contract did not encompass purely emotional harm, coverage was available if injury was accompanied by physical manifestations); <em>Garvis v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>497 N.W.2d 254, 257 (Minn. 1993) (\u201cemotional distress with appreciable physical manifestations can qualify as a \u2018bodily injury\u2019 within the meaning of the insurance policy\u201d); <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>607 A.2d 1255, 1262 (N.J. 1992) (emotional distress resulting in headaches, stomach pains, nausea, and body pains constituted \u201cbodily injury\u201d under homeowner\u2019s insurance policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b633 Reliance on <em>Aetna </em>may well have led the <em>Jacobsen </em>Court to overlook this later development in the law which addressed the distinction between these injuries. However, without an understanding of this development, the Court was unequipped to recognize that none of the cases upon which <em>Aetna </em>relied, <em>American and For. Ins. Co. v. Church Schools, Diocese of Virginia, </em>645 F. Supp. 628 (E.D. Va. 1986), <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Campbell County Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>612 F. Supp. 285 (D.Wyo. 1985), <em>and Rolette County v. Western Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>452 F. Supp. 125 (D.N.D. 1978), involved mental injuries accompanied by physical manifestations. To the contrary, they addressed whether strictly mental injuries were included within the term \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Thus, this precedent did not provide precise authority for Jacobsen\u2019s conclusion that a mental injury with physical manifestations could not constitute a bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b634 To further explain, <em>American and For. Ins. Co. </em>held that \u201cbodily injury\u201d did not include emotional damages in the absence of physical injury. <em>American and For. Ins. Co., </em>645 F. Supp. at 632. However, the injured party alleged \u201cpurely emotional harm,\u201d with no assertion regarding physical manifestations. <em>American and For. Ins. Co., </em>645 F. Supp. at 632. Similarly, in <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>the court found that \u201c[s]ince Ms. Worth is not suing for a physical injury or disease, the Court concludes that plaintiff insurance company has no duty to defend or cover any losses\u201d and further held that emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>suffering \u201cwithout physical changes\u201d did not constitute bodily injury. <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>612 F. Supp. at 287-88. Finally, the court in <em>Rolette County </em>held that the insurer was not required to defend the insured against a complaint alleging the injured party was embarrassed and humiliated and suffered great mental anguish and emotional distress. <em>Rolette County, </em>452 F. Supp. at 129-30. Again, the injured party in that case alleged no physical manifestations arising from the emotional injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b635 Given the clear development in the law which distinguished mental injuries from mental injuries with physical manifestations, <em>Aetna </em>and the aforementioned cases it relied upon did not provide current, on-point support for <em>Jacobsen\u2019s </em>holding that emotional injuries, \u201cincluding ... physical manifestations resulting therefrom, do not constitute \u201cbodily injury as that term is defined in the contract of insurance ....\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 29. None of those cases involved mental injuries accompanied by physical manifestations and, without more, this critical distinction was missed entirely. We should have examined the plentiful authority addressing such injuries which had developed by the time <em>Jacobsen </em>was decided in 2004 in order to provide a more accurate analysis of relevant authority. We now make the belated effort to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b636 A review of our sister states\u2019 case law, including those cases referenced above in \u00b6 32, reveals that various courts have held that allegations of physically-manifested emotional distress fall within bodily injury coverage in the insurance context. <em>See also </em>Keri Farrell-Kolb, <em>General Liability Coverage for Claims of Emotional Distress </em>\u2014 An <em>Insurance Nightmare, </em>45 Drake L. Rev. 981, 993 (1997) (\u201cmany courts agree that allegations of emotional distress or mental anguish come within bodily injury coverage if accompanied by allegations of physical manifestations\u201d). The Washington Court of Appeals has observed that \u201cmany courts have held that allegations of physically-manifested emotional distress fall within \u201cbodily injury coverage in the insurance context.\u201d <em>Trinh v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>37 P.3d 1259, 1262 (Wash. App. Div. 2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b637 In <em>Trinh, </em>the plaintiff, after witnessing her friend\u2019s death in a car accident, began to experience emotional trauma accompanied by multiple physical ailments including headaches, nausea, hair loss, and weight loss. At issue was whether her injuries constituted \u201cbodily injury\u201d under the insurance policy, which defined bodily injury as \u201cbodily injury, sickness, disease or death[.]\u201d <em>Trinh, </em>37 P.3d at 1261. The Washington Court of Appeals first observed that Washington followed the view that \u2018\u201cin the context of purely emotional injuries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>without physical manifestations, the phrase \u2018bodily injury\u2019 is not ambiguous. Its ordinary meaning connotes a physical problem.\u2019\u201d <em>Trinh, </em>37 P.3d at 1261-62 (citation omitted). However, the Washington Court of Appeals also noted that \u201cmany jurisdictions that deny \u2018bodily injury\u201d coverage for purely emotional injuries have indicated that there would be coverage if an emotional injury were accompanied by physical manifestations.\u201d <em>Trinh, </em>37 P.3d at 1263 (citations omitted). Persuaded by this authority, it concluded that the term bodily injury \u201cincludes emotional injuries that are accompanied by physical manifestations.\u201d <em>Trinh, </em>37 P.3d at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b638 In <em>State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Basham, </em>520 N.W.2d 713 (Mich. App. 1994), the insurer filed a declaratory action to determine its obligations under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that \u201cabsent physical manifestations, the phrase \u2018bodily injury\u2019 does not include a claim for psychiatric damage\u201d but, on the other hand, noted that \u201callegations of physical manifestations supported by sufficient documented evidence\u201d would be sufficient to trigger coverage as bodily injury. <em>State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>520 N.W.2d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b639  We are cognizant that \u201c[v]ery weighty considerations underlie the principle that courts should not lightly overrule past decisions.\u201d <em>Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 403, 90 S. Ct. 1772, 1789 (1970). We have held, in this regard, that <em>\u201cstare decisis </em>is a fundamental doctrine which reflects our concerns for stability, predictability and equal treatment....\u201d <em>Formicove, Inc. v. Burlington Northern, Inc., </em>207 Mont. 189, 194, 673 P.2d 469, 472 (1983). \u201cCourt decisions are not sacrosanct, however, and <em>stare decisis </em>is \u2018not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gatts, </em>279 Mont. 42, 51, 928 P.2d 114, 119 (1996) (quoting <em>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172, 109 S. </em>Ct. 2363, 2370 (1989)). We have held, as noted by Appellants, that <em>stare decisis </em>does not require us to follow \u201ca manifestly wrong decision.\u201d <em>Formicove, </em>207 Mont. at 194, 673 P.2d at 472 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b640  We now conclude that we manifestly erred in <em>Jacobsen </em>by failing to recognize the development in the law with regard to mental injuries with physical manifestations. Many courts have concluded in insurance interpretation cases like this one that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d is ambiguous when applied to physical problems arising from a mental injury. \u201cAn ambiguity exists when an insurance contract, taken as a whole, is reasonably subject to two or more different interpretations.\u201d <em>Heggem v. Capitol Indem. Corp., 2007 </em>MT 74, \u00b6 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>336 Mont. 429, \u00b6 22, 154 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 22 (citation omitted). The definition of \u201cbodily injury\u2019 in the Allstate policy-\u201cphysical harm to the body, sickness, disease, or death\u201d-could mean a strictly physical injury or could also include physical manifestations arising from a mental injury or sickness. \u201cAny ambiguity in an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured and in favor of extending coverage.\u201d <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 174, \u00b6 17, 108 P.3d 469, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted). We thus join other courts which have construed the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d within an insurance policy to include a mental or psychological injury that is accompanied by physical manifestations. We therefore hold that Tiffany and Brandon\u2019s claims, to the extent they are based on physical manifestations, fall within the \u201cbodily injury\u2019 definition of WagnerEllsworth\u2019s Allstate policy and may be asserted on that basis. We agree, in light of the preceding analysis, that in the context of purely emotional injuries without physical manifestations, the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u2019 is not ambiguous and its ordinary meaning connotes a physical problem and not purely emotional injuries. <em>See Trinh, </em>37 P.3d at 1263; <em>see also Kolb, </em>45 Drake L. Rev. at 986-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b641 We recognize that distinguishing between injuries which have physical manifestations from those which do not can be challenging. <em>See Pekin Ins. Co. v. Hugh, </em>501 N.W.2d 508 (Iowa 1993) (noting the belief that \u201c \u2018every emotional disturbance has a physical aspect and every physical disturbance has an emotional aspect.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). It has been held that \u201cthere is no litmus test for determining where to draw the line between emotional and physical injuries....\u201d <em>SL Industries, Inc. v. American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>607 A.2d 1266, 1273 (N.J. 1992). Courts have struggled with these distinctions, focusing on the facts of each case. <em>Compare State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Westchester Inv. Co., </em>721 F. Supp. 1165, 1167 (C.D. Cal. 1989) (dry throat, rise in body temperature, and knot in stomach were sufficient physical manifestations of emotional distress to constitute bodily injury), <em>W. Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Waisanen, </em>653 F. Supp. 825, 832 (D.S.D. 1987) (allegation of high blood pressure was sufficient to bring within definition of bodily injury), and <em>Trinh, </em>37 P.3d at 1264 (bodily injury includes emotional distress where it is accompanied by physical symptoms such as weight loss, sleep loss, headaches, stomach pains, and muscle aches) <em>with Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. of Michigan v. Hoag, </em>356 N.W.2d 630, 633 (Mich. App. 1984) (\u201cbodily injury\u2019 does not encompass damages for humiliation, mental anguish, and mental suffering; at a minimum, physical manifestation of mental suffering is necessary to satisfy bodily injury requirement), <em>Economy Preferred Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Co. v. Jia, </em>92 P.3d 1280, 1284 (N.M. App. 2004) (\u201ccrying, shaking, and sleep difficulties are not enough\u201d), and <em>SL Indus., </em>Inc., 607 A.2d at 1273-75 (\u201cbodily injury\u201d does not include emotional distress claims accompanied only by allegations of \u201closs of sleep, loss of self esteem, humiliation and irritability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b642 We echo the statement made by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in a similar case that although, as a result of this holding, \u201ca few plaintiffs may be tempted to assert emotional distress with accompanying physical manifestations more often, that will not necessarily obligate insurers to undertake unbounded duties to defend and indemnify. When an emotional distress claim is not supported factually, the insurer can and should move to dismiss the meritless claims.\u201d <em>Voorhees, </em>607 A.2d at 1262. Each case must necessarily be judged by its own facts to determine whether the alleged injuries are sufficiently akin to physical injuries to fall within coverage for \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Such conditions include those which are susceptible to medical diagnosis and treatment in a manner which distinguishes them from mental injuries. <em>See State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>520 N.W.2d at 715 (\u201cAt a minimum, there must be allegations of physical manifestations supported by sufficient documented evidence in order for insurance coverage to be triggered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b643  Appellants have raised a genuine issue of material fact about whether Tiffany and Brandon suffered mental injuries with physical manifestations. Such injuries would be covered within the subject policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s summaryjudgment order.
