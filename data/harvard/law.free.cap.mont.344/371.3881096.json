In this case, he spent five days in jail following his arrest on January 16, 2005, and was then released on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b64 On February 13, 2005, in Cascade County Cause Number CDC-05-105, the State charged Henderson with theft and criminal mischief. He was arrested on that charge, but was unable to post bail, and he spent 301 days in jail following his arrest and prior to judgment. Henderson\u2019s bail in this case, CDC-05-047, was not revoked following his arrest on the charges in CDC-05-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b65 Henderson pled guilty to the theft charges in both CDC-05-047 and CDC-05-105, pursuant to a single plea agreement. The State agreed to recommend a sentence of ten years with five years suspended on each of the charges in the separate cases, and also to recommend that the District Court order the sentences to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b66 On December 13, 2005, the District Court orally pronounced sentence and ordered that in both cause numbers Henderson be sentenced to serve ten years with five years suspended. In this case, CDC-05-047, the District Court gave Henderson credit for five days served. In CDC-05-105, Henderson received 301 days credit for time served. The written judgment did not specify that the sentences were to be served concurrently. However, upon motion by Henderson\u2019s counsel, the District Court issued a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order clarifying that the sentences were to run concurrently. Henderson\u2019s appointed counsel was allowed to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u00b67 Henderson then filed a <em>pro se </em>motion in the District Court for an order correcting his sentence in this case, increasing the credit for time served from five days to 306 days. He argued that he should receive credit in this case for all time served prior to the time he was sentenced. The District Court denied his motion, and Henderson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\u00b68  We review a sentence for legality, examining only whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>is within statutory parameters. <em>State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 220, \u00b6 12, 113 P.3d 297, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b69 Section 46-18-403(1), MCA, provides that a \u201cperson incarcerated on a bailable offense against whom a judgment of imprisonment is rendered must be allowed credit for each day of incarceration prior to or after conviction.\u201d We have interpreted this to mean that a defendant receives credit for the time incarcerated only if the incarceration was directly related to the offense for which the sentence is imposed. <em>State v. Kime, </em>2002 MT 38, \u00b6 16, 308 Mont. 341, \u00b6 16, 43 P.3d 290, \u00b6 16. In <em>Kime, </em>we concluded that the District Court correctly refused to credit the defendant with time served relating to a prior felony conviction while he was awaiting sentencing on subsequent charges. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 16. A defendant is not entitled to receive credit for pre-conviction time served on an offense if he is not incarcerated for that particular offense. <em>State v. Erickson, </em>2005 MT 276, \u00b6 25, 329 Mont. 192, \u00b6 25, 124 P.3d 119, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b610  The record does not show that Henderson\u2019s bond was revoked in this case, Cascade County CDC-05-047. Had he posted bond on the offense he was later arrested for, Cascade County CDC-05-105, he would not have been held on the charge in this case. Therefore, the 301 days Henderson was incarcerated following his arrest in Cascade County CDC-05-105 were not directly related to the offense charged in this case, and he is not entitled to credit for any additional time served. Kime,\u00b6 16. The District Court did not impose an illegal sentence when it refused to credit Henderson in CDC-05-047 with the pre-conviction time he served in CDC-05-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b611 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
