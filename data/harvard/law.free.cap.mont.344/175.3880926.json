We reverse and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court imposed an illegal sentence when it ordered VanWinkle to pay an $85 fee to the local community service program as a condition of his deferred imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">\u00b63 On November 30,2006, VanWinkle pled guilty to felony burglary pursuant to a plea agreement he entered into with the State of Montana (State). In exchange for the guilty plea, the State agreed to recommend to the District Court that VanWinkle receive a three-year deferred imposition of sentence, subject to various conditions. Two of the specified conditions in the agreement provided that VanWinkle would complete 150 hours of community service and \u201cshall pay a fine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to go to the community service program in the amount of $85.00. Said fine shall be paid through the Clerk of District Court and according to a schedule as set by his/her probation officer.\u201d The plea agreement further specified that VanWinkle \u201cshall receive credit against his fine for pre-trial incarceration.\u201d The District Court accepted VanWinkle\u2019s guilty plea, scheduled a sentencing hearing and ordered preparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI). The PSI concurred in the State\u2019s recommendation of a three-year deferred imposition of sentence, subject to conditions. The PSI also recommended specific conditions, including Condition No. 13 requiring that VanWinkle \u201cshall pay a fee of $85.00 to the Community Service Program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b64 At the sentencing hearing, VanWinkle objected to Condition No. 13 on the basis that the condition required payment of a \u201cfee,\u201d whereas the plea agreement provided for payment of the $85 to the community service program as a \u201cfine.\u201d VanWinkle also argued that the District Court was without statutory authority to impose the payment as a fee. The District Court overruled VanWinkle\u2019s objection, observing that the condition was one the judges in the Fourth Judicial District had agreed to institute as a local rule and was to be designated as a fee. The District Court subsequently entered its written judgment deferring imposition of VanWinkle\u2019s sentence for a three-year period with conditions, including that VanWinkle complete 150 hours of community service and Condition No. 13 that he \u201cshall pay a fee of $85.00 to the Community Service Program.\u201d VanWinkle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b65 VanWinkle challenges the legality of his sentence. We review the legality of a criminal sentence to determine whether the sentence is within applicable statutory parameters. <em>State v. Armstrong, </em>2006 MT 334, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 131, \u00b6 8, 151 P.3d 46, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence when it ordered VanWinkle to pay an $85 fee to the local community service program as a condition of his deferred imposition of sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\u00b67 VanWinkle challenges the District Court\u2019s imposition of Condition No. 13 as illegal because there is no statute authorizing sentencing courts to impose a fee for the support of local community service programs. In response, the State first raises the threshold argument that VanWinkle waived his right to challenge Condition No. 13 by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>explicitly and voluntarily agreeing to pay $85 to the community service program when he signed the plea agreement. The State contends VanWinkle should not be allowed to evade his agreement by challenging the condition as being denominated a fee, rather than a fine as specified in the agreement, because \u201cwhether the assessment is considered a fee or a fine does not \u2018affect the substantial rights of the defendant\u2019....\u201d VanWinkle replies that the distinction between a \u201cfine\u201d and a \u201cfee\u201d is not mere semantics, but has repercussions on a defendant obligated to make the payment. Thus, according to VanWinkle, he was not-and is not-barred from challenging the District Court\u2019s imposition of the condition as a fee. We agree with VanWinkle.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b68  Contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, denominating a monetary obligation imposed on a criminal defendant as a fee, rather than a fine, can \u201caffect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d For example, \u00a7 46-18-403(2), MCA, provides that any defendant against whom a fine is imposed upon conviction must be allowed credit against that fine for each day served in incarceration prior to the conviction. We have held that the term \u201cfine\u201d as used in this statute does not encompass fees, costs or other court-imposed monetary obligations. <em>Voerding v. State, </em>2006 MT 125, \u00b6 16, 332 Mont. 262, \u00b6 16, 136 P.3d 502, \u00b6 16. Thus, a defendant may only receive credit for pre-conviction incarceration against \u201cfines\u201d and not against \u201cfees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b69 Here, while the District Court expressly included in its written judgment that VanWinkle was entitled to $7,275 credit toward his fines as a result of 97 days of pre-conviction incarceration, the court deferred imposition of sentence and did not impose any fine. Had the District Court imposed the $85 fine to which the parties agreed in the plea agreement-and assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>such a fine would otherwise be legal-VanWinkle would not have been obligated to pay it. In light of these facts, we conclude VanWinkle\u2019s plea agreement with the State to pay a fine of $85 did not bar him from challenging the District Court\u2019s imposition of the condition as a fee. We turn, then, to the merits of VanWinkle\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b610 It is well-established that a district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence in a criminal case is defined and constrained by statute. <em>State v. Blackwell, </em>2001 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 306 MT 267, \u00b6 6, 32 P.3d 771, \u00b6 6. Thus, \u201c\u2018a district court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u2019\u201d <em>Blackwell, </em>\u00b6 6 (quoting <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029 (1993)). As stated above, VanWinkle contends that no statute authorizes the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Court to impose a fee for the support of a local community service program.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b611 We recently addressed the identical issue raised here in <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, 342 Mont. 60, 179 P.3d 502. In that case, Stephenson entered into a plea agreement with the State by which he agreed to plead guilty to one felony and two misdemeanor offenses in exchange for the State\u2019s agreement to recommend the district court impose an aggregate sentence of three years, all suspended on specified conditions. Stephenson further agreed to any additional probation conditions recommended in the PSI. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-3. One of the additional recommended conditions in the PSI was that Stephenson pay a fine of $85 to the local community service program. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 4. At the sentencing hearing, Stephenson objected to this condition on the basis that it was not included in the plea agreement. Notwithstanding Stephenson\u2019s objection, the district court imposed the condition and noted that, although the $85 payment was denominated a fine, it viewed the payment as in the nature of a surcharge fee. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Stephenson moved to withdraw his guilty plea, the district court denied the motion and Stephenson appealed. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b612  On appeal, we addressed the legality of the condition as both a \u201csurcharge fee\u201d and a \u201cfine.\u201d We observed that, although various Montana statutes authorize imposing specified fees and surcharges when sentencing a defendant, no statute \u201cauthorizes an assessment \u2018in the nature of [a] surcharge fee\u2019 to be paid to the community service program.\u201d <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 29. We further determined that, while \u00a7 46-18-231, MCA, authorizes a sentencing court to impose a fine on a defendant in either a felony or misdemeanor case, \u00a7 46-18-235, MCA, requires that money collected from the imposition of a fine must be paid to specified entities. No statute authorizes a district court to impose a fine and order the fine be paid to a local community service program. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 28. Consequently, we held that the condition requiring Stephenson to pay $85 to the local community service program, as either a surcharge fee or a fine, was illegal and must be stricken from the sentence. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 36. Similarly, in this case, no statute authorizes the District Court to require that VanWinkle pay $85 to the local community service program as either a fee or a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"AYF\">\u00b613 The State contends, however, that the District Court was authorized to impose the $85 assessment as \u201ca reasonable restriction or condition\u201d on VanWinkle\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(l)(f), MCA. Addressing the latter statute first, \u00a7 46-18-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>202(l)(f), MCA, provides that a sentencing judge may impose certain restrictions or conditions on a sentence \u201cthat the judge considers necessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society...\u201d including \u201cany other limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d We previously have upheld two types of sentencing conditions under this provision: conditions limiting a defendant\u2019s conduct and conditions requiring payment of restitution to a victim of the offense. <em>See State v. Krum, 2007 </em>MT 229, \u00b6 18, 339 Mont. 154, \u00b6 18, 168 P.3d 658, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b614 In <em>Krum, </em>we held that sentencing conditions which require a defendant to pay monetary assessments to local community entities are not \u201climitations\u201d on a defendant\u2019s conduct, but rather affirmative duties to make donations to those entities. Further, such assessments cannot be considered restitution when the money is being paid to community entities which are not victims of the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced. <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 20. Thus, the assessments were not authorized by the express language of \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA, and were illegal. <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 21. Similarly, here, Condition No. 13 requiring VanWinkle pay an $85 fee to the local community service program is not a \u201climitation\u201d on VanWinkle\u2019s conduct, but an affirmative obligation to pay money to a local entity. Nor can the condition be considered restitution, because the local community service program is not a victim of VanWinkle\u2019s burglary offense. Consequently, \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA, does not authorize imposition of Condition No. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"AUf\">\u00b615 Section 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA-the second statute upon which the State relies-provides th\u00e1t, when deferring imposition or suspending execution of all or a portion of a defendant\u2019s sentence, the sentencing court may impose on a defendant \u201cany reasonable restrictions or conditions ...\u201d including those \u201cconsidered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society....\u201d We recently held that, when imposing a sentencing condition pursuant to this provision, the condition must have \u201ca nexus to either the offense for which the offender is being sentenced, or to the offender himself or herself.\u201d <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6 15, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6 15. In other words, there must be factual support in the record, specific to the individual case before the sentencing court, which justifies imposition of the condition in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b616  Here, the record reflects that the District Court did not impose Condition No. 13 based on a nexus between the condition and either VanWinkle\u2019s offense or VanWinkle himself. In responding to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>VanWinkle\u2019s objection to Condition No. 13, the District Court stated that the condition was \u201cone of the local rules in the district that the judges all agreed to ... it\u2019s a uniform condition of all the four judges here.\u201d Nothing in \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, authorizes trial judges to simply agree-by local rule or otherwise-to impose a particular condition on all defendants being sentenced in their judicial district.</p>\n<p id=\"AjI-\">\u00b617 Finally, the State contends that Condition No. 13 is statutorily authorized as a legitimate cost. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b618  Section 25-10-201, MCA, enumerates various costs of litigation which a trial court may award the prevailing party in an action, including at subsection (9), \u201csuch other reasonable and necessary expenses as are taxable according to the course and practice of the court or by express provision of law.\u201d Moreover, \u00a7 46-18-232, MCA, provides that a sentencing court may require a convicted defendant to pay costs as defined in \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA. However, \u201c[s]uch costs shall be limited to expenses specifically incurred by the prosecution in connection with the proceedings against the defendant.\u201d Section 46-18-232(1), MCA. Here, the $85 to be paid in support of the local community service program was not a cost incurred by the State in prosecuting VanWinkle for the burglary offense. Consequently, Condition No. 13 is not authorized as a cost pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-232 and 25-10-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b619  We conclude that Condition No. 13-requiring VanWinkle to pay an $85 fee to the local community service program-is not statutorily authorized and, therefore, is illegal. As a result, we hold the District Court imposed an illegal sentence when it ordered VanWinkle to pay an $85 fee to the local community service program as a condition of his deferred imposition of sentence. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of Condition No. 13 and remand this case with instructions to the District Court to strike the condition from VanWinkle\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b620 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b205-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b205-8\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"A7j\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u00b621 I concur with the Court\u2019s Opinion, but write separately to acknowledge what I believe is a good point raised by the Dissent. Specifically, I agree with the Dissent that a fee may be assessed against a defendant to cover the costs of his participation in a rehabilitative program. Here, however, it does not appear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>District Court imposed the $85 fee in connection with the order that the defendant complete 150 hours of community service. The order to pay the fee is set forth as Condition 13, and it follows seriatim the assessment of other fees in the court\u2019s sentencing order. The directive to participate in community service is set forth later in the order at Condition 19. Moreover, as the Court notes, the District Court, upon VanWinkle\u2019s objection to Condition 13, said the condition was \u201cone of the local rules in the district that the judges all agreed to ... it\u2019s a uniform condition of all the four judges here.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. Based upon this affirmative representation, in combination with the disjunctive imposition of the fee and the order of community service, I must agree with the Court that the fee in this instance was of the nature imposed in <em>Stephenson, </em>and is for that reason unlawful. I therefore concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b206-4\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AfO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b622 On a daily basis, sentencing courts impose conditions which require defendants to participate in such programs as anger management counseling, sex offender treatment, mental health or chemical dependency evaluations, parenting classes, and to complete various community service tasks, in order to further their rehabilitation. Today the Court holds that, despite having broad discretion to impose such conditions, sentencing courts are powerless to require defendants to pay the fee which makes their participation in such programs possible. In my opinion this decision not only lacks common sense, but is an absurd rendering of the sentencing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"Auh\">\u00b623 I agree that \u201c[njothing in \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, authorizes trial judges to simply agree-by local rule or otherwise-to impose a particular condition on all defendants being sentenced in their judicial district[,j\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16, and that a sentencing court is prohibited from instituting a uniform sentencing scheme that fails to meet the <em>Ashby </em>nexus requirement as applied to each individual defendant. However, these general principles ignore the fact that, as applied to VanWinkle, Condition 13 is a related condition aimed at recouping rehabilitation costs for VanWinkle\u2019s own rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b624 Pursuant to the plea agreement, VanWinkle agreed to \u201ccomplete 150 hours of community service\u201d and to \u201cpay a fine to go to the community service program in the amount of $85.00.\u201d The District Court subsequently imposed payment of the $85 \u201cfine\u201d as a \u201cfee.\u201d Accordingly, the Court likens this case to our decisions in <em>Krum </em>and <em>Stephenson. </em>However, neither case requires the broad rule which the Court imposes today.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u00b625 In <em>Krum, </em>the defendant was required to pay large sums of money to local non-profit organizations such as Big Brothers and Sisters. <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 8. We concluded that the assessments constituted \u201caffirmative duties to make donations to community entities\u201d and were illegal sentencing conditions pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA. <em>Krum, </em>\u00b6 20. In <em>Stephenson </em>we determined that the same $85 fee at issue here was impermissible because the court lacked statutory authority to impose it as a condition of sentencing. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 33. Because the instant case involves the same $85 fee as in <em>Stephenson </em>the Court concludes that the issues are \u201cidentical.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 11. However, they are not. We did not consider in either <em>Krum </em>or <em>Stephenson </em>a sentence requiring payment of a program fee by a defendant who participates in the program as part of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b626 Here, as a participant in the community service program, VanWinkle was ordered to pay an $85 fee <em>to that program. </em>Unlike our decisions in <em>Krum </em>and <em>Stephenson, </em>the fee at issue here is neither a random charity payment nor a standard sentencing assessment imposed to raise money for a court program. Rather, this fee was assessed to cover the costs of VanWinkle\u2019s own participation in a rehabilitative program. Sentencing courts are authorized, pursuant to statute, to impose reasonable conditions, including a wide array of rehabilitative programs, and I believe the only reasonable interpretation of that same statutory authority allows a court to impose a requirement for payment of the very fees necessary for defendants to attend the programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b627 While the Court is rightly worried about blanket sentencing conditions, that is not the issue here. Unfortunately, this holding will undermine legitimate sentencing authority and interfere with the rehabilitative efforts which courts are making in thousands of cases. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
