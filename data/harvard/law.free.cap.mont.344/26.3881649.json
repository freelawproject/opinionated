We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">\u00b62 Between June 1,2005, and March 17,2006, a number of Flathead County residents reported that their carved bears had been stolen. According to one of the victims, he purchased his carving approximately 15 to 20 years earlier from an Idaho chainsaw carver. He stated that it cost $350 at that time and would cost a minimum of $600 to replace now. Another victim valued his stolen bear at $250. All in all, the aggregate value of the stolen property was estimated at $3,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b63 On February 27, 2006, the Kalispell Police Department received several tips that Lessard and his wife had been bragging about going \u201cbear hunting\u201d and that they were the perpetrators of this 10-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>crime spree. The police executed a search of Lessard\u2019s residence, where they found a number of the stolen bears. Some of the bears, however, had already been sold at garage sales. Lessard claimed that he had no knowledge the carvings had been stolen and that he was \u201cunknowingly in possession of stolen property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b64 The State charged Lessard by information on March 20, 2006, with theft (common scheme), a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA. Lessard initially pleaded not guilty; however, the parties ultimately entered into a plea agreement under \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, wherein Lessard agreed to plead guilty to the charge and the State, in return, agreed to recommend that the court defer imposition of sentence for a period of three years. Thereafter, Lessard entered a plea of no contest, which the District Court accepted on December 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b65 A probation/parole officer with the Department of Corrections conducted a presentence investigation and filed a report (\u201cPSI\u201d) on January 22, 2007. <em>Among </em>other things, the PSI recited Lessard\u2019s background, his criminal history, and the circumstances of the offense. According to the PSI, Lessard was 24 years old and presently unemployed. He had a prior conviction for felony residential burglary in Pierce County, Washington, which occurred in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b66 Lessard reported that he first tried alcohol at age 18 and rarely drinks. On the matter of illegal drugs, the probation/parole officer noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">The Defendant indicated he tried marijuana on only one occasion, when he was nineteen years old. It should be noted a glass marijuana pipe was discovered in the master bedroom of the Defendant\u2019s home when law enforcement conducted the search pursuant to this crime. He eventually admitted to law enforcement that he owned the pipe and had last smoked marijuana two days prior to the search conducted on March 13, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">In addition, as a result of the 2003 conviction in Pierce County, Washington, Lessard was ordered to complete drug and alcohol treatment \u201cat the discretion\u201d of his supervising officer, but the records were unclear as to whether the supervising officer ever ordered Lessard to do so, and Lessard claimed that he had never received any chemical-dependency counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u00b6 7 The probation/parole officer recommended a number of conditions of probation in the PSI. At issue on this appeal are the following three recommended conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">* \u201cThe Defendant shall not possess or consume intoxicants/alcohol, nor will he enter any place intoxicants are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>chief item of sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\">* \u201cHe will submit to Breathalyzer testing or bodily fluid testing for drugs or alcohol as requested by his Probation &amp; Parole Officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">* \u201cThe Defendant will not enter any casinos or play any games of chance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b68 At the January 26, 2007 sentencing hearing, Lessard indicated that he had received a copy of the PSI, had reviewed it, and did not have any corrections to make to it. However, he objected to the three recommended conditions quoted above on the ground that there was no nexus between these conditions and the underlying offense for which he was being sentenced. In addition, he pointed out that the PSI \u201cindicates that [he] rarely drinks, he does not have any sort of alcohol problem, in addition to which there is no indication that this offense involved any sort of alcohol.\u201d In response, the prosecutor argued \u201cthere is a nexus in this case that when outstanding restitution is being owed that gambling and the purchase of alcohol should be prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b69 The District Court overruled Lessard\u2019s objection. The court stated that it would defer imposition of sentence for a period of three years, subject to the conditions recommended in the PSI, including the three challenged conditions. In addition, the court ordered Lessard to pay restitution. After the court imposed the sentence, and while still on the record, the prosecutor asked Lessard whether he drinks, to which Lessard responded: \u201cI have a beer about once every two months.\u201d In addition, the prosecutor asked Lessard whether he gambles, to which Lessard responded: \u201cFive dollars once every two, three weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b610 The court\u2019s written judgment, entered April 4, 2007, recited the three-year deferred imposition of sentence, which was made subject to a number of conditions, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">9) He may not consume or possess intoxicants, nor may he frequent bars or other businesses where alcohol is the chief item of sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">10) He must submit to drug and alcohol testing (breath or bodily fluid testing) on a regular or random basis as required by his supervising officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">20) He may not gamble or frequent casinos.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">\u00b611 This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">\u00b612 The sole issue on appeal is whether Conditions 9, 10, and 20 are illegal or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b613 We review challenges to sentencing conditions under a two-prong standard. First, we review the challenged condition for legality. <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6 9. A sentencing condition is illegal if the sentencing court lacked statutory authority to impose it, if the condition falls outside the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, or if the court did not adhere to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Brotherton, </em>2008 MT 119, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 511, \u00b6 10, 182 P.3d 88, \u00b6 10; <em>see also State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 60, \u00b6 15, 179 P.3d 502, \u00b6 15. This determination is a question of law and, as such, our review of the condition\u2019s legality is de novo. <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 10. Second, we review the reasonableness of the challenged condition for an abuse of discretion (unless the condition is mandated by statute, in which case there is no exercise of discretion by the sentencing court). <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 10. A sentencing court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b614 A sentencing court\u2019s authority to impose a criminal sentence derives from the law; it is not inherent. <em>See State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 41, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 41; <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029 (1993). Therefore, a sentencing condition is legal only if it is authorized by applicable sentencing statutes. <em>See Brotherton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b615 The conditions at issue here are not explicitly mandated by law in the Montana Code; thus, the statutory authority for the conditions would be \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4) and -202(1)(f), MCA (2005). The former authorizes a sentencing judge, when deferring imposition of sentence or suspending all or a portion of execution of sentence, to impose upon the offender \u201cany reasonable restrictions or conditions.\u201d Section 46-18-201(4), MCA. \u201cReasonable restrictions or conditions\u201d include those enumerated in \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(a)-(m), MCA (2005), <em>as amended at </em>\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(a)-(n), MCA (2007), as well as those which the judge considers \u201cnecessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society,\u201d \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(n), MCA (2005), <em>recodified at </em>\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA (2007). Similarly, \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, authorizes a sentencing judge to impose on a sentence any limitation \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AkL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u00b616 In <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, 293 Mont. 133, 974 P.2d 620, we held that in order to be \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society,\u201d a sentencing limitation or condition must have \u201csome correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11. We recently expanded this test in <em>Ashby. </em>Specifically, we held that a sentencing judge may impose a particular condition of probation pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4) and - 202(1)(f), MCA, if the condition has a nexus either to the offense for which the offender is being sentenced or to the offender himself or herself. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>see also Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b617  Our <em>Ashby </em>test allows a sentencing court discretion to craft conditions of sentence appropriate to the management of probationers generally, but also requires the court to individualize its exercise of discretion so as to impose conditions that have some correlation or connection to the underlying offense or to the unique background and characteristics of the individual offender. However, with respect to offender-related conditions, we cautioned in <em>Ashby </em>that courts may impose such conditions only where the history or pattern of conduct to be restricted (e.g., alcohol or drug abuse) is \u201crecent, and significant or chronic. A passing, isolated, or stale instance of behavior or conduct will be insufficient to support a restrictive probation condition imposed in the name of offender rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b618 In the case at hand, therefore, we must consider whether each of Conditions 9,10, and 20 has a nexus either to Lessard\u2019s offense of theft or to his unique background and characteristics. We will address each condition in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Condition 9</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b619 Under Condition 9, Lessard \u201cmay not consume or possess intoxicants, nor may he frequent bars or other businesses where alcohol is the chief item of sale.\u201d Lessard contends that this condition is illegal and must be stricken. He points out that there is no evidence in the record that alcohol or intoxicants were connected in any way to his offense. More specifically, he asserts that he did not commit the crime while under the influence of alcohol or in an effort to procure alcohol. Furthermore, he points out that there is no indication in the PSI that he has a history of alcohol abuse. In short, Lessard contends that neither the PSI nor the District Court\u2019s judgment recites any facts which would support a restriction on the use of intoxicants/alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"AUTe\">\u00b620 Much of the State\u2019s argument in response is directed at persuading this Court to modify the <em>Ommundson </em>test so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>sentencing courts may look beyond the circumstances of the particular crime and consider \u201cthe individual defendant\u2019s history and his or her \u2018characteristics, circumstances, needs, and potentialities.\u2019 \u201d This argument was addressed and resolved-largely in favor of the State\u2019s position-in our <em>Ashby </em>decision. (The State\u2019s brief in this case was filed before <em>Ashby </em>was handed down.) There is no reason to address the argument again in this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b621 With respect to Condition 9, the State does not contend that a nexus exists between the intoxicants restriction and Lessard\u2019s stealing the carved bears. Indeed, as Lessard points out, there is no evidence in the record that this offense involved or was related to alcohol use. Instead, the State makes several arguments related to criminal defendants generally and to Lessard specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b622 As for the former, the State offers a number of generalizations about the evils of alcohol-e.g., alcohol reduces inhibitions and impairs judgment. The State asserts that \u201cthe connection between alcohol use and crime and recidivism is established\u201d and that \u201cthe risk of recidivism is compounded when felony offenders are allowed to drink alcohol.\u201d As an example of this, the State informs us that the defendant/probationer in <em>State v. Jones, </em>2006 MT 209, 333 Mont. 294, 142 P.3d 851, was drinking in a bar before he killed Gisela Morris (a fact not stated in the <em>Jones </em>opinion). The State also reports that 93.1 percent of 654 offenders committed to Montana prelease centers had \u201ca condition of substance abuse or chemical dependency disorder either at admission or discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b623 Such broad generalizations and predictions based on statistics, however, are entirely inconsistent with the <em>individualized </em>sentencing that the State advocates and that <em>Ashby </em>requires. Moreover, we have rejected similar arguments offered by the State in a number of prior cases. For instance, the State asserted in <em>Brotherton </em>that \u201c[ajlcohol lowers inhibitions and the ability to think rationally and that \u201c[p]eople often mix alcohol with drugs.\u201d <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 21. Addressing these assertions, we stated that \u201c[s]ueh generalizations ... are wholly insufficient to show that [the no-alcohol condition at issue] has a nexus to Brotherton\u2019s offense or his unique background and characteristics. Indeed, if these general propositions were sufficient to sustain a no-alcohol condition, then such a condition would be justified in every <em>case.\u201d Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 21. Likewise, in <em>State v. Greeson, </em>2007 MT 23, 336 Mont. 1, 152 P.3d 695, the State appeared to rely on the prosecutor\u2019s contention during Greeson\u2019s sentencing that alcohol consumption reduces judgment and could contribute to Greeson\u2019s willingness to commit future similar crimes (her conviction was for identity theft). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Greeson, </em>\u00b6 14. We concluded that the State\u2019s position was \u201ctotally without merit\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">[I]t may well be that alcohol consumption reduces judgment and could thus relate to any person\u2019s \u201cwillingness\u201d to commit a crime, although a prosecutor\u2019s unsupported commentary on such matters is not evidence of any kind. Such general commentary is wholly inadequate, however, to establish a nexus between Greeson and the offense of which she was convicted or to establish that the alcohol and testing condition at issue here would in any real way promote Greeson\u2019s rehabilitation or protect society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>Greeson, </em>\u00b6 15; see <em>also State v. Armstrong, </em>2006 MT 334, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 335 Mont. 131, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 151 P.3d 46, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; <em>State v. Holt, </em>2006 MT 151, \u00b6 51, 332 Mont. 426, \u00b6 51, 139 P.3d 819, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b624 Turning, then, to Lessard\u2019s individual characteristics, the State notes that Lessard admitted at the sentencing hearing to having a beer \u201cabout once every two months.\u201d However, evidence of such alcohol use clearly fails to establish a \u201crecent, and significant or chronic\u201d history or pattern of alcohol abuse. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b625 Alternatively, the State offers a highly critical view of Lessard\u2019s character. In particular, the State asserts that Lessard \u201cis a recidivist manipulator whose word cannot be trusted.\u201d The State contends that Lessard \u201cminimizes his criminal behavior and problems\u201d and has the \u201cpotentiality\u201d for \u201cavoiding accountability and abusing substances.\u201d Thus, the State urges, Lessard\u2019s claim that he rarely drinks alcohol \u201chas to be met with skepticism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b626 Setting aside the fact that the District Court made no such finding concerning Lessard\u2019s credibility, the State\u2019s commentary on Lessard\u2019s character is not evidence of any kind. <em>Cf. Greeson, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 15. More to the point, none of the State\u2019s conclusory assertions establishes a nexus between Condition 9 and Lessard\u2019s background and characteristics. It seems that the State would have us deduce, based on the State\u2019s critical assessment of Lessard\u2019s character, that Lessard lied to the District Court and to the author of the PSI about how often he consumes alcoholic beverages and that he actually has a recent, and significant or chronic history of alcohol abuse that justifies the no-alcohol condition on his sentence. We refuse to engage in such speculation. We emphasize that conjecture of this nature cannot supplant the required showing that the condition at issue has a nexus either to the offense for which the offender is being sentenced or to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>offender himself or herself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b627  Based on the record before us, we hold that Condition 9 is not reasonably related to Lessard\u2019s offense of theft, is not necessary to ameliorate a problem with alcohol, and is not more likely to protect society from further bouts of stealing carved bears. <em>See Ashby, </em>\u00b6 19. Accordingly, Condition 9 is illegal and must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Condition 10</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b628 Under Condition 10, Lessard \u201cmust submit to drug and alcohol testing (breath or bodily fluid testing) on a regular or random basis as required by his supervising officer.\u201d Given our holding under Condition 9, the alcohol testing contemplated by Condition 10 must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">\u00b629 As for the drug-testing requirement, Lessard\u2019s argument here is essentially the same as his argument under Condition 9-namely, that neither the PSI nor the District Court\u2019s judgment recites any facts which would support a requirement of continuous drug testing. He states that there is no indication in the PSI of a history of drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"AqK\">\u00b630 In response, the State points out that Lessard indicated to the probation/parole officer that he had tried marijuana on only one occasion (when he was 19 years old), yet the police found a glass marijuana pipe in the master bedroom of Lessard\u2019s home when they searched it and he eventually admitted to law enforcement that he owned the pipe and had last smoked marijuana two days prior to the search (i.e., on March 11, 2006). The State contends, therefore, that Lessard is \u201can abuser of illegal drugs.\u201d Finally, the State argues more generally that drug-testing requirements enable probation officers to monitor probationers\u2019 compliance with probation conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b631 While there is no evidence in the record establishing a nexus between the drug-testing condition and Lessard\u2019s offense of stealing the carved bears, we conclude that there is a sufficient connection between this condition and Lessard\u2019s background and characteristics. As just noted, the police found a glass marijuana pipe in the master bedroom of Lessard\u2019s home, and he admitted both that he owned the pipe and that he had smoked marijuana just two days earlier. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Ownership of a glass marijuana pipe is suggestive (though by no means conclusive) of nonsporadic marijuana use. Moreover, Lessard was untruthful when he told the probation/parole officer that he had tried marijuana on only one occasion five years earlier. This fact further supports the conclusion that the extent of his drug use was more significant than he let on.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b632  We hold that there is sufficient evidence in the record of recent and significant drug use to justify the drug-testing requirement in Condition 10. Because this requirement has a sufficient nexus to Lessard\u2019s background and characteristics, it is not illegal. Furthermore, given the circumstances discussed above, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Condition 20</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b633 Under Condition 20, Lessard \u201cmay not gamble or frequent casinos.\u201d Lessard contends that this condition is illegal and must be stricken because there is no evidence in the record that gambling had anything to do with his offense. In response, the State points out that Lessard estimated during the sentencing hearing that he gambles \u201c[f]ive dollars once every two, three weeks.\u201d In addition, the State argues that the case at hand is analogous to <em>State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, 322 Mont. 294, 95 P.3d 717, in which we affirmed gambling restrictions based on the nature of Kroll\u2019s offense (issuing bad checks), his evident \u201clure to easy money-making schemes,\u201d the fact that he had been charged with issuing or negotiating a bad check on multiple prior occasions, and the fact that he owed in excess of $13,000 in restitution and held no job. <em>See Kroll, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31. The State characterizes Lessard as someone who \u201cwants something for nothing\u201d and \u201cdoes not care who he hurts to get it.\u201d The State also points out that Lessard owes two of his victims $850 but has \u201climited means\u201d with which to pay this (according to the PSI, he was unemployed and his only income was $623 per month in Social Security Disability Insurance benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b634 We cannot agree that these assertions establish a nexus between Condition 20 and either Lessard\u2019s offense of stealing carved bears or his individual background and characteristics. Aside from Lessard\u2019s statement that he gambles \u201c[f]ive dollars once every two, three weeks,\u201d there is nothing in the record even suggesting that he has a history of gambling, that he stole the carved bears as part of an \u201ceasy moneymaking scheme,\u201d or that he has failed in the past to fulfill financial obligations. Lessard\u2019s \u201climited means\u201d and his statement about gambling \u201c[f]ive dollars once every two, three weeks\u201d are not sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>to establish a recent, and significant or chronic gambling or money-management problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b635 The State suggests that Condition 20 facilitates the State\u2019s effort to ensure timely payment of restitution. Yet, while a restitution obligation is indeed a component of an offender\u2019s rehabilitation, <em>see Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 11, the Legislature has provided a separate mechanism for ensuring that the restitution is paid, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-18-244 to -249, MCA. The mere existence of a restitution obligation \u2014 without any evidence in the record that the offender has a history of gambling or financial irresponsibility-is insufficient to justify a gambling condition on the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b636  We conclude that Condition 20 is not reasonably related to Lessard\u2019s offense of theft, is not necessary to ameliorate a problem with gambling, and is not likely to protect society from further bouts of stealing carved bears. Accordingly, Condition 20 is illegal and must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b637 We conclude that the alcohol and gambling conditions were too much, that no conditions would be too little, and that the drug-testing condition was just right. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of Conditions 9 and 20. In addition, we reverse Condition 10\u2019s alcohol-testing requirement, but we affirm Condition 10\u2019s drug-testing requirement. We remand this matter to the District Court with instructions to strike the illegal conditions from Lessard\u2019s sentence. \u00b638 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-13\"> Remarkably, this sort of thing goes on in other parts of the country. In western Missouri, on March 30, 2008, some \u201clousy thieves\u201d stole Big Bertha, the 6-foot, 500-pound carved wooden bear that stood in front of Bill Struewe\u2019s sewer and plumbing business. <em>See </em>Toriano L. Porter, <em>Who stole Bertha? </em>The Examiner (Independence, Mo.) (Apr. 2, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> In this regard, the State points out in its recitation of the factual background of this case that Lessard\u2019s father was sentenced to seven years in prison for raping a ten-year-old boy and that his mother went to prison for fifteen years for withholding evidence in a murder investigation. (Lessard reported this information to the probation/parole officer, who noted it in the PSI.) We are at a complete loss to understand what bearing these matters have on this appeal and the probation conditions at issue. Indeed, we reject any suggestion that the conditions of Lessard\u2019s probation may be based on the criminal convictions of his parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b60-9\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AYI\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">\u00b639 I agree with the result of the Court\u2019s opinion. In this case the record is insufficient to sustain Conditions 9 and 20 of Lessard\u2019s deferred sentence. However, this is not to say that a probation restriction on possessing or ingesting alcohol cannot be justified when the offender has a proven history of abuse of a different intoxicant, such as methamphetamine or marijuana. <em>See State v. Winkel, </em>2008 MT 89, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, 342 Mont. 267, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, 182 P.3d 54, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">\u00b640 With this proviso, I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
