We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated J.D.\u2019s parental rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u00b64 Flathead County Child Protective Services initially received referrals of concern regarding J.D. in 1994. Eight separate referrals alleged physical abuse of J.D. by her step-father and physical neglect of J.D.\u2019s first child by J.D. The Department removed J.D.\u2019s first child, E.D., from her care in 1996. J.D. was seventeen years old at the time, pregnant with her second child, and addicted to drugs. The Department removed her children again due to drug use when E.D. was eighteen months old and her second child, N.T., was nine months old. J.D. attended inpatient treatment at the Montana Chemical Dependency Center, completed parenting classes and counseling sessions, and engaged in random urinalysis in order to regain custody of her children. J.D. and her two children reunified and she remained sober for approximately two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u00b65 J.D. resumed drug use again at age 22. J.D. had a third son, M.S., who was twelve months old at this time. The Department removed all three of J.D.\u2019s children in January of 2005. All three children had seen their mother use drugs. They also had witnessed physical violence between their mother and her boyfriend. The two oldest children had witnessed sexual behavior occurring between their mother and her boyfriend. J.D.\u2019s oldest child stated that J.D. sometimes would not feed the children at night and would make them stay in a separate room while she and her boyfriend used drugs. J.D. admitted at this time to using marijuana and methamphetamine. She also agreed that her children met the definition of youths in need of care. The District Court adjudicated all three children as youths in need of care in May of 2005, and the Department received temporary legal custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u00b66 The Department created a treatment plan to help J.D. reunify with her children. The treatment plan set forth six separate areas with goals and requirements. The plan required J.D. to remain free from alcohol and drugs and to submit to a drug testing program. The plan required J.D. to provide documentation verified by a doctor for any prescribed medications. J.D. also had to secure and maintain housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>appropriate for herself and her children under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing regarding the treatment plan on April 21, 2006. J.D. attended the hearing. The court approved the plan in an order issued on May 22, 2006. The Department received three extensions of temporary legal custody over the children. The Department ultimately petitioned the District Court to terminate J.D.\u2019s parental rights on November 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b68 The District Court held a hearing on the Department\u2019s petition to terminate J.D.\u2019s parental rights. The court heard testimony from seven social workers who testified on behalf of the Department. J.D. also testified at the hearing. She admitted that she had made mistakes in the past concerning her children and her choices as a parent. She attributed her initial failure to comply with the treatment plan to her various medical conditions. She asserted that these medical problems had left her in pain and \u201cstuck in a fetal position,\u201d and had rendered her -unable to comply with the plan\u2019s urinalysis testing requirements. J.D. insisted that she had made significant improvements and recently had complied with her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b69 The termination hearing ran for two days and ended on July 24, 2007. The District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Terminating Parental Rights and Approving Permanency Plan, on December 26, 2007. The court issued one hundred and eighty-nine findings of fact in its order terminating J.D.\u2019s parental rights. The court detailed J.D.\u2019s family history and drug use history, J.D.\u2019s attempted compliance with the treatment plan, her visitation with her children, the abuse and neglect of the children, and the subsequent impact upon the children . The court\u2019s findings of fact also addressed J.D.\u2019s history of involvement with the Department, the services and efforts put forth by the Department in the present matter, J.D.\u2019s potential for change, and the physical and emotional needs of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b610 The District Court found that J.D. had not complied with the treatment plan\u2019s requirement that she participate in a urinalysis testing program and remain drug free. The court found that J.D. had failed five times to report for urinalysis in June of 2006. J.D. failed to test and did not report during August of2006. These failures triggered the Department\u2019s removal of J.D. from the urinalysis testing program. The court determined that J.D. had attempted to comply with a testing program only \u201cwhen the Termination Hearing was looming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u00b611 The court found that J.D. consistently had tested positive for drugs. J.D. had valid prescriptions for some of the drugs present in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>system during urinalysis testing. J.D. also had tested positive, however, for a number of drugs for which she did not have a prescription. Authorities had arrested J.D. for drug possession on July 28, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b612 The District Court determined that J.D. had failed to comply with the treatment plan\u2019s requirement that she maintain appropriate housing during the majority of her time under the plan. J.D. had lost her housing in May of 2006 due to nonpayment of rent. J.D. failed to maintain appropriate housing for twelve of the fourteen months from the beginning of her treatment plan until the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"A71\">\u00b613 Finally, the District Court determined that J.D. likely would not change her conduct. The court cited the pattern of J.D.\u2019s drug use and poor choices that the witnesses had revealed at the termination hearing. The court noted that J.D. had revealed that she had acquired the appropriate housing and urinalysis testing \u201cspecifically in preparation for the Termination Hearing-not for the benefit of her children.\u201d The court noted that the removal of her children did not stop J.D. from resuming her drug use and poor associations during those periods when she had regained physical custody of the children. The court found that J.D. knowingly had resumed abusive relationships that had endangered both J.D. and her children. The court described the lives of J.D.\u2019s children as consisting of \u201can emotional rollercoaster from the day they were born.\u201d The court determined that J.D.\u2019s children had begun to \u201cact out behaviorally\u201d as a result of the abuse and neglect that they had suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b614 The District Court determined that J.D. had not complied with an appropriate treatment plan and that her conduct likely would not change \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time, if ever.\u201d The court concluded that terminating J.D.\u2019s parental rights would serve the best interests of the children. The court ordered J.D.\u2019s parental rights terminated with respect to all three children. J.D. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate a parent\u2019s rights for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re M.P., </em>2008 MT 39, \u00b6 16, 341 Mont. 333, \u00b6 16, 177 P.3d 495, \u00b6 16. A district court abuses its discretion if it \u201cacts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to perform a substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re M.P., </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u00b616 A district court must address adequately each applicable statutory requirement before terminating a parent\u2019s rights. <em>In re D.B., </em>2007 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>246, \u00b6 17, 339 Mont. 240, \u00b6 17, 168 P.3d 691, \u00b6 17. The district court must make specific factual findings to address the statutory requirements. <em>In re D.B., </em>\u00b6 18. We review these findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re </em>D.B., \u00b6 18. We will consider a district court\u2019s finding of fact clearly erroneous if the finding is unsupported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if the finding leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re S.T., </em>2008 MT 19, \u00b6 8, 341 Mont. 176, \u00b6 8, 176 P.3d 1054, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated J.D.\u2019s parental rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b618 J.D. argues that the District Court terminated her rights as a parent in violation of the statutes controlling the termination of a parent-child relationship. J.D. asserts that the Department failed to modify properly the treatment plan to accommodate her special medical needs. J.D. further asserts that the court cited events that had occurred before the court had approved of the treatment plan in May of 2006 as proof that J.D. had not complied with the treatment plan. The State counters that it had no obligation to alter the treatment plan for the unsubstantiated medical needs asserted by J.D. The State argues that the court properly determined that J.D. had failed to comply with the treatment plan and that the court cited past events only to demonstrate the improbability that J.D.\u2019s conduct would change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b619  A parent\u2019s right to maintain the care and custody of a child constitutes a fundamental liberty interest that fundamentally fair procedures must protect. <em>In re D.B., </em>\u00b6 17. Section 41-3-609, MCA, sets forth the criteria governing a court\u2019s authority to terminate a parent-child legal relationship. Section 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA, authorizes a court to terminate a parent-child relationship if the child qualifies as a youth in need of care and (1) the parent has failed to comply with an appropriate treatment plan, and (2) the condition or conduct rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b620  This Court recently confirmed that no single, generalized definition exists of an appropriate treatment plan. <em>In re </em>D.B., \u00b6 32. We consider a number of factors in determining whether the Department has provided an appropriate treatment plan, including whether the plan accounts for the particular problems facing both the parent and the child. <em>In re D.B., </em>\u00b6 32 (citation omitted). The State bears the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>burden of developing an appropriate treatment plan and must prove the appropriateness of a plan by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re D.B., </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b621 J.D. asserted at the hearing that her medical problems caused her to test positive for drugs during urinalysis and to miss testing sessions due to her condition. The State presented testimony and affidavits that verified that J.D.\u2019s treatment plan accounted for the potential use of prescription medications and authorized J.D. to miss urinalysis appointments for verifiable reasons. The plan required documentation for prescribed medications. The court determined, however, that J.D. had tested positive for a number of drugs for which she did not have a prescription or otherwise verifiable documentation. The court also determined that J.D. had failed to validate or excuse many of her missed urinalysis appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b622 J.D.\u2019s conduct also belied her claim that her medical conditions rendered the treatment plan inappropriate for her medical needs. J.D. had claimed that she had remained \u201cstuck in a fetal position\u201d due to pains from her medical condition. She asserted that her condition prevented her from making her appointments for urinalysis testing. The court noted that J.D. had provided only one doctor\u2019s note. The doctor had placed J.D. on a bed rest restriction for a finite period. The court also noted that authorities had arrested J.D. outside her home for possession of drugs during the time period covered by the bed rest restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b623 The court also questioned J.D.\u2019s allegations concerning the symptoms of her medical condition in light of her later conduct during a period when she had a verifiable illness. The court noted that J.D. had been able to comply with the urinalysis protocol, \u201cwhen the Termination Hearing was looming,\u201d after she had contracted a legitimate illness in 2007. The District Court\u2019s extensive findings of fact and the testimony at the hearing support the court\u2019s conclusion that the Department\u2019s treatment plan in this case represented an appropriate plan for J.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b624 J.D. claims that she did not receive a copy of the treatment plan until July of 2006. She contends that the court could gauge her compliance with the treatment plan only from events that took place after July of 2006. The District Court held a hearing for the approval of a treatment plan for J.D on April 21, 2006. J.D. attended the hearing. J.D. agreed to the proposed treatment plan at the hearing, and the District Court approved the plan in May of2006. J.D. testified at the termination hearing that she had understood throughout her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>case that her treatment plan addressed her drag use, housing, and parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b625 Section 41-3-609(1)(f)(i), MCA, required the District Court to consider J.D.\u2019s compliance with the treatment plan. The court addressed J.D.\u2019s compliance with the treatment plan at length. The court\u2019s discussion of J.D.\u2019s compliance cited some events that had taken place before the court had approved of J.D.\u2019s treatment plan. These events had no relevance to J.D.\u2019s compliance with the plan. The court documented numerous instances that took place after the court\u2019s approval of the treatment plan, however, where J.D. had failed to comply with the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b626 The court noted, for example, that J.D. had failed to comply with the treatment plan\u2019s requirements that she participate in a urinalysis testing program, that she remain drag free, and that she provide the Department with documentation of any prescribed medications. J.D. regularly had failed to report to the testing provider and often would decline to appear for testing due to alleged illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b627 Notwithstanding her alleged bed rest restrictions, J.D. had failed to report for urinalysis testing five times in June of2006, and made no calls during August of 2006. J.D. had tested positive consistently during 2006 for marijuana. She also had tested positive for benzodiazepines and morphine. J.D. could provide no valid prescriptions or medical records authorizing her use of these drugs. The court also noted J.D.\u2019s arrest in July of 2006 for drug possession.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Mf\">\u00b628 The District Court further determined that J.D. had failed to maintain housing appropriate for her children as required by the treatment plan. J.D. had lost her housing in May of 2006 due to nonpayment of rent. The court determined that J.D. had failed to maintain appropriate housing for twelve of the fourteen months from the beginning of her treatment plan until the termination hearing. The District Court determined that J.D. had failed to comply with her treatment plan in light of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b629 The District Court also had to address whether the conduct that had rendered J.D. unfit as a parent likely would remain unchanged. Section 41-3-609(1)(f)(ii), MCA. The statute requires the court to consider, among other factors, the parent\u2019s emotional illnesses, history of violent behavior, and excessive use of a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA. The District Court determined that J.D. likely would not change the conduct that had rendered her unfit as a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u00b630 The District Court based its determination on J.D.\u2019s pattern of drug use and poor choices revealed at the termination hearing. J.D. became addicted to drugs at the age of seventeen. The Department removed J.D.\u2019s children from her care on three different occasions. The Department\u2019s removals mirrored J.D.\u2019s periods of sobriety and relapse. The removal of her children did not prompt J.D. to refrain from her drug use and poor associations during those periods when she had regained physical custody of the children. J.D. had a history of knowingly resuming abusive relationships that endangered both J.D. and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b631  J.D. failed to secure appropriate housing for her children from May of2006 until two months before the termination hearing. She had failed to arrange for urinalysis testing until six weeks before the termination hearing. The court found that J.D. had admitted that she had acquired the appropriate housing and urinalysis testing \u201cspecifically in preparation for the Termination Hearing-not for the benefit of her children.\u201d Substantial evidence supported the court\u2019s finding that J.D.\u2019s conduct likely would not change. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it terminated J.D.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
