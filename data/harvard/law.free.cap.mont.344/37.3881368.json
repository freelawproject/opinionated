Halley (Halley) appeals the Fourth Judicial District Court\u2019s denial of his Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Halley\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction Relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">\u00b64 During a contentious divorce proceeding, Halleys actions resulted in his arrest on eleven separate criminal charges, including five counts of felony intimidation, two counts of felony stalking, one count of misdemeanor stalking, one count of misdemeanor violation of privacy in communications, one count of misdemeanor unlawful restraint and one count of felony tampering with witnesses. On January 21, 2004, several days after his arrest, a public defender was assigned to his case and arraignment was scheduled for February 10, 2004. The arraignment was subsequently continued at Halley\u2019s request to March 9, 2004. Despite having assigned counsel, Halley filed several pro se motions between February 12 and February 20. The District Court issued two orders instructing that Halleys motions be returned \u201cunfiled\u201d on the ground that he was represented by counsel. Subsequently, Halleys hearing was continued until March 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">\u00b65 Between January 21 and March 17 Halleys attorney claims to have spent 3.3 hours on his case. She spent another hour on March 18 when she represented him in front of a special master at his arraignment and bond reduction hearing during which Halley pled not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>guilty to all counts and requested bail reduction and release on his own recognizance. Both requests were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b66 On March 25, 2004, Halley sent a letter to Judge Larson, the presiding District Court judge, requesting another bail reduction hearing and claiming ineffective assistance of appointed counsel. He asked the court to appoint a pro bono attorney from outside the public defender\u2019s office because his public defender would \u201cnot communicate\u201d with him nor would she conduct his defense as he requested. He explained that he believed his rights to effective assistance of counsel, due process of law and reasonable bail were being violated and that he was being dealt \u201ca great injustice\u201d as a result of ineffective counsel. This letter is not recorded in the court\u2019s docket nor is there any record of a court response to Halley\u2019s letter. Also on March 25, Halley wrote a letter to Judge McLean, another Fourth Judicial District Court judge, complaining of ineffective assistance of counsel and asking for assistance in resolving his situation. Judge McLean acknowledged receipt of the letter and explained that he lacked jurisdiction. He also indicated he had forwarded the letter to Judge Larson.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b67 On May 10,2004, Halley sent another letter to Judge Larson, now expressing his desire to waive his right to counsel and to represent himself. He explained that his public defender did not answer his letters and that she refused to cooperate with any of his requests pertaining to his case. The District Court responded to Halley\u2019s May 10 letter with an order issued on the same day instructing Halley\u2019s attorney to confer with Halley and to be prepared to address this issue at a conference scheduled for June 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b68 On May 11, 2004, the State filed its Notice of Intent to Seek Increased Punishment, and on May 13, 2004, the court relieved Halley\u2019s appointed attorney of her duties and issued an order permitting Halley to represent himself. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Halley\u2019s counsel met with him between May 10 and May 13. On May 18, 2004, the court appointed stand-by counsel for Halley but indicated that Halley could continue pro se if desired. Between May 18 and June 17 Halley filed multiple pro se motions, including a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and one for the State\u2019s failure to provide a speedy trial. He also sought, again, to be released on his own recognizance. The court denied some of Halley\u2019s motions and reserved others for resolution at the June 17 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b69 On June 17 Halley and stand-by counsel appeared before a special master in the District Court. Halley was not asked about the circumstances surrounding the waiver of his right to counsel, nor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>he asked whether he was aware of the disadvantages of proceeding without counsel or if his waiver was voluntary. On August 26, 2004, Halley entered into a plea agreement under which he pled guilty to all counts. At the hearing conducted immediately after entering into the plea agreement, Halley told the court that he was completely comfortable with his appointed stand-by counsel, opining that \u201c[sjhe\u2019s been excellent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b610 After almost one year in jail, on January 10, 2005, the District Court sentenced Halley to forty years in the Montana State Prison, all suspended. Halley did not appeal but on March 9, 2006, he filed a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and requesting an evidentiary hearing. In October 2006 the District Court denied Halley\u2019s Petition concluding that Halley voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel on May 10, 2004, and therefore could no longer claim that he was deprived of his right to counsel based on ineffective assistance. Halley filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Jordan v. State, </em>2007 MT 165, \u00b6 5, 338 Mont. 113, \u00b6 5, 162 P.3d 863, \u00b6 5. Additionally, we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for substitution of counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 4, 304 Mont. 215, \u00b6 4, 19 P.3d 817, \u00b6 4 <em>(Gallagher II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Halley\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction Relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">\u00b6 13 Halley argues that the District Court erroneously failed to conduct a <em>Gallagher </em>inquiry pursuant to his written request for substitute counsel and that the District Court failed to hold a hearing before releasing appointed counsel and ordering Halley to represent himself. Halley asserts that these errors in turn led the court to its erroneous denial of his request for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">\u00b614 The State counters that the District Court correctly found and concluded that these alleged \u201cerrors\u201d became moot at the time Halley \u201cunequivocally, voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently\u201d waived his right to counsel and exercised his right of self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">\u00b6 15 A defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution and by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 14, 288 Mont. 180, \u00b6 14, 955 P.2d 1371, \u00b6 14 <em>(Gallagher I). </em>In cases where a criminal defendant cannot afford to hire an attorney, counsel is appointed to represent him at public expense. <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792 (1963); <em>State v. Craig, </em>274 Mont. 140, 148, 906 P.2d 683, 688 (1995). As noted above, Halley was provided with appointed counsel soon after his arrest. Shortly thereafter, however, Halley became dissatisfied with appointed counsel and requested substitute counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b616 When a criminal defendant makes a pretrial request for appointment of substitute counsel in conjunction with allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, we require the district court to make an adequate initial inquiry into the nature of a defendant\u2019s complaint to determine if those complaints are \u201cseemingly substantial.\u201d <em>Gallagher I, </em>\u00b6 15. If a defendant\u2019s complaint about his relationship with counsel rises to the level of \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d and he requests that the court appoint substitute counsel, the court should conduct a hearing to address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims. <em>Gallagher I, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b617 We stated in <em>Gallagher 1 </em>that such an initial inquiry is adequate when the district court considers the \u201cdefendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations addressing the complaints.\u201d <em>Gallagher I, </em>\u00b6 15. Conversely, we also said that a district court\u2019s initial inquiry is inadequate when there is not even a \u201ccursory inquiry\u201d into the defendant\u2019s complaint. <em>Gallagher I, </em>\u00b6 15. More recently, in <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2007 MT 49, \u00b6 23, 336 Mont. 164, \u00b6 23, 153 P.3d 619, \u00b6 23, we clearly reiterated that the district court <em>\u201cmust </em>determine if the complaints are substantial by making an adequate initial inquiry into the nature of the complaints.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b618 In the case before us, the District Corut conducted no inquiry whatsoever into Halley\u2019s written allegations of ineffective assistance submitted on March 25. Such failure was an abuse of the District Court\u2019s discretion and constitutes reversible error unless the error was cured by Halley\u2019s subsequent request to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b619 As indicated above, on May 10 Halley submitted a letter to the District Court. In this letter, rather than requesting appointment of substitute counsel as he had previously done without success, Halley asked to be allowed to represent himself and to waive his right to counsel. He explained that he wished to represent himself because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>was dissatisfied with appointed counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 13, without conducting any inquiry, the court discharged appointed counsel and ordered Halley to proceed through self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b620 Just as an accused has a constitutional right to effective counsel, he also has a constitutional right to appear pro se. However, because such action results in the loss of many benefits associated with the right to counsel, the trial court must ensure the defendant is competent to abandon his right to assistance of counsel and proceed pro se. <em>State v. Colt, </em>255 Mont. 399, 403, 843 P.2d 747, 749-50 (1992), <em>citing Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 2541 (1974). Competence on the part of a defendant to abandon his right to counsel and proceed pro se does not necessarily mean he must have the skill and experience of a lawyer, but it does mean that the defendant\u2019s relinquishment of his right to counsel must be made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. <em>Colt, </em>255 Mont. at 404, 843 P.2d at 749-50. In <em>State v. Insua, </em>2004 MT 14, \u00b6 19, 319 Mont. 254, \u00b6 19, 84 P.3d 11, \u00b6 19, we explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\"><em>Faretta </em>required that a defendant \u201cshould be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S. Ct. at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 581-82. In applying the <em>Faretta </em>standard, we have repeatedly held that \u201ca trial court is not required to advise a defendant specifically of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation as long as the court makes inquiry of the defendant to the extent it deems necessary to ensure that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">So long as substantial credible evidence exists to support the court\u2019s determination that a defendant acted voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently in waiving his right to counsel, we will not disturb the court\u2019s ruling. <em>State v. Langford, </em>267 Mont. 95, 100, 882 P.2d 490, 492.</p>\n<p id=\"ASC\">\u00b621  In the case before us, there is no evidence that the District Court made <em>any </em>inquiry of Halley <em>before </em>granting Halley\u2019s request to waive his right to counsel. In fact, at the time the court issued its May 10 order allowing Halley to proceed pro se, Halley had not appeared before the judge for several weeks; his first appearance after the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>did not occur until June 17. Moreover, the hearing transcript reveals that the only inquiry made by the special master on June 17 pertaining to Halley\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">The Court: My understanding is you are proceeding Pro Se. My understanding is that was your clear choice-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">Halley: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">The Court: -and that the Court has appointed Ms. Latino. I understand her to be a legal advisor, but the active role in this matter you have chosen to take on yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">Halley: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">The Court: Is that how you understand it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">Halley: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">As a result of the court\u2019s failure to make any substantive inquiry as to whether Halleys waiver was voluntary, knowing and intelligent, there exists no substantial credible evidence to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Halleys waiver was voluntary, knowing and intelligent. Therefore, under our clear precedent, we must conclude that Halley\u2019s waiver was not a valid exercise of his right of self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">\u00b622 Moreover, and contrary to the State\u2019s argument, subsequent appointment of and participation by stand-by counsel was not an adequate substitute for counsel. As held by the Supreme Court in <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 177-78, 104 S. Ct. 944, 950-51 (1984), the appointment of stand-by counsel can be a very useful step in a case in which a defendant wishes to represent himself; however, the proper role of stand-by counsel is quite limited in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">[t]he defendant preserves actual control over the case he presents to the jury: standby counsel cannot substantially interfere with any significant tactical decisions, cannot control the questioning of witnesses, and cannot speak in place of the defendant on any matter of importance. <em>Id. </em>Standby \u201ccounsel\u201d is thus quite different from regular counsel. Standby counsel does not <em>represent </em>the defendant. The defendant represents himself, and may or may not seek or heed the advice of the attorney standing by. As such, the role of standby counsel is more akin to that of an observer, an attorney who attends the trial or other proceeding and who may offer advice, but who does not speak for the defendant or bear responsibility for his defense. Thus, as useful as standby counsel may be when a defendant wishes to represent himself, this Court holds that standby counsel is not \u201ccounsel\u201d within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>United States v. Taylor, </em>933 F.2d 307, 313 (5th Cir. 1991). As such, Halley was deprived of his constitutional right to counsel during critical stages of the criminal proceeding. <em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 148, 906 P.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b623  Lastly, as Halley\u2019s guilty pleas were entered without counsel and without a valid waiver of counsel, his pleas are invalid and must be vacated. <em>State v. Browning, </em>2006 MT 190, \u00b6 15, 333 Mont. 132, \u00b6 15, 142 P.3d 757, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b624 While a district court has discretion to appoint, or refuse to appoint, substitute counsel after an initial <em>Gallagher </em>inquiry and hearing, if required, it does not have discretion to ignore a defendant\u2019s allegations of ineffective counsel and refuse to conduct an inquiry. In the case before us, the District Court abused its discretion in failing to comply with the <em>Gallagher </em>guidelines when presented with a claim of ineffective counsel and a request for substitute counsel. It further erred in failing to inquire adequately whether Halley\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel and request to represent himself was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b625 As a result, the District Court\u2019s Opinion and Order Denying Petitioner\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction Relief is based on incorrect conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b626 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate Halley\u2019s guilty pleas, reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition, and remand this matter for retrial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\"> On appeal, Halley asserts that he was \u201cdesperate\u201d to get before the court to explain the total breakdown between him and his appointed counsel and thought his request for \u201cwaiver\u201d would get the court\u2019s \u201cattention.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
