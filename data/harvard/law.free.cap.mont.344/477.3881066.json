We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether Walker\u2019s waivers of her right to counsel and her right to trial at the time of her 1999 DUI convictions were made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">\u00b63 On July 11,2005, Walker was charged by Information with felony DUI and four misdemeanor counts: speeding, driving while license suspended or revoked, failure to carry proof of insurance, and failure to use a seatbelt. Because Walker\u2019s driving record indicated that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>had six prior DUI convictions, this latest charge of DUI was enhanced to a felony pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA. According to a certified copy of Walker\u2019s driving record, her six prior DUI convictions occurred: on August 28,2003, in Hill County Justice Court; on September 27,1999, and January 6, 1999, in Harlem City Court; on October 26, 1992, and July 10,1992, in Browning Tribal Court; and on January 11,1985, in Harlem City Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b64 Walker filed a Motion to Dismiss Information or Complaint on December 13, 2005, alleging that four of her prior DUI convictions were constitutionally infirm because she did not have the assistance of counsel. She further argued that the conviction that occurred on January 11, 1985, should have been expunged because, based on the law that existed at that time, she did not receive another DUI within five years of that conviction. Walker also argued that the two 1992 convictions should have been expunged under the same premise. She maintained that even though the law changed in 1995, the law in effect at the time of the conviction controls. Walker did not challenge her August 2003 DUI conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b65 On December 13, 2005, Walker entered into a plea agreement with the State wherein she agreed to plead guilty to the felony DUI charge and the misdemeanor driving without proof of insurance charge in exchange for the State dropping the rest of the misdemeanor charges. In addition, she expressly reserved her right to appeal any unfavorable decision regarding her challenge to her previous DUI convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b66 At the change of plea hearing, Walker\u2019s counsel requested that the court reserve until sentencing taking Walker\u2019s plea on the driving without proof of insurance charge to allow counsel to verify whether Walker did indeed have insurance. The court agreed and accepted Walker\u2019s guilty plea on the felony DUI charge. The court also ordered that both parties file briefs with the court prior to sentencing regarding Walker\u2019s challenge to her prior DUI convictions. In her brief, Walker argued that her 1999 DUI convictions were infirm because she was not told that she had the \u201cabsolute and guaranteed\u201d right to an attorney and the right to compel the attendance of witnesses on her behalf; she was not told of the effect of any penalty enhancement provision; and she was not told that her right to a jury trial included having an impartial jury from the community as well as a unanimous verdict, and that she had a right to participate injury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b67 On February 6,2006, prior to sentencing, the court held a hearing on Walker\u2019s arguments that four of her prior DUI convictions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>invalid and, thus, could not be used to elevate her current DUI charge to a felony. In addition, the State moved to dismiss the driving without insurance charge as Walker had provided proof of insurance. The court determined that Walker\u2019s 1985 and 1992 convictions would not be considered for purposes of enhancing her sentence. The court also determined that Walker\u2019s 1999 DUI convictions were valid and, since she had not challenged her 2003 DUI conviction, the current charge was her fourth DUI and, thus, was a felony pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA.?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b68 Walker appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b69 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal proceeding is a question of law which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 196, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 534, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>State v. Luckett, </em>2007 MT 47, \u00b6 6, 336 Mont. 140, \u00b6 6, 152 P.3d 1279, \u00b6 6). As to a district court\u2019s factual findings concerning the circumstances surrounding a defendant\u2019s prior convictions, we review those findings under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing State <em>v. Burt, </em>2000 MT 115, \u00b6 6, 299 Mont. 412, \u00b6 6, 3 P.3d 597, \u00b6 6). A trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of that evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 10, \u00b6 17, 171 P.3d 731, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 23, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b610 <em>Whether Walker\u2019s waivers of her right to counsel and her right to trial at the time of her 1999 DUI convictions were made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b611 In Walker\u2019s effort to strike the two 1999 DUI convictions, she filed an affidavit in the District Court stating that she was not advised that a fourth or subsequent DUI could result in a felony; that if she chose to go to a jury trial, the verdict would have to be unanimous; that she could compel witnesses to testify on her behalf by way of subpoena; and that if she could not afford a lawyer, one would be appointed to represent her. She further stated in her affidavit that she pled guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>to both of the 1999 DUI charges without the benefit of a lawyer and that she was sentenced to jail for both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b612  It is well settled in Montana that the State may not use a constitutionally infirm conviction to support an enhanced punishment such as the felony DUI in the case before us on appeal. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>State v. Okland, </em>283 Mont. 10, 15, 941 P.2d 431, 434 (1997)). Moreover, a rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches to prior criminal convictions during a collateral attack and a defendant who challenges the validity of that prior conviction during a collateral attack has the burden of producing direct evidence of its invalidity. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 11. In other words, a prior conviction is presumed to be valid absent evidence to the contrary. <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 33, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 137, \u00b6 15, 130 P.3d 164, \u00b6 15. Once the defendant has made such a showing, the burden then shifts to the State to produce direct evidence and to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior conviction was not entered in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b613 As stated above, a rebuttable presumption of regularity attached to Walker\u2019s 1999 DUI convictions which Walker had to overcome by direct evidence. To that end, Walker submitted an affidavit in which she averred that she was not advised that an attorney would be appointed to represent her if she could not afford one; that if she chose to go to a jury trial, the verdict would have to be unanimous; that she could compel witnesses to testify on her behalf by way of subpoena; and that a fourth or subsequent charge of DUI would be a felony charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b614  This Court has recognized that a defendant\u2019s unequivocal and sworn statement that the defendant did not waive the right to counsel constitutes direct evidence which rebuts the presumption of regularity. State v <em>Howard, </em>2002 MT 276, \u00b6 13, 312 Mont. 359, \u00b6 13, 59 P.3d 1075, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>State v. Couture, </em>1998 MT 137, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 215, \u00b6 15, 959 P.2d 948, \u00b6 15). Here, Walker\u2019s unequivocal and sworn statements in her affidavit are direct evidence demonstrating that her guilty pleas may have been obtained in violation of her constitutional rights and therefore \u201cirregular.\u201d Consequently, Walker met her burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b615 The burden then shifted to the State to produce direct evidence and to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Walker\u2019s prior convictions were not entered in violation of Walker\u2019s rights. To that end, the State produced the records from Harlem City Court relating to both of Walker\u2019s 1999 DUI convictions. We now examine this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>evidence produced by the State to determine whether the State met its burden in proving that Walker\u2019s 1999 DUI convictions were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\n<em>1. right to counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b616 The right to the assistance of counsel is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 14, 941 P.2d at 433 (citing <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 342-44, 83 S. Ct. 792, 795-97 (1963); <em>State v. Craig, </em>274 Mont. 140, 148, 906 P.2d 683, 688 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1195, 116 S. Ct. 1689 (1996); <em>see also State v. Langford, </em>267 Mont. 95, 99, 882 P.2d 490, 492 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1163, 115 S. Ct. 1128 (1995)). Indigent defendants are entitled to legal representation by court-appointed counsel at public expense. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 14, 941 P.2d at 433 (citing <em>State v. Enright, </em>233 Mont. 225, 228, 758 P.2d 779, 781 (1988), <em>overruled in part and on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b617  However, the fundamental right to counsel in misdemeanor cases extends only to those cases in which a sentence of imprisonment is actually imposed and does not extend to defendants who waive that right. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 14, 941 P.2d at 433 (citing <em>Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 373-74, 99 S. Ct. 1158, 1162 (1979); <em>State v. Hansen, </em>273 Mont. 321, 325, 903 P.2d 194, 197 (1995), <em>overruled in part by Alabama v. Shelton, </em>535 U.S. 654, 122 S. Ct. 1764 (2002); <em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 152, 906 P.2d at 690).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b618 Furthermore, courts indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights and will not indulge in any presumption of waiver. <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 33, \u00b6 13, 331 Mont. 137, \u00b6 13, 130 P.3d 164, \u00b6 13. Thus, for a waiver to be effective, a defendant must waive a known right knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b619 In this case, Walker contends that she did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive her right to counsel prior to entering her guilty pleas to the 1999 DUI charges because she was advised at that time that counsel <em>may </em>be appointed to represent her if she could not afford counsel, not that counsel <em>would </em>be appointed to represent her. She maintains that a defendant must be advised that the right to counsel is absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">\u00b620 In support of her contention that her waiver of her right to counsel was not made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, Walker relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mann </em>wherein we held that the defendant in that case did not enter into a knowing, intelligent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>voluntary waiver of his right to counsel when he signed the arraignment forms that were provided for him. However, we came to that conclusion in <em>Mann, </em>not because of the defendant\u2019s interpretation of one simple word as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>but because the right to counsel provision contained in the arraignment forms signed by the defendant in <em>Mann </em>were \u201cerroneous, intimidating and virtually indecipherable.\u201d <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 24. These arraignment forms advised Mann</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auo\">[t]hat I have a right to have legal counsel represent me, but since no provision is made for payment of legal counsel in the lower court, I would be required to pay for such counsel, unless I fill out such form claiming indigency, that I would be sworn as to the truthfulness of statements, this form would then be turned over to the County Attorney who would have an investigation made, <em>if statements were found to be false I could be tried for perjury. </em>If found true, the Judge <em>may or may not appoint legal counsel to represent me </em>at the State\u2019s expense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 6 (emphasis added). We held in <em>Mann </em>that the language in this form was confusing and intimidating in that it threatened additional prosecution for perjury. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 24. We also determined that the final sentence in this paragraph of the form was an incorrect statement of the law because it articulated that even after Mann filled out indigence forms and underwent a criminal investigation regarding his truthfulness as to indigence, the court could still choose not to appoint counsel to represent him. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b621 In the instant case, the State produced the Harlem City Court records for Walker\u2019s September 27, 1999, and January 6, 1999 DUI convictions to show that Walker was properly advised of her right to an attorney. Unlike the forms in <em>Mann, </em>the Initial Appearance/Arraignment documents that Walker signed after she was charged with each offense of DUI in 1999 stated: \u201cYou have the right to have an attorney represent you. If you cannot afford your own attorney, one may be appointed to represent you, in accordance with MCA 46-8-101.\u201d In these same documents, Walker indicated that she understood her rights, that she did not desire an attorney and that she would represent herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b622 Walker also signed a \u2018Waiver of Rights\u201d and a Waiver of Counsel\u201d prior to both of her 1999 DUI convictions wherein she acknowledged that she fully understood that she had the right to have an attorney. In the Waiver of Counsel, Walker acknowledged that she had been advised of her right to counsel and that she understood that she had \u201c[t]he right to have an attorney and consult with an attorney before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>entering a plea. If I have no funds to hire an attorney, and I QUALIFY, and [sic] attorney may be appointed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b623 While Walker finds fault with the phrase \u201cmay be appointed,\u201d in these documents, the Initial Appearance/Arraignment documents actually stated, \u201cmay be appointed to represent you, <em>in accordance with MCA 46-8-101 </em>[emphasis added].\u201d In 1999, when Walker entered her guilty pleas, this statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">Right to counsel. (1) During the initial appearance before the court, every defendant must be informed of the right to have counsel, and must be asked if the aid of counsel is desired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">(2) If the defendant desires counsel, is unable to employ counsel, and is entitled to have counsel assigned, the court shall assign counsel to the defendant without unnecessary delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">(3) The defendant, if unable to employ counsel, is <em>entitled to have counsel assigned if:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">\n<em>(a) the offense charged is a felony;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">\n<em>(b) the offense charged is a misdemeanor and the court desires to retain imprisonment as a sentencing option; or</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">\n<em>(c) the interests of justice would be served by assignment.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ausm\">Section 46-8-101, MCA (1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">\u00b624 Thus, contrary to Walker\u2019s assertions that the use of the qualifying phrase <em>\u201cmay </em>be appointed,\u201d did not advise her adequately of her absolute right to counsel, the reference to \u00a7 46-8-101, MCA (1997), is clear. Under that statute, a defendant\u2019s right to have counsel assigned is qualified, not only by a determination of indigence, but by the following three criteria: 1) whether the offense charged is a felony; 2) whether the offense charged is a misdemeanor and the court desires to retain imprisonment as a sentencing option; and 3) whether the interests of justice would be served by assignment. Consequently, because Walker had to meet one of these three criteria in order to have counsel assigned, the court was not in error in using the qualifying language that counsel \u201cmay be appointed\u201d to represent her as it had yet to determine whether Walker qualified for counsel under the terms of \u00a7 46-8-101, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">\n<em>2. right to compel the attendance of witnesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AoVT\">\u00b625 The Initial Appearance/Arraignment documents Walker signed prior to her guilty pleas to the 1999 DUI charges stated: \u201cAt the trial you have the right... to call witnesses to testify for you ....\u201d Similarly, the Waiver of Rights documents asked Walker to acknowledge that she fully understood that \u201c[a]t the trial, I have the right... to call witnesses to testify for me.\u201d And, the Waiver of Counsel documents asked Walker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>to indicate that she had been advised of and understood that she had: \u201cThe right to call witnesses to testify before me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b626 Walker contends that she did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive her right to trial when she signed these documents because she was only advised that she had the right to \u201ccall\u201d witnesses to testify on her behalf, not that she had the right to \u201ccompel\u201d witnesses to testify. She maintains that \u201c[b]eing told that one can call witnesses to testify, and being told that one can compel or force witnesses to testify through the power of the court are two (2) different things.\u201d Walker provides no authority in support of her contention.</p>\n<p id=\"AVK\">\u00b627  Contrary to Walker\u2019s assertions, the plain meaning of the term \u201cto call\u201d includes \u201cto ask or order to come,\u201d <em>The Collins English Dictionary </em>224 (Patrick Hanks ed., 2d ed. Collins 1990), and \u201c[t]o summon,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>196 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed. West 1999). Consequently, we conclude that it was sufficient for the court to advise Walker that she had the right to <em>call </em>witnesses to testify in her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b628 Moreover, the Montana Constitution does not provide that a defendant has the right to compel witnesses to <em>testify. </em>Instead, it provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to ... compel <em>the attendance </em>of witnesses in his behalf....\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24 (emphasis added). Thus, while under Montana\u2019s Constitution an accused can compel a witness in their behalf to <em>attend </em>a proceeding, the Constitution does not state that the accused can compel them to <em>testify.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\n<em>3. right to trial by jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b629 Walker contends that she could not have validly waived her right to a jury trial if she was not told what the right to a jury trial included. Walker maintains that she was not told that the verdict in a jury trial must be unanimous, that the jurors must be from the community where the alleged crime was committed, that the jurors must be impartial, and that the accused has a say in the jurors selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u00b630 Article II, Section 26 of the Montana Constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cThe right of trial by jury is secured to all and shall remain inviolate.... In all criminal actions, the verdict shall be unanimous.\u201d Moreover, Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to ... a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00b631 The Initial Appearance/Arraignment documents Walker signed prior to her guilty pleas to the 1999 DUI charges stated: \u201cYou have the right to have a trial by jury or a trial by Judge.... You have the right to ... have the charge(s) against you to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Similarly, the Waiver of Rights documents asked Walker to acknowledge that she fully understood that she had \u201cthe right to be tried by a jury, or by a judge\u201d and that \u201c[a]t the trial, I have the right ... to have my guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d And, the Waiver of Counsel documents asked Walker to indicate that she had been advised of and understood that she had: \u201cThe right to a jury trial or a trial by judge\u201d and the \u201cright to have the pending charge proven beyond a reasonable doubt....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b632 Walker asserts that these statements were insufficient to advise her of her various trial rights. In support of her contention, she quotes the following language from <em>United States v. Cochran, </em>770 F.2d 850, 853 (9th Cir. 1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">Like the Sixth Circuit, we expect that adoption of a supervisory rule will be unnecessary and that district court [sic] will in the future follow the course we are once again urging. Like the Sixth Circuit we \u201cimplore\u201d district courts to inform defendants that (1) twelve members of the community compose a jury; (2) the defendant may take part in jury selection; (3) jury verdicts must be unanimous; and (4) the court alone decides guilt or innocence if the defendant waives a jury trial. When district courts provide this information on the record, they help insure that defendants understand the basic mechanics of a jury trial before deciding whether to waive that right. By asking appropriate questions the district court will also be better able to perform its task of determining whether a proposed waiver is in fact being offered voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. [Internal citation and footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u00b633 As the State points out in its brief on appeal, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals went to great lengths in <em>Cochran </em>to implore courts to conduct a colloquy with defendants to be sure they understand a jury waiver, the court underscored that no constitutional or statutory provision requires such a colloquy. <em>Cochran, </em>770 F.2d at 851 (\u201cthe failure of a district judge to conduct such an interrogation does not violate either the Constitution... or Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(a); nor does it <em>ipso facto </em>require reversal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b634  Walker was advised that she had the right to a jury trial and the right to have her guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>conclude that, beyond that, requiring the court to explain all of the nuances or effects of waiving the right to a jury trial is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\n<em>4. penalty enhancement provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATa\">\u00b635 Section 46-12-210(1)(a)(iii), MCA, requires that before accepting a plea of guilty, the trial court shall determine that the defendant understands \u201cthe maximum penalty provided by law, <em>including the effect of any penalty enhancement provision </em>... [emphasis added].\u201d Walker argues, in effect, that this statute requires that the enhanced penalty for a fourth or greater DUI must be made known to a defendant prior to obtaining that defendant\u2019s guilty plea on a third or lesser DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b636 We disagree. Contrary to Walker\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7 46-12-210(1)(a)(iii), MCA, requires trial courts to advise defendants of what might happen as a result of a plea of guilty to the specific charge at issue and not to some future crime. As the State points out in its brief on appeal, there is no requirement under Montana law that a sentencing judge must advise a defendant specifically regarding a crime the defendant may commit in the future. Indeed, committing a future felony is clearly an indirect consequence over which Walker had complete control.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b637 In <em>State v. Liefert, </em>2002 MT 48, \u00b6 21, 309 Mont. 19, \u00b6 21, 43 P.3d 329, \u00b6 21, <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 892, 123 S. Ct. 160 (2002), we held that because it is impossible for a judge to inform a defendant of every possible consequence of a guilty plea, a judge is only required to inform a defendant of the <em>direct, </em>rather than the collateral, consequences of a guilty plea. We stated in <em>Liefert </em>that a \u201cconsequence is direct if it has a \u2018definite, immediate, and largely automatic effect\u2019 on the defendant.\u201d <em>Liefert, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>United States v. Bouthot, </em>878 F.2d 1506, 1511 (1st Cir. 1989)). Conversely, a consequence is indirect or collateral if it is not under the control of the sentencing judge or it is a procedure under the control of a different sovereign or agency. <em>Liefert, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>United States v. Long, </em>852 F.2d 975, 979 (7th Cir. 1988)). A consequence is also indirect or collateral if the defendant has control over whether or not the consequence occurs. <em>Liefert, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Torrey v. Estelle, </em>842 F.2d 234, 236 (9th Cir. 1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b638  In the instant case, Walker was advised in the Initial Appearance/Arraignment documents that she signed prior to both of her 1999 DUI convictions that \u201c[t]here may be indirect consequences of this plea, which may include loss of driving privileges; and the use of this conviction against you if you are convicted of a crime in the future.\u201d However, the trial court was not required to advise her that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>a fourth or subsequent DUI might result in a felony charge. Whether Walker committed a fourth or subsequent DUI requiring that she receive the enhanced penalty was clearly within her sole control and was, thus, an indirect consequence of her guilty pleas to the 1999 DUI offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b639 The State presented sufficient evidence in the District Court to support the conclusion that Walker\u2019s 1999 DUI convictions were not entered in violation of her constitutional rights. As shown above, Walker was properly advised of her right to counsel, her right to compel the attendance of witnesses on her behalf, and her right to a jury trial. In addition, the District Court was not required to advise her of the indirect consequences of her guilty pleas. On that basis, we conclude that Walker\u2019s guilty pleas to the 1999 DUI charges were entered knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. We hold, therefore, that the District Court correctly ruled that Walker\u2019s 1999 DUI convictions could be used to elevate her current DUI charge to a felony, and that the District Court did not err in denying Walker\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b640 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
