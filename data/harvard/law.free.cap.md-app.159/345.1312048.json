The complaint arose from the death of appellee\u2019s father, Jermal Thomas (Thomas), who was killed while riding as a passenger in Gaither\u2019s uninsured motor vehicle. Count one of the complaint alleged a wrongful death claim against Gaither while count two asserted a breach of contract against Hartford, Thomas\u2019s insurer, for uninsured motorist coverage. The third count of the complaint alleged a breach of contract claim against appellant, Johnson\u2019s automobile insurer. Although Thomas was not insured under the policy provided by appellant, appellee maintained that Md. Code (2002 Repl. Vol.), Ins., \u00a7 19-509 required appellant to provide wrongful death coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Subsequently, counts one and two of the complaint were voluntarily dismissed after Hartford paid its policy limit of $20,000. In regard to count three, appellee filed a motion for partial summary judgment on June 19, 2003 and appellant responded by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment on July 2, 2003. A hearing was conducted on July 28, 2003 and appellee\u2019s motion was granted by an order dated the same day. On September 15, 2003, a final judgment in the amount of $5,000 was entered against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Appellant filed its timely notice of appeal on October 7, 2003, presenting one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Did the trial court err when it determined that [Ins. \u00a7 19\u2014 509] required an insurer to provide [uninsured motorist] coverage for the wrongful death of a person who was not an insured under the policy?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">We answer appellant\u2019s question in the affirmative and, therefore, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">On March 6, 2002, Thomas was killed in a two-vehicle accident while traveling as the passenger in an uninsured vehicle operated by Gaither. As the automobile traveled westbound on Cold Spring Lane, Gaither lost control, crossed the center line, and struck another vehicle. It is undisputed that Gaither\u2019s negligent driving caused Thomas\u2019s death. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>though Gaither did not have automobile insurance coverage, Thomas carried an uninsured motorist policy with Hartford in the amount of $20,000. Additionally, appellee\u2019s mother, Johnson, carried an automobile insurance policy with appellant, which provided uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence. The policy issued by appellant, however, only provided coverage for the named insured and any relative.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of the accident, Johnson was the only named insured on the policy. Furthermore, Thomas did not reside with Johnson during the five years prior to his death and the two were never married. Although appellee lived with Johnson and was considered a relative under her policy, Thomas did not fit the definition of an insured or relative. Consequently, when appellee filed a claim with appellant regarding Thomas\u2019s death, appellant asserted that no coverage existed and denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">As noted, <em>supra, </em>appellee filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, naming appellant as one of the defendants. The parties subsequently filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether appellant was obligated to provide uninsured motorist coverage. Appellee argued that, notwithstanding the apparent lack of coverage for Thomas under the policy, appellant was required to provide coverage for appellee\u2019s claim because, under Maryland law, the decedent does not necessarily need to be the insured. For support, appellee cited an alternative holding in <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, </em>322 Md. 689, 589 A.2d 944 (1991), to the effect that an insured is covered under his or her uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>motorist policy as long as the insured is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle because of bodily injuries or death. Because appellee was an insured under the policy and because he was entitled to collect from Gaither for the death of Thomas, appellee asserted that he was entitled to coverage. Appellant responded that Ins. \u00a7 19-509, which was amended at the time of the <em>Forbes </em>decision to specifically include a wrongful death provision, did not require coverage unless the decedent was the insured. After a hearing, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion, holding that the \u201cissue is controlled by the Court of Appeals\u2019 alternative holding in <em>Forbes, </em>notwithstanding the language of \u00a7 19-509(c)(2) of the Insurance Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">As in the trial court, appellant argues that Ins. \u00a7 19-509 does not require it to provide coverage for appellee\u2019s claim. According to appellant, because Thomas was not an insured under the policy and because coverage is not mandated by Ins. \u00a7 19-509, it is not obligated to provide uninsured motorist benefits for the wrongful death of Thomas. Appellee responds, as he did in the circuit court, by relying on the alternative holding found in <em>Forbes. </em>Despite the language in Ins. \u00a7 19-509 suggesting that coverage does not exist, appellee maintains that the holding set forth in <em>Forbes </em>is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The trial court may grant summary judgment only when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute of material fact\u201d and \u201cthe party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2\u2014501(e); <em>Bagwell v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>106 Md.App. 470, 488, 665 A.2d 297 (1995). If we determine that there is no dispute of material fact, then our role is to decide whether the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods. Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Tennant v. Shoppers Food Warehouse Md. Corp., </em>115 Md.App. 381, 386, 693 A.2d 370 (1997). Whether sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>mary judgment is properly granted as a matter of law is a question of law and, therefore, review of the granting of summary judgment is <em>de novo. Eng\u2019g Mgmt. Servs. v. Md. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 229-30, 825 A.2d 966 (2003). \u201cThe standard of appellate review of a summary judgment is whether it is \u2018legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 825 A.2d 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Ins. \u00a7 19-509 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">(c) <em>Coverage </em>required.\u2014In addition to any other coverage required by this subtitle, each motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued, sold, or delivered in the State after July 1, 1975, shall contain coverage for damages, subject to the policy limits, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">(1) the insured is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the uninsured motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">(2) a surviving relative of the insured, who is described in \u00a7 3-904 of the Courts Article, is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because the insured died as the result of a motor vehicle accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Under the plain meaning of Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(l), an \u201cinsured is entitled to recover ... because of bodily injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident,\u201d which suggests that the insured may only recover for injuries he or she sustained. The wrongful death provision in Ins. \u00a7 19-509(e)(2) states that a \u201csurviving relative of the insured ... is entitled to recover ... because the insured died as a result of a motor vehicle accident,\u201d thereby indicating that the decedent must be the insured in order for a plaintiff to prevail under a claim for uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Appellee concedes that Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(2) is not applicable because Thomas was not an insured under the policy issued by appellant. He instead argues that the language in Ins. \u00a7 19-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>509(c)(1) applies because, under <em>Forbes, </em>the language not only allows an insured plaintiff to recover for the injuries he or she sustained in an automobile accident, but also for damages an insured plaintiff is entitled to recover due to the injury or death of another, regardless of whether the other is insured. Applying his interpretation to the facts of the instant case, appellee asserts that he is an insured plaintiff who is entitled to recover damages for the death of another person, namely Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Turning to the decision in <em>Forbes, </em>we note that the factual scenario confronted by the Court of Appeals in that case was in some regards similar to the facts in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Forbes, </em>the plaintiff and his wife, although married with two children, lived apart, with both children residing with the wife. The wife was killed in an automobile accident while riding as a passenger in an uninsured vehicle. The children, who were also passengers in the vehicle, suffered injury but survived the accident. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed an action against his uninsured motorist carrier for the personal injuries of the two children. He also filed actions on behalf of the children and the wife for the wrongful death of his wife. The plaintiff was a named insured under the policy and coverage was also provided for the children. It was unclear, however, whether the wife was an insured because she no longer resided with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The insurer in <em>Forbes </em>argued that, under Md. Code (1957, 1991 Repl. Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, the predecessor to Ins. \u00a7 19-509, it was not required to provide wrongful death benefits because the wife was not an insured under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>plaintiffs policy. In response, the Court of Appeals set forth two holdings. First, it concluded that, the wife was an insured under the plaintiffs policy despite the marital separation. <em>Forbes, </em>322 Md. at 702-08, 589 A.2d 944. Alternatively, the Court held that, even if the wife was not an insured, \u00a7 541(c)(2) mandated that the children\u2019s wrongful death claims be covered by the uninsured motorist policy. <em>Id. </em>at 708-09, 589 A.2d 944. Although \u00a7 541(c)(2) did not explicitly address whether wrongful death claims were covered, the Court reasoned that the legislature intended such claims to be covered under the statute. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the Court concluded that nothing in \u00a7 541(c)(2) required that the decedent be the insured in order for the section to be applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 709, 589 A.2d 944. The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">The Forbes children\u2019s wrongful death claims squarely fall within this statutory language even if their mother at the time of the accident was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the language of [the plaintiffs] policy. The children are \u201cinsureds\u201d under the [plaintiffs] policy. Under Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute, the children are legally entitled to damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of the death of their mother sustained in an accident arising out of the operation of the uninsured vehicle. In fact, a judgment against the owner and operator of the uninsured vehicle has been recovered on their behalf. The claims of the insured children clearly are embraced by the critical coverage language of \u00a7 541(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Because the controlling language from \u00a7 541(c)(2) now appears in Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(l), appellee argues that <em>Forbes </em>is applicable. In other words, just as the children in <em>Forbes, </em>appellee contends that his wrongful death claim falls squarely within the statute because he is an insured entitled to collect from an uninsured motorist. Likewise, appellee also asserts that it should make no difference that'the decedent, Thomas, was not an insured. Appellee overlooks, however, the circumstances surrounding the <em>Forbes </em>decision and the revision of \u00a7 541(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The decision in <em>Forbes </em>was filed on May 10, 1991. As noted, <em>supra, Forbes </em>analyzed whether \u00a7 541(c)(2) required uninsured motorist coverage for wrongful death claims. Contemporaneously, section 541(c)(2) was revised by Ins. \u00a7 19-509, which the General Assembly passed on April 7, 1991 and which became effective on July 1, 1991. In amending the statute, the legislature used part of the language from \u00a7 541(c)(2) in drafting Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(l), thus retaining the coverages afforded by \u00a7 541(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(2), on the other hand, was an entirely new section that was aimed at providing uninsured motorist coverage for wrongful death claims. The revision of \u00a7 541(c)(2) was due in large part to a decision rendered by this Court in <em>Globe American Casualty Co. v. Chung, </em>76 Md.App. 524, 547 A.2d 654 (1988), <em>vacated by Globe American Casualty Co. v. Chung, </em>322 Md. 713, 589 A.2d 956 (1991). The Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 541(c)(2) did not apply to wrongful death claims. The General Assembly\u2019s subsequent revision sought to counteract the <em>Globe </em>decision by adding the language found in Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(2). Therefore, the revision of \u00a7 541(c)(2) was in reaction to <em>Globe </em>and was unrelated to <em>Forbes. </em>In fact, Ins. \u00a7 19-509 was passed one month before <em>Forbes. </em>Additionally, <em>Forbes </em>was not in reaction to\u2014or an application of\u2014Ins. \u00a7 19-509 because the statute did not become effective until two months after <em>Forbes. </em>It can also be inferred from the timing of <em>Forbes </em>and the legislative revision of \u00a7 541(c)(2) that the Court of Appeals sought to accomplish in <em>Forbes, </em>at least in part, what the General Assembly did when it revised \u00a7 541(c)(2)\u2014namely, establishing that uninsured motorist policies covered wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Based on the aforementioned facts, it is apparent that the passage of Ins. \u00a7 19-509 invalidated <em>Forbes. Forbes </em>was based solely on \u00a7 541(c)(2), a statute which left ambiguous the question of whether uninsured motorist policies were required to cover wrongful death claims. With the enactment of Ins. \u00a7 19-509, the General Assembly fully addressed the issue of wrongful death coverage with the additional language found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Ins. 19-509(c)(2). Consequently, the controlling language in the case <em>subjudice </em>is Ins. \u00a7 19-509 and not <em>Forbes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Because the General Assembly included a subsection specifically addressing wrongful death claims\u2014Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(2)\u2014 it is evident that the legislature intended the subsection to regulate all instances in which a claimant seeks wrongful death benefits under an uninsured motorist policy. Thus, contrary to appellee\u2019s argument, Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(l) does not apply. A plain reading of Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(l) indicates that the subsection addressed instances in which an insured sustains bodily injury. Turning to the governing language of Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c)(2), the statute mandates that all uninsured motorist policies contain coverage for damages that <em>\u201ca </em>surviving relative <em>of the insured </em>... is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because the <em>insured </em>died as the result of a motor vehicle accident....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Applying the plain language of the subsection to the instant case, we hold that appellee\u2019s wrongful death claim was not covered because Thomas was not the insured. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in appellee\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\">.
