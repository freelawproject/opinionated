Vol., 2003 Supp.), \u00a7 12-302(c)(3)(i) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State challenges the order of the Circuit Court for Cecil County, suppressing contraband and over $175,000 recovered during a warrantless search of a vehicle driven by Yerson Rafael Cabral, appellee. The search was conducted during a traffic stop, after a trained canine alerted to the presence of drugs in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">The State asks one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Did the motions court err by granting the motion to suppress because the alert by the trained and certified drug dog in this case provided probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of Cabral\u2019s vehicle?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The primary issue posed by the State requires us to consider whether probable cause to search a vehicle is undermined because of \u201cthe possibility that a drug dog could alert on residual odor.... \u201d While challenging probable cause, appellee contends that the circuit court properly granted the suppression motion because the State did not satisfy the best evidence rule; it was unable to play for the court the trooper\u2019s digital recording of the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Cabral was charged with possession of heroin with the intent to distribute, and with following \u201canother vehicle too closely____\u201d Thereafter, he moved to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle during a warrantless search. An evidentiary hearing was held on February 20, 2004, and on March 17, 2004. A summary of what transpired at the hearings now follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">On August 28, 2003, Trooper First Class Christopher Spinner was assigned to the Interstate Criminal Enforcement Team. Between 2:45 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. on that date, he effected a traffic stop of a Mercury Villager minivan on Interstate 95 in Cecil County, because it was following another vehicle too closely. Appellee was the driver of the vehicle and he was accompanied by one passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Trooper Spinner testified that he \u201cadvised\u201d Cabral of \u201cthe reason for the stop.\u201d Upon request, Cabral produced his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, which revealed that \u201cthe vehicle was registered to a third party.\u201d Spinner \u201cnoticed that [Cabral] was breathing very heavily and his chest was rising and falling quickly and his hands were shaking as he gave [Spinner] his driver\u2019s license and registration.\u201d Spin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ner recalled \u201csome other interesting things.\u201d He noted that \u201cthere was a single key in the ignition, no other keys on the key ring, and there were some pump air fresheners throughout the vehicle as well as a strong odor of air freshener coming from the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">After Cabral produced his driver\u2019s license, Spinner \u201c[a]sked him to remain in the vehicle while [he] went back and prepared the paperwork.\u201d Spinner also called for assistance. Shortly thereafter, Troopers Catalano and Connor responded to the location, arriving at \u201cjust about the same time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that point, Spinner \u201cwas beginning to fill out the paperwork necessary for the warning as well as calling in the license and registration checks.\u201d Spinner added that, when Trooper Catalano arrived, he (Spinner) \u201cwas still waiting on the checks and attempting to complete all the paperwork.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Spinner \u201cadvised\u201d Catalano of his \u201cinitial observations.\u201d As Spinner continued to work \u201con the warning,\u201d and while \u201cwaiting on the checks,\u201d Connor spoke to the driver and Catalano \u201cconducted a K-9 scan of the van.... \u201d The K-9 scan of the vehicle \u201cresult[ed] in a positive K-9 alert.\u201d In his testimony, Spinner made clear that, when the dog alerted, he \u201cwas still working on the warning\u201d and had not yet finished the \u201clicense and registration check,\u201d The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMj\">[PROSECUTOR]: And as far as the license and registration check that you were conducting, is that the standard operating procedure in making a traffic stop on Interstate 95?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.... You hadn\u2019t received the results of that [license and registration] check at the time that the dog alerted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: No, I had not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Based upon the alert, Spinner and Connor searched the vehicle, while Catalano remained with the driver and the passenger \u201cfor their safety and ours.... \u201d During the search of the vehicle, the troopers spotted \u201ca hidden compartment in the driver\u2019s side panel of the vehicle,\u201d from which they recovered $178,840 in United States currency and \u201cthree compressed pellets\u201d of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">On cross-examination, Trooper Spinner testified that he had a DVD camera in his patrol car, which he activated during the stop.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, he did not have the DVD with him at the February 2004 hearing. Although Spinner offered to retrieve the DVD from his vehicle, the State did not have the equipment needed to play it.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">State Trooper First Class Joseph Catalano testified that he was assigned to the Maryland State Police Special Operations Section, K-9 Division. He had been a K-9 handler for approximately one year prior to the date in question. According to Catalano, his dog, Bruno, was trained to detect the odor of various Schedule II illegal drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. Moreover, Bruno was up-to-date on the requisite retraining and certifications, and had been successful in the field in the year prior to the stop. Accordingly, the State offered Bruno as an \u201cexpert in detection of controlled dangerous substances.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected, and was permitted to conduct voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>During voir dire, Catalano testified that in 2002 he and Bruno \u201cinitially went through an 11-week course\u201d and, at the end of that course, Bruno was certified. Moreover, Bruno was recertified in November 2003. In addition, Catalano explained that they \u201cgo through a 24-hour of monthly training and then an [sic] every quarter we go through, like, a certification training.\u201d Catalano claimed that Bruno is unable to detect prescription drugs, such as Codeine, Oxycontin, or Oxycodone.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Catalano explained that Bruno alerts by \u201cpaw[ing] at the direct odor of the source [sic]. That\u2019s one of his behavior changes. Then it\u2019s followed by he sits. That\u2019s his final response.\u201d As to Bruno\u2019s ability to detect illegal drugs, Catalano testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">Bruno\u2019s never had a false positive, I guess. I mean he\u2019s never alerted false. He never falsed on anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">In training he\u2019s never falsed. Wherever he alerts there\u2019s a drug. He\u2019s never alerted to, say, a blank vehicle. Out on the street there\u2019s been times where he\u2019s alerted and the trooper searching that vehicle has not found the drug. That\u2019s not saying that there wasn\u2019t a drug there previously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">Or even\u2014or if that trooper found the drugs in the car, I\u2019ve had people admit that\u2014some people admit they were smoking marijuana in the car a day or two prior, maybe earlier that day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Of significance here, Catalano agreed that, even if drugs were no longer present in a vehicle, Bruno could alert to a residual odor. Indeed, Catalano acknowledged that \u201cthere have been alerts by Bruno previously where there hadn\u2019t been drugs in the car,\u201d but drugs had been in the vehicle up to 72 hours prior to the scan. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aio\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Would [Bruno] he be able to detect CDS that were present in the vehicle in the past; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>other words, that weren\u2019t there on that day that may have been there in the recent past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: Typically the way we\u2019re trained is that the vehicle has no drugs in it at all, the residual odor of a drug can last up to 72 hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>So he would have alerted if drugs would have been there in the 72 hours that give off an odor that he\u2019s been trained for?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: <em>He could, he could show an indication.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Would he also have alerted if the passenger and or driver, let\u2019s say, would have\u2014the passenger on this day would have had drugs on their person and gotten out of that vehicle and you run a scan on the vehicle, could there still be an alert?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: If there was a drug in there within 72 hours or recently, a residual odor in that vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaK\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: So in other words, if someone smoked marijuana there the day before, let\u2019s say, and there still could be a residual odor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Or if a passenger had been in the vehicle, gotten out of the vehicle and gone someplace else, [sic] still could be a residual odor is it [sic] fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZC\">[TROOPER CATALANO]: That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s what I\u2019m told.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">During voir due, Catalano also testified about what occurred on the date in question. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-14\">On this date I circled Bruno around the vehicle. Bruno approached the driver\u2019s side front door; and at the rear portion of that front door Bruno kicked his head back, which indicates to me that he caught an odor of a, one of the drugs that he\u2019s trained in. He kicked back. He ran his nose along the seam of that door. He started pawing at the door and then he went into a sit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>State Trooper First Class Christopher Connor testified that he \u201cadvised\u201d Cabral that they had \u201clocated a false compartment [in the vehicle] and that we were attempting to access it and I asked for his cooperation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cabral then spoke in Spanish to his passenger, and reported to Connor that \u201cthe compartment was broken and that it would not open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Appellee did not testily or call any witnesses. The hearing was continued, however, in order to allow the State to play the digital recording of the traffic stop. The court said: \u201cI think it\u2019s good to see the order of events, all that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">When the hearing resumed on March 17, 2004, the prosecutor explained that he had issued a subpoena to the State police \u201cfor production of the equipment necessary to play that CD.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, he reported that an \u201cunsuccessful\u201d attempt was made to transfer the CD to \u201cVHS format.\u201d Further, the prosecutor stated that an attempt was \u201cmade to transfer it to a CD that would play [on] a computer,\u201d but that effort also proved \u201cunsuccessful\u201d and caused \u201csome damage to the cassette format.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The prosecutor also informed the court that he and defense counsel \u201chad the actual CD itself\u201d that morning, and \u201ctried to play it\u201d on a court computer, but they were \u201cunable to do [so],\u201d despite the aid of \u201cone of the resident computer gurus in the courthouse.... \u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">[THE COURT]: Well, I mean I would certainly want to know why this CD can\u2019t be played.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, Your Honor, I don\u2019t know. I mean I know\u2014I believe that we made the best good faith efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>we can make to try to get it into a posture of playing it for the Court and counsel. I\u2019m saying, you know, it\u2019s kind of like any other evidence that in the absence occurred, and the question is is there an explanation for the absence. I\u2019ve given the Court the explanation that has been given to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiq\">[THE COURT]: I understand that. That\u2019s all you have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4l\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, all I\u2019m saying is that at this point it appears that someplace in the process, I mean\u2014and I\u2019m only assuming now, but it appears someplace in the process, in essence, that CD was destroyed from the perspective of not being able to play it back. I got a physical CD and, again, [defense counsel] and I both handled that thing trying to get it to play ... but we haven\u2019t been able to do that.... [M]y position would be that there\u2019s no, there\u2019s no inference that could be drawn adverse to the State simply because we have been unable to produce that CD.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Defense counsel acknowledged that he had spoken \u201cdirectly\u201d with the \u201ccomputer guru in the courthouse,\u201d and \u201cit appeared\u201d that the CD was \u201cabsolutely blank.\u201d Nevertheless, he argued: \u201c[I]t\u2019s the defendant\u2019s position in this case that there is evidence out there that\u2019s available; it just is the state has placed it into a format that they can\u2019t reproduce it for us to look at. -As a result of that, I\u2019m severely\u2014my client is severely prejudiced.\u201d The court replied: \u201cYou have a right\u2014 the law is clear, it\u2019s considered the best evidence rule and it\u2019s going to be\u2014if you want it in, it\u2019s going to be the [Sjtate\u2019s burden to show and prove by evidence that it can\u2019t be used----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The court indicated that it wanted \u201cto hear evidence from the [S]tate [police] about why that thing is not available.\u201d Then, the court recessed to allow the State to procure an \u201cexternal drive,\u201d which the prosecutor thought might enable him to play the digital recording. Although the drive was brought to court, the State was still unable to play the recording. The prosecutor explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">... First Sergeant Davis of the Maryland State Police brought up here to Cecil County an external drive, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>was thought to be able to play the DVD. I might add First Sergeant Davis doesn\u2019t have any expertise in computers. He was simply the chauffeur for bringing that up here, Your Honor. Again, I apologize. So, First Sergeant has no computer expertise. He brought the drive up here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">We went upstairs to the computer personnel for the county; and Chris, the head of the computer operations, has indicated that he\u2019s tried every way possible to actually view this DVD today and it just can\u2019t be done. We\u2019re not sure whether it\u2019s the external drive, whether it\u2019s the DVD itself, but in any event, it\u2019s impossible to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Accordingly, Trooper Spinner was recalled. He testified that, at the time of the traffic stop, his vehicle was equipped with a recording device known as \u201cCustom electronics digital eyewitness, which records on a DVD RAM.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It records \u201cboth visual and audio.\u201d The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: You\u2019re aware that when we were here for court on the motions hearing the last time around, you indicated that you were unable to play that DVD on a standard computer DVD drive; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Subsequent to that hearing did you have occasion to deliver that CD or DVD to other Maryland State Police personnel for purposes of copying it on to a medium that we could use here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: That\u2019s correct, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdO\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Now, once you delivered that, the only other information you have about it is what was related to you by others; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. What were you told, though, with respect to what had occurred with that DVD?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>[TROOPER SPINNER]: I was told that the DVD was taken to headquarters and that they were unable to make a copy of it there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Was there any indication as to why they were unable to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: No, there was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZU\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Excuse me. The DVD that we\u2019re talking about here, have you had occasion to actually look at that DVD; that is, to see the images recorded on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8W\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: I have viewed them only in my patrol car while the DVD was still in the recording unit in my trunk. Since it has been changed out, I\u2019ve not viewed it since then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">In my patrol car I have the ability to rewind and play it again to view what\u2019s been previously recorded, so I did so with this stop. And since then I have not viewed this particular stop in the external drive, you know, in any other manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">I did see it playing [in the patrol car] because I took notes from that reference to my report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: And now today\u2014I\u2019m sorry, backing up. Once you had turned that DVD over to other [Maryland State Police] personnel to try to copy, did there come a time when you got back your original DVD?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you have that with you today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV3\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: And have we attempted today to try to view that through the media players available within the courthouse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">[TROOPER SPINNER]: Yes, we have. We tried not only the court computers here at the Circuit Court, we also tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>attaching the external drive that was relayed up here by First Sergeant Davis, and all those attempts were unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">According to Spinner, the DVD recording began within seconds of when Spinner activated his emergency equipment to effectuate the traffic stop of Cabral\u2019s vehicle. Spinner testified that the recording would have shown his communications, the arrival of Connor and Catalano, their communications with the occupants of the vehicle, as well as the K-9 scan by Bruno. The recording also was time stamped, so that it would have shown the times associated with the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">After Spinner testified, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuH\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, well, I would ask if Mr. Riddle is willing to stipulate that he accompanied us upstairs through the attempts to view this through the computer people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">[THE COURT]: Then you don\u2019t have to call them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaz\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yeah, oh, I agree with you; I was upstairs with him. Chris, the person that was the tech guy up there, did all that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">[THE COURT]: Okay. Computer people up there and they couldn\u2019t play it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Appellee\u2019s counsel then moved to strike the troopers\u2019 testimony, on the ground that the recording was the best evidence of the stop, and would have revealed whether appellee was following a vehicle too closely; the communications between the officers; and the time frame from the stop to the K-9 scan. Appellee\u2019s counsel also asked the court to suppress \u201cthe stop of the vehicle, the search of the vehicle, and any statements my client gave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In response, the State asserted \u201cthat [the] videotape or DVD recording of a stop is not the best evidence. That is supplemental evidence to what he testified to from the stand.\u201d Further, the State argued: \u201cThe best evidence rule is that if you can\u2019t produce the best evidence available in the way of documentary evidence, that if you can show the reason for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>absence of that best evidence, then you can go ahead with the secondary evidence.\u201d Moreover, the State noted that there are instances when the \u201cequipment doesn\u2019t work, is muffled or is not clear,\u201d or \u201cpeople block the view of some of the things that are going on around a vehicle in these types of stops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The court ruled from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">Well, here\u2019s what I find is that the best evidence rule in this case would be the tape. And not through any fault of [the prosecutor] and, from what I\u2019ve heard, no fault of Trooper Spinner, that CD is not available to the Court, and there\u2019s been absolutely no reason given about why it\u2019s not available. That was given to third parties and in the state police. They\u2019ve had plenty of time\u2014and I know [the prosecutor] put something on about this before. They\u2019ve had plenty of time to come up here and explain exactly what happened, why that CD will not operate. I get no explanation at all other than the fact it won\u2019t operate. And I can\u2019t, certainly can\u2019t blame [the prosecutor] or Trooper Spinner. They\u2019re not computer geniuses and neither is the first sergeant, but that is the best evidence. And the next thing here, I just have no reason at all for it not being able to be played.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">The next thing here is kind of a, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessary of [sic] the outcome of the case, but the testimony of the K-9 handler is that the K-9 alerted. And he\u2019s only had one year experience; can be based on either drugs being there or drugs having been there in the last 72 hours, and there\u2019s not one iota of evidence to indicate any difference between how the dog alerts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">And I\u2019ll say for future cases, because it\u2019s not before me in this case, but there\u2019s been testimony by other officers that a dog alerts to a lot of other things besides this, too. I don\u2019t find under these circumstances that the K-9 or the handler are even experts, because although they weren\u2019t\u2014wasn\u2019t required in detail, but it was somewhat, they don\u2019t know what the dog will alert to, what it will not alert to, what other kind of substances can cause the alert, and other troopers have testified in other cases that just legal drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>with opiates in them can cause alert. I just think it\u2019s something the state police need to take up with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">And I don\u2019t find under those circumstances that either the trooper or the dog under those circumstances are experts in being able to tell are [sic] there drugs presently available, are present in the vehicle at the time of the alert. And based on that, I\u2019m granting the motion for\u2014the motion to suppress evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">After the court ruled, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoE\">[PROSECUTOR]: If I may, Your Honor. Again, I would ask that [defense counsel] stipulate to this: The computer people upstairs were unable to offer any explanation as to why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">[THE COURT]: Is that correct, [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axh\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right.

Accordingly, probable cause existed to search Cabral\u2019s vehicle.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">According to the State, the suppression court\u2019s ruling was erroneously premised \u201con the concept that Bruno could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>alerted based on residual odor.\u201d In its view, probable cause was not undermined merely because the dog might have alerted to a residual odor. The State argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">Ultimately, the rule that should have been applied by the trial court in this case is the simplest and easiest to apply. If a trained drug dog alerts on a vehicle, that <em>ipso facto </em>establishes probable cause which will authorize a warrant-less search of that vehicle. Thus, the trial court clearly erred when it ruled that Bruno\u2019s alert did not amount to probable cause to search the vehicle. Cabral\u2019s motion to suppress should have been denied and reversal is required.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In a footnote in its brief, the State addresses the best evidence issue, claiming that the suppression court \u201calso erred when it ruled that the video recording of the stop was the \u2018best evidence\u2019----\u201d According to the State, the best evidence rule does not apply here, because the purpose of the best evidence rule is to require the production of an original writing when the terms of the writing are material. In its view, \u201cthe video simply added weight to the officer\u2019s testimony concerning the stop, and the State was not seeking to prove the contents of the video.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Cabral insists that the court below based its decision on the best evidence rule, and that \u201cthe Court\u2019s mention of the reliability of a K-9 alert was dicta.\u201d Moreover, he maintains that \u201c[i]t was proper for the Motions Court not to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>secondary evidence in this case.... \u201d Appellee explains: \u201cThe fact is that at one time there was a recording of the stop and that the State Police failed to provide the necessary equipment that was available to them for the recording to be viewed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Cabral also contends that \u201cthere is a serious question of reliability as to what the dog may or may not alert to,\u201d because of the possibility that the dog alerted to a residual odor. Given the \u201ctestimony that the dog would detect if there had been drugs in the car or on someone in the car up to 72 hours of the sniff,\u201d Cabral maintains that \u201cthe reliability of a positive drug dog sniff\u2019 was \u201cseriously undermine[d].\u201d He adds: \u201c[l]n a case such as this where the positive K-9 sniff provides almost all the basis for the probable cause, the reliability of the dog and the sniff are of the utmost importance.\u201d Appellee thus \u201curges the Court to evaluate its position on the reliability of the K-9 sniff in light of the fact that the dog can give a false positive based on residual odors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to a suppression motion is based solely on the record of the suppression hearing. <em>Dashiell v.

To be sure, one of the factors in the \u201cprobable cause puzzle\u201d concerns the staleness of the information on which the claim of probable cause is based. <em>See West v.

The appellate court declined to adopt the trial court\u2019s suggestion \u201cthat a dog alert, by itself, does not constitute probable cause to search a detained vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The <em>Carlson </em>court concluded that, \u201conce a trained drug dog alerts to the odor of drugs from a lawfully detained vehicle, an officer has probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also dismissed the trial court\u2019s concern as to a possible alert to a \u201cstale odor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Characterizing the \u201cstale odor argument\u201d as \u201cfanciful but unpersuasive,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court stated that \u201cthe test for staleness is whether the available information justifies a conclusion that contraband is <em>probably </em>on the person or premises to be searched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(emphasis in Carlson). Moreover, the court was of the view that \u201c \u2018there is no arbitrary time limit on how old information ... can be.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><em>United States v. Johnson, </em>660 F.2d 21 (2d Cir.1981) (per curiam), is also instructive. There, the defendant claimed that the drug dog\u2019s alert did not create probable cause to support the issuance of a search warrant for his luggage. <em>Id. </em>at 22. He argued that the dog was \u201cincapable of distinguishing between the actual presence of drugs in a container and the residual odor when the controlled substances are no longer there....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Second Circuit rejected that contention as a misapprehension of the concept of probable cause. It said, <em>id. </em>at 22-23:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">[Ajppellant\u2019s argument with respect to the problem of a dog detecting only the residual odors as opposed to the drugs themselves misconstrues the probable cause requirement. Absolute certainty is not required by the Fourth Amendment. What is required is a reasonable belief that a crime has been or is being committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\"><em>See also State v. Braendle, </em>134 Idaho 173, 997 P.2d 634, 637 (App.2000) (upholding warrantless vehicle search because \u201cthe police possessed probable cause to believe there was contraband in the vehicle\u201d, despite the fact that drug dog had previously given false positive reactions in response to residual odor of drugs); <em>Dawson v. State, </em>238 Ga.App. 263, 518 S.E.2d 477, 481 (1999) (finding that \u201cthere was significant evidence of [dog\u2019s] reliability and training\u201d in detecting drugs, and observing that \u201cthere is no way to verify whether the dog actually detected a residual odor of contraband or whether it made a false alert\u201d). <em>But see Matheson, supra, </em>870 So.2d at 14 (\u201c[W]e conclude that the fact that a dog has been trained and certified, standing alone, is insufficient to give officers probable cause to search based on the dog\u2019s alert.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701 (5th Cir.2003), the Fifth Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress where a trained drug dog alerted to luggage found to contain PCP, despite the fact that the dog was not trained to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>detect PCP. The court stated: \u201cThat the suitcase the canine alerted to later turned out to contain PCP, a drug the dog was not trained to detect, simply does not vitiate the agent\u2019s reasonable suspicion under these facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704. <em>See also United States v. Robinson, </em>707 F.2d 811, 815 (4th Cir.1983) (rejecting defendant\u2019s claim that dog\u2019s alert to package did not constitute probable cause, because dog was not trained to detect the substances in the package; \u201c[The drug dog\u2019s] initial detection ... was sufficient to establish probable cause for a search for controlled substances\u2014the fact that a different controlled substance was actually discovered does not vitiate the legality of the search\u201d); <em>United States v. McCranie, </em>703 F.2d 1213, 1215, 1218 (10th Cir.1983) (holding that the \u201csignals\u201d given by dog trained to detect explosives, not drugs, nevertheless gave rise to reasonable suspicion that the defendant\u2019s luggage contained contraband and police properly held luggage pending application for search warrant), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 484, 78 L.Ed.2d 680 (1983); <em>United States v. Viera, </em>644 F.2d 509, 511 (5th Cir.1981) (challenging denial of motion to suppress quaaludes found in suitcases, because dogs were trained to detect other drugs; \u201cIt is true that the [drug] dogs were not trained to react to quaaludes, and that the discovery of the quaaludes can in this respect be characterized as fortuitous. However, that conclusion is not grounds for suppression of the evidence.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 867, 102 S.Ct. 332, 70 L.Ed.2d 169 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">These cases lead us to conclude that Cabral is \u201cbarking up the wrong tree.\u201d He has confused probable cause with proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If a trained drug dog has the ability to detect the presence of drugs that are no longer physically present in the vehicle or container, but were present perhaps as long as 72 hours prior to the alert, such an ability serves to strengthen the argument that the dog has a superior sense of smell on which to rely to support a finding of probable cause. The possibility that the contraband may no longer be present in the vehicle does not compel the finding that there is no probable cause; for purposes of the probable cause analysis, we are concerned with probability, not certain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ty. The issue of a possible alert to a residual odor is a factor to be considered by the trial court, but it is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">We are reminded of what Judge Moylan wrote in <em>Fitzgerald, </em>recognizing the reliability of a trained drug dog.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\u201c[T]he instant court sees a positive alert from a law enforcement dog trained and certified to detect narcotics as inherently more reliable than an informant\u2019s tip. Unlike an informant, the canine is trained and certified to perform what is best described as a physical skill. The personal and financial reasons and interest typically behind an informant\u2019s decision to cooperate can hardly be equated with what drives a canine to perform for its trainer. The reliability of an informant is really a matter of forming an opinion on the informant\u2019s credibility either from past experience or from independent corroboration. With a canine, the reliability should come from the fact that the dog is trained and annually certified to perform a physical skill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4J\"><em>Fitzgerald, </em>153 Md.App. at 637, 837 A.2d 989 (quoting <em>United States v. Wood, </em>915 F.Supp. 1126, 1136 n. 2 (D.Kan.1996))(italics omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court erred in finding that there was no probable cause because Bruno might have alerted to the presence of an illegal drug that was in the vehicle as much as 72 hours before the alert.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">We turn to consider the court\u2019s best evidence ruling. As we indicated, it was predicated on the State\u2019s inability to play Trooper Spinner\u2019s recording of the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Appellee maintains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">Here, the State cannot say that the recording was not made available and then destroyed without fault. The State police failed to provide the equipment necessary to play the recording in the first instance. The State Police then destroyed the only copy of the recording due to their negligence in attempting to transfer the medium of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>recording. Would it not have been advisable to make a copy of the recording before attempting to transfer it\u2019s [sic] contents onto another medium. It follows that the State Police is an agent of the State\u2019s Attorney and them fault and negligence is imputed to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Cabral contends that the State\u2019s failure to produce the recording prejudiced him and denied him due process, in that \u201c[t]he tape would show the basis for the initial stop, the duration of the stop, whether the drug dog alerted, whether any statements were made etc.\u201d Further, Cabral maintains that \u201cthe destruction of the tape was in effect a suppression of exculpatory evidence.\u201d He states: \u201cThe tape was material evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In our factual summary, we reviewed at length what occurred in regard to the recording. The record reveals that, at the March 2004 hearing, the State produced a recording of the traffic stop but was unable to play it, either because of a defect in the recording or in the equipment used to play it.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The Court of Appeals has \u201clong recognized that the Best Evidence Rule is applicable in criminal cases in Maryland.\u201d <em>Carter v. State, </em>367 Md. 447, 469, 788 A.2d 646 (2002) (Raker, J., dissenting). The requirements of the best evidence rule are found in Maryland Rules 5-1001 through 5-1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Maryland Rule 5-1001(a) provides, in pertinent part: \u201c Writings\u2019 and \u2018recordings\u2019 consist of letters, words, numbers, or their equivalent, set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic or optical impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, or other form of data compilation.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-1002 provides: \u201cTo prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Maryland Rule 5-1004 is also relevant. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">The contents of a writing, recording, or photograph may be proved by evidence other than the original if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>(a) Original lost or destroyed. All originals are lost or have been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">(b) Original not obtainable. No original can be obtained by any reasonably practicable, available judicial process or procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">(c) Original in possession of opponent. At a time when an original was under the control of the party against whom offered, that party was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing or trial, and that party does not produce the original at the hearing or trial; or (d) Collateral matters. The writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In addition, C.J. \u00a7 10-102 is pertinent. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014If a business, institution, member of a profession or calling, or a department or agency of government, in the regular course of business or activity has kept or recorded a memorandum, writing, entry, print, representation, or a combination of them, of an act, transaction, occurrence, or event, and in the regular course of business has caused any or all of them to be recorded, copied, or reproduced by a photographic, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic, optical imaging, or other process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for so reproducing the original, the original may be destroyed in the regular course of business unless its preservation is required by law. The reproduction, when satisfactorily identified, is as admissible in evidence as the original itself in a judicial or administrative proceeding whether the original is in existence or not and an enlargement or facsimile of the reproduction is likewise admissible in evidence if the original reproduction is in existence and available for inspection under direction of the court. The introduction of a reproduced record, enlargement, or facsimile does not preclude admission of the original.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(b) <em>Uniformity of </em>interpretation.\u2014This section shall be interpreted and construed to effectuate its general purpose of making uniform the law of those states which enact it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">(c) <em>Short </em>title.\u2014This section may be cited as the Maryland Uniform Photographic Copies of Business and Public Records as Evidence Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">As Professor McLain has explained in her treatise, the best evidence rule \u201cis misleadingly named, as it is not a general requirement that each party present only the \u2018best evidence\u2019 available on every point, so as to preclude other probative evidence.\u201d 6A L. McLain, Maryland Evidence, \u00a7 1001:1, at 535 (2001). What this Court said in <em>Cooper v. </em>State, 41 Md.App. 392, 398, 397 A.2d 245 (1979), is also noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av8\">The Best Evidence Rule states a <em>preference </em>for original documents, but does not foreclose use of secondary evidence \u201cafter a proper foundation has been laid, showing good and sufficient reasons for the failure to produce the primary evidence.\u201d <em>Forrester v. State, </em>224 Md. 337, 349, 167 A.2d 878, 884 (1961). The issue usually arises when the original document has been lost or destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Appellee cites <em>Green v. State, </em>25 Md.App. 679, 337 A.2d 729, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 749 (1975), to support his position. It does not advance his cause. In <em>Green, </em>the appellant asked: \u201c \u2018Did the Court err in admitting a typewritten copy of an alleged \u201ccorrected\u201d statement of Louis Irvin, an alleged co-conspirator, and did not require instead the playing of a tape recorded version of said statement, which was the \u201cbest evidence\u201d in the case?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 337 A.2d 729 (footnote omitted). The <em>Green </em>Court said: \u201cAppellant inaccurately employs the term \u2018best evidence\u2019 which, in its classic application, treats only documentary evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The <em>Green </em>Court relied on <em>Forrester v. State, </em>224 Md. 337, 167 A.2d 878 (1961). There, the appellant, a police officer, was \u201cconvicted of malfeasance in office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 167 A.2d 878. An inspector was asked to testify that a tape \u201cwas a dictation recording tape (dictabelt) and a permanent record of the Police Department, made in the normal course of business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>said Department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348-49, 167 A.2d 878. The tape, which \u201crecorded wire-tapped conversations\u201d, was previously played in the inspector\u2019s presence and reproduced. <em>Id. </em>at 348, 167 A.2d 878. He was asked to relate the conversations, but the State\u2019s objection was sustained. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 167 A.2d 878. The Court concluded that there was no error, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">Since the tape that was obtained by wire tapping was not made in the presence of the Inspector and he did not claim to recognize any of the voices heard therefrom, his answer to the question, if permitted to be given, would obviously have been hearsay. <em>And, as no effort was made to produce the original tape, nor any explanation offered for its non-production-, the answer called for, if allowed, would have violated the best evidence rule. </em>The best evidence of which the case is capable must be produced, and <em>secondary, or inferior, evidence is only admissible after a, proper foundation has been laid, showing good and sufficient reasons for the failure to produce the primary evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We need not resolve whether the best evidence rule applies here. We shall assume, instead, that it does. Appellee concedes that \u201c \u2018oral testimony or other secondary evidence of the terms of the writing\u2019 \u201d may be \u201c \u2018offered as a substitute for the original\u2019 \u201d if \u201c \u2018the proponent can demonstrate an adequate reason for the non-production of the original.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted). As we see it, that was precisely the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u201cCarelessness, recklessness, ordinary negligence, and even gross negligence are all satisfactory explanations\u201d for the absence of an original. Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 1104(B)(3), at 461 (3d ed.1999). On the other hand, \u201c[ijntentional destruction to gain an unfair advantage is obviously not a sufficient excuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the record amply demonstrates that the State made repeated, good faith efforts to play the recording, albeit without success. Despite the State\u2019s diligent effort to play the recording, it was unable to overcome the unknown technological problems. There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>no suggestion, however, of any intentional misconduct or bad faith on the part of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We conclude that if the testimony as to the stop would have been sufficient to demonstrate probable cause, it is no less so merely because the recording did not function as intended. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress on the basis of the best evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY REVERSED.
