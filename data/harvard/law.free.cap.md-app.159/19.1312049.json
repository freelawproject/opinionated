Knott died, her Last Will and Testament named, as personal representatives of her estate, two of her children, appellees Patricia K. Smyth<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Francis X. Knott, and, among other things, left her \u201ctangible personal property\u201d to her ten surviving children. In dispute is the fate of that property and its implications for the standing of the decedent\u2019s other children to request judicial probate. If, as appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Smyth and Knott contend, that property was adeemed, before her death, appellants, who comprise six of the decedent\u2019s eight other children, had no standing to file a petition for judicial probate, and the decision of the orphans\u2019 court, dismissing that petition on those grounds, must be affirmed. But if, as appellants claim, the ademption of that property was in dispute at the time that their petition was dismissed, then appellants did have standing, and the orphans\u2019 court erred in dismissing their petition for judicial probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">This matter commenced when, upon Mrs. Knott\u2019s death, appellees Smyth and Knott filed a petition for administration of a small estate, together with the decedent\u2019s Will and First Codicil (collectively, the \u201cWill\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the Register of Wills for Baltimore City. The only asset of the estate, according to the petition, was a bank account, containing a little less than $13,000. No tangible personal property was listed. After admitting the Will to probate and appointing appellees, Smyth and Knott, as personal representatives of the estate, the register of wills sent notice of the appointment to all \u201cinterested persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In response to that notice, seven of decedent\u2019s other children: Martin G. Knott, Sr.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and appellants Marion Knott McIntyre, Alice K. Voelkel, Margaret K. Riehl, Mary Stuart K. Rodgers, Sarah Lindsay K. Harris, and Rose Marie Porter, filed a petition for judicial probate in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore City, requesting, among other things, a plenary hearing and the appointment of an independent personal representative to conduct an investigation into whether the actions purportedly taken by the decedent or by others on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>behalf or on behalf of her estate \u201cwere in accord with her intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Appellees filed a response to that petition, requesting that the orphans\u2019 court dismiss appellants\u2019 petition and re-appoint them as personal representatives, as their administrative appointment ended, in accordance with ET \u00a7 6-307,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when appellants filed their Petition for Judicial Probate. That response was followed by a motion to dismiss appellants\u2019 petition for judicial probate, in which appellees, for the first time, sought dismissal on the grounds that appellants were no longer \u201cinterested persons\u201d under the Will and therefore, under Maryland law, lacked standing to request judicial probate. The orphans\u2019 court agreed, granted appellees\u2019 motion, and dismissed appellants\u2019 petition for judicial probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Challenging that ruling, appellants present two issues for our review. Reordered, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">I. Whether the orphans\u2019 court erred when it held that appellants did not qualify as heirs under the definition of \u201cinterested persons\u201d as set forth in section 1-101(i)(4) of the Estates and Trusts Article and as a result did not have standing to file the Petition for Judicial Probate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">II. Whether the orphans\u2019 court erred when it held that appellants did not qualify as legatees under the definition of \u201cinterested persons,\u201d as set forth in section 1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>101(i)(3) of the Estates and Trusts Article and as a result did not have standing to file the Petition for Judicial Probate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment of the orphans\u2019 court and remand this matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Marion I. Knott, a Baltimore City resident, died testate on April 15, 2003. Before her death, in 1994, she executed both the will at issue and a power of attorney authorizing Patricia K. Smyth and Patricia\u2019s now-deceased brother, Henry J. Knott, Jr., to create a revocable trust on the decedent\u2019s behalf. According to appellants, the decedent was to be the sole beneficiary of that trust, and upon her death, the assets were to be payable to her estate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In her Will, the decedent left all of her \u201ctangible personal property\u201d to her surviving children. The property included her \u201cfurniture and furnishings, household and personal effects,\u201d and was to be divided \u201camong them in shares nearly equal in value as practicable.\u201d She left the balance of her estate to the Marion I. and Henry J. Knott Foundation, Inc. (the \u201cFoundation\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and named two of her children, Henry J. Knott, Jr. and Patricia K. Smyth, as the personal representatives of her estate. She further provided in her Will that if Henry J. Knott, Jr. were to predecease her that Francis X. Knott was to serve as co-personal representative in his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Shortly after Decedent\u2019s death, appellees Smyth and Francis Knott (Henry J. Knott, Jr. having passed away) filed a petition, requesting administrative probate of a small estate, with the Register of Wills for Baltimore City. The decedent\u2019s estate qualified as a small estate, they claimed, because its only estate asset was a checking account containing $12,344. In that petition, they also requested that they be appointed, in accordance with the terms of the Will, personal representatives of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">After admitting the Will to administrative probate and appointing Smyth and Knott as personal representatives of the estate, the register of wills published, in a newspaper of general circulation, as required by Md.Code (1974, 2001 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 7-103 of the Estates and Trusts Article (\u201cET\u201d), notice of the appointment of appellees as personal representatives and sent a copy of that notice, as required by ET \u00a7 2-210, to appellants, as \u201cinterested persons\u201d under ET \u00a7 l-101(i). In response to that notice, appellants, as \u201cinterested persons,\u201d filed a petition for judicial probate in the Orphans Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Appellants\u2019 judicial probate petition requested \u201cthe appointment of an independent person selected by the Court to serve as Personal Representative of the Estate for purposes of conducting an independent investigation to assure that all actions taken by or on behalf of the Decedent, during her lifetime and on behalf of her estate, after her death, were in accord with her intent, without violation of a confidential relationship and without self-dealing or other conflict.\u201d The petition also \u201cdemand[ed] a plenary hearing to determine testamentary capacity of the decedent, the validity and proper execution of the Will and Codicil, and for the appointment of an independent Personal Representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">After filing their petition for judicial probate, appellants sent appellees interrogatories and requests for production of documents, seeking information regarding the decedent\u2019s testamentary capacity; her execution of the will; the assets of her estate, including her tangible personal property; her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>revocable trust; and any \u201cgift, distribution, transfer, exchange, [or] other disposition of any type\u201d that appellees received from the decedent before her death. When appellees failed to respond to those requests, appellants moved for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Before the orphans\u2019 court ruled on that motion, appellees filed a response to appellants\u2019 petition, challenging its propriety, and, shortly after that, a motion to dismiss, disputing appellants\u2019 standing to request judicial probate. The orphans\u2019 court granted that motion, stating, in a written opinion, that appellants had \u201cfailed to show that they [were] Interested Parties to the Estate\u201d and \u201cthus that they ha[d] standing to bring the Petition for Judicial Probate.\u201d It then dismissed appellants\u2019 petition and upheld the register\u2019s order admitting the decedent\u2019s Will to administrative probate and appointing Smyth and Knott as personal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Appellants contend that the orphans\u2019 court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss their petition for judicial probate on the grounds that they were not \u201cinterested persons,\u201d as either heirs or legatees, and therefore, did not have standing to file a petition for judicial probate. Although appellees designated their motion as a \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d and the orphans court not only accepted that designation but then \u201cdismissed\u201d appellants\u2019 petition, the question arises whether the court\u2019s references to facts, which did not appear in any of the pleadings filed by the parties, transformed its disposition of appellants\u2019 petition from a dismissal to a grant of summary judgment. If it did, that would, of course, affect the standard of review we apply and, in this instance, the result we reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Initially, we note that, under the Maryland rules, the orphans\u2019 court has the authority to dismiss a petition for judicial probate for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, in accordance with Rules 2-322(b)(2) and 6\u2014461(d), or to grant summary judgment, in accordance with Rules 2-501 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>and 6-46l(b). Appellees chose to seek a dismissal of appellants\u2019 petition under Rule 2-322(b). Claiming that appellants had no standing to request judicial probate, appellees asked the orphans\u2019 court to dismiss appellants\u2019 petition. The court granted that request and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In so ruling, the court relied on unsworn representations in appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss that the \u201ctangible personal property\u201d that appellants were to inherit as legatees under the Will, had been transferred by the decedent, before her death, to the revocable trust established for her by appellees. Concluding that appellants\u2019 only interest in the estate\u2014the decedent\u2019s tangible personal property\u2014had been adeemed, the court dismissed appellants\u2019 petition for lack of standing, without apparently considering appellants\u2019 contrary claim that the property had never been transferred to the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Asking this Court to nonetheless affirm the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s ruling, appellees argue that it was entirely appropriate for that court, in granting their motion to dismiss, to go beyond the four corners of the petition for judicial probate and to consider extra-pleading sources. Relying on certain federal decisions, <em>Phillips v. LCI Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>190 F.3d 609, 618 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Parrino v. FHP, Inc. </em>146 F.3d 699, 706 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Watterson v. Page, </em>987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.1993), they assert that \u201cit is widely recognized that where, as here, the initial pleading references a document that is integral to that initial pleading, a court may consider that document within the context of a motion to dismiss, even if the document is not attached to the pleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We agree that the court may consider such a document but disagree that such consideration may be done within the context of a motion to dismiss. While a court does indeed have the discretion to consider matters beyond the four corners of a complaint, when it does, it \u201ctransmut\u00e9is] the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hosp. Ctr., Inc., </em>93 Md.App. 772, 789, 614 A.2d 1021 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In <em>Hrehorovich, </em>Dr. Hrehorovich, a <em>former member of </em>Harbor Hospital\u2019s medical staff, filed a complaint against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>hospital, alleging, among other things, breach of contract and wrongful discharge. <em>Id. </em>at 778, 614 A.2d 1021. In that complaint, he referred to specific provisions of the \u201cMedical Staff Bylaws\u201d and the \u201cEmployee Policy Manual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779, 614 A.2d 1021. In response, Harbor Hospital filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, citing other provisions in those documents. <em>Id. </em>at 779-80, 614 A.2d 1021. When the circuit court granted that motion, <em>id. </em>at 778, 614 A.2d 1021, Hrehorovich noted an appeal, arguing, among other things, that, in granting the hospital\u2019s motion to dismiss, the circuit court erred in relying on \u201cthe facts set forth by appellees that went beyond [his] complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779, 614 A.2d 1021. \u201c[S]uch consideration,\u201d he maintained, \u201cis not proper for a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780, 614 A.2d 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The hospital, on the other hand, argued, as appellees do now, that \u201cthe trial court could properly examine the documents that form the basis for appellant\u2019s complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]hey had the right,\u201d the hospital insisted, \u201cto \u2018complete\u2019 the pleading by providing additional portions of the documents relied on by [Hrehorovich].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected that reasoning but not the right of the court to consider documents outside of the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Citing Maryland Rule 2-322(c), we held that the circuit court did not err in considering those documents, but that, in doing so, it had transformed a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 789, 614 A.2d 1021. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">If, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a clam upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 2-501, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 2-501.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Md. Rule 2-322(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Although framing its ruling in terms of a motion to dismiss, the orphans\u2019 court considered, as did the trial court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Hrehomvich, </em>matters presented by extra-pleadings sources and thereby turned a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Hrehorovich, </em>93 Md.App. at 789, 614 A.2d 1021. Accordingly, we shall review the orphans\u2019 court ruling as a grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The standard for reviewing a grant of summary judgment requires us to \u201cdetermine if there is a genuine dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Crews v. Hollenbach, </em>126 Md.App. 609, 624, 730 A.2d 742 (1999), <em>aff'd, </em>358 Md. 627, 751 A.2d 481 (2000). If, after construing all facts and reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, we conclude that a genuine dispute as to a material fact exists, we must vacate the grant of summary judgment. <em>See Bank of N.Y. v. Sheff </em>382 Md. 235, 244, 854 A.2d 1269, 1275 (2004). In this instance, we find that such a dispute does exist and shall therefore vacate the judgment of the orphans\u2019 court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Administrative and Judicial Probate</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Because substance without its procedural context can be confusing, if not misleading, we begin our analysis of this standing dispute by placing it within its procedural context. To do so, we shall briefly outline the differences between administrative and judicial probate and the rules that govern standing to participate in either proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Administrative probate \u201c[i]s a proceeding instituted by the filing of a petition for probate by an interested person before the register for the probate of a will or a determination of the intestacy of the decedent, and for the appointment of a personal representative.\u201d ET \u00a7 5-301. Such proceedings \u201cmay be conducted without notice, to the extent provided in \u00a7 5-304, subject to the right of an interested person to require judicial probate....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Judicial probate is \u201ca proceeding instituted by the filing of a petition for probate by an interested person, or creditor, with the court for the probate of a will or a determination of the intestacy of the decedent, and for the appointment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>personal representative.\u201d ET \u00a7 5-401. It \u201cis conducted after notice as provided in \u00a7 5-403, and is final except as provided in ET \u00a7 5-406.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the principal difference between the two forms of probate is that the former is an administrative proceeding before the register of wills while the latter is a judicial proceeding before the orphans\u2019 court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In conducting judicial probate, the orphans\u2019 court may hold plenary proceedings, ET \u00a7 5-404(b), call witnesses, ET \u00a7 2-102(a), and resolve issues of fact, ET \u00a7 2-105(a). After doing so, the orphans\u2019 court \u201cshall determine the testamentary capacity of the decedent if he died testate,\u201d and \u201cshall appoint one or more personal representatives.\u201d ET \u00a7 5-404(a). If appropriate, the court may \u201crevoke, modify, or confirm action taken at the administrative or any prior judicial probate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The Estates &amp; Trusts Article imposes limits on who has standing to file a petition for judicial probate: only \u201cinterested persons\u201d and creditors may file such a petition. ET \u00a7 5-402. An \u201cinterested person\u201d is defined by ET \u00a7 l-101(i) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">(1) A person named as executor in a will;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">(2) A person serving as personal representative after judicial or administrative probate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">(3) A legatee in being, not fully paid, whether his interest is vested or contingent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">(4) An heir even if the decedent dies testate, except that an heir of a testate decedent ceases to be an \u201cinterested person\u201d when the register has given notice pursuant to \u00a7 2-210 or \u00a7 5^03(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">And a \u201clegatee\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who under the terms of a will would receive a legacy,\u201d ET \u00a7 l-101(m), that is, \u201cany property disposed of by will.\u201d ET \u00a7 1\u2014101(Z). An heir, on the other hand, is defined as \u201ca person entitled to property of an intestate decedent.\u201d ET \u00a7 l-101(h). The orphans\u2019 court ruled that, under these subsections, appellants were without standing to file the petition as either heirs or legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Heirs</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Appellants claim that the orphans\u2019 court erred in ruling that, as heirs of a testate decedent, they were not \u201cinterested persons\u201d under ET \u00a7 l-101(i) with standing to request judicial probate, once the register of wills gave notice of probate and the appointment of the personal representatives, under ET \u00a7 <em>5-403. </em>They argue that, as heirs of the decedent, they were indeed interested parties, under ET \u00a7 1\u2014101(i)(4), and thus had standing to request judicial probate. They are at least correct in asserting that they are the decedent\u2019s heirs. An \u201cheir,\u201d under Maryland law, is \u201ca person entitled to property of an intestate decedent pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-101 through 3-110.\u201d ET \u00a7 l-101(h). Section 3-101 simply introduces the subtitle on intestate succession, while ET \u00a7 3-110 provides that certain heirs, who do not \u201csurvive the decedent by 30 full days ... shall be considered to have predeceased the decedent for purposes of intestate succession, and [are] not to be entitled to the rights of an heir.\u201d ET \u00a7 1-101(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">As the Decedent\u2019s children, or \u201cissues,\u201d <em>see </em>ET \u00a7 1-209, appellants would have been entitled to the decedent\u2019s property, had she died intestate. <em>See </em>ET \u00a7 3-103. Thus, appellants are indeed her heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">But that does not mean that they are <em>ipso facto </em>\u201cinterested persons\u201d with standing to seek judicial probate. Although an heir, upon the death of the decedent, is an interested person, he or she loses that status, according to ET \u00a7 1\u2014101(i)(4), \u201cwhen the register has given notice pursuant to \u00a7 2-210 or \u00a7 5-403(a).\u201d Section 2-210 requires that the heirs and legatees of an estate are to be given personal notice of the appointment of the estate\u2019s personal representatives by the register of wills, while ET \u00a7 5-403(a) prescribes when notice of judicial probate should be given to \u201call interested persons\u201d and in what form. \u201cAll persons having any objection to the appointment (or to the probate of the will of the decedent)\u201d by the register of wills must \u201cfile the same with the register of wills on or before six months from the date of the appointment.\u201d ET \u00a7 7-103(b). But, when small estates are involved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>that time period is reduced from six months to thirty days. ET \u00a7 5-603(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Here, the register of wills gave notice of probate and appellees\u2019 appointment as personal representatives in May 2003. On June 11, 2003, appellants, claiming to be \u201cinterested persons,\u201d filed their petition for judicial probate. Because appellants received their notice of probate and appointment of appellees as personal representatives before that time, the orphans\u2019 court, relying on ET \u00a7 1\u2014101(i)(4) (\u201ca testate decedent ceases to be an \u2018interested person\u2019 when the register has given notice pursuant to \u00a7 2-210----\u201d), concluded that appellants, as heirs, were no longer interested persons. That conclusion stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Section 1\u2014104(i)(4) plainly states that an heir\u2019s status as an interested person ends when the register of wills gives notice of probate and appointment of the personal representative. <em>See </em>ET \u00a7 1\u2014101(i)(4). And, given the clear and unambiguous language of that subsection, that ends our inquiry. As the Court of Appeals observed, \u201c[w]hen the words are clear and unambiguous, there is no need to search further.\u201d <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 38, 811 A.2d 297 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">While acknowledging that, if given a \u201cliteral\u201d reading, that subsection does provide that heirs cease to be \u201cinterested persons\u201d when the register of wills sends notice of probate and appointment, appellants insist that such a construction of ET \u00a7 1-101(4) is \u201cnonsensical.\u201d And, were they correct, we would be required to reject the orphans\u2019 court conclusion as every statute is entitled to \u201ca reasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical and incompatible with common sense.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 8, 629 A.2d 731 (1993); <em>see Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145, 626 A.2d 946 (1993). But they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Denying heirs standing to petition for judicial probate, once they receive notice of administrative probate, makes sense. If an heir is to receive nothing under the terms of a will offered for probate, he or she has no interest in the probate of that will and certainly no interest in petitioning the orphans\u2019 court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>to accept that document as a decedent\u2019s last will and testament. And that principle has been adopted, in one form or another, by other state courts, <em>see, e.g., Smith v. Negley, </em>304 S.W.2d 464, 468 (Tex.Ct.App.1957) (\u201cAn heir ... is interested only in opposition to the will.\u201d); <em>In re Aberman\u2019s Estate, </em>412 N.Y.S.2d 572 (N.Y.Surr.Ct.1979), and endorsed by at least one legal treatise. <em>See </em>95 C.J.S. <em>Wills </em>\u00a7 468 at 492 (2001) (\u201c[X]t is necessary that a person show that he or she has some interest in the matter before they will be allowed to become a proponent, since one who has no sufficient interest in the will or estate, such as a pecuniary interest which will be benefitted and affected by the probate of the will and one which will be materially impaired in the absence of its probate, cannot petition for probate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Similarly, a person who receives nothing under the terms of a will has no interest in the administration of the estate, including the appointment of the personal representative. <em>See, e.g., McClinton v. Sullivan, </em>263 Ga. 711, 438 S.E.2d 71, 73 (1994) (Having \u201cno legal right to be appointed administrator and no interest in the estate; [the petitioner has] no standing to challenge the probate court\u2019s appointment of the ... administrator.\u201d); <em>In re Alstock, </em>230 La. 167, 88 So.2d 14, 15 (1956) (\u201cThroughout our jurisprudence is the well-accepted principle that one without a pecuniary interest has no judicial standing to interfere with the administration of a succession.\u201d); <em>In re Lyons\u2019 Estate, </em>132 Cal.App.2d 790, 283 P.2d 66, 68 (1955) (\u201cOne must be a \u2018person interested\u2019 in the estate in order to oppose a petition for letters of administration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">That does not mean that, once they cease to be \u201cinterested persons,\u201d heirs of testate decedents are without means to protect any interests they may have in intestacy or a prior will. They still have the right to challenge the validity of the will by filing a petition to caveat under ET \u00a7 5-207. That section provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Regardless of whether a petition for probate has been filed, a verified petition to caveat a will may be filed at any time prior to the expiration of six months following the first appointment of a personal representative under a will, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>if there be a subsequent judicial probate or appointment of a personal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">ET \u00a7 5-207(a); In fact, \u201c[i]f the petition to caveat is filed before the filing of a petition for probate, or after administrative probate, it has the effect of a request for judicial probate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 (b). As heirs, that is, \u201cperson[s] entitled to property of an intestate decedent pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-101 through 3-110,\u201d ET \u00a7 1\u2014101(h), appellants probably<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had sufficient interest in the estate to petition to caveat. <em>See Sherman v. Robinson, </em>319 Md. 445, 448 n. 2, 573 A.2d 34 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Appellants further argue that appellees\u2019 \u201cliteral\u201d interpretation of ET \u00a7 1\u2014101(i)(4) conflicts with other notice provisions in the Estates &amp; Trusts Article, notably sections 2-210 and 7-103. Under those sections, once the register of wills has admitted a will to probate and appointed the personal representative, the register shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation notice of the appointment and send every heir and legatee of the decedent a copy of the newspaper notice. ET \u00a7 2-210. That notice must state that \u201c[a]ll persons having any objection to the appointment (or to probate of the will of the decedent) shall file the same with the register of wills on or before six months from the date of the appointment.\u201d ET \u00a7 7-103(b). When an estate qualifies as a \u201csmall estate,\u201d that is, an estate having \u201ca value of $30,000 or less as of the date of the death of the decedent,\u201d ET \u00a7 5-601(a), the period for objecting is shortened to thirty days from the date of the appointment. ET \u00a7 5-603(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Because the register of wills is required by statute to send notice of appointment to all heirs, as well as legatees, of a testate decedent, informing them that \u201call persons\u201d objecting to the appointment of the personal representative, or to the probate of the will, have six months (or thirty days) to object, appellants argue that the legislature could not have intended that the notice of appointment both cut off their rights to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>petition for judicial probate, by denying them \u201cinterested person\u201d status under ET \u00a7 1-101 (i)(4), while granting them rights to object to the validity of probate and the appointment of the personal representative under ET \u00a7 7\u2014103(b). While appellants\u2019 argument is inventive, taking advantage as it does of the not altogether tidy aspects of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article, it fails upon scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Section 2-210 does indeed require that a copy of the notice of appointment be sent to all heirs and legatees. And that notice, according to ET \u00a7 7-103, is to be sent to heirs of both testate and intestate decedents. It also notifies its recipients of the time in which \u201cpersons\u201d may object to the appointment of the personal representative and to the probate of the will. <em>Id. </em>The failure of that notice to be more specific and expressly indicate that not all recipients have standing to object to the probate of the will or to the appointment of the personal representative does not compel us to conclude that heirs of testate decedents, contrary to the plain language of ET \u00a7 1-101(i)(4), continue to be interested persons, with standing to object, after receiving such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It is also true, as appellants point out, that former Article 93, \u00a7 1\u2014101(f), which was drafted by the Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Law of Maryland (known as the \u201cHenderson Commission\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and enacted in 1969, provided that an heir of a testate decedent lost his or her status as an interested party, not when the register gave notice of administrative probate, but when those proceedings or judicial probate ended. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1969 Repl.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Vol.), Art. 93 \u00a7 1\u2014101(f)(3). Thus, under earlier Maryland law, an heir had standing to file a petition for judicial probate even after receiving notice of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">But, two years later, the statutory definition of an \u201cinterested person\u201d was revised to read, as it does now, that an \u201cinterested person\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">an heir even if decedent died testate except that an heir of a testate decedent ceases to be an \u201cinterested person\u201d <em>after the register has given notice pursuant to \u00a7 2-209 (unless judicial probate is requested thereafter and then after the register has given notice pursuant to \u00a7 5-403(a)).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Md.Code (1957, 1969 Repl.Vol., 1971 Cum.Supp.), Art. 93 \u00a7 1-101(f)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In changing the definition of \u201cinterested person,\u201d the legislature, it appears, simply neglected to make any corresponding changes to the form and content of the notice, set forth in ET \u00a7 7-103, to clarify that an heir, as one of several classes of persons receiving notice of the appointment, could not challenge the appointment of the personal representative or the administrative probate of the will under that subsection, after receiving notice of the appointment. Nothing can be read into that omission, given that it does not necessarily conflict with the plain language of ET \u00a7 1\u2014101(i)(4) and, even if it did, the notice set forth in ET \u00a7 7-103 pre-dates the revised definition of \u201cinterested person\u201d and therefore is amended by it. <em>See Bell v. State, </em>236 Md. 356, 365, 204 A.2d 54 (1964) (\u201c[A] subsequent independent statute, complete in itself, which alters or changes a prior act in such a way that the two are repugnant and cannot stand together, in whole or in part, effects a repeal or an amendment of the earlier act even though there is not [sic] reference whatever in the later act to the earlier.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Appellants further argue that the 1971 amendment was merely stylistic and was not intended to shorten the time in which heirs of testate decedents were \u201cinterested persons.\u201d But even a cursory comparison of the two provisions indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>that the changes made by legislature in the language of that section were substantive and not simply stylistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Legatees</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Appellants also contend that they are \u201clegatees\u201d under the terms of the decedent\u2019s Will and thus have standing as \u201cinterested persons\u201d to request judicial probate. The orphans\u2019 court found that claim no more persuasive than it did appellants\u2019 assertion that they had standing as the decedent\u2019s heirs. Concluding that appellants\u2019 bequests had been adeemed before the decedent\u2019s death, the court declared that appellants were no longer \u201clegatees\u201d and therefore had no standing, as legatees, to file for judicial probate. \u201cLMJerely being named to receive an asset under the will that no longer exists as an asset of the testator,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cdoes not make one a legatee when that individual would actually receive nothing because they will not receive anything from the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">But the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s ruling apparently rested upon the slenderest of reeds: a bald assertion in appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss that the decedent, before her death, had transferred, to a revocable trust, the \u201ctangible personal property\u201d that appellants were to receive under her Will. Not only was that statement unsupported by either oath or documentation, but its accuracy was in dispute. Appellants alleged in their opposition to appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss that no ademption of that property had ever occurred. Hence, the orphans\u2019 court had before it two conflicting claims as to the present status of the decedent\u2019s tangible personal property: in legal terms, a genuine dispute as to a material fact. Yet, it failed to deny appellees\u2019 motion on that or any other ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Appellees assert, however, that no such dispute existed because appellants \u201cdid not challenge the sworn statement in ... the administrative probate petition\u201d that the estate\u2019s only asset was a bank account containing a little less than $13,000. But that assumes that appellants were required to do so or, by their inaction, conceded the point. They were not and did not. Appellants were under no legal obligation to respond to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>allegations of the administrative probate petition, once they filed a petition for judicial probate. That petition supplanted appellees\u2019; transformed the nature of the proceedings, from administrative to judicial; and rendered nugatory any decisions or actions taken by the register as to the Will, estate, or appointment of personal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">At the time that appellants filed their petition they were only required to show that they were \u201cinterested persons,\u201d under ET \u00a7 l-101(i), which they did by stating, under oath, that they were legatees under the decedent\u2019s will. That does not mean that appellees could not challenge their standing to file that petition on a motion to dismiss or, as they in effect did in this instance, on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Moreover, the orphans\u2019 court did not apparently even rely on that petition in rendering its decision. The only evidence, cited by that court in dismissing appellants\u2019 petition, was the unsworn and undocumented claim of ademption in appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. It made no mention of appellants\u2019 denial of ademption. Yet, it was required to consider both and, once it had done so, it should have denied appellees\u2019 motion on the ground that a genuine issue as to a material fact existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">We further note that appellants\u2019 petition for judicial probate complied with Maryland law. The petition was in the pre-printed form, required by ET \u00a7 5-206, and contained the information required by ET \u00a7 5-201.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>checked the box on that form, indicating that they were seeking judicial probate of a small estate, did not constitute an admission that their legacy had in fact been adeemed, as appellees suggest. The decedent\u2019s estate, according to appellees, had only one asset, a bank account containing less than $13,000. Since a \u201csmall estate\u201d may contain up to $30,000 in property, ET \u00a7 5-601(a), there was sufficient leeway in the value of the estate for it to still qualify as a small estate even after the value of the tangible personal property was added back in. Hence, the designation of the decedent\u2019s estate as a \u201csmall estate\u201d by appellants\u2019 petition did not constitute an admission, express or implied, that the decedent\u2019s tangible personal property was no longer part of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Moreover, appellants candidly indicated in \u201cSchedule\u2014B\u201d of their petition that a description and statement of value of each item of property would have to await an investigation \u201cby the Independent Personal Representative\u201d they hoped the court would appoint. Considerations of cost and time, we note, frequently lead many, who are uncertain of the value of the assets of an estate, to initially request small state administration. They do so to avoid the time and expense that probate otherwise entails, knowing that such request can be easily amended once it is clear that the assets of the estate exceed $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">And finally, although appellants did not allege, in their petition, that there were unaccounted-for assets of the estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>neither did they concede that the estate, as appellee\u2019s petition alleged, had only one asset\u2014a bank account containing less than $13,000. Instead, appellants\u2019 petition for judicial probate requested the appointment of an \u201cindependent personal representative\u201d\u2014one \u201cwithout any prior business or personal relationships with the Decedent\u201d\u2014to conduct an \u201cindependent investigation\u201d to determine whether actions purportedly taken by Decedent and on her behalf \u201cwere in accord with her intent.\u201d They did not list \u201call real and personal property owned by decedent,\u201d as requested by \u201cSchedule\u2014B\u201d of the pre-printed petition but, instead, as noted, requested that assets of the estate \u201cbe further investigated by [an] Independent Personal Representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">As a basis for that request, appellants asserted in a statement attached to their petition that they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">objected[ed] to the continued appointment of Patricia K. Smyth and Francis <em>X. </em>Knott, as personal representatives of the Estate, and requested] the appointment of an independent person selected by the Court to serve as Personal Representative of the Estate for purposes of conducting an independent investigation to assure that all actions taken by or on behalf of Decedent, during her lifetime, and on behalf of her Estate, after her death, were in accord with her intent, without violation of a confidential relationship and without self-dealing or other conflict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">To consider these and other issues, appellants demanded a \u201cplenary hearing.\u201d Although the petition would not have satisfied the requirements of a complaint filed in a court of general jurisdiction, failing as it did to allege, except by implication, why appellants were entitled to the relief they requested, such specificity is not required to obtain a plenary hearing in the orphans\u2019 court. That proceeding must be \u201cinstituted at any time before administrative probate or within the period after administrative probate provided by \u00a7 5-304,\u201d upon the request of an interested person. ET \u00a7 5-402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In sum, without either side producing any evidence besides bald and unsworn to assertions offering conflicting accounts as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>to the fate of the decedent\u2019s tangible personal property, the orphans\u2019 court resolved this dispute in favor of appellees, holding that the decedent\u2019s property had been, as appellees claimed, transferred to the decedent\u2019s revocable trust, during her lifetime, and that that ademption deprived appellants of standing to request judicial probate. By relying on information outside of the pleadings, the orphans\u2019 court transformed appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and, thereafter, violated Rule 2-501 by entering summary judgment, notwithstanding the existence of a genuine dispute as to a material fact. We shall therefore vacate the judgment of the orphans\u2019 court and remand this case to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">On remand, the orphans\u2019 court may consider whether the tangible property at issue was, as appellants contend, concealed by appellees. Although the orphans\u2019 court has no jurisdiction over questions of title to personal property, <em>DeFelice v. Riggs Nat\u2019l </em>Bank, 55 Md.App. 476, 481-82, 462 A.2d 88 (1983), or real property, <em>Wingert v. State, </em>125 Md. 536, 543, 94 A. 166 (1915) or, for that matter, trusts, <em>Galard v. Winans, </em>111 Md. 434, 472, 74 A. 626 (1909), it does have jurisdiction to determine title \u201cwhere a person interested in the estate charges the administrator with concealing or having in his hands property belonging to the estate which he has omitted to return in the inventory.\u201d <em>Kerby v. Peters, </em>172 Md. 1, 7, 190 A. 511 (1937); <em>see also Linthicum v. Polk, </em>93 Md. 84, 93-94, 48 A. 842 (1901); <em>see also McKenney v. McKenney, </em>214 Md. 397, 404, 135 A.2d 423 (1957); <em>Pratt v. Hill, </em>124 Md. 252, 256, 92 A. 543 (1914); <em>Daugherty v. Daugherty, </em>82 Md. 229, 231, 33 A. 541 (1896). Furthermore, we note that the orphans\u2019 court \u201cmay determine questions of title to personal property not exceeding $20,000 in value for the purpose of determining what personal property is properly includable in an estate that is the subject of a proceeding before the court.\u201d ET \u00a7 1-301(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>If the orphans\u2019 court does find that property has been concealed, and the personal representatives have acted in bad faith, it may chose other persons to serve as personal representatives of the estate. <em>See Kerby, </em>172 Md. at 6, 190 A. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Moreover, if the orphans\u2019 court determines, on remand, that appellants\u2019 legacy had been adeemed, appellants would not then qualify as interested persons with standing to challenge the personal representative. An \u201cinterested person\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201c[a] legatee in being, not fully paid.\u201d ET \u00a7 l-101(i)(3). And \u201clegatee\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who under the terms of a will would receive a legacy.\u201d ET \u00a7 l-101(m). \u201c[U]nder the terms of a will\u201d means, appellants argue, that, in determining whether an individual is a legatee, the court should not read beyond the four corners of the will. In other words, even if the legacy has been adeemed, appellants would remain \u201clegatees in being, not fully paid\u201d because they are still named in the will. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">An ademption is \u201c[t]he destruction or extinction of a legacy or bequest by reason of a bequeathed asset\u2019s ceasing to be part of the estate at the time of the testator\u2019s death.... \u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>39 (7th Ed.1999). The effect of which is a \u201c \u2018revocation, recalling, or cancellation, of a legacy, according to the apparent intention of the testator, implied by the law from acts done by him in his life, though such acts do not amount to an express revocation of it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Von Steinner v. Sorrell, </em>259 Md. 228, 230, 269 A.2d 604 (1970) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>60 (4th ed.1951)); <em>see also </em>97 C.J.S. <em>Wills </em>\u00a7 1770 (2001) (\u201cWhere a legacy is adeemed or satisfied the will is to be read as though it had been expunged from it and the legatee or devisee takes nothing, with no rights being conferred to such legatee or devisee.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Thus, if, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, a legacy has been adeemed, and thereby revoked, <em>see Sorrell, </em>259 Md. at 230, 269 A.2d 604, the person, who was to receive that legacy, would no longer be entitled to receive it under the terms of the will and, therefore, would no longer be a \u201clegatee\u201d as defined by ET \u00a7 l-101(m). Indeed, the Henderson Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>sion, which drafted this provision, commented that \u201c \u2018[l]egatee\u2019 would not include someone named in the will to receive a legacy which is void or otherwise inoperative.\u201d <em>See Second Report of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Rem.se the Testamentary Law of Maryland </em>3 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Moreover, appellants\u2019 contention that the ademption of one\u2019s legacy is irrelevant to one\u2019s status as a legatee cannot be reconciled with the definition of an \u201cinterested person.\u201d To qualify as an \u201cinterested person,\u201d a legatee must not, under ET \u00a7 l-101(i)(3), \u201cbe fully paid.\u201d Once he is fully paid, his interest in the probate of the will or the appointment of the personal representative is extinguished and he is no longer an interested person. The same is true for a legatee whose legacy has been adeemed. Once his legacy is adeemed, his interest in the will is extinguished. To argue otherwise, as appellants do, is to claim that an interested person can be someone without an interest\u2014a contradiction in terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED.
