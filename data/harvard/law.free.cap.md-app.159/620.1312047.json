Diane Stevenson, appellant and cross-appellee, because her leadership of the bank\u2019s Maryland Region did not satisfy its post-merger expectations. Stevenson sued BB <em>&amp; </em>T for breach of her written employment contract and for violation of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (the Wage Payment Act). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 3-501 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor &amp; Employment Article (LE). Both of Stevenson\u2019s claims arise from BB &amp; T\u2019s contractual obligation to pay \u201cTermination Compensation\u201d equal to Stevenson\u2019s \u201cannual cash compensation\u201d before her termination. The jury\u2019s special verdict was in Stevenson\u2019s favor on both counts, but the court ordered a remittitur, reducing the award to $60,540.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Stevenson asks us to reverse the judgment, arguing <em>inter alia </em>that it was too small because, in calculating the amount of severance that the bank owed under the terms of her employment contract, the court erroneously prevented the jury from considering earnings from the exercise of bank stock options that generated a significant portion of her compensation pack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>age. BB &amp; T cross-appeals, arguing <em>inter alia </em>that the Wage Payment Act does not extend to an employer\u2019s failure to pay severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">On a question of first impression regarding whether the Wage Payment Act affords relief to employees claiming severance pay, we conclude that non-payment of severance pay representing deferred compensation for services performed during the employment may be grounds for relief under the Act. In this instance, however, the Termination Compensation owed to Stevenson was not the type of \u201cwages for work performed before termination\u201d that gives rise to a Wage Payment Act claim. We shall vacate the judgment for that reason, and because the trial court should have let the jury decide whether Stevenson\u2019s severance benefit included her stock option earnings and should not have awarded Stevenson four times her unpaid wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">BB &amp; T merged with Maryland Federal Bancorp, Inc. in 1998. At the time, Stevenson was a Senior Vice President of branch operations with Maryland Federal. BB &amp; T offered Stevenson a position as Senior Vice President of the Maryland Region, with a three year written employment agreement beginning September 20,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Section 4 of the proposed agreement contained a non-compete clause. \u201c[I]n consideration of the mutual covenants\u201d in the employment agreement, Stevenson was asked to promise that, \u201cupon termination of [her] employment,\u201d she would not \u201cdirectly or indirectly, either as a principal, agent, employee, employer, stockholder, co-partner or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever,\u201d compete with BB &amp; T. Specifically, Stevenson could not \u201cengage in a Competitive [banking, financial services, insurance, mortgage, or trust] Business anywhere in the States of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, or South Carolina, or the District of Columbia, or any county contiguous to\u201d those jurisdictions. She also would be barred from soliciting BB &amp; T customers and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Just as when she worked for Maryland Federal, Stevenson\u2019s compensation was to include bank stock options. These options allowed her to purchase shares of bank common stock at a below-market price, then sell that stock for a profit at a higher market price, at a time she selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The employment contract also provided in Section 6 for \u201cTermination Compensation\u201d if either BB <em>&amp; </em>T or Stevenson terminated the contract before its term expired. The contract stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">6c. Employer may terminate Employee\u2019s employment other than for \u201cJust Cause,\u201d as described in Subparagraph (b) above, at any time upon written notice to Employee, which termination shall be effective immediately. In the event Employer terminates Employee pursuant to this Subparagraph (c),(l) Employee will receive the highest amount of the annual cash compensation (including cash bonuses and other cash-based benefits, including for these purposes amounts earned or payable whether or not deferred) received from Maryland Federal or Employer during any of the three calendar years immediately preceding such termination (\u201cTermination Compensation\u201d) in each year until the end of the Term (prorated for any partial year).... In addition, Employee shall continue to participate in the same group hospitalization plan, health care plan, dental care plan, life or other insurance or death benefit plan, ... on the same terms as were in effect prior to Employee\u2019s termination, either under Employer\u2019s plans or comparable coverage, for all periods Employee receives Termination Compensation ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">6e. In the event Employee elects to resign from employment under this Agreement for other than \u201cGood Reason,\u201d death or disability following the one-year anniversary of the date of this Agreement, Employee shall be entitled to receive a lump sum amount equal to his annual Termination Compensation times the lesser of (i) the number of years until the end of the term, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>with partial years rounded to two decimal places, or (ii) 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">6f. In receiving any payments pursuant to this Section 6, Employee shall not be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to Employee hereunder, and such amounts shall not be reduced or terminated whether or not Employee obtains other employment. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Before executing this agreement, Stevenson had a face-to-face conversation with Robert Halleck, Regional President of BB <em>&amp; </em>T, about whether \u201cother cash-based benefits\u201d meant that her earnings from the exercise of stock options would be included in the calculation of Termination Compensation. In her employment with Maryland Federal, Stevenson\u2019s profits from exercising her stock options had been a significant amount of her overall earnings. In 1997, she earned $60,476.80 as a result of buying and selling Maryland Federal stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">At trial, Stevenson testified that Halleck assured her that \u201cother cash-based benefits\u201d meant the cash she received as a result of exercising her stock options. Stevenson \u201cchose to go with BB &amp; T ... because of [her] conversations with Mr. Halleckf.]\u201d In accepting the position at BB <em>&amp; </em>T, she declined another position, as President of Enterprise Federal Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Stevenson\u2019s employment with BB &amp; T ended just over a year after it began. In the 13 months she worked for BB &amp; T, Stevenson earned a significant portion of her income from the exercise of bank stock options. In 1998, she earned $81,380 in base salary plus twice that amount\u2014$162,601.86\u2014by exercising her options on five different occasions. All five were \u201ccashless same day exercises\u201d in which she purchased and sold bank shares in a single trading session. These stock options were reported to the IRS as employment compensation to Stevenson. The bank direct-deposited into Stevenson\u2019s bank account the cash proceeds of her stock option earnings, in the same manner her paycheck was deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>On October 81, 1999, Halleck met with Stevenson and told her that he was \u201cgoing to have to let [her] go\u201d because \u201cthe powers that be were , very disappointed with the Maryland region,' and ... they want to bring somebody in from down south, somebody that was BB &amp; T born and bred, and they felt that they would do a better job.\u201d At trial, both Stevenson and Halleck testified that BB &amp; T did not give her an opportunity to stay with the bank in another capacity. Although Halleck gave her the option of resigning, Stevenson rejected that offer because she was aware that she would not have health insurance or stock options for the remaining two years of her contract if she resigned, and that her Termination Compensation otherwise would last through the time she was required to comply with the non-compete clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In paying the Termination Compensation due under Stevenson\u2019s employment contract, however, BB &amp; T took the position that Stevenson voluntarily resigned, rather than that she was terminated. By letter dated November 9, BB &amp; T informed Stevenson that she was entitled to a lump sum payment of $156,250.18 under section 6(e) of the employment agreement. The letter detailed how the bank calculated the proffered payment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">There are 23 months remaining in the term of your contract as of your termination date. This equates to a multiplier of 1.92. Phil Burrows confirmed that your termination compensation was $81,380.30, which was your 1998 compensation. So, the payment is calculated as $81,380.30 x 1.92 = $156,250.18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Thus, BB &amp; T\u2019s payment formula excluded from Stevenson\u2019s benchmark \u201c1998 compensation\u201d the $162,601.86 she earned that year from the exercise of her stock options. The bank did not provide Stevenson with any information regarding health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In November 2001, Stevenson filed suit against BB <em>&amp; </em>T, claiming (1) the bank underpaid her because it mischaracterized her termination as a resignation; (2) the bank failed to include the money she earned in exercising her stock options <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>in its calculation of Termination Compensation, resulting in an underpayment of $314,844.63; and (3) the bank also failed to provide health insurance and other benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">A year after Stevenson filed suit, BB &amp; T amended its interrogatory answers to acknowledge that it had underpaid Stevenson by $6,444.04. BB &amp; T explained how it calculated the underpayment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">In determining [Stevenson\u2019s] Termination Compensation, [BB &amp; T] inadvertently failed to include certain deferred cash compensation in the amount of $5,967.00, resulting in an underpayment of severance pay in the amount of $11,456.64. As of [Stevenson\u2019s] termination of her employment, [Stevenson] had accrued, but unused vacation with a value of $3,567.90. The combined amount of the deferred cash compensation plus accrued vacation is $15,024.04. [Stevenson] terminated her employment effective October 31, 1999, and should have ceased receiving wages, contributions to [BB &amp; T\u2019s] 401K plan and health care benefits as of that date. Notwithstanding [Stevenson\u2019s] termination of her employment as of October 31,1999, [BB <em>&amp; </em>T] inadvertently paid to [Stevenson] additional salary after that date in the aggregate amount of $7,730.46, made contribution to [BB &amp; T\u2019s] 401K plan for the benefit of [Stevenson] in the amount of $463.82, and provided her health care benefits with an aggregate value of at least $386.22. The combined amount of these benefits was $8,580.50. As a result, [Stevenson] has been underpaid severance in the approximate amount of $6,444.04 through the [BB &amp; T], (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Thus, the bank maintained its position that Stevenson\u2019s stock option earnings did not constitute \u201cAnnual Cash Compensation\u201d for purposes of determining her Termination Compensation. BB &amp; T issued Stevenson a check in the net after-tax amount of $3,729.75. Viewing the payment as \u201ctoo little, too late,\u201d Stevenson proceeded to trial on her breach of contract and Wage Payment Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>On the first day of Stevenson\u2019s jury trial, the court ruled that the phrase \u201cand other cash-based benefits\u201d in section 6(c) of Stevenson\u2019s employment agreement is ambiguous. The trial court allowed parol evidence solely on the meaning of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, BB &amp; T moved for judgment on any claim arising from the bank\u2019s failure to include profits from the exercise of stock options in its calculation of Stevenson\u2019s Termination Compensation. The court granted the motion, citing \u201cthe nature of what a stock option is and what happens when it\u2019s exercised, and the limiting language in termination as being [\u2019Jreceived from Maryland Federal or employer!?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Stevenson\u2019s breach of contract and Wage Payment Act claims went to the jury on the remaining issues, so that the jury did not factor Stevenson\u2019s earnings from the exercise of her stock options into its calculation of the Termination Compensation due under her employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The jury returned a special verdict in favor of Stevenson, finding that Stevenson did not resign from BB <em>&amp; </em>T, that BB &amp; T breached the employment contract by underpaying her Termination Compensation, and that there was no bona fide dispute justifying the bank\u2019s refusal to pay the full amount owed. The jury awarded damages on Stevenson\u2019s common law breach of contract claim in the total amount of $81,452.41.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On her statutory Wage Payment Act claim, the jury awarded $244,357.13\u2014three times the damage award on the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Dismayed that the jury awarded more damages than Stevenson requested, the trial court immediately announced that it intended to order either a remittitur or a new trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>I believe this verdict is the result of my fault in not reminding [jurors] that they can\u2019t speculate, and both of [counsels\u2019 fault] by not laying out a specific figure.... What I intend to do is rule on a remittitur either today or.... Tuesday.... [I]f it\u2019s not accepted, we\u2019re going to pick a new jury and retry this case and correct all of the mistakes that I made before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">These amounts are not based on the evidence, are clearly the result of guesswork and speculation. They exceed what [Stevenson\u2019s counsel] said [he] thought [she] was entitled. What I should have done is put those amounts on the verdict sheet, and put them in as options, as plaintiff alleges, as defendant alleges, or other, and remind them that they can\u2019t guess. And it has to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence or they must enter zero. That\u2019s what I should have told them.... [W]hen I got that question [from the jury during deliberations] about what amount does each side claim, I should have had them come out and have you all re-argue and put the figures down specifically. That\u2019s what I should have done. I never make the same mistake twice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The court concluded that Stevenson had proven actual underpayment of only $15,185.00. It proposed a judgment in favor of Stevenson in an amount equal to four times that amount, or $60,540.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although she objected to the size <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>of this reduction, Stevenson decided to accept the reduced damage award in the belief that \u201cthe issue on the stock options is still available for an appeal.\u201d The court ordered judgment in the remitted amount on May 23, 2003. The clerk entered judgment on June 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">At that point, Stevenson\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees and litigation costs was still unresolved. Stevenson petitioned for $76,074.75 in attorney\u2019s fees and $1,693.45 in expenses. The court conducted hearings on the attorney\u2019s fees claim on June 23 and June 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">At the first hearing, the trial court held that a reasonable fee for the services rendered by Stevenson\u2019s attorneys should not include the time spent on the unsuccessful stock option claim. At the court\u2019s request, Stevenson\u2019s counsel eliminated time expended on that issue. Counsel also supplied the court with a copy of the retainer agreement, which provides for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">a legal fee in the amount of One-third of all sums recovered. These fees are contingent on recovery.... I also agree to pay an hourly, non-contingent fee of $110 per hour for all time spent on the case. This will be paid monthly.... The contingency fee shall be reduced by the amount of any hourly fees paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">By order dated June 30, 2003, the court awarded Stevenson $20,180 in counsel fees and litigation expenses, an amount equal to the one-third contingency fee set out in the fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">To resolve this appeal and cross-appeal, we consider the following issues, which we have consolidated, rephrased, and reordered for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>I. Did the trial court err in denying BB &amp; T\u2019s request for entry of a satisfaction of judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">II. Did the trial court err in instructing the jury to treat any unpaid Termination Compensation as unpaid wages that were subject to the prompt payment requirements of the Wage Payment Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">III. Did the trial court err in removing from the jury\u2019s consideration the issue of whether Stevenson\u2019s Termination Compensation should have included profits she earned from the exercise of her stock options?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">IV. Did the trial court err in awarding four times Stevenson\u2019s unpaid wages or in awarding attorney\u2019s fees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The Court Did Not Err In Refusing To Enter A Satisfaction Of Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">As a threshold matter, we reject BB &amp; T\u2019s cross-appeal challenging the denial of its motion for entry of a satisfaction of judgment. BB &amp; T premised that request on its June 10, 2003 proffer of a bank check in the amount of $60,722.45, representing the post-remittitur award plus 10 days post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">A determination of whether judgment has been satisfied is a question of law that we review <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> See </em>Md. Rule 2-622; <em>Underwood-Gary v. Mathews, </em>366 Md. 660, 667, 785 A.2d 708 (2001). \u201cA satisfaction of a judgment is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>acceptance of full compensation for the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663 n. 2, 785 A.2d 708 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Here, the proffered bank check did not represent \u201cfull compensation\u201d for Stevenson\u2019s injuries. The check was delivered after the court-ordered remittitur reduced the amount the jury awarded Stevenson. Subsequent correspondence between counsel concerning this check reflects that Stevenson refused to cash it because counsel was concerned that BB &amp; T would claim she had waived her appellate right to challenge the court\u2019s stock option ruling and/or her right to recover attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In the May 23 colloquy concerning remittitur, the trial court acknowledged that the reduced award of $60,540.00 did not compensate Stevenson for her attorney\u2019s fees, and that Stevenson was entitled to recover at least some of her fees and expenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the court ordered judgment in the remitted amount, it held two hearings on Stevenson\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. The court received detailed records in support of Stevenson\u2019s claim for fees and costs. On June 24, BB &amp; T filed a motion seeking a declaration that the judgment had been satisfied. On June 30, the trial court ordered payment of an additional $20,180.00 in \u201creasonable counsel fees.\u201d We have not been directed to any evidence that BB <em>&amp; </em>T proffered the $20,180.00 to Stevenson. By order dated August 28, the trial court denied the bank\u2019s motion for an entry of satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Thus, the check proffered by BB &amp; T on June 10 represented only partial compensation for Stevenson\u2019s claimed injuries, in that it did not purport to compensate Stevenson for the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses she allegedly incurred in her efforts to obtain full payment of her wages. In these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>stances, BB &amp; T\u2019s payment could not be considered \u201cfull compensation,\u201d and the trial court did not err in refusing to enter a satisfaction of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The Trial Court Correctly Ruled That Severance Pay May Be Recovered Under Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment Act, But Erred In Affording Stevenson A Statutory Remedy For The Bank\u2019s Underpayment Of \u201cTermination Compensation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment Act protects employees from wrongful withholding of wages by employers upon termination. LE section 3-505, governing payment upon termination of employment, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">Each employer shall pay an employee ... all wages due for work that the employee performed before the termination of employment, on or before the day on which the employee would have been paid the wages if the employment had not been terminated. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Section 3-507.1 creates a private right of action to recover unpaid wages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">[IJf an employer fails to pay an employee in accordance with ... \u00a7 3-505 of this subtitle, after 2 weeks have elapsed from the date on which the employer is required to have paid the wages, the employee may bring an action against the employer to recover the unpaid wages.... If ... a court finds that an employer withheld the wage of an employee in violation of this subtitle and not as a result of a bona fide dispute, the court may award the employee an amount not exceeding 3 times the wage, and reasonable counsel fees and other costs. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-10\"> \u201cThe principal purpose of the Act \u2018[isj to provide a vehicle for employees to collect, and an incentive for employers to pay, back wages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 39, 811 A.2d 297 (2002). The focus of the subtitle is not on \u201cthe amount of wages payable but rather the duty to pay whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>wages are due on a regular basis and to pay all that is due following termination of the employment.\u201d <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 513, 819 A.2d 354 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In its cross-appeal, BB &amp; T argues that \u201c[cjontractually established severance due after employment ends falls outside the Wage [Payment] Act\u201d because \u201cthe General Assembly has chosen not to include severance payments within the definition of wages.\u201d In support, the bank cites two decisions from other state courts holding that severance pay does not constitute \u201cwages.\u201d In <em>Dep\u2019t of Labor ex rel. Commons v. Green Giant Co., </em>394 A.2d 753, 755 (Del.Sup.Ct.1978), a Delaware trial court held that severance pay was not \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of that state\u2019s prompt payment law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">The review of the word usage in the statute indicates that the word \u201cwages\u201d was used to refer to the regular direct compensation which would ordinarily be paid at the end of each period of a certain number of work days.... The usage ... does not adapt- itself to the concept that \u201cwages\u201d include nonrecurrent benefits such as severance pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">In <em>McGowan v. Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>153 Conn. 691, 220 A.2d 284, 286 (1966), the Connecticut Supreme Court held that severance pay is not \u201cwages\u201d for purposes of determining whether a terminated employee qualifies for unemployment. The court reasoned that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARQ\">in the connotation of the statute, wages cease when employment does, severance pay cannot be considered wages. Severance pay is \u201ca form of compensation for the termination of the employment relation, for reasons other than the displaced employees\u2019 misconduct, primarily to alleviate the consequent need for economic readjustment but also recompense him for certain losses attributable to the dismissal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Our research also revealed more recent decisions holding that severance pay should not be considered wages for purposes of prompt payment statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>When construing the Wage Payment Act, <em>our </em>goal is to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent so that we can apply the statute in the manner designed by the legislature. <em>See Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 301, 783 A.2d 667 (2001). We begin with the \u201cthe words of the statute, which we give their ordinary and common meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 783 A.2d 667. \u201cWe consider the meaning of the statutory language in the context of the overall statutory scheme. Only if the words of the statute are ambiguous need we seek the Legislature\u2019s intent in the legislative history or other extraneous sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">LE section 3-501 (c) defines \u201cwage\u201d broadly and specifically identifies a non-exclusive list of compensation categories as wages for purposes of the Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">(1) \u201dWage\u201d means all compensation that is due to an employee for employment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">(2) \u201cWage\u201d includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">(i) A bonus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">(ii) A commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">(iii) A fringe benefit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>(iv) Any other remuneration promised for service. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The Maryland Wage Payment Act does not specifically mention severance pay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor has there been any reported Maryland decision concerning whether severance pay constitutes \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Stevenson contends that severance pay fits within the broad definition of wages under LE subsection 3-501(c)(l). She argues that severance pay is both \u201ccompensation for employment\u201d and \u201cother remuneration promised for service.\u201d LE \u00a7 3-501(c). In support, Stevenson points to the Court of Appeals\u2019 rationale for its decisions in <em>Whiting-Turner v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 783 A.2d 667 (2001), and <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 811 A.2d 297 (2002), in which the Court recognized that profit sharing and incentive payments, respectively, may qualify as wages that are subject to the Wage Payment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Stevenson also claims that the out-of-state cases cited by BB &amp; T represent the minority view. According to Stevenson, the decisions holding that severance pay may constitute wages that must be paid in compliance with statutory prompt payment requirements represent the prevailing and better reasoned position.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>We <em>begin our </em>analysis of this issue by examining the two Maryland decisions construing LE sections 3-505 and 3-507.1. Although neither <em>Whiting-Tv,mer </em>nor <em>Medex </em>specifically addresses whether Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment Act provides relief to employees seeking to recover severance pay, the interpretation of the Wage Payment Act in those cases necessarily frames our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>the Court of Appeals discussed the meaning of \u201cwage\u201d under LE section 3\u2014501(c). When he was hired, Fitzpatrick agreed to a weekly salary. After two years of employment, depending on the company\u2019s profits, he would also receive a profit sharing bonus. At the time he resigned, Fitzpatrick had worked less than two years, but Whiting-Turner nevertheless had drawn up a bonus check for him that represented a profit sharing bonus. Although Whiting-Turner offered Fitzpatrick the check if he stayed with the company instead of leaving to work for its competitor, Fitzpatrick elected to resign. He then sued to collect the bonus pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Court of Appeals held that the bonus was not a \u201cwage\u201d subject to the prompt payment requirements of LE section 3-505 because Fitzpatrick had not earned it by fulfilling the two year employment condition. <em>See Whiting-Turner, </em>366 Md. at 306, 783 A.2d 667. In doing so, the Court considered the meaning of \u201cother remuneration promised for service\u201d under subsection 3-501 (c)(2) (iv) and distinguished between a gratuitous bonus and compensation earned according to the terms of an employment contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">[Sjubsection (c)(2)(iv) .... has a meaning that is significant to an understanding of why \u201cbonus,\u201d and for that matter, \u201ccommission\u201d and \u201cfringe benefit\u201d were included as examples of the kind of \u201cother remuneration\u201d that could constitute \u201cwages.\u201d Section 501(c)(2)(iv) serves two functions: it makes clear both that the listed forms of remuneration are simply examples, by the use of the phrase \u201cany other remuneration,\u201d and that the \u201cother remuneration\u201d that may be included in ... wages must have been \u201cpromised for service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The [employee] would read out of the statute the words \u201cpromised for service.\u201d But reading the statute as including a bonus for wages only when it has been promised as part of the compensation for employment is logical and makes good common sense. The conditions of employment are determined in advance of the employment. What, if anything beyond the basic salary, the employee will receive is a matter for discussion, consideration and agreement. If a bonus is to be made part of the wage package, it can be negotiated and included in what has been promised. Similarly, whether commissions are to be paid or what fringe benefits attach are matters for agreement in advance of the employment or to become a part of the undertaking during the employment. Once a bonus, commission or fringe benefit has been promised as part of the compensation for service, the employee would be entitled to its enforcement as wages.... [T]his reading gives effect to the plain language of the statute and, we believe, is reflective of the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 304-05, 783 A.2d 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Applying a \u201cbright line test,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that the profit sharing bonus Whiting-Turner planned to give Fitzpatrick if he stayed with the company was not a \u201cwage\u201d because his right to receive that bonus had not'yet vested. <em>See id. </em>at 305-06, 783 A.2d 667. The Court reasoned that, although he had been promised a bonus as compensation for service, Fitzgerald had not earned the bonus before his employment terminated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The bonus therefore did not qualify as a \u201cwage\u201d recoverable under the Wage Payment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>In <em>Medex, </em>the Court of Appeals applied the same rationale in concluding that an incentive payment qualified as a \u201cwage\u201d under section 3-501 (c). McCabe was employed as a sales representative for a medical supplies manufacturer, whose employment terms provided for a salary plus \u201cincentive fees\u201d that were paid out according to \u201ca series of [annual] incentive compensation plans.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 38, 811 A.2d 297. The employee manual stated that incentive payments were \u201cconditional upon meeting targets and the participant being an employee at the end of the incentive plan (generally the fiscal year) and being employed at the time of actual payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>McCabe resigned four days after an incentive plan ended, but before payments under that plan were due to be made. Medex refused to pay McCabe, citing his failure to satisfy the last condition <em>of </em>\u201cemployment at the time of actual payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">This Court concluded the incentive payments were \u201ccommissions\u201d and that McCabe had earned them as wages under section 3-501 (c). <em>See McCabe v. Medex, </em>141 Md.App. 558, 564-65, 786 A.2d 57 (2001), <em>aff'd, </em>372 Md. 28, 811 A.2d 297 (2002). We held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the third requirement of employment at the time of payment was \u201cinvalid in light of Maryland statutory and common law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The Court of Appeals agreed. <em>See Medex, </em>372 Md. at 35-36, 811 A.2d 297. The Court emphasized that \u201cit is the exchange of remuneration for the employee\u2019s work that is crucial to the determination that compensation constitutes a wage[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 811 A.2d 297. McCabe\u2019s work to meet the company\u2019s sales targets satisfied that test. \u201cIn accordance with the policy underlying the Maryland Act, an employee\u2019s right to compensation vests when the employee does everything required to earn the wages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 811 A.2d 297. In McCabe\u2019s case, \u201c[t]he right to future commissions formed part of the inducement for his initial and continuing employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 811 A.2d 297. Because \u201cthe incentive fees were related directly to sales made by the employees during a defined fiscal year\u201d and \u201cMcCabe had performed all the work necessary to earn the fees,\u201d \u201cthe fees were compensation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>work performed, and, thus, wages under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 811 A.2d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Applying the lessons of <em>Whiting-Turner </em>and <em>Medex, </em>we have no trouble rejecting BB &amp; T\u2019s argument that Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment Act excludes severance pay because it does not mention this particular type of compensation. The trial court correctly concluded that \u201cthe listed forms of remuneration are simply examples\u201d of different types of \u201cwages.\u201d <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>366 Md. at 304, 783 A.2d 667. Consequently, the legislature\u2019s failure to explicitly define severance pay as a \u201cwage\u201d does not necessarily mean that Stevenson\u2019s Termination Compensation is not covered by the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>We turn next to BB <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s alternative argument that severance pay falls outside the scope of the Act because it does not compensate employees for work performed before termination. BB &amp; T points out that, by legislative directive, the prompt payment protections of LE section 3-505 extend only to terminated employees who have not been paid \u201cwages due for work performed before termination,\u201d and that the statutory remedy in section 3-507.1 is available only when there is a violation of section 3-505. In our view, however, BB &amp; T\u2019s theory that this excludes severance pay rests on the incorrect factual premise that severance pay can never be remuneration for an employee\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Many courts have recognized that severance pay often represents a type of deferred compensation for work performed during the employment. <em>See, e.g., Fang v. Showa Entetsu Co., </em>91 P.3d 419, 422 (Colo.Ct.App.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>2004 WL 1301893 (Colo. June 14, 2004)(\u201cIn the absence of controlling statutory provisions, severance payments are generally viewed as consideration for past services\u201d so that contractual severance provision, which was \u201cdeterminable and vested upon entering the contract, payable under the contract upon termination,\u201d constituted \u201cwages\u201d); <em>Ferry v. XRG Internat'l, Inc., </em>492 So.2d 1101, 1103-04 (Fla.Ct.App.1986)(severance was \u201cwages\u201d because \u201cone year\u2019s salary provided for in the contract should the [employee] be terminated without cause was an inducement to procure his services and to help ensure the continued quality of those services once he was employed\u201d); <em>Triad Data Serv., Inc. v. Jackson, </em>153 Cal. App.3d Supp. 1, 200 Cal.Rptr. 418, 423 (1984)(\u201cseverance pay constitute[s] wages\u201d given \u201cthe present day concept of employer-employee relations\u201d as including \u201cnot only the periodic monetary earnings of the employee but also the other benefits to which he is entitled as part of his compensation\u201d); <em>Heimenz v. Pa. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>23 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. (BNA) 227 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>(Pa. Ct. Common Pleas 1976)(severance pay under company plan was \u201cwages\u201d because calculation formula based on years of service showed pay \u201cis clearly intended to be a form of compensation for labor or services rendered over time\u201d). Our Court of Appeals long ago subscribed to that view in <em>Dahl v. Brunswick Corp., </em>277 Md. 471, 480, 356 A.2d 221 (1976)(ap-proving the \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d view of severance pay as \u201ca reward for past services,\u201d rather than \u201ca form of unemployment insurance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">These courts view severance pay as compensation that is \u201cearned\u201d before termination and payable at the time employment ends. The oft-cited explanation was offered in a New Jersey case involving the arbitrability of a dispute over vacation benefits in a collective bargaining agreement. In deciding that issue, the court examined the nature of both vacation pay and severance pay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">Vacation pay, as well as severance pay, has often been said to be in the nature of deferred compensation, in lieu of wages, earned in part each week the employee works, and payable at some later time. In the case of vacation pay, the future date is usually fixed; with severance pay it is dependent on termination of employment. In this sense such benefits \u201caccrue\u201d during the work year, not merely on the date when they become payable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\"><em>Botany Mills, Inc. v. Textile Workers Union of Am., </em>50 N.J.Super. 18, 141 A.2d 107, 113 (1958)(emphasis added). <em>See also Owens v. Press Publ\u2019g Co., </em>20 N.J. 537, 120 A.2d 442, 446 (1956)(\u201cIn a real sense, [severance pay] is remuneration for services rendered during the period covered by the agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Given the broad language of the statute and its remedial purpose, we conclude that the scope of Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment Act extends to the type of severance pay that represents deferred compensation for work performed during the employment. Thus, a severance benefit that is based on the length and/or nature of the employee\u2019s service, and promised upon termination, may be recoverable under the Wage Payment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The problem for Stevenson, though, is that her Termination Compensation does not fit this description. After examining Stevenson\u2019s employment agreement, we conclude that the Wage Payment Act does not provide her a remedy for BB <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s underpayment of Termination Compensation. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Unlike severance pay that is tied to length of employment, Stevenson\u2019s contractual severance benefit compensates her for the nearly two years remaining in her three year employment term. The terms of the employment contract make it clear that Stevenson\u2019s Termination Compensation is payment for her agreement not to compete following termination. Stevenson\u2019s right to receive Termination Compensation is explicitly tied to her duty not to compete with the bank after the end of her employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">[Section 4(d)]: If Employee\u2019s employment is terminated by Employer for reasons other than Just Cause ... at any time, Employee will be subject to the [non-compete] provisions of Section 4(a) until the later of: (i) the first anniversary of Employee\u2019s termination or (ii) the date as of which Employee ceases to receive Termination Compensation as provided in Section 6(e)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">[Section 6(c)]:.... Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Employee breaches [the non-compete provisions in] section 4(a) of this Agreement during the period that [s]he is receiving Termination Compensation, Employee will not be entitled to receive any further Termination Compensation!.] (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The cross-referenced provisions in Stevenson\u2019s employment agreement establish that, even if Stevenson\u2019s Termination Compensation fits the definition of a \u201cwage,\u201d in that it was \u201cremuneration promised for [Stevenson\u2019s] services\u201d in refraining from competing with the bank,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that wage was not \u201cdue for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>work that [Stevenson] performed before the termination of [her] employment[.]\u201d <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 3-501(c), \u00a7 3-505. The Termination Compensation was promised to Stevenson in exchange for the 23 months she agreed to refrain from competing with the bank, not for the 13 months she actually worked at BB &amp; T. Given that the payment was explicitly a <em>quid pro quo </em>for this non-compete, Stevenson could not possibly \u201cperform all the work necessary to earn\u201d the Termination Compensation until after her 13 month employment ended. <em>Cf Medex, </em>372 Md. at 36-37, 811 A.2d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In summary, Stevenson does not have a Wage Payment Act claim with respect to the bank\u2019s underpayment of Termination Compensation because (1) LE section 3-507.1 may be invoked only when the employer \u201cfails to pay an employee in accordance with section 3-505,\u201d (2) LE section 3-505 applies only to employers who do not promptly pay all \u201cwages due for work that the employee performed before the termination of employment[,]\u201d and (3) Stevenson\u2019s Termination Compensation was not payment \u201cfor work [she] performed before the termination of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">A contrary conclusion would require us to ignore the limiting phrase \u201cdue for work performed before termination\u201d in section 3-505. We may not do so. <em>See Whiting-Turner, </em>366 Md. at 304, 783 A.2d 667. As the Court of Appeals emphasized in <em>Whiting-Turner </em>and <em>Medex, </em>\u201can employee\u2019s right to compensation vests [only] when the employee does everything required to earn the wages\u201d and the Wage Payment Act affords relief only when the employee \u201cha[s] performed all the work necessary to earn the [compensation]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>before termination. <em>See Medex, </em>372 Md. at 37, 41, 811 A.2d 297; <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>366 Md. at 304-05, 783 A.2d 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">We therefore find merit in BB &amp; T\u2019s cross-appeal challenging the Wage Payment Act judgment. We must vacate that judgment and remand for further proceedings, as we shall discuss in greater detail following our consideration next of the primary issue raised by Stevenson\u2019s appeal. <em>See infra </em>Section III.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The Trial Court Erred In Ruling As A Matter Of Law That Earnings From The Exercise Of Stock Options Were Excluded From Termination Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In her appeal, Stevenson challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to remove from the jury the issue of whether her stock option profits should have been used in calculating her Termination Compensation. The Termination Compensation that BB &amp; T voluntarily paid Stevenson reflected Stevenson\u2019s 1998 salary income, but excluded the $162,601.86 in gross earnings from her exercise of stock options during that period. Stevenson argues the bank\u2019s failure to use these stock option profits to calculate her Termination Compensation resulted in a significant underpayment, in breach of her employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Section 6c of Stevenson\u2019s employment agreement defines-\u201cTermination Compensation\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6T\">the highest amount of the annual cash compensation (including cash bonuses and other cash-based benefits, including for these purposes amounts earned or payable whether or not deferred) received from Maryland Federal or Employer during any of the three calendar years immediately preceding such termination[.] (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">In Stephenson\u2019s view, \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d includes her stock option earnings because (1) the meaning of Termination Compensation under the contract is ambiguous and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Halleck explicitly told her that her stock option profits would .be treated as \u201ccash based benefits,\u201d while she was in the process of deciding between BB &amp; T\u2019s offer and the presidency of another bank. In BB &amp; T\u2019s view, any discussion between Halleck and Stevenson regarding the meaning of \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d is immaterial because such earnings are neither \u201ccash based,\u201d nor \u201cannual cash compensation,\u201d nor \u201creceived from Maryland Federal or [BB &amp; T].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The Trial Court\u2019s Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The trial court initially ruled that the Termination Compensation provision is ambiguous due to the disputed meaning of \u201cother cash based benefits.\u201d On the first day of trial, while considering pre-trial motions, the court pointed out the uncertain meaning of this phrase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">The Court: It amazes me.... I have had several major cases with banking institutions, ... and the documents were written, in my opinion, as if they were written by a second year law student---- [T]hat could have [been] explained with another couple sentences what the parties meant, but it did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-10\">Now, ... there are ambiguities in the direct language. For example, ... [o]ther cash based benefits. Now, that\u2019s as clear as mud. Other cash based benefits. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Rejecting the bank\u2019s argument that \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d clearly excludes earnings from the exercise of stock options, the court acknowledged that the phrase \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d is \u201cqualified by[,] as is the entire annual cash \u25a0compensation^\u201d the phrase \u201cpaid by the employer or Maryland Federal.\u201d Notwithstanding the latter term, the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apu\">found that portion is ambiguous.... [A] reasonable person similarly situated at the time could read and other cash based benefits in a number of ways, received from the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Because of this ambiguity, the trial court allowed Stevenson to testify about pre-contractual discussions concerning the meaning of \u201cother cash based benefits.\u201d On direct, Stevenson related that she \u201casked Mr. Halleck what did cash based benefits mean.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">[H]e assured me that, the cash I received from my stock options was on my W-2\u2019s, and .... that\u2019s what cash based benefits were....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">I was concerned with this particular question.... I was giving up a pretty good package [with a competitor bank] if I accepted the position. So, I wanted to make sure that it would be advantageous for me to stay with BB <em>&amp; </em>T, to sign the contract with BB <em>&amp; </em>T.... I wanted to verify -with him what other cash based benefits included.... He assured me that cash based benefits was the cash I received from my stock options.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Halleck disputed Stevenson\u2019s testimony. He testified that he never discussed the meaning of \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d with Stevenson, and denied telling her that stock option earnings would qualify as income for purposes of her severance package.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">After hearing that testimony, as well as testimony about the mechanics and reporting practices involved in the exercise of Stevenson\u2019s stock options, the court reversed its earlier holding that the Termination Compensation provision was ambiguous. The court reasoned that any ambiguity in the phrase \u201cother cash-based benefits\u201d was eliminated by the ensuing phrase \u201c... received from Maryland Federal or employer.\u201d The court explained why it believed Stevenson\u2019s Termination Compensation could not include her stock option profits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">I\u2019ve got ... problems with including the monies earned from the stock option plan as termination comp.... [Reading it in a light most favorable to [Stevenson], and mindful that the [bank] drafted this agreement, it\u2019s inescapable that the words [\u201d]received from Maryland Federal or employer[\u201d] ... do not fit a situation where a stock option is exercised.... It\u2019s the right to purchase company stock at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>fixed period of time. That\u2019s all a stock option is. That may- or may not be exercised. However, the moment it is exercised, that gives the right in exchange for the amount involved, the employee to purchase company stock at that price for however brief a period of time____The stock is then sold on the market, and at whatever price it\u2019s sold at, and that\u2019s an ascertainable figure based on the Stock Exchange. The employee is given the difference between that amount and the option price. That money is coming for the sale of that stock. That is not coming from the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtX\">The court acknowledged that BB &amp; T had made this argument earlier, but explained that it did not rely on the \u201creceived from employer\u201d phrase at that time because, \u201cuntil I heard all of the evidence I couldn\u2019t make an intelligent decision with regard to where that money for the stock option came from.\u201d Stevenson argues that the trial court erred in holding that the Termination Compensation provision was not ambiguous, and in deciding as a matter of law that her stock option earnings did not qualify as Termination Compensation. For the reasons set forth below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Ambiguity</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for judgment in a jury trial, we conduct the same analysis as the trial court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Hurt v. Chavis, </em>128 Md.App. 626, 639, 739 A.2d 924 (1999). The interpretation of a written contract is ordinarily a question of law for the court. <em>See Lema v.

Iz, </em>123 Md.App. 135, 162, 716 A.2d 1107, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 663, 719 A.2d 1262 (1998); <em>see First Union Nat\u2019l Bank v. Steele Software Sys.

Even then, however, the parties \u201cwill not be allowed to place their own interpretation on what it means or was intended to meant.]\u201d <em>Fultz v. Shaffer, </em>111 Md.App. 278, 299, 681 A.2d 568 (1996). Instead, the trier of fact must determine \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In evaluating whether the trial court\u2019s grant of BB &amp; T\u2019s motion for judgment was proper, we must view the evidence and inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to Stevenson, as the party opposing judgment. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-519(b); <em>Pahanish v. Western Trails, Inc., </em>69 Md.App. 342, 363, 517 A.2d 1122 (1986). When presented with the employment contract, Stevenson immediately asked questions about the \u201cTermination Compensation\u201d generally and about the undefined phrase \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d specifically. Even Halleek, the bank\u2019s representative during contract negotiations, admitted on cross-examination that he did not have any understanding of what \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d meant. We conclude that a reasonable person could share the uncertainty expressed by Stevenson and Halleek as to whether stock option profits qualified as the type of \u201cother cash based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>benefits\u201d that would be factored into Stevenson\u2019s Termination Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">We therefore concur with the trial court\u2019s initial ruling that the meaning of \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d is ambiguous. Unlike the trial court, however, we do not find that ambiguity-resolved by the ensuing phrase \u201creceived from Maryland Federal or Employer.\u201d Following the objective law of contracts, we must view the disputed term in context with all of the language in the Termination Compensation provision. <em>See Atl. Contracting &amp; Material Co. v. Ulico Cas. Co., </em>380 Md. 285, 301, 844 A.2d 460 (2004). By focusing exclusively on the \u201creceived from\u201d language, the trial court disregarded other descriptive language within the same provision that makes \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d susceptible of the broader interpretation that Stevenson gave it when she signed the employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">We conclude that profits from the exercise of stock options might reasonably be viewed as falling within the meaning of \u201ccash based benefit,\u201d because that term is defined broadly in Stevenson\u2019s employment contract to \u201cinclud[e] amounts earned ... whether or not deferred.\u201d We do not dispute BB &amp; T\u2019s contention that the stock options themselves were non-cash compensation that Stevenson \u201creceived from Maryland Federal or [BB &amp; T].\u201d <em>See, e.g., Schneider v. Hagerstown Brewing Co., </em>136 Md. 151, 152, 110 A. 218 (1920)(recognizing that stock option was not cash compensation). But that does not necessarily prevent Stevenson\u2019s stock option profits from being reasonably viewed as a \u201ccash based benefit\u201d that generated \u201camounts earned\u201d on a \u201cdeferred\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The stock option program was designed to allow an executive bank employee to earn profits through a standardized cashless transaction that could be deferred until a time of the employee\u2019s own choosing. Exercise of the option reliably yielded cash given the nature of the single day transaction in which Stevenson could purchase stock at a discounted price set by the bank, then sell at market price for a profit. The \u201ccash\u201d earnings were deposited into Stevenson\u2019s account in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>same manner as her \u201ccash\u201d salary paycheck, and reported to the IRS in a comparable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">We think a reasonable person in Stevenson\u2019s circumstances might view the stock options and their easily traceable cash proceeds as a \u201ccash based benefit\u201d that was \u201creceived from Maryland Federal or [BB <em>&amp; </em>T]\u201d in the sense that the stock options were a form of compensation that generated cash through \u201camounts earned\u201d in the market, \u201cwhether or not [those earnings were] deferred.\u201d Reading the term to include stock option profits is also reasonable in that the result would be consistent with the bank\u2019s obligation, under section 6 of the employment agreement, to pay Stevenson at her \u201chighest\u201d rate of compensation if it terminated her without cause, and to otherwise extend the full range of employee programs and benefits to her during the remainder of the three year contract period. A reasonable person in Stevenson\u2019s position could conclude that, if the bank terminated her without cause, she would be paid for the remainder of her three year contract term at a rate that compensated her not only for the loss of her salary and medical benefits, but also for the loss of her opportunities to earn cash through the exercise of stock options.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">For these reasons, we reject BB &amp; T\u2019s contentions that stock option profits cannot be \u201cannual cash compensation\u201d because they are neither \u201cannual\u201d nor \u201ccash compensation.\u201d BB <em>&amp; </em>T again fails to view those terms in the context created by the language defining \u201cannual cash compensation\u201d as \u201cother cash based benefits . .. including amounts earned ... whether or not deferred[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Given the lack of any contract definition or clear trade meaning, the trial court erred in ruling that the Termination Compensation provision is unambiguous. We have no quarrel with the trial court\u2019s observation that a reasonable person might conclude that stock options are not covered by the provision, as BB &amp; T did after Stevenson was terminated. Where we part company with the trial court is in its selection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>as a matter of law, of the narrower interpretation of \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d over the broader one.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We hold that Stevenson offered sufficient parol evidence to get to the jury on the question of whether her Termination Compensation included stock option profits. Stevenson and BB &amp; T agreed that stock options were given and treated as compensation to executive employees. By itself, Stevenson\u2019s testimony that Halleck assured her that stock option profits would be counted toward Termination Compensation was enough to get her to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">There was also circumstantial evidence to bolster this testimony. In the year before she accepted BB &amp; T\u2019s offer, Stevenson earned 44% of her 1997 income from the exercise of stock options; in 1998, Stevenson exercised stock options five times before she signed the employment agreement and raised the percentage of her income attributable to stock option profits to 67%. These earnings were reported as income by both the bank and Stevenson.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">In these circumstances, a reasonable jury might conclude that the parties intended \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d to encompass the stock option profits that had become such a significant component of Stevenson\u2019s compensation package.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>We hold the trial court should have let the jury decide between the two plausible constructions of \u201cother cash based benefits.\u201d It was the fact-finders\u2019 task to assess the credibility of Stevenson and Halleck with respect to the alleged conversation about whether stock option profits would qualify as \u201cother cash based benefits,\u201d and then to decide whether the parties intended \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d to include Stevenson\u2019s stock option earnings. <em>See, e.g., Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chemicals, Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 597, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990)(ambiguity in contract required that \u201cfactual findings about the intention of the parties will have to be made by the trier of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The trial court erred in refusing to let the jury decide whether BB <em>&amp; </em>T owed Stevenson additional Termination Compensation. That error provides additional reason to vacate the judgment, including the breach of contract award. We consider next the scope and consequences of our conclusions in Parts II and III with respect to the Termination Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">We shall vacate the judgments on both of Stevenson\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Judgment on the breach of contract claim must be vacated because Stevenson is entitled to have the jury decide whether her income from the exercise of bank stock options constituted \u201cother cash based benefits\u201d that BB &amp; T should have factored into its calculation of Termination Compensation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>mand, the jury should determine Stevenson\u2019s damages depending on its answer to that question and in accordance with the Termination Compensation provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Because her claim for unpaid Termination Compensation is not a Wage Payment Act claim, however, Stevenson cannot recover additional statutory damages, over and above her breach of contract damages. Nor can she recover attorney\u2019s fees that she incurred in connection with this claim, because the employment agreement does not have an attorney\u2019s fee provision and the fee provision in the Wage Payment Act does not apply to Stevenson\u2019s claim for additional Termination Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We must also vacate the judgment on Stevenson\u2019s Wage Payment Act claim, because it was tainted by the court\u2019s instruction to treat the bank\u2019s underpayment of Termination Compensation as grounds for relief under the Act. We assume the jury followed that instruction, so that the judgment as well as the damage award reflect this improper consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We have no way to discern whether the jury would have found a violation of the Act if it had considered only the bank\u2019s failure to timely pay \u201celigible\u201d wages under the Act, such as vacation pay or any deferred compensation that accrued based on work that Stevenson performed before termination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>ilarly, we cannot determine how much the jury would have awarded if it found that the bank violated the Act by failing to timely pay Stevenson all of her eligible wages. On remand, Stevenson\u2019s opportunity to recover statutory damages and attorney\u2019s fees under LE section 3-507.1 is limited by the narrowing of her Wage Payment Act claim in accordance with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">As for the special interrogatory findings made by the jury, we see no reason to revisit the unchallenged factual determination that Stevenson did not resign, but was fired. We cannot afford the same preclusive effect, however, to the jury\u2019s findings with respect to Stevenson\u2019s damages. This record does not disclose how much, if any, of the damages awarded to Stevenson represent compensation for \u201celigible wages\u201d that can be recovered under the Wage Payment Act (such as vacation pay and deferred compensation accrued for work performed before termination), or how much of the award represents underpayment of \u201cineligible\u201d wages that should not have been treated as recoverable under the Act (ie., Termination Compensation).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">For similar reasons, we cannot credit the jury\u2019s \u201cno bona fide reason for withholding\u201d finding. Although this finding may be appropriately premised on a finding that the bank had no bona fide reason for not paying Stevenson eligible wages <em>(ie., </em>accrued vacation and any deferred compensation) until after litigation began, it was not limited in this manner. The jury\u2019s determination clearly represented a finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>bank had no bona fide reason for failing to pay Stevenson\u2019s \u201cineligible <em>wages\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>the full amount of Termination Compensation. The jury\u2019s consideration of ineligible wages taints the entire damage award, for the reasons we have explained above.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">To guide the parties and the court on remand, we shall briefly address the remaining questions regarding how the trial court interpreted and applied the statutory damages and attorney\u2019s fees provisions of LE section 3-507.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Damages And Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Collectively, Stevenson\u2019s appeal and BB &amp; T\u2019s cross-appeal raise the following issues, which we have rephrased to focus on the questions as they may recur on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">A. In awarding treble damages under the Wage Payment Act, can a trial court order the employer to pay the unpaid wages plus three times that amount, resulting in a total award of four times the unpaid wages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">B. Was Stevenson the prevailing party at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">C. Is Stevenson entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees arising from her stock option earnings claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-12\">D. In awarding reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, what consideration can a trial court give to the actual amount of unpaid wages and to Stevenson\u2019s contingency fee agreement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">We address each question in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">The Trial Court May Award No More Than Three Times The Wages Withheld Without Bona Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">Under Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment Act, employees who successfully sue to recover unpaid wages also may be awarded additional damages. LE subsection 3\u2014507.1(b), captioned \u201c[ajward and costs,\u201d permits \u201cthe court [to] award the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ee <em>an amount not exceeding 3 times the wage, </em>and reasonable counsel fees and other costs.\u201d LE \u00a7 3-507.1(b)(emphasis added). BB &amp; T argues that the trial court erroneously interpreted this provision as authorization to award four times the amount of Stevenson\u2019s eligible unpaid wages. The bank reads section 3-507.1(b) as limiting the maximum award to three times any wrongfully withheld eligible wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">To our knowledge, neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has approved a Wage Payment Act damage award equal to four times the unpaid wage. On the other hand, there is no reported Maryland decision specifically holding that the treble damages provision of LE section 3-507.1(b) caps an employee\u2019s award at three times the unpaid wage. We shall explicitly adopt the latter construction based on a plain language interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The language creating the remedy and the penalty is simple: if there is no bona fide dispute justifying the employer\u2019s withholding of the wage, the employee\u2019s total compensatory plus punitive award may \u201cnot exceed[] 3 times the wage\u201d plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 3-507.1(b). That construction is consistent with the Court of Appeals\u2019 observation that section 3-507.1(b) authorizes a court to award <em>\u201cup to </em>treble damages.\u201d <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 517, 819 A.2d 354 (2003)(emphasis in original); <em>see also Battaglia v. Clinical Perfusionists, Inc., </em>338 Md. 352, 353-54, 658 A.2d 680 (1995)(\u201cThe Act provides, <em>inter alia, </em>for a private right of action for certain violations, in which up to three times the compensatory recovery may be awarded, together with counsel fees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Stevenson\u2019s reliance on language in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinions in <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 745 A.2d 1026 (2000), and <em>Baltimore Harbor Chanters, Ltd. v. Ayd, </em>365 Md. 366, 780 A.2d 303 (2001), for the proposition that the statute permits an award of both unpaid wages plus treble damages, is misplaced. In neither of those cases did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Court address the question of whether the statute authorizes treble damages in addition to the unpaid wage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Nor are we persuaded by Stevenson\u2019s analogy to the treble damages provision in federal trademark infringement law. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). The cited provision contains different language authorizing a federal court to increase the compensatory damage award by also awarding, in addition to those damages, \u201cany sum above the amount found as actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>U.S. Structures, Inc. v. J.P. Structures, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1185, 1191-92 (6th Cir.l997)(because statute vests district court with discretion \u201cto increase a damages award up to three times the actual damages sustained,\u201d award of four times actual damages was not error).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Rather, we find a more instructive analogy in Maryland law governing actions to recover another type of wrongfully withheld funds. In <em>Rohrbaugh v. Estate of Stern, </em>305 Md. 443, 505 A.2d 113 (1986), the Court interpreted Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-203(h)(3)(ii) of the Real Property Article, which creates a private right of action allowing a tenant to recover unreturned security deposits by bringing an \u201caction [for] up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d After Mrs. Stern died, landlord Rohrbaugh withheld her entire $675 security deposit. The trial court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>$67.50 of the deposit had been improperly withheld, but awarded Stern\u2019s estate $2,025, representing damages based on \u201cthe entire amount withheld by Rohrbaugh ($675 x 3 = $2,025).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 505 A.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The Court of Appeals vacated that award. It explained that section 8\u2014203(h)(3)(ii) is a punitive damages remedy that may be invoked when these funds are withheld without a reasonable basis. Resolving an ambiguity \u201cintroduced into this statutory provision during its recodification,\u201d the Court held that the trial court was statutorily authorized to treble only the $67.50 that had been improperly withheld. <em>See id. </em>at 451, 505 A.2d 113. Writing for the unanimous Court, Chief Judge Murphy explained that \u201cthe punitive damages recoverable under this section may not exceed threefold the amount of the security deposit withheld without a reasonable basis by the landlord, plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 505 A.2d 113. The Court then calculated the appropriate amount of the award, making it clear in the process that the total \u201ccompensatory plus punitive damages\u201d recovery in such cases may not exceed three times the improperly withheld funds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHP\">The trial judge in this case found from the evidence that $67.50 of the $675 security deposit was incorrectly withheld, and, furthermore, that the entire $67.50 was withheld without a reasonable basis. Accordingly, the amount of the judgment could not have been greater than $702.50 plus costs, calculated as follows: threefold the amount withheld without a reasonable basis ($67.50 x 3 = $202.50), plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees ($500).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 451, 505 A.2d 113 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Though worded somewhat differently, we view the treble damage provision in LE section 3-507.1(b) as the employer-employee analog to the treble damages provision in RP section 8\u2014203(h)(3)(ii). Both statutes create a civil remedy by which wrongfully withheld money can be recovered, along with litigation expenses and a substantial penalty that serves as an incentive for the payor not to stonewall without legitimate reason. We therefore find support for our construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>treble damages provision of the Wage Payment Act in the Court of Appeals\u2019 construction of Maryland\u2019s comparable statute permitting recovery of treble damages for wrongfully withheld security deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">We hold that the statutory damage formula when the trier of fact \u201cfinds that an employer withheld the wage of an employee in violation of [the Wage Payment Act] and not as a result of a bona fide dispute,\u201d and the court thereafter determines additional damages are appropriate, is as follows: \u201c(amount of wrongfully withheld wages) x (3 or less).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Stevenson May Be The Prevailing Party With Respect To Her Wage Payment Act Claim Concerning Eligible Wages</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We review the trial court\u2019s decision to award Stevenson attorney\u2019s fees under the Wage Payment Act for abuse of discretion and clear error. <em>See Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 512, 819 A.2d 354 (2003). BB &amp; T argues that the trial court erred in awarding Stevenson attorney\u2019s fees \u201cbecause she was not the prevailing party at trial. By almost every measure, the Bank, not Ms. Stevenson, was the prevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">BB &amp; T\u2019s complaint focuses on the standard governing this type of attorney\u2019s fee award. BB &amp; T defines \u201cprevailing party\u201d as \u201cthe party who prevails as to the substantial part of the litigation.\u201d <em>See Testa v. Village of Mundelein, Ill., </em>89 F.3d 443, 447 (7th Cir.1996). It interprets \u201csubstantial part\u201d as a purely quantitative measure. Pointing out that \u201cStevenson sought nearly $1,500,000.00 in damages under the Wage Act[,]\u201d the bank claims the victor should be measured solely by bottom line results. It argues, \u201cStevenson proved actual damages in an amount barely equal to one percent of the amount she sought, ... and recovered barely four percent[.]\u201d We find the bank\u2019s \u201cpure bottom line\u201d standard too narrow. In <em>Friolo, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized that federal courts characterize a plaintiff as the prevailing party when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201csucceeds on any significant issue that achieves some of the benefit sought in bringing the action; he or she does not have to win it all to be regarded as prevailing.\u201d <em>Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 523, 819 A.2d 354 (emphasis added)(reviewing <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). Similarly, in <em>Brown v. Hornbeck, </em>54 Md.App. 404, 412, 458 A.2d 900 (1983), this Court held that \u201cplaintiffs may be considered the prevailing parties \u2018if a significant issue is resolved so as to achieve some of the benefit through litigation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">This is the standard that the trial court appears to have applied when it concluded that Stevenson was the prevailing party. For the same reasons we must vacate the Wage Payment Act judgment, however, we must also vacate the attorney\u2019s fee award. We decline to speculate on the outcome of any attorney\u2019s fee request after remand. On remand, the trial court will determine whether Stevenson is the prevailing party with respect those eligible wages that she may recover under the Wage Payment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Attorney\u2019s Fees May Be Awarded Only For Work Performed On Wage Act Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Stevenson complains that the trial court should not have excluded from the fee award expenses for legal work on whether her stock option earnings must be used to calculate Termination Compensation. <em>See </em>Part III <em>infra. </em>Based on our ruling that Stevenson may not recover unpaid Termination Compensation under the Wage Payment Act, the stock options issue is relevant only to the breach of contract claim. Because there is no attorney\u2019s fee provision in Stevenson\u2019s employment agreement, the remand court may not award Stevenson attorney\u2019s fees for work performed on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">As discussed above, however, the court may award Stevenson reasonable fees and expenses that she incurred in successfully pursuing a claim under the Wage Payment Act. <em>See Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 529-30, 819 A.2d 354 (fee award for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>successful Wage Payment Act claim should be liberally granted). Below, we briefly review the method by which such a fee award should be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Determination Of Reasonable Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Both parties challenge the manner in which the trial court determined the attorney\u2019s fee award. Stevenson argues that the trial court erred in setting the amount of those fees at one-third of the post-remittitur award for unpaid wages. In addition to misinterpreting and improperly relying on the contingency fee agreement between Stevenson and her attorneys, she asserts, the court also failed to follow the Court of Appeals\u2019 instructions in <em>Friolo </em>to use the lodestar method, adjusted on the basis of specific factors, and to \u201cgive a clear explanation of the factors [it] employed in arriving at the end result[.]\u201d <em>See Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 528, 819 A.2d 354 (court may not use proportion of judgment as sole mathematical basis for attorney\u2019s fee award, and may award amount that exceeds judgment in cases involving fee-shifting statute); <em>Blaylock v. Johns Hopkins Fed. Credit Union, </em>152 Md.App. 338, 359, 831 A.2d 1120 (2003)(same). Finally, Stevenson complains that the award \u201cwas based in part on the belief that an attorney should not recover more than the client,\u201d a proportionality precept that \u201ccannot be applied in cases involving a fee-shifting statute.\u201d <em>See Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 528, 819 A.2d 354; <em>Blaylock, </em>152 Md.App. at 359, 831 A.2d 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">On cross-appeal, BB &amp; T complains that Stevenson\u2019s attorneys are not entitled to a fee that is several multiples of her actual damages. In its view, strict application of the lodestar analysis, although unnecessary, indicates that counsel was overcompensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Having vacated the attorney\u2019s fee award along with the Wage Payment Act judgment, we need not dissect it for each of these errors. On remand, the court may consider any fee request that reflects the limited nature of Stevenson\u2019s Wage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Payment Act claims following this appeal<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the proceedings on remand. For the guidance of the court and parties, we summarize the standards by which such an award should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In <em>Friolo, </em>the Court of Appeals described the appropriate analysis in awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to LE section 3-507.1(b). Although \u201c[t]here is no statutory requirement that\u201d a court must award reasonable counsel fees for a successful claim under the Wage Payment Act, \u201cit is clear .. . that the Legislature intended that discretion to be exercised liberally in favor of awarding fees ... in appropriate cases.\u201d <em>Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 515, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Stevenson is correct that a court may not determine attorney\u2019s fees by simply awarding a selected proportion of the compensatory judgment, or otherwise engaging in a cost-benefit analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 529, 819 A.2d 354; <em>Blaylock, </em>152 Md.App. at 356, 831 A.2d 1120. Instead, the court should ordinarily begin its analysis using the lodestar approach\u2014 determining the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation, then multiplying those hours by a reasonable hourly rate. <em>See Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 512, 819 A.2d 354. This creates an objective basis for an estimate of the value of services provided by counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 523, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">From there, reductions may be taken for a variety of reasons, including inadequate documentation of hours and work that is duplicative, excessive, unnecessary, or unsuccessful. <em>See id. </em>at 523-24, 528-29, 819 A.2d 354; <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433-34, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939-40, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). When the claimant has had only partial success, the court may refuse to award fees that were incurred on an unsuccessful claim that is unrelated to a successful claim. <em>See Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 524-25, 819 A.2d 354. Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>reductions to the lodestar amount may be based on the particular circumstances presented by the case, as measured by factors set forth in Rule 1.5 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 527 &amp; n. 3, 529, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">When doing so, however, the court must \u201cmake appropriate findings, so that the parties and any reviewing appellate court can follow the reasoning and test the validity of the findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529, 819 A.2d 354. It also must avoid using a strict \u201cproportionality test\u201d to judge the reasonableness of a fee request. <em>See, e.g., Blaylock, </em>152 Md.App. at 355-56, 831 A.2d 1120 (\u201cif attorney fee awards in [cases arising under fee-shifting statutes] do not provide a reasonable return, it will be economically impossible for attorneys to represent their client\u201d). And it should not treat a contingency fee agreement as an automatic cap on the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Blanchard v. Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 93, 109 S.Ct. 939, 944, 103 L.Ed.2d 67 (1989)(contingency fee agreement may aid court in determining reasonable amount of attorney\u2019s fees, but \u201cdoes not impose an automatic ceiling on an award of attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). On remand, the court should follow these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>guidelines and explain any adjustments it makes to the lodestar figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">JUDGMENTS VACATED.

Taylor, </em>312 Md. 609, 624, 541 A.2d 969 (1988). Ordinarily, a plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of a remittitur will bar her appeal. <em>See Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 458, 578 A.2d 745 (1990). This rule does not apply in all circumstances, however. <em>See id. </em>at 459, 578 A.2d 745. \u201cThe \u2018norma! situations in which the rule precluding appeal has been invoked are those that involve an appeal by the plaintiff with none by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In this instance, appeals by Stevenson and BB &amp; T were anticipated at the time Stevenson accepted the remittitur in lieu of a new trial. At that time, counsel for Stevenson and the trial court, explicitly agreed, without objection from counsel for BB &amp; T, that Stevenson's acceptance of the remittitur would not be taken as an acquiescence barring appeal. BB &amp; T does not argue that Stevenson's acceptance of the remittitur bars her appeal, and under these circumstances, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>that it is not barred. <em>See Banegura, </em>312 Md. at 615, 541 A.2d 969 (rule barring appeal after acceptance of remittitur \"has been variously characterized as grounded upon notions of estoppel, waiver, acquiescence, acceptance of benefits, or mootness\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-11\">.

The reason for bifurcating the attorney's fee claim from the underlying Wage Payment Act claim was evidently that the decision about whether BB &amp; T violated the prompt payment requirements is for the jury while the decision about whether Stevenson should receive counsel fees, and if so how much, is for the court.

The Indiana Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion in a similar situation involving severance pay. In <em>Wank v. Saint Francis College, </em>740 N.E.2d 908 (Ind.Ct.App.2000), a college that was merging with another institution terminated a long time college employee, but offered severance pay. The Indiana court held that the severance pay was a gratuitous bonus for faithful service, rather than wages, because the employee had no right to the payment under the terms of his employment contract, the payment was not connected to work performed by the employee and was not otherwise deferred compensation. <em>See id. </em>at 913-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b664-5\">. Courts in other jurisdictions have construed analogous wage payment statutes to include severance pay, citing inclusive statutory language, as well as the legislature\u2019s preventive and remedial goals of promoting timely payment of all compensation owed to an employee after termination. <em>See, e.g., Kulinski v.

Although we have ruled that Stevenson cannot recover unpaid Termination Compensation under the Wage Payment Act, we recognize that the Act does provide her a remedy to recover other unpaid wages that she earned before she was fired, such as any vacation pay or deferred compensation accumulated during her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">During this litigation, BB &amp; T admitted that it did not pay Stevenson all of her accumulated vacation pay. It is unclear whether Stevenson contends that she was entitled to more. Moreover, we are uncertain whether, notwithstanding the bank\u2019s payment, she is seeking the additional statutory damages available under the Act based on the bank\u2019s failure to pay Stevenson within the time period prescribed by LE section 3-505. Even assuming the bank paid Stevenson in full for all her accrued vacation before trial, Stevenson nevertheless was entitled to pursue her claim that BB &amp; T violated the Wage Payment Act by not timely paying such wages, that its failure to pay was not the result of a bona fide dispute, and that Stevenson should be awarded additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>statutory damages as well as attorney's fees and expenses incurred to recover such wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Moreover, it is unclear whether BB &amp; T also admitted that Stevenson earned deferred compensation before termination, or whether Stevenson claims that she did. It is also unclear whether any of the lump sum payment the bank made to Stevenson before trial represented payment for deferred compensation earned before termination. The same principles applicable to unpaid vacation benefits that qualify as \u201cwages\u201d under the Act would apply equally to any unpaid deferred compensation that qualifies as \u201cwages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">We leave the resolution of these factual issues for the remand proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">.
