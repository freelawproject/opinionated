Vol. &amp; 2001 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">An Administrative Law Judge found that the DSS had correctly found \u201cindicated child sexual abuse\u201d in a case in which Danny Russell, appellee, was accused of molesting his daughter\u2019s teenage friend. At issue in this appeal is whether, because the DSS had failed to include in the record before the ALJ, an audio recording of a statement made by appellee to investigators, the record was incomplete. The circuit court ruled that failure to provide the audio tape resulted in an incomplete record, and remanded the case to the Office of Administrative Hearings for the receiving of additional evidence, to wit, the audio tape.</p>\n<p id=\"AhC\">Appellant presents for our review three questions, which restated, are:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>1. Did the circuit court err by ordering remand on the ground that the record was incomplete because of the absence of an audio recording of appellee\u2019s statement to investigators?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\"><em>2. </em>Did the circuit court err by ordering the Office of Administrative Hearings to presume, should the audio recording not be produced, that the information on the audio tape was unfavorable to the DSS?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We answer \u201cNo\u201d to both questions, and shall affirm. For the reasons stated herein, we hold that the audio tape of Russell\u2019s joint interview with the DSS and Sheriffs Department investigators should have been included in the record provided to Russell and the Office of Administrative Hearings, and shall affirm the decision of the circuit court. Because this case will be remanded to the Office of Administrative Hearings for further proceedings, we need not reach the substantive issues presented by appellant\u2019s questions two and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">FACTS and PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Since we will not address the substantive and sufficiency issues raised, a brief recitation of the facts will serve the purpose of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">On March 18, 2000, the DSS received information that a 16 year-old girl, \u201cD.,\u201d had been sexually abused by her friend\u2019s father on two separate occasions. The DSS assigned an assessor and the Sheriffs Department assigned a detective to conduct a joint investigation of the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">On March 15, 2000, the investigators interviewed \u201cD.\u201d at her school. Although reluctant to discuss the incidents, \u201cD.\u201d eventually identified appellee as her abuser, and informed the investigators that he had touched her inappropriately on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\n<em>The Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The DSS and Sheriffs Department conducted a joint investigation of the allegations, as required by Md.Code Ann., Fam. L. \u00a7 5-706, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u00a7 5-706. Investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general\u2014Promptly after receiving a report of suspected abuse of neglect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">(1) the local department or the appropriate law enforcement agency, or both, if jointly agreed on, shall make a thorough investigation of a report of suspected abuse to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the child or children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">(f) <em>Joint investigation </em>procedure.\u2014(1) The agencies responsible for investigating reported cases of suspected sexual abuse, including the local department, the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and the local State\u2019s Attorney, shall implement a joint investigation procedure for conducting join investigations sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The implementation of the mandate of \u00a7 5-706(a)(l) is found in Fam. L. \u00a7 5-706(e), which provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALI\">(e) <em>Written agreement to specify standard operation proce</em>dures.\u2014The local department, the appropriate law enforcement agencies, the State\u2019s Attorney within each county and Baltimore City, the department\u2019s office responsible for child care regulation, and the local health officer, shall enter into a written agreement that specifies standard operating procedure for the investigation and prosecution of reported cases of suspect abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">In compliance with that directive, an interagency agreement was developed and became operative on October 22, 1992. Among the parties to the agreement were the DSS and the Cecil County Sheriffs Department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The joint investigation of the allegations against Russell included interviews of \u201cD.,\u201d her mother, Russell, Russell\u2019s daughter, and two other witnesses. As a result of the interviews, the DSS found Russell responsible for \u201cindicated child abuse\u201d on August 3, 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\n<em>The Administrative Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Russell appealed the finding of indicated sexual abuse, asserting that the finding was wrong because he had no \u201cinappropriate contact whatsoever with the alleged victim.\u201d A contested case hearing was held by an ALJ from the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) on March 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">During the course of the hearing, testimony concerning the nature of the joint investigation, and the contents of the DSS record, were provided. The DSS successfully sought admission of the Sheriffs Department report, over Russell\u2019s objection. The DSS counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">Your Honor, this document constitutes a part of the case record that is reviewed and examined by the case worker during the course of her investigation. Quite frankly, this particular document denotes interviews that [the DSS investigator] was actually present for also. [The DSS investigator] works in combination with [the Sheriffs Department investigator], they did the investigation jointly, and this was a product of that investigation and is relevant to the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aund\">The Sheriffs Department report contained the statement that \u201c[Russell] was advised that [the] interview would be audio taped,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that report became part of the record, as did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Russell\u2019s written statement, taken during an interview conducted by the DSS and the Sheriffs Department. That statement remained in the custody of the Sheriff until requested by the DSS for inclusion in the record. The audio recording made of Russell\u2019s interview was not part of the record. The detective who investigated the allegations on behalf of the Sheriffs Department did not testify before the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">When cross-examined about the joint interview with Russell, the DSS investigator testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">Q. And this was a joint investigation you said between you and the Sheriffs Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">A, Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">Q. The interview with Mr. Russell was taped, was it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayk\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">Q. Do you have a copy of the tape?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">A. I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">Q. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">A. I don\u2019t have that information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">Q. But you have everything else. You\u2019ve got the Sheriffs report, you have a copy of his written statement, I believe a copy of his Miranda advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-14\">A. Um-hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-15\">Q. Why don\u2019t you have the tape?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-16\">A. I don\u2019t have it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-17\">Q. Wouldn\u2019t that be certainly the best evidence of what was said during that interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-18\">A. I don\u2019t have that information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-19\">On re-direct examination, the investigator further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auo\">Q. And even though the interview [with Russell] was tape recorded, audio tape recorded at the Sheriffs Department, who is in possession of those tapes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-20\">A. The law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Q. Is it your understanding that the tape remains in the possession of the Sheriffs office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">Q. Okay. Any has the tape ever been part of your case record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The ALJ ruled that the DSS\u2019s finding that Russell was responsible for \u201cindicated child sexual abuse\u201d was supported by credible evidence and was consistent with the law. As a result, the ALJ ruled that the DSS could \u201cidentify [Russell] as an individual responsible for indicated child sexual abuse in a central registry and in its other files.\u201d In so ruling, the ALJ made specific findings that Russell and his daughter were not credible witnesses, but that the DSS investigator and victim, \u201cD.,\u201d were credible witnesses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After receiving the ALJ\u2019s decision, appellee filed a timely petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Cecil County.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">\n<em>The Circuit Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\"><em>On </em>November 16, 2001, a hearing was held in the circuit court. The court held the matter <em>sub curia </em>and issued a Memorandum and Order on March 28, 2003, remanding the case to the OAH for the development of further evidence, specifically the audio tape of the Russell interview. Although the DSS argued before the circuit court, as it does here, that the tape was not part of its record, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">The local department iterates throughout the record that this was a joint investigation between DSS and the Cecil County Sheriffs Department. In fact, [the Department investigator] testified on cross that the investigation was a joint investigation between the local department and the Sheriffs Department. [The Sheriffs Department investigator\u2019s] report also states, quite explicitly, that \u201c[t]his writer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>will conduct a <em>joint investigation </em>with [DSS].\u201d Consistent with both agencies\u2019 description of the investigation as a joint endeavor, the local department obtained a copy of [the Sheriffs Department\u2019s] report, Appellant\u2019s written statement, and Appellant\u2019s Miranda form from the Sheriffs Department. Both the written statement and the Miranda form were taken during the interview that was audio taped at the Sheriffs Department. The same is true of notes taken by [the detective], which were later incorporated as part of [the Sheriffs Department] report. The local department provided Appellant with copies of all of these documents as part of the redacted record, in full compliance with [COMAR] \u00a7 07.02.26.11. Moreover, the record reveals that [the detective] provided the local State\u2019s Attorney with a copy of his report as required under FL \u00a7 5\u2014706(f)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">When viewed in light of FL \u00a7 5\u2014706(f)(1), <em>Hutton [v. State, </em>339 Md. 480, 663 A.2d 1289 (1995)], and <em>Craig [v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 250, 544 A.2d 784 (1988)], these facts demonstrate that the investigation into \u201cD\u2019s\u201d allegation was clearly conducted as a joint investigation between DSS and the Cecil County Sheriffs Department. The implication of this finding in the case at bar is that the audio tape, which was made by the Sheriffs Department as part of the joint investigation into \u201cD\u2019s\u201d allegation, is considered to be documentary material made the [sic] local department, as well. The local department, however, failed to procure and provide the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">The local department has entirely failed to proffer a rationale as to why [the detective\u2019s] report, Appellant\u2019s statement, and the Miranda rights were collected by the local department and provided to Appellant while the audio tape was not. At the contested case hearing, the only response [the local Department investigator] could provide to the question, \u201c[w]hy don\u2019t you have the tape?\u201d was \u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d A reading of COMAR \u00a7 07.02.26.11(A) reveals that \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">The audio tape was clearly documentary material made by the Sheriffs Department (and therefore made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>local department) during the course of the joint investigation. The local department was required to provide Appellant with the redacted record, including the audio tape, not less than 14 days before the scheduled hearing. The local department, however, failed to provide the tape, in direct contravention of \u00a7 07.02.26.11(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">Here, the local department failed to produce the audio tape as required pursuant to COMAR \u00a7 07.02.26.11. Production of the audio tape was peculiarly within the power of the Sheriffs Department, which holds the only copy of the tape. Under these circumstances, it should have been natural for the local department to obtain a copy of the audio tape and to include the copy in the redacted record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">In cases such as the one at bar, where the outcome will turn on little more than which of two persons is to be believed, possible inferences, whether naturally or legally raised, become crucial. <em>Hayes [v. State], </em>57 Md.App. [489] at 501, 470 A.2d 1301. The ALJ\u2019s decision was entirely based upon inferences that were drawn from the testimony of witnesses and the information contained in the record. The weight that the ALJ attached to the credibility of the witnesses here was crucial to the outcome of the case. The local department\u2019s failure to enter the audio tape into the record prejudiced Appellant\u2019s defense and deprived the ALJ of information that may have influenced her decision. Accordingly, the local department\u2019s failure to provide Appellant with a copy of the tape should have raised the presumption at the contested case hearing that the information contained on the tape, if the tape were provided, would be unfavorable to the local department. In weighing the evidence, however, the ALJ failed to make this determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">Based on the foregoing, this case is remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the local department shall obtain a copy of the audio tape from the Sheriff\u2019s department and insert the tape as part of the redacted record. In addition, the local department shall provide a copy of the audio tape to counsel for the Appellant. If, on remand, the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>department fails to provide Appellant with a copy of the audio tape, then the ALJ shall find that this omission gives rise to the presumption that the audio tape, if produced, would be unfavorable to the local department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">Finally, because this case is remanded for a new contested case hearing, the thicket of additional issues raised by Appellant in his Appeal Brief need not be addressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In view of the court\u2019s order of remand, it did not reach the substantive or sufficiency questions. The DSS filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">SCOPE and STANDARD of REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">This Court\u2019s review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is quite narrow. The scope and standard of appellate review has been described as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">essentially the same as the circuit court\u2019s scope of review. We must review the administrative decision itself. <em>Pub. Svce. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691 (1974); <em>State Election Bd. v.

Vol., 2000 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 5-701(k) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d); COMAR 07.02.07.12A(2). Cases in which child sexual abuse is \u201cindicated\u201d may be included in a central registry of child abuse and neglect cases that is maintained by a local department of social services (a \u201clocal department\u201d). <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-714. [The local Department\u2019s] registry is part of a network of similar registries maintained by other county social services departments throughout Maryland. <em>See id. </em>In many cases, the identity of a person whom a local department has determined was responsible for child sexual abuse may be discerned from these networked central registries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>\n<em>Judicial Review Of Administrative Decision</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">In a contested case proceeding to determine the validity of a local department\u2019s disposition of a particular child sexual abuse case, the administrative law judge has a fact finding role. <em>See C.S. v.

P.F., </em>137 Md.App. 243, 262-65, 768 A.2d 112 (2001) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">We shall first address the DSS\u2019s argument that appellee waived his right to challenge the exclusion of the audio tape from the administrative record because he did not file a subpoena requesting its inclusion or production before the administrative hearing. We find no merit in that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Appellee argues that the record provided was incomplete because the DSS failed to include the audio tape. We conclude that Md.Code Ann., Fam. L. \u00a7 5-701(t), which we shall discuss in greater detail, <em>infra, </em>requires the inclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>audio tape. Therefore, appellee was not required to request a subpoena to assure its inclusion in the administrative record. Although appellee suggests he requested the audio tape, his appeal rests on the DSS failure to include it as part of the record provided to him during the regular course of the appeal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">As we have noted, appellee\u2019s counsel objected to the introduction of the Sheriffs Department report, which was based in part on the recorded interview, on the basis that the audio tape had not been provided to him or made a part of the record. While more careful preparation for the administrative hearing might have alerted appellee that the audio tape was not a part of the record provided by the DSS, that failure does not amount to a waiver. Because of the statutory mandate it was not necessary for appellee to request or subpoena the audio tape to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>1. Did the circuit court err by ordering remand on the ground that the record was incomplete because of the absence of an audio recording of appellee\u2019s statement to investigators?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Determining whether the circuit court erred by ordering a remand requires us to decide whether the audio tape ought to have been part of the DSS record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If so, it was error for the DSS not to provide it, and for the ALJ not to order its inclusion in the record. The result, therefore, would be a decision based on an incomplete record, thereby requiring remand to the OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>As required by Fam. L. \u00a7 5-706(f), an inter-agency agreement was created, involving, among others, the Cecil County DSS and the Cecil County Sheriffs Department. The agreement details how joint investigations are to be conducted. Fam. L. \u00a7 5\u2014706(f). The relevant agreement before us provides with respect to purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">Since a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency approach is necessary and crucial for effective intervention and service to abused children and their families, a multi-agency team is established to include participation from those parties mentioned above. This approach will encourage the sharing of vital information so as to enhance their ability to protect children and to cooperatively serve their families.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">This team is created to ensure:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Att\">1. coordination in the investigation of reports of suspect- - ed child abuse ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Upon completion of an investigation, the local DSS must determine whether there is evidence that abuse has occurred. If the DSS makes a finding that the abuse has been indicated, it must notify the alleged abuser in writing. Fam. L. \u00a7 5-706.1(a). The alleged abuser may request a contested case hearing, as provided by Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article (the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act), to dispute the determination. <em>Id. </em>at (b). The APA assures to the alleged abuser certain rights concerning the nature and form of the hearing, but allows each agency to adopt regulations concerning the procedures for an administrative appeal involving that agency. Md.Code Ann., Gov\u2019t. \u00a7 10-206. <em>See, e.g., C.S. v. Prince George\u2019s County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>343 Md. 14, 26, 680 A.2d 470 (1996). Pursuant to the regulations adopted by the Department of Human Resources, of which the local departments of social services are a component, only limited discovery is available. The relevant provision in the Code of Maryland Administrative Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The local department shall provide the appellant with the redacted record not less than 14 days before the scheduled hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">COMAR 07.02.26.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The definitions of \u201crecord\u201d provided, respectively, by the General Assembly, in the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code, and the COMAR regulations of the Department of Human Resources, are slightly different. That difference, in part, gives rise to the question raised in this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">The Family Law Article defines the \u201crecord\u201d for review as: [T]he original or any copy of any documentary material, in any form, including a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, that is made by, received by, or received from the State, a county, or a municipal corporation in the state, or any subdivision or agency concerning a case of alleged child abuse or neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Md.Code Ann., Fam. L. \u00a7 5-701 (t).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The pertinent COMAR provision, concerning the procedures for child abuse and neglect hearings, provides the following definition of \u201crecord\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApZ\">[T]he original or a copy of any documentary material, in any form, including a report of alleged or suspected abuse or neglect, concerning an incident of alleged child abuse or neglect, that is made or received by a local department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">COMAR 07.02.26.02(B)(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">The DSS argues that because it did not \u201cmake, consider, or possess the tape,\u201d it was not required to provide a copy to Russell in the redacted record mandated by COMAR 07.02.26.il.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The DSS argument follows this line: that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>agent participated in the investigation with the Sheriffs Department; that the participation was not truly \u201cjoint\u201d because it was limited to the interview process; that, even though the DSS obtained the resulting Sheriffs Office report, the investigating detective\u2019s notes of the interview, and Russell\u2019s statement, it chose not to obtain the interview tape; ergo, because the audio tape remained in the custody of the Sheriff, it was not part of the DSS records and not subject to mandatory disclosure as part of the redacted administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Appellee argues, in contrast, that because the DSS and the Sheriff\u2019s Department conducted a joint investigation, the records of both agencies were part of the overall record of the investigation. Underlying appellee\u2019s argument is the theme that it would be unfair to permit the DSS to pick and choose the aspects of the joint investigation that form the record for purposes of disclosure under COMAR 07.02.26.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">For the reasons we shall discuss, we agree with appellee and hold that the audio tape of the interview with the DSS and Sheriffs Department investigators should have been provided to both the Office of Administrative Hearings and Russell prior to the administrative hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The DSS does not contend that a joint investigation did not occur, as required by statute and the inter-agency agreement. What appellant contends, however, is that the documents and materials generated by the investigation are not in the joint custody of the investigating agencies. As a result, the DSS considered the audio tape to be the property of the Sheriffs Department, over which the DSS had no control.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Hence, the DSS posits, it was not required to include that material in the record that it developed. We do not accept that rationale. In our view, the inter-agency agreement, and the practice of joint investigations, creates a partnership between, or among, the agencies, in which each is the agent of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The audio tape was made during a joint interview, in which the DSS investigator actively participated. It falls within the definition of \u201cdocumentary material,\u201d and therefore is part of the \u201crecord\u201d as defined by Fam. L. \u00a7 5\u2014701(t). Thus, it is a part of the \u201crecord\u201d that should have been provided to appellee prior to the contested case hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Where the language of a statute differs from relevant language in a departmental regulation, the statutory language must control. <em>See, e.g., Medstar Health v. Maryland Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Md. 1, 21, 827 A.2d 83 (2003) (Moreover, where \u201cthe General Assembly has delegated ... broad power to an administrative agency to adopt [legislative rules] or regulations [in a particular area], this Court has upheld the agency\u2019s rule or regulations as long as they did not contradict the language or purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Christ v. Department of Nat Res., supra, </em>335 Md. 427, 437-38, 644 A.2d 34, 39 (1994); <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 689, 684 A.2d 804, 807-808 (1996)). The statute must be read to include the entire record of an investigation, whether normally kept in the physical custody of the DSS or other participating agencies. The narrower COMAR definition of \u201crecord\u201d must give way to the broader, more inclusive definition in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The DSS investigator and Sheriffs Department detective together conducted an investigation of the allegations against Russell. The reports of both agencies, and the notes provided to the ALJ, indicate that their interviews with appellee, the victim, and the other witnesses, were jointly conducted, and that the investigators freely shared information. The relevant joint investigation agreement, signed by the DSS and the Sheriffs Department, describe the relationship as a \u201cteam.\u201d That information was to be freely shared within the \u201cteam\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>apparent. Even if the DSS investigator did not rely on the audio tape in creating her report, as she indicated in an affidavit filed with the circuit court,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> she had an access to it not enjoyed by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Guiding our analysis is a basic principle of administrative law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">[Administrative bodies are not ordinarily bound by the strict rules of evidence of a law court. <em>Hyson v. Montgomery County Council, </em>242 Md. 55, 70, 217 A.2d 578, 587 (1966). In that connection, we stated in <em>American Radio-Telephone Service, Inc. v. Public Service Commission, </em>33 Md.App. 423, 434-35, 365 A.2d 314, 320 (1976), \u201c[ajlthough administrative agencies are not bound by the technical common law rules of evidence, they must observe the basic rules of fairness as to the parties appearing before them.\u201d <em>See Dickenson [Dickinson]-Tidewater, Inc. v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>273 Md. 245, 253, 329 A.2d 18, 24 (1974); <em>Montgomery County v. National Capital Realty, </em>267 Md. 364, 376, 297 A.2d 675, 681 (1972); <em>Dal Maso v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>238 Md. 333, 337, 209 A.2d 62, 64 (1965). Procedural due process in administrative law is recognized to be a matter of greater flexibility than that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>strictly judicial proceedings. <em>NLRB v. Prettyman, </em>117 F.2d 786, 790 (6th Cir.1941); <em>Lacomastic Corp. v. Parker, </em>54 F.Supp. 138, 141 (D.Md., 1944). The concept of due process requires that we examine \u201cthe totality of the procedures afforded rather than the absence or presence of particularized factors.\u201d <em>Boulware v. Battaglia, </em>344 F.Supp. [889] at 904.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><em>Widomski v. Chief of Police of Baltimore County, </em>41 Md.App. 361, 378-79, 397 A.2d 222 (1979). The concept that an administrative proceeding must be fundamentally fair to the parties pervades Maryland\u2019s administrative law. <em>See, e.g., Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981); <em>Rogers v. Radio Shack, </em>271 Md. 126, 314 A.2d 113 (1974); <em>Bernstein v. Bd. of Ed. of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>245 Md. 464, 226 A.2d 243 (1967); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Hartley, </em>150 Md.App. 581, 822 A.2d 537 (2003); <em>Bryant v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety and Correctional Servs., </em>33 Md.App. 357, 365 A.2d 764 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The audio tape provides the most accurate, contemporaneous record of Russell\u2019s statements to the investigators. If the investigators did not rely on the tape to make their reports, it would have been the best source for the preparation of accurate written reports. Likewise, fairness requires that Russell should have the opportunity to use the recording to test the statements and conclusions made by the investigators in their reports, and to test their credibility and recall, if necessary. During the administrative hearing, Russell\u2019s counsel demonstrated instances where discrepancies between his testimony and the investigators\u2019 statements concerning the interview might easily have been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\n<em>An Analogy: A Criminal Defendant\u2019s Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AsX\">Had Russell been charged with crimes as a result of the investigation, the State\u2019s Attorney would have been under a duty to disclose the audio tape.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2) (2003) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Statements of the defendant. As to all statements made by the defendant to a State agent that the State intends to use at a hearing or trial, furnish to the defendant ... (A) a copy of each written or recorded statement[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>the prosecution did not provide to the defendant, or introduce, his pre-trial statement, but elicited testimony about the statement from a police officer. The Court of Appeals determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">The State shall not be allowed so disingenuously to circumvent the pre-trial disclosure mandated by Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A) by the device of using a derivative version of Petitioner\u2019s statement through [a police officer\u2019s] testimony. We hold that, upon request of the defendant, the State must furnish a defendant\u2019s apparently available recorded statement made to a State agent, even if the State intends only to use the content of the recorded statement at trial, irrespective of whether the physical recording itself is intended for use as direct evidence at trial. For us to hold otherwise would render Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A) a nullity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">The State\u2019s argument that it provided the \u201csubstance\u201d of Petitioner\u2019s oral statement, pursuant to Rule 4-263(b)(2)(B), does not relieve it of its companion obligation to produce the recorded statement under Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A). Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2) cannot be parsed as the State wishes. To allow the State to satisfy its discovery obligations under Rule 4-263(b)(2)(B), in lieu of Rule 4-263(b)(2)(A), would grant the State largely unchecked discretion to summarize, edit, or characterize the content of a defendant\u2019s recorded statement in any form it chooses. This violates the spirit and letter of discovery of a recorded statement as provided by the rule. When a recorded statement is available, the \u201csubstance\u201d of the oral delivery of the statement, as determined by the State, may not substitute for, or even be able to describe, the nuances, qualities, or manner in which the interrogation was conducted. A principal purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>rule is to provide \u201cfor the discovery of statements which might possibly have been unlawfully obtained.\u201d <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Brown, </em>327 Md. [81] at 92, 607 A.2d [923] at 928. Mere production of the \u201csubstance\u201d of a defendant\u2019s recorded statement risks thwarting defense counsel\u2019s ability to determine the lawfulness of the interrogation or the evidence that stems from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><em>Johnson v.

The Court determined that the defendant should have been able to examine both. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 360, 667 A.2d 999. Even though <em>Butler, supra, </em>concerns the written notes of a witness, the principle remains the same when the document in question is a recorded statement. Both investigators relied on Russell\u2019s statements in creating their reports. The audio tape should have been made available, by inclusion in the record, prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\n<em>Relevant Statements Made By or Information About Other Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The Court of Appeals and this Court have found that the prosecution must, provide a defendant with certain statements made by, or information about, other witnesses in criminal proceedings. In <em>Conyers v. State, </em>367 Md. 571, 790 A.2d 15, <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 942, 123 S.Ct. 341, 154 L.Ed.2d 249 (2002), a capital murder case, the defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the prosecution had failed to provide impeachment evidence about its key witness. The evidence included information that the witness sought to benefit from testifying against Conyers. The Court of Appeals concluded that the evidence was material and should have been disclosed. <em>Id. </em>at 612-13, 790 A.2d 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Similarly, this Court determined recently that a defendant should have the benefit of all information available to the prosecution about a State\u2019s witnesses, because revelation of such information is the only way to assure thorough and effective cross-examination. <em>Williams v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 200, 228, 831 A.2d 501 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The DSS investigator relied on statements made by Russell in concluding that he was responsible for indicated sexual abuse. Her notes, although created contemporaneously with the interview, may be self-serving and are not the most reliable record of the content of appellant\u2019s statement. The most reliable record is the audio tape, which may provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>sustenance to appellee\u2019s position (but just as likely may well bolster the DSS conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The DSS participated in the creation of the audio tape, even if the tape did not remain in its physical custody. Nothing in the notes made by either the DSS investigator or the detective indicate that they made clear to Russell that the tape would not be reviewed by the DSS investigator, or that it would be retained exclusively for the Sheriffs Department\u2019s use. Appellee should have the benefit of challenging the DSS\u2019s determination by use of the most reliable, and least self-serving, evidence available from the joint investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\n<em>2.

In addition, the local department shall provide a copy of the audio tape to counsel for the Appellant. If, on remand, the local department fails to provide Appellant with a copy of the audio tape, then the ALJ shall find that this omission gives rise to the presumption that the audio tape, if produced, would be unfavorable to the local department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">In <em>Miller v. Montgomery County, </em>64 Md.App. 202, 214, 494 A.2d 761, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 299, 498 A.2d 1185 (1985), Judge Bloom, writing for this Court, explained the consequences of spoliation of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">The destruction or alteration of evidence by a party gives rise to inferences or presumptions unfavorable to the spoliator, the nature of the inference being dependent upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>intent or motivation of the party. Unexplained and intentional destruction of evidence by a litigant gives rise to an inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to his cause, but would not in itself amount to substantive proof of a fact essential to prove his opponent\u2019s case. The maxim, <em>Omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatem, </em>\u201call things are presumed against the spoliator,\u201d rests upon a logical proposition that one would ordinarily not destroy evidence favorable to himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">As we later pointed out in <em>Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 694 A.2d 150 (1997)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\"><em>Miller </em>makes clear that two levels of inferences could have been drawn from Bramble\u2019s discarding most of the tarp system. If the jury concluded that Bramble\u2019s decision to throw away the tarp was merely the product of innocent mistake, the jury could still presume that, at the time of the accident, the tarp was in a defective, or otherwise unfavorable, condition. If, on the other hand, the jury was convinced that Bramble had a fraudulent intent to conceal the nature of the tarp\u2019s defective condition, the jury could also infer Bramble\u2019s consciousness of the fact that its case was weak. Thus, under <em>Miller, </em>an adverse presumption may rise against the spoliator even if there is no evidence of fraudulent intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">115 Md.App. at 561, 694 A.2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The circuit court\u2019s direction to the ALJ to apply a presumption that the content of the tape would be unfavorable to the DSS is partially legally correct. Because this issue will arise at a subsequent hearing, we offer guidance to the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">As we read <em>Miller </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>we conclude that, upon remand, the administrative law judge must make a factual determination regarding the circumstances of destruction of the audio tape. An intentional or willful destruction of the evidence could support a presumption unfavorable to the DSS; however, the mere inability to produce the audio tape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>would support an adverse inference rather than a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">We affirm the judgment of the circuit court, and remand this case to the Office of Administrative Hearings for further appropriate proceedings in compliance with this opinion. Because we affirm the order of remand, we need not reach appellant\u2019s remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY AFFIRMED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-11\">.

The documents and evidence described in the affidavit are singularly part of the differing purposes of the parties' investigation\u2014the DSS is assigned to investigate child sexual abuse with respect to the victim's well-being. Law enforcement investigates child sexual abuse allegations for purposes of criminal prosecution. Necessarily, each investigation contains information not necessarily relevant to the other.
