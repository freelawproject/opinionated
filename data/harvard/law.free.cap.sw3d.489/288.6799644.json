Martin, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Marcus Haley (\u201cHaley\u201d) appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of Erie Bennett (\u201cBennett\u201d) and Chris Smoot (\u201cSmoot\u201d) in Haley\u2019s negligence lawsuit filed after Haley, a high school student, suffered injuries at a summer football camp. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Haley participated in a multi-school summer high school football camp, known as the Hut Hut Team Camp (\u201cthe Camp\u201d), in June 2011. Haley was a member of the Centralia High School football team.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Bennett was the head football coach at Centralia High School and was coaching the Centralia High School football team during the Camp. Bennett was employed by the Centralia School District as a physical education teacher and as the head football coach in June 2011. Bennett received a monthly salary from the school district that included a stipend that covered all of his duties as head football coach. Before attending the camp in June 2011, Bennett prepared a summer schedule of football-related activities and reviewed that schedule with the Centralia athletic director to determine if attending the camp complied with Missouri State High School Athletic Association (\u201cMSHSAA\u201d) regulations. Bennett received permission from the Cen-tralia School District to take the Centralia High School football team to the Camp, to travel to the camp on school district buses, to use school district equipment and jerseys, and to bring a school district provided athletic trainer to the Camp. The Cen-tralia School District superintendent also attended to help Bennett supervise the athletes participating in the Camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Prior to attending the camp, Bennett decided that only sophomores, juniors, and seniors would be allowed to attend the camp. Bennett cleared that decision with the athletic director. Bennett also determined how long the Centralia High School football team would attend the camp and how many games they would play.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Smoot was the head football coach at Clinton High School and was coaching the Clinton High School football team during the Camp. Smoot was employed by the Clinton School District as a teacher and as the head football coach in June 2011. Smoot had a nine-month teacher\u2019s contract with the Clinton School District and received a stipend to compensate him for all of his football related activities. Smoot\u2019s responsibilities as head football coach extended through the summer. Prior to attending the Camp, Smoot checked with the Clinton School District athletic director to determine if the Camp conflicted with other summer activities. The Clinton School District athletic director approved of Smoot\u2019s decision to attend the Camp. The Clinton High School football team traveled to the Camp on Clinton School District buses, wore school district uniforms, and used school district equipment. During the Camp, Smoot decided who his team would play against, which players would play on any given play, and whether his players were practicing in a safe manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">Individual players had to pay a fee to the Camp in order to attend, but attendance at the Camp was not required to play football in the fall for either Centralia High School or Clinton High School. Referees were not at the Camp, but coaches agreed to look for rule infractions in addition to proper play execution and could stop play if they observed rule infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Haley was playing in a full-pad, full-contact scrimmage at the Camp against the Clinton High School football team when he was injured by another player. Haley contends that the tackle that resulted in his injury was an overly aggressive, below-the-waist- hit after a play was over, and that the lack of adequate supervision caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">On April 30, 2012, Haley filed a first amended petition against Bennett and Smoot, among others,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that Bennett and Smoot were negligent, resulting in Haley\u2019s injury. Haley alleged that both Bennett and Smoot were acting as employees and within the scope and course of their employment with their respective school districts. On June 13, 2012, Bennett filed a motion to be dismissed from Haley\u2019s first amended petition, claiming he was immune from suit because he was a public official. The trial court granted Bennett\u2019s motion on July 11, 2012. On October 11, 2012, Haley voluntarily dismissed his negligence claims against Smoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">On August 4, 2014, Haley filed a second amended petition (\u201cPetition\u201d) against Bennett and Smoot, among others.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Once again, Haley alleged that Bennett\u2019s and Smoot\u2019s negligence and them lack of adequate supervision of players at the Camp led to Haley\u2019s injury. The Petition alleged that Bennett and Smoot were employed as head football coaches for area high schools at the time of the incident and that the Camp was \u201ca multi-school football scrimmage.\u201d The Petition stated that \u201cBennett was supervising the football team comprised of Centraba participants\u201d and that \u201cSmoot was supervising the football team comprised of Clinton participants.\u201d The Petition no longer alleged that Bennett and Smoot were acting within the scope of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Bennett and Smoot filed separate motions for summary judgment, arguing (among other things) that Haley\u2019s claims against them were barred by the doctrine of official immunity given their status as public school teachers and coaches. The trial court entered a judgment granting Smoot\u2019s motion on March 27, 2015, and a separate judgment granting Bennett\u2019s motion on April 3, 2015. The trial court\u2019s judgments did not specify the basis on which the motions for summary judgment were granted. The trial court found that each judgment should be designated as final for purposes of appeal pursuant to Rule 74.01(b) because there was no just reason for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Haley separately, and timely, appealed both judgments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We consobdated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">The Supreme Court set out the standard of review for the grant of summary judgment in <em>Goerlitz v. City of Maryville:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-14\">The trial court makes its decision to grant summary judgment based on the pleadings, record submitted, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>law; therefore this Court need not defer to the trial court\u2019s determination and reviews the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. ITT Commercial Fin. Corp. v. Mid-America Marine Supply Corp., </em>854 S.W.2d 371, 376 (Mo. banc 1993); Rule 74.04. In reviewing the decision to grant summary judgment, this Court applies the same criteria as the trial court in determining whether summary judgment was proper. <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is only proper if the moving party establishes that there is no genuine issue as to the material facts and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>The facts contained in affidavits or otherwise in support of a party\u2019s motion are accepted \u201cas true unless contradicted by the non-moving party\u2019s response to the summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only genuine disputes as to material facts preclude summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 378. A material fact in the context of summary judgment is one from which the right to judgment flows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">A defending party ... may establish a right to summary judgment by demonstrating: (1) facts negating any one of the elements of the non-movant\u2019s claim; (2) \u201cthat the non-movant, after an adequate period for discovery, has not been able and will not be able to produce sufficient evidence to allow the trier of fact to find the existence of any one\u201d of the elements of the non-movant\u2019s claim; or (3) \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to the existence of facts necessary to support movant\u2019s properly pleaded affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">333 S.W.3d 450, 452-53 (Mo. banc 2011). \u201cThe movant bears the burden of establishing a legal right to judgment and the absence of any genuine issue of material fact required to support the claimed right to judgment.\u201d <em>Southers v. City of Farmington, </em>263 S.W.3d 603, 608 (Mo. banc 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The trial court did not explain its rationale for granting Bennett\u2019s and Smoot\u2019s motions for summary judgment. \u201cWhere a trial court has granted summary judgment without specifying the basis upon which the motion was granted, this court will affirm the grant of summary judgment under any appropriate theory.\u201d <em>Central Missouri Elec. Co-Op. v. Balke, </em>119 S.W.3d 627, 635 (Mo.App.W.D. 2003) (citation omitted). \u201c[A] trial court[ ] .,. is presumed to have based its decision on the grounds specified in [the] motion if the trial court\u2019s order does not set forth its reasoning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">Haley raises five points on appeal, each claiming error in the grant of summary judgment. The first point alleges that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Bennett and Smoot were acting within the scope of their employment, which prevented the entry of judgment as a matter of law based on either the affirmative defense of official immunity or the affirmative defense of immunity under the Coverdell Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The see<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ond point alleges that the trial court misapplied the law because Bennett and Smoot were not public officials entitled to assert the defense of official immunity or the defense of immunity under the Cover-dell Act. The third, fourth, and fifth points respectively allege that the trial court misapplied the law in finding that the earlier dismissal of Haley\u2019s first amended petition barred his recovery against Bennett; in requiring a standard of willful and reckless conduct be applied to Bennett\u2019s and Smoot\u2019s conduct; and in finding that Haley assumed the risk of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">We combine our discussion of points one and two as both address whether \u25a0 summary judgment could have been granted based on the affirmative defense of official immunity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment can be affirmed based on the defense of official immunity, we need not address the defense of immunity under the Coverdell Act or the claims of error raised in points three, four and five.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Haley\u2019s first and second points on appeal argue that Bennett and Smoot are not public officials entitled to assert the defense of official immunity, and that even if they are, there is a genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether they .were acting in the scope of their employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201cOfficial immunity protects public officials from liability for alleged acts of ordinary negligence committed during the course of their official duties for .the performance of discretionary acts.\u201d <em>Woods v. Ware, </em>471 S.W.3d 385, 391 (Mo.App.W.D. 2015) (quoting <em>Davis v. Lamberb-St. Louis Int\u2019l Airport, </em>193 S.W.3d 760, 763 (Mo. banc 2006)). -\u201cOfficial immunity is intended to provide protection for individual government actors who, despite limited resources and imperfect information, must exercise judgment in the performance of their duties.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>471 S.W.3d at 391 (quoting <em>Southers, </em>263 S.W.3d at 611). \u201cIts goal is also to permit public employees to make judgments affecting public safety and welfare without concerns about possible personal liability.\u201d <em>Southers, </em>263 S.W.3d at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">\u201cMissouri courts -have routinely extended official immunity to discretionary acts even when the public official\u2019s actions were not governmental in nature.\u201d <em>Richardson. v</em>. <em>City of St. Louis, </em>293 S.W.3d 133, 140 (Mo.App.E.D. 2009). Moreover, the Supreme Court has \u201cthoroughly discussed the scope of official immunity and did not restrict immunity only to. those actions which \u2018go to the essence of governing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Southers, </em>263 S.W.3d \u00e1t 610-11). \u201cThis court and this court\u2019s Eastern District, relying on the Missouri Supreme Court's clarification of the doctrine of official immunity in <em>Southers, </em>both found that teachers are public employees who \u00e1re protected from\u2019 liability for negligent acts committed during the course of their official duties for the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>discretionary acts.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>471 S.W.3d at 392 n. 4 (citing <em>Nguyen v. Grain Valley R-5 School Dist., </em>353 S.W.3d 725, 731 (Mo.App.W.D. 2011); <em>Boever v. Special School Dist. Of St. Louis Cnty., </em>296 S.W.3d 487, 492 (Mo.App.E.D. 2009); <em>McCoy v. Martinez, </em>480 S.W.3d 420, 424-25 (Mo.App.E.D. 2016); <em>see also Nine v. Wentzville R-IV School Dist., </em>No. 4:11-CV-353 CEJ, 2011 WL 2564767 (E.D. Mo. June 28, 2011) (teachers are public officials entitled to official immunity)). \u201cThus ... coach[es] hired by a public school district [are] public employee[s] entitled to official immunity for [their] discretionary acts.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>471 S.W.3d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Haley cites several dated cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to support his argument that public school teachers and coaches are not public officials entitled to official immunity. All of those cases, however, were decided before <em>Southers, </em>which held that that \u201cthe official immunity doctrine protects all public employees \u2018from liability for alleged acts of negligence committed during the course of their official duties for the performance of discretionary acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ware, </em>471 S.W.3d at 392 n. 4 (quoting <em>Southers, </em>263 S.W.3d at 610). As such, the cases Haley cites are neither persuasive nor controlling.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court could properly have concluded, therefore, that Bennett and Smoot are public officials entitled to assert the defense of official immunity, so long as their alleged acts of negligence were \u201c \u2018committed during the course ' of their official duties for the performance of discretionary acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Southers, </em>263 S.W.3d at 610).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Haley concedes that Bennett\u2019s and Smoot\u2019s alleged negligent acts were discretionary<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in nature. Haley admits that \u201cthe evidence clearly showed that Bennett and Smoot themselves, not their respective school districts,\u2019were in control of their services at the Camp.\u201d [Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 26]</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Haley argues, however, that .because Bennett and Smoot \u201cwere in control of their services at the Camp,\u201d there is a genuine issue of material fact in dispute as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>to whether Bennett and Smoot were acting \u201cwithin the course and scope of their employment\u201d at the time of Haley\u2019s injury. [Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 18] Specifically, Haley argues that unless the school districts are vicariously liable because they controlled the manner, methods, and means of Bennett\u2019s and Smoot\u2019s performance at the Camp, there was no employment relationship with the coaches sufficient to support official immunity. [Appellant\u2019s Brief pp. 18-20]</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Haley\u2019s argument relies on <em>Woods v. Kelley, </em>948 S.W.2d 634 (Mo.App.W.D. 1997), a case that addresses whether a governmental entity entitled to <em>sovereign </em>immunity has waived that immunity pursuant to section 537.600<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for injuries resulting from a public employee\u2019s negligent operation of a motor vehicle. To resolve that question, we looked at whether the governmental entity had the power to direct and control the employee\u2019s conduct at the time of the injury under \u201cthe traditional common law doctrine of vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637. We concluded that a city aider-man who voluntarily provided landscape services to property the city was required to maintain was acting as a volunteer, and not as a public employee, when her negligent operation of a vehicle caused injuries to another. <em>Id. </em>635-38. We tailored the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity for a governmental entity in this manner because waivers of sovereign immunity are required to be narrowly construed. <em>Id. </em>at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Haley cites no authority for the proposition that the vicarious liability doctrine, relied on to narrowly tailor a waiver of <em>sovereign </em>immunity, applies equally to narrowly tailor when a public official is entitled to <em>official </em>immunity. <em>Thummel v. King, </em>570 S.W.2d 679, 687 (Mo. banc 1978) (holding that an appellant has an obligation to cite appropriate precedent to support an argument). In the absence of authority, we would be within our discretion to consider Haley\u2019s argument abandoned. <em>Steltenpohl v. Steltenpohl, </em>256 S.W.3d 597, 599-600 (Mo.App.W.D. 2008). Instead, we find the argument to be plainly without merit. To hold as Haley suggests would be to disregard the very essence of the defense of official immunity which applies only to <em>discretionary </em>acts. \u201c \u2018A discretionary act requires the exercise of reason in the adaptation of means to an end and discretion in determining how or whether an act should be done or course pursued.\u2019\u201d <em>Nguyen, </em>353 S.W.3d at 730 (quoting <em>Southers, </em>263 S.W.3d at 610). A discretionary act is the antithesis of restrictive employer control over the details of the manner, methods, and means of how work is performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Simply stated, Haley\u2019s proposition disregards the fact that \u201csovereign immunity and official immunity are distinct legal concepts.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>193 S.W.3d at 765. Waivers of a governmental entity\u2019s sovereign immunity are to be narrowly construed. <em>Woods, </em>948 S.W.2d at 637. At the same time, \u201c[t]he aim of official immunity is to allow officials to \u2018make judgments affecting the public safety and welfare\u2019 without being burdened by \u2018[t]he fear of personal liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>193 S.W.3d at 765 (quoting <em>Green v. Denison, </em>738 S.W.2d 861, 865 (Mo. banc 1987)). This purpose would not be served by restraining official immunity to the performance of duties under circumstances that would subject an employer to vicarious liability. Though \u201c[a] governmental employer may still be hable for the actions of its employee even if the employee is entitled to official immunity,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>193 S.W.3d at 766, it does not follow that an employee is only entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>official immunity if the employee\u2019s conduct will subject the governmental employer to vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Instead, as directed by <em>South-ers, </em>the standard for determining whether a public official has official immunity is whether the public official negligently performed discretionary acts \u2018\u201cduring the course of their official duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ware, </em>471 S.W.3d at 392 n. 4 (quoting <em>Southers, </em>263 S.W.3d at 610). This is a broader standard than whether a public official has acted strictly within the scope of employment because the manner, methods, and means of performance were subject to the employer\u2019s control.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The uncontroverted facts establish that Bennett and Smoot were performing discretionary acts during the course of their official duties at the time Haley was injured. Haley admits that Bennett and Smoot were employed as teachers and football coaches by their respective school districts during the Camp and that the Camp was a \u201cmulti-school football scrimmage.\u201d Haley admits that Bennett\u2019s and Smoot\u2019s \u201croles at the [C]amp were as football coaches.\u201d Haley admits that he was injured while participating in the football scrimmage while under Bennett\u2019s and Smoot\u2019s supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">It is uncontroverted that Bennett was employed by Centraba as the head football coach at the time of the incident; that he was acting as a public school employee and head football coach at the time of the incident; that he received compensation for all football related activities from the school district; that he received permission from his school\u2019s athletic director to attend the Camp; that he received permission to use school district transportation, equipment, and uniforms at the Camp; that he decided which players would attend the Camp; that he decided how long the Centraba High School football team would attend the.Camp; that he decided how many games the team would play at the Camp; and that he would stop play at the Camp if he observed rule infractions or dangerous play.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">It is uncontroverted that Smoot was employed by Clinton as the head football coach during the incident; that he took the Clinton High School football team to the Camp to prepare for the upcoming season; that he received a stipend to compensate him for all football related activities; that his football activities extended through the summer; that his school\u2019s athletic director approved of his decision to attend the Camp; that he received permission to use school district transportation, equipment, and uniforms at the Camp; that he decided who his team would play against at the Camp; that he decided which players would play on any given play; that he determined whether his players were practicing in a safe manner at the Camp, and that he would stop play at the Camp if he observed rule infractions or dangerous play.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">These uncontroverted facts establish that Bennett and Smoot\u2019s \u201c \u2018alleged acts of negligence [were] committed during the course of their official duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ware, </em>471 S.W.3d at 392 n. 4 (quoting <em>Southers, </em>263 S.W.3d at 610). The trial court did not err in concluding that Bennett and Smoot are entitled to official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">Points one aqd two insofar as they address official immunity are denied. Because we can affirm the trial court\u2019s grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of summary judgment to Bennett and Smoot on the basis of the defense of official immunity, we need not address the defense of immunity under the Coverdell Act or the claims of error in granting summary judgment raised by Haley\u2019s third, fourth, and fifth issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-2\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">The trial court\u2019s judgments granting Bennett\u2019s and Smoot\u2019s motions- for summary judgment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AqVu\">All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\">. We view the record below in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered. <em>Reynolds v. Missouri Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole, </em>468 S.W.3d 413, 415 (Mo.App.W.D. 2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">.

The judgments resolved all issues as between Haley and Bennett, and Haley and Smoot, respectively, rendering each judgment an appealable judicial unit pursuant to Rule 74.01(b). <em>Gibson v.

The Coverdell Act, 20 U.S.C. sections 6731-6738 (2006), has the stated purpose \u201c \u2018to provide teachers, principals, and other school professionals the tools they need to undertake reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline, and an appropriate educational environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dydell v.

However, the essential elements of the two defenses are distinct, and they must be separately pled and proven. <em>Id. </em>(noting that Court would not reach issue of official immunity when superintendent only pleaded the defense of immunity under the Coverdell Act); <em>M.C.-B. ex ret T.B. v.

Points one and two are impermissibly multifarious because they claim error in entering summary judgment with respect to distinct affirmative defenses \u2014 official immunity and the defense of immunity under the Coverdell Act. \"Generally, multifarious points preserve nothing for appellate review and are ordinarily subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Hopkins v.

We proceed with a review of points one and two, however,, because we can affirm the trial court\u2019s judgments based on the defense of official immunity with no need to address the' defense of immunity under the Coverdell Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\">.

Haley has not asserted a claim that any governmental entity is vicariously liable for Bennett or Smoot\u2019s actions or inactions, so our discussion should not be construed to address vicarious liability.
