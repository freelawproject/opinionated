The Lawyers\u2019 Fund is administered by a seven-member Board of Trustees (Trustees) appointed by the Supreme Court. <em>R. </em>1:28-1. \u201cThe trustees shall adopt rules and regulations, consistent with these rules and subject to the approval of the Supreme Court, governing the administration of the Fund, the procedures for the presentation, consideration and payment of claims, and the exercise of their investment powers.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:28-1(d). The Lawyers\u2019 Fund is financed primarily through mandatory annual contributions from New Jersey attorneys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>R. </em>1:28-2. The Trustees are authorized in \u201ctheir sole discretion\u201d to determine which claims \u201cmerit reimbursement from the Fund and the amount, time, manner, conditions and order of payment of reimbursement.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:28 \u2014 3(b). The Trustees may require a claimant to execute an assignment, subrogation agreement, trust agreement, and a promise to cooperate with the Trustees in making or prosecuting claims or charges against any person as a condition to payment from the Lawyers\u2019 Fund. <em>R. </em>l:28-3(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In this case the Lawyers\u2019 Fund paid fifteen former clients of James V. Higgins, Esquire, now deceased, who had settled their tort claims without the clients\u2019 knowledge, forged the clients\u2019 signatures, and embezzled the clients\u2019 funds. The Higgins\u2019 clients assigned their rights to the Lawyers\u2019 Fund. The Lawyers\u2019 Fund, as assignee and subrogee of the defrauded clients, brought a suit for conversion against the depositary bank, First Fidelity Bank (FFB), for accepting the clients\u2019 forged indorsements. The Law Division judge granted summary judgment to the Lawyers\u2019 Fund. FFB appeals contending (1) the banks\u2019 liability for accepting the forged indorsements was not the proximate cause of the clients\u2019 losses, and (2) the transfer of the loss from the Lawyers\u2019 Fund to an \u201cinnocent\u201d party violates public policy and the goals of the Lawyers\u2019 Fund. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The facts are not in dispute. James V. Higgins, admitted to practice law in New Jersey in 1965, was a sole practitioner who maintained offices in South Amboy, New Jersey. He died on September 1, 1992. After his death, his widow discovered that he had settled a number of personal injury actions without the knowledge of the clients, forged their signatures on the settlements checks, negotiated the checks, and stolen the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The Lawyers\u2019 Fund made an application to the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Middlesex County, for the appointment of a custodial receiver for the Higgins estate, including the former law practice. The custodial receiver recovered about $208,000 for the benefit of Higgins\u2019 creditors, representing money stolen from clients and used by Higgins for the purchase and maintenance of real estate owned by him and his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Simultaneously with the appointment of the custodial receiver the Lawyers\u2019 Fund began processing claims against Higgins and ultimately paid $292,000 on twenty-six claims involving his dishonest conduct. Upon payment of the claims, the Lawyers\u2019 Fund received an assignment from each of the claimants of their claims against Higgins and any other party involved in the transaction giving rise to the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">On September 19, 1994 the Lawyers\u2019 Fund filed a forty-five count complaint, as assignee and subrogee of fifteen former Higgins clients, against various banks and insurance companies seeking damages for conversion and for paying cheeks with forged indorsements. Appellant First Fidelity Bank (FFB) was one of the banks sued by the Lawyers\u2019 Fund. On December 12, 1994 FFB answered the complaint, asserted seventeen defenses and cross-claimed against the other defendants for indemnification and contribution. Several other defendant banks answered the complaint (and filed cross-claims against the other defendants): Wa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>chovia Bank of N.A.; Shawmut Bank of Connecticut, N.A.; Bay-bank Boston, N.A.; Citibank, DE.; Boatman\u2019s Bank of Marshall; and Midlantic Bank, N.A. Government Employees Insurance Co. (GEICO) and Riggs National Bank jointly answered the complaint and cross-claimed against the various defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In August 1995 the banks and GEICO jointly moved for summary judgment. The Lawyers\u2019 Fund cross-moved for summary judgment. Judge Shuster (1) granted summary judgment in favor of the Lawyers\u2019 Fund and against FFB for two-thirds (recovery net of fee) the face amount of the drafts; (2) granted summary judgment in favor of the other payor banks, pay-through-banks, and insurance companies and against the Lawyers\u2019 Fund; and (3) denied FFB\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">On September 25, 1996 First Union National Bank, successor of FFB, filed a notice of appeal with this court. FFB and the Lawyers\u2019 Fund are the only parties participating in this appeal. FFB contends that the Lawyers\u2019 Fund has no right to maintain a subrogation action against anyone other than the defrauding attorney. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Both parties look to the history of <em>R. </em>1:28 to support their respective positions on whether the Lawyers\u2019 Fund can subrogate against the bank. FFB cites various comments made prior to the adoption of the Clients\u2019 Fund rule by Dickinson R. Debevoise, the original chairman of the Clients\u2019 Security Fund Committee, to demonstrate that the \u201conly collateral source or subrogation action that appears to have been contemplated [at the time of the rule\u2019s proposal] is an action against the dishonest attorney.\u201d The Lawyers\u2019 Fund argues that when the Clients\u2019 Fund rule was originally adopted, the philosophy was that the Fund would be a source of last resort for defrauded clients but that over the years the policy governing the Lawyers\u2019 Fund has changed, as demonstrated by textual changes in the Rule. Now, the Lawyers\u2019 Fund can pay a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>client before the client pursues the collateral source and the Lawyers\u2019 Fund can then itself pursue the collateral source.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">1. The Original Proposed Rule, <em>R. </em>1:22A.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In 1968 the Trustees of the New Jersey State Bar Association approved the Clients\u2019 Security Fund Supreme Court Committee\u2019s proposal for a court rule governing the proposed Clients\u2019 Security Fund. 91 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>329 (May 23, 1968). The proposed rule, <em>R. </em>1:22A, authorized and created a fund called the \u201cClients\u2019 Security Fund of the Bar of New Jersey.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of the Fund shall be to maintain the integrity and protect the good name of the legal profession by reimbursing, to the extent deemed proper and feasible by the Trustees, losses caused by the dishonest conduct of members of the Bar of the State of New Jersey.\u201d Proposed <em>R. </em>1:22A-1(c) printed in 91 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>329. Under the proposed rule the Trastees had the power to \u201cenforce claims for restitution, arising by subrogation or assignment or otherwise.\u201d Proposed <em>R. </em>1:22A-3(a)(4) printed in 91 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>329. The Committee proposed the following as <em>R. </em>1:22A-8(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">Claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">(e) In addition to other conditions and requirements the Trustees may require each claimant, as a condition of payment, to execute such instruments, to take such action, and to enter such agreements as the Trustees may desire, including assignments, trust agreements and promises to co-operate with the Trustees in making and prosecuting claims or charges against any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">[91 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>329.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">There was no mention of \u201ccollateral sources\u201d in the proposed rule. The Supreme Court placed the proposal on the agenda of the May 24, 1968 Judicial Conference. 91 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>329.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">2. The Original Rule, <em>R. </em>1:22A.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">On December 17, 1968 the Supreme Court adopted the Clients\u2019 Security Fund rule, <em>R. </em>1:22A, which became effective on January 1, 1969. 92 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>1 (January 2, 1969). <em>R. </em>1:22A-1 stated that the purpose of the Clients\u2019 Security Fund of the Bar of New Jersey \u201cis the reimbursement, to the extent and in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>provided by these rules, of losses caused by the dishonest conduct of members of the bar of this State.\u201d 92 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>1. This \u201cpurpose\u201d language has remained constant. <em>See </em>the current <em>R. </em>1:28-1(a). The \u201cPayment of Claims\u201d section of the original rule stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">(a) Eligible Claims. The trustees may consider for payment all claims resulting from the dishonest conduct of a member of the bar of this State acting either as an attorney or fiduciary, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">(4) The trustees are satisfied that there is no other collateral source, such as a fidelity bond for the reimbursement of the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">[R. 1:22A-3(a)(4) published in 92 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The Supreme Court adopted the proposed provision giving the trustees the right to require a claimant to enter into agreements including assignments, subrogation agreements, trust agreements or promises to cooperate in \u201cmaking and prosecuting claims or charges against any person.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:22A-3(e). Under <em>R. </em>1:22A-5, \u201cGeneral Powers of Trustees,\u201d the Supreme Court gave the trustees the general power \u201c(b) to enforce claims which the Fund may have for restitution.\u201d 92 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>9.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">On January 23, 1969 the trustees adopted \u201crules and regulations\u201d for the Clients\u2019 Fund, which were approved by the Supreme Court on February 13, 1969. 92 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>113 (Feb. 20, 1969). The regulation concerning the consideration of reimbursement claims provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">The trastees shall not allow a claim where there is a collateral source, such as a fidelity bond, for the reimbursement of the claim, and except in cases of extreme hardship the trustees shall not allow a claim until the claimant has pursued all other sources of recovery available to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">[Regulation 3.2(b) published in 92 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>119.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">3. Subsequent Changes to <em>R. </em>1:28.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">On February 25,1969 Chief Justice Weintraub and the Supreme Court adopted a revision of the <em>Rules of the Courts of the State of New Jersey </em>which became effective on September 8, 1969. <em>See </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>(GANN) at iii. The Clients\u2019 Security Fund rule remained substantively unchanged in the 1969 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>revision but was renumbered <em>B. </em>1:28. The former \u201cPayment of Claims\u201d provision, <em>R. </em>l:22A-3(a)(4), became <em>R. </em>1:28-8(a)(4). The provision granting the Trustees the power to enforce claims for restitution, <em>R. </em>1:22A-5(b), became <em>R. </em>1:28-5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">On February 15, 1990 the Trustees proposed several modifications of <em>R. </em>1:28 (suggestions reprinted in 125 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>388 (Feb. 15, 1990)). Prior to the proposed changes to <em>R. </em>1:28-5 the committee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">It has been the policy of the Board of Trustees to pursue any claim for reimbursement assigned by a claimant. It was felt that <em>B. </em>1:28 \u2014 5(b) should be amended to clarify that policy. <em>The Fund\u2019s ability to recoup monies paid on claims is not limited to seeking restitution from the defalcating attorney but extends to all parties liable to a claimant in the transaction giving rise to the claim.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">[125 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>388 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">On June 29, 1990 the Supreme Court adopted three of the Trustee\u2019s suggested changes to <em>R. </em>1:28, which took effect on September 4, 1990. First, the \u201celigible claims\u201d provision, requiring the Trustee\u2019s satisfaction that no other collateral sources are available to the claimant, was deleted. <em>See R. </em>1:28-3(a). Second, \u201c[t]he potential for recovery from a collateral source\u201d was added to the list of appropriate factors that the trustee shall consider when determining if a claim should be paid. <em>R. </em>1:28-3(b)(5). Third, the \u201cgeneral powers\u201d of the Trustees was amended from permitting the Trustees to enforce claims for <em>restitution, </em>to permitting the Trustees to \u201cenforce claims which the Fund may have for <em>reimbursements.\u201d R. </em>1:28-5(b) (emphasis added). In 1992 <em>R. </em>1:28 was amended effective September 1992 to reflect the name change to the New Jersey Lawyers\u2019 Fund for Client Protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">4. Textual Analysis and Conclusion regarding the History of <em>R. </em>1:28.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Both parties are correct in their analysis of the history of the Clients\u2019 Fund rule. FFB is correct in stating that at the time of its proposal and adoption, the Clients\u2019 Fund was considered to be a source of last resort. The Clients\u2019 Fund rule, as originally enacted, explicitly prohibited its Trustees from paying a claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>if the claimant could collect from a collateral source. Additionally, Regulation 3.2(b) prohibited the Trustees from paying a claim until a claimant exhausted all collateral sources, except in cases of undue hardship. If the Clients\u2019 Fund paid a claim under the original rule it was entitled to seek \u201crestitution\u201d from the defrauding attorney. The problem with FFB\u2019s analysis, unlike the Lawyers\u2019 Fund analysis, is it does not consider the Clients\u2019 Fund rule\u2019s subsequent history.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The 1990 textual changes and the Trustees comments to the proposed changes to the Lawyers\u2019 Fund rule, support the view that the philosophy of the rule\u2019s implementation changed from considering the Lawyers\u2019 Fund a source of last resort to allowing the Lawyers\u2019 Fund to pay a claim earlier and then pursue the collateral sources. In 1990 the provision of the Clients\u2019 Fund rule forbidding the Trustees to pay a claim if a collateral source was available to the client was deleted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also, the rule was amended to allow the Trustees to consider a claimant\u2019s potential recovery from a collateral source. Finally, the Trustees were empowered to seek not only \u201crestitution\u201d but \u201creimbursements.\u201d The modification of \u201crestitution\u201d to \u201creimbursements\u201d appears to have been a deliberate and meaningful change by the drafters because it was made at the same time the prohibition of the Trustees\u2019 ability to pay a claimant where collateral sources were available was eliminated. It appears that under the original draft of the rule, the trustees could seek \u201crestitution\u201d from the defrauding attorney. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1313 (6th ed.1990) defines \u201crestitution\u201d in pertinent part as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">Act of restoring; restoration; restoration of anything to its rightful owner; the act of making good or giving equivalent for any loss, damage or injury; and indemnification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">There is a limited or negative connotation associated with \u201crestitution\u201d \u2014 in that definition when one is making restitution, the \u201cwrongful\u201d taker is giving something back to the \u201crightful\u201d owner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Therefore, the original rule narrowly envisioned that \u201crestitution\u201d would come from the defrauding attorney. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1287 (6th ed.1990) defines \u201creimburse\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">To pay back, to make restoration, to repay that expended; to indemnify, or make whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Because of the lack of the \u201crightful owner\u201d language in this definition, \u201creimbursement\u201d does not have such a narrow or negative connotation. Thus, the change from \u201crestitution\u201d to \u201creimbursement\u201d indicates that the Trustees are free to pursue collateral sources other than the defrauding attorney. The overall history of the textual changes to the Lawyers\u2019 Fund rule supports a conclusion that under the current philosophy, the Lawyers\u2019 Fund is entitled to pay a claimant and seek reimbursements from sources other than the defrauding attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">5. Supreme Court dicta supports the Lawyers\u2019 Fund theory of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">In this decade, the Supreme Court has alluded to the \u201ccurrent\u201d philosophy of having the Lawyers\u2019 Fund pay defrauded clients and then, as assignee or subrogee, seek reimbursement from collateral sources. In <em>Clients\u2019 Security Fund v. Security Title, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>358, 363, 634 A.2d 90 (1993), the issue before the court was \u201cwhich party participating in the closing of a real estate title must ultimately absorb the loss caused by the closing attorney\u2019s theft of moneys earmarked for the payment of an existing first mortgage on the property.\u201d In <em>Security Title </em>Hart hired attorney Joseph Witkowski to represent him in the purchase and financing of a condominium. Witkowski ordered and received a title report from Security Title. Hart gave Witkowski money to cover the title-insurance premium which Witkowski never forwarded to Security Title. The title policy was never issued. About a year later, Hart retained Witkowski to represent him in the refinancing of his condominium. Witkowski ordered a title report and commitment from Security Title. The commitment listed the second mortgagee as the proposed insured and required Hart to pay off and cancel the first mortgage. Security Title issued a \u201cclosing-protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tion letter\u201d which protected the second mortgagee against the risk of the closing attorney\u2019s fraud or theft. Before the closing, the second mortgagee forwarded, among other things, a check payable to Hart and Witkowski. Witkowski had Hart indorse the cheek and then forwarded a certification to the second mortgagee stating that loan was now secured by a first mortgage on Hart\u2019s property. Witkowski stole the closing money and was prosecuted, convicted, sentenced and disbarred. The second mortgagee called on Security Title to fulfill its obligation under the closing-protection letter. Security Title paid the first mortgagee, took an assignment of the mortgage, subordinated its mortgage to the second mortgagee, and sought payment from Hart.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Hart then filed a claim with the Clients\u2019 Fund. The Client\u2019s Fund denied the claim but set aside $50,000 in the event the claim could later be substantiated. Security Title filed a Chancery Division complaint to foreclose on the mortgage; Hart answered, counterclaimed and filed a third-party complaint against Witkowski. While the case was pending Hart sold the property, paid the second mortgagee, and placed the proceeds into an escrow account. The Clients\u2019 Fund paid Hart half of the escrow amount and Hart assigned half of his interest in the escrow proceeds to the Clients\u2019 Fund. The Clients\u2019 Fund then brought an action against Security Title, the first mortgagee, the second mortgagee, and Witkowski.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">After the Court held that Security Title, the title-insurance carrier, was liable for the loss based on the closing-protection letter it had furnished to the second mortgagee, the Court discussed Hart\u2019s claim against the Clients\u2019 Fund. <em>Id. </em>at 378-79, 634 A.2d 90. The Court stated: \u201cby setting aside money for Hart, the Fund was entitled to be subrogated to any claim Hart had against Security and [the second mortgagee].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 634 A.2d 90. This demonstrates to us that the Court now agrees that the Clients\u2019 Fund can subrogate against persons other than the defrauding attorneys. The Court stated, albeit in dicta:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>In view of our holding ... the Fund became entitled to consider the insurance protection as a collateral source of recovery under <em>Rule </em>1:28 \u2014 3(b) (5). Nonetheless, we urge the Fund to reconsider the manner in which it applies the collateral-source provision. In <em>Sears, </em>the Fund required the claimants to await the outcome of the litigation before reimbursing them. <em>[Sears Mortg. Corp. v. </em>Rose,] 134 <em>N.J. </em>[326] at 335-336, 634 A.2d [74] at 78 [(1993)]. That approach causes innocent victims of attorney misconduct severe hardship. Here, the Fund paid a part of the claim brought by Hart. Hart filed his claim in 1987, but received reimbursement of only one-fifth of his total loss in 1989, and today, in 1993, still awaits recovery of the balance. The Fund should consider paying off claimants in similar situations immediately now that we have established that title insurers are liable under these circumstances for their approved attorneys\u2019 theft of closing funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><em>[Id. </em>at 378-79, 634 A.2d 90.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">This passage supports the Lawyers\u2019 Fund\u2019s position that consistent with the \u201ccurrent\u201d philosophy, it can pay a claim promptly to avoid a claimant enduring the process of collecting from a collateral source and then the Lawyers\u2019 Fund, as subrogee or assignee of the claimant\u2019s rights, can seek reimbursement from the collateral sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">6. Other Jurisdictions Permit Subrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Other jurisdictions which have similar client funds have permitted them to subrogate against collateral sources. In Florida, the Clients\u2019 Security Fund, maintained by the Florida Bar, compensates defrauded clients under a system similar to New Jersey\u2019s Lawyers\u2019 Fund. In <em>Southeast First National Bank of Miami v. Florida Bar, </em>389 So. 2d 1222,1222 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1980), an attorney forged a client\u2019s indorsement on a check and converted the funds to his own use through the Southeast National Bank. The Clients\u2019 Security Fund paid the client $4,300 and the client executed an assignment and subrogation agreement, as explicitly authorized by Florida\u2019s Integration Rule. <em>Id. </em>at 1222-23. The court found that the \u201cpayee [client] would be entitled to recover from the Defendant for conversion of the cheek as a result of its payment on a forged and unauthorized endorsement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1223, citing to the Florida UCC statute. The Florida appellate court held that the Clients\u2019 Fund, as assignee of the payee\u2019s cause of action, was entitled to recover the amount of the actual loss sustained by the client from the bank. In reaching this decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the court compared the then-current version of the rule with the previous version of the rule. The 1966 rule provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">The Florida Bar shall exert every reasonable effort to recover from the offending lawyer such amounts as shall have been paid to a client on any claim against such lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\n<em>mm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The 1970 version of the same Florida rule provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">The Florida Bar or its Board of Governors may take assignments of the causes of action of claimants as a condition to said payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">\u201cAny doubt about the intended scope of the Bar\u2019s recovery rights under the 1970 Rule is resolved by comparison with the former rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1223.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also found that the Florida Integration Rule permitted the Clients\u2019 Fund to subrogate the client\u2019s claim against the bank and that the subrogation action did not violate the bank\u2019s rights to equal protection or due process. <em>Id. </em>at 1223-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">By statute the New York Legislature established a Clients\u2019 Security Fund, with the assets in the custody of the State Comptroller. <em>Clients\u2019 Security Fund v. Grandeau, </em>72 N.Y.2d 62, 64, 530 N.Y.S.2d 775, 526 N.E.2d 270 (1988). In <em>Grandeau, </em>attorney Grandeau was disbarred for misappropriating funds from his clients. Grandeau\u2019s partner, Dahowski, was censured for failing to oversee the firm\u2019s record keeping but the court found that Dahowski was not responsible for the conversions. The Clients\u2019 Fund reimbursed several hundred Grandeau clients and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>clients agreed to assign and subrogate to the Clients\u2019 Fund their rights against Grandeau, Dahowski and the partnership of Grandeau and Dahowski. The governing statute permitted the Clients\u2019 Fund to recover disbursements. \u201cThe question presented on this appeal is whether the Fund is restricted to recoupment solely from the attorney who personally engaged in the dishonest conduct, or whether it may also pursue a subrogation action against the attorney\u2019s former law partner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 530 N.Y.S.2d 775, 526 N.E.2d 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In <em>Grandeau </em>the pertinent statute permitted the Clients\u2019 Fund to condition payments upon the assignment of rights under a provision worded similarly to New Jersey\u2019s rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyD\">shall require that the claimant execute such instruments, take such action or enter into such agreements as the board of trustees shall require, including assignments, subrogation agreements and promises to cooperate with the board of trustees in making claims against the attorney whose dishonest conduct resulted in the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 67, 530 N.Y.S.2d 775, 526 N.E.2d 270.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The New York highest court stated that under the traditional principles of partnership law, one partner is liable for a conversion of property committed by another member of the firm, even if that partner had no knowledge of the offending partner\u2019s actions. The court found that each aggrieved client had a viable cause of action against Dahowski and the clients assigned those rights to the Clients\u2019 Fund. \u201cThe Fund may therefore prosecute, standing in the shoes of the aggrieved clients, claims of negligence, breach of contract and breach of trust against Dahowski.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court rejected Dahowski\u2019s argument that subrogation against anyone other than the defrauding attorney was not contemplated by the Legislature because Dahowski\u2019s position was \u201cinconsistent with the statutory provisions vesting broad discretion in the Board and frustrates the purposes of the legislation creating the fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 530 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>775, 526 N.E.2d 270. The Court of Appeals elaborated: \u201cTo so limit the power of the Fund [limited to an individual who often may be bankrupt, incarcerated, or deceased and incapable of providing any refunding] would jeopardize its financial integrity and undermine its ability to promote public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>confidence in the legal profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 530 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>775, 526 N.E.2d 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The history of <em>R. </em>1:28 and the Supreme Court\u2019s dicta in <em>Security Title </em>support the Lawyers\u2019 Fund position that it is entitled to subrogate and collect from sources other than the defrauding attorney. Moreover, we find the rationale used and the conclusion reached by the two jurisdictions to address this issue, Florida and New York, are sound and persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">FFB contends that it is an \u201cinnocent\u201d party and the Lawyers\u2019 Fund should not be able to shift this type of loss to banks. FFB does not directly address or try to refute the Lawyers\u2019 Fund\u2019s contention that, as a depositary bank, FFB is strictly liable for conversion under New Jersey\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Rather, FFB essentially argues, on public policy grounds, that it should not be a collateral source from which the Lawyers\u2019 Fund can seek reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">During the pendency of this case the UCC was modified. The new provisions became effective on June 1, 1995. There was some debate among the parties in the Law Division as to whether the new or the former UCC applies to this case. We conclude that under either the current or the former UCC, a depositary bank is strictly liable for paying on forged indorsements.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">A. Former UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">The former UCC, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">(1) An instrument is converted when ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">(c) it is paid on a forged indorsement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">(3) Subject to the provisions of this Act concerning restrictive indorsements a representative, including a depositary or collecting bank, who has in good faith and in accordance with the reasonable commercial standards applicable to the business of such representative dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>who was not the true owner is not liable in conversion or otherwise to the true owner beyond the amount of any proceeds remaining in his hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Under the former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(1)(c) a depositary bank is strictly liable for paying on a forged indorsement. There was a defense available, however, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(3), as set out above. FFB did not claim in the Law Division and does not claim on appeal that it has a valid defense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(3) but rather FFB simply mentions <em>Knesz v. Central Jersey Bank and Trust Co. of Freehold, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>1, 477 A.2d 806 (1984), in which the Court applied the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3 \u2014 419(3) defense. FFB cites <em>Knesz </em>for the proposition that because it is commercially reasonable for a depositary bank to rely upon its attorney-client\u2019s veracity when depositing multiple payee instruments, the depositary bank is not at \u201cfault.\u201d The reasoning in <em>Knesz </em>is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">There are two ways a depositary bank can be liable for paying on a forged indorsement. First, the depositary bank can be liable directly to the true owner, often the payee, for conversion as long as the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(3) defense does not apply. <em>See Mandelbaum v. P &amp; D Printing, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>427, 652 A.2d 1266 (App.Div.1995) (no defense available under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(3) where depositary bank accepts a multiple payee check with a missing indorsement). Second, the depositary bank is liable to the drawee bank on a warranty of good title theory. <em>See </em>former UCC \u00a7\u00a7 3-417, 4-207; <em>Mandelbaum, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 435, 652 A.2d 1266. The <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(3) defense does not operate in favor of a depositary bank as against subsequent holders. <em>See generally, </em>Janet Bergman Groue, <em>Forged Indorsements, Depositary Banks, and the Defense of Section 3-419(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code, </em>18 Hous. L.Rev. 173, 179-180 (1980) <em>(Forged Indorsements).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">In <em>Knesz, </em>the attorney, Moringiella, forged his client Knesz\u2019s indorsement on the two checks and gave the checks to attorney Collins in payment of an unrelated transaction, who then deposited the checks in his firm\u2019s trust account at Central Jersey Bank, which accepted the checks with the forged indorsements and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>forwarded them for collection. <em>Knesz, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>1, 477 A.2d 806. Knesz only sued Central Jersey Bank, the depositary bank. The Court, applying the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(3) defense, found that Central Jersey Bank was not liable in the lawsuit brought by Knesz. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 477 A.2d 806. The Court further stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">That immunity may be lost, however, under certain circumstances. A depositary bank or collecting bank may become <em>directly liable to an owner-payee </em>in conversion of a forged cheek where it (1) acted in bad faith; (2) failed to adhere to reasonable commercial standards of banking profession applicable to such transactions; or (3) had given a provisional credit to the forger or his transferee and had not yet disbursed the entire amount of the collection proceeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 21-22, 477 A.2d 806 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\"><em>Knesz </em>only stands for the proposition that a \u201ctrue owner\u201d or payee cannot succeed in a direct action against the depositary bank alone because the drawee bank is strictly liable to the maker, and the depositary bank is strictly liable to the drawee bank on a warranty theory. But if the payee brings an action against all the banks in the chain of collection and the maker, the reasoning of <em>Knesz </em>is irrelevant. The creation of this circuitous litigation brought criticism to the former section. <em>See Id. </em>at 12, 477 A.2d 806; <em>Forged Indorsements, </em>18 Hous. L.Rev. 173. Apparently, this is why the former defense available under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(c) has been eliminated in the new version of the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In <em>Nutt v. Chemical Bank, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57, 62-63, 555 A.2d 8 (App.Div.1989), this court upheld a summary judgment against the depositary bank on the issue of liability, appropriate under the former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419, where there was no dispute that an attorney forged his client\u2019s signature on a check made jointly payable to the attorney and client. In <em>Nutt, </em>we did not address <em>Knesz </em>or the defense available under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(3) because the plaintiff joined the depositary bank, the collecting bank, and the drawee bank and because the plaintiff claimed he was subrogated to the rights of the maker. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 555 A.2d 8. In this case the Lawyers\u2019 Fund likewise brought suit against all the banks and the makers, the insurance companies. The Law Division judge here held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>First Fidelity, as the depositary bank, is therefore primarily liable to Plaintiff if the instruments were converted. First Fidelity\u2019s liability as the depositary bank which dealt with the forger, on either a payable at or payable through draft, is primary to the liability of the Payor Banks, Collecting Banks, and DrawerDrawees. These parties are therefore entitled to summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Although the judge may not have had exactly the correct reasoning, the outcome is the same; because the Lawyers\u2019 Fund sued all the banks and makers, the depositary bank was ultimately and properly liable. Therefore, under the former UCC the depositary bank is strictly liable to the drawee bank, who is liable to the maker, who is in turn liable to the payee; the defense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(3) is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">B. The Current UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Any doubt under the former UCC provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419, that a depositary bank is liable for conversion when paying on a forged indorsement where there are two joint payees has been explicitly removed under the current <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420. The current UCC provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420. Conversion of Instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">a. The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">b. In an action under subsection a. of this section, the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on. the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiffs interest in the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">c. A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">\u201cSection 3-420 is a modification of former Section 3-419.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420, cmt. 1. The comments to the current <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420 provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The second sentence of Section 3-420(a) ... covers eases in which a depositary or payor bank takes an instrument bearing a forged indorsement. It also covers cases in which an instrument is payable to two persons and the two persons are not alternative payees, e.g., a check payable to John and Jane Doe. Under Section 3-110(d) the cheek can be negotiated or enforced only by both persons acting jointly. Thus, neither payee acting without the consent of the other, is a person entitled to enforce the instrument. If John indorses the cheek and Jane does not, the indorsement is not effective to allow negotiation of the check. If Depositary Bank takes the check for deposit to John\u2019s account, Depositary Bank is liable to Jane for conversion of the check if she did not consent to the transaction. John, acting alone, is not the person entitled to enforce the cheek because John is not the holder of the cheek. Section 3-110(d) and Comment 4 to Section 3-110. Depositary Bank does not get any greater rights under Section 4-205(1). If it acted for John as its customer, it did not become holder of the cheek under that provision because John, its customer, was not a holder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">If a check is payable to more than one payee, delivery to one of the payees is deemed to be delivery to all of the payees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">Subsection (3) of former Section 3-419 drew criticism from the courts, that saw no reason why a depositary bank should have the defense stated in the subsection. See <em>Knesz v. Central Jersey Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>[97 <em>N.J. </em>1,] 477 A.2d 806 (N.J.1984). The depositary bank is ultimately liable in the ease of a forged indorsement check because of its warranty to the payor bank under Section 4-208(a)(1) and it is usually the most convenient defendant in cases involving multiple checks drawn on different bank____the defense provided by Section 3-420(c) is limited to collecting banks other than the depositary bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420, cmt. 1, cmt. 3.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Because the cause of action in this case arose prior to the 1995 changes in the UCC, the former UCC version probably applies. <em>See Schiavo v. John F. Kennedy Hosp., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>380, 609 A.2d 781 (App.Div.1992) (newly enacted statutes apply prospectively), aff<em>\u2019d o.b., </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>400, 620 A.2d 1050 (1993). An argument could be advanced that the changes to the UCC were merely \u201ccurative\u201d and therefore the current provisions apply. Under either version, however, of the UCC, FFB is ultimately liable to the Lawyers\u2019 Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">FFB does not rely on <em>Knesz v. Central Jersey Bank and Trust Co. of Freehold, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>1, 477 A.2d 806 (1984), for the proposition that it has a defense under the UCC but rather uses <em>Knesz </em>for the proposition that because it is commercially reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>able for a depositary bank to rely upon its attorney-customer\u2019s veracity when depositing multiple payee instruments, the depositary bank is not at \u201cfault.\u201d Even if FFB was commercially reasonable when it accepted the forged cheeks in this case, FFB is still strictly liable for conversion for paying on forged indorsements. It is true that FFB may not have been acting with a \u201cculpable\u201d mien when it accepted the forged indorsements but under the UCC the depositary bank is still hable. There is no room to allow FFB\u2019s argument that it is \u201cinnocent\u201d to prevail. If the Lawyers\u2019 Fund was not involved, FFB would clearly be hable to the defrauded clients for converting their funds by paying on forged indorsements if the clients had sued ah the banks and the makers, as was done here. Because <em>R. </em>1:28 does not require \u201cculpable\u201d conduct on the part of the collateral source, FFB is an appropriate entity from which the Lawyers\u2019 Fund can seek reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">FFB attempts to distinguish <em>Security Title, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>358, 634 A.2d 90 (1993), on three grounds: (1) in that case the attorney represented not only the buyer but the title company as well; (2) the title insurer expressly undertook the risk of theft by the attorney through the closing-protection letter; and (3) embezzlement of closing funds is an obligation implicit in title insurance. Essentially FFB is urging that <em>Security Title </em>stands for the proposition that the Lawyers\u2019 Fund can only seek reimbursements from \u201ccollateral sources\u201d which are \u201cnot innocent\u201d or which explicitly undertake the risk of loss. But <em>R. </em>1:28 does not distinguish between morally \u201cinnocent\u201d and \u201cculpable\u201d collateral sources; we will imply no such aura to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We find the balance of FFB\u2019s argument: (1) lack of proximate cause; (2) failure to maintain a direct action against the bank; and (3) ratification by Lawyers\u2019 Fund, clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The historical textual changes to <em>R. </em>1:28 support the conclusion that the Lawyers\u2019 Fund currently has the right to pay a claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>before that claimant pursues collateral sources and then can, as subrogee or assignee of the claimant, pursue those collateral sources. This system avoids making defrauded clients engage in extensive litigation to recoup their losses. This efficient philosophy has been alluded to by the Supreme Court and adopted by other jurisdictions which have similar client funds. We affirm Judge Shuster\u2019s finding that the Lawyers\u2019 Fund has a right to subrogate against collateral sources other than the defrauding attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Under the former and the current versions of the UCC a depositary bank is strictly liable for paying on forged indorsements. In this case, if the claimants had pursued a legal action against FFB they would have prevailed because there was no factual dispute that the checks were forged and FFB accepted and paid under the forged indorsements. FFB is an appropriate collateral source to reimburse the Lawyers\u2019 Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-14\"> Prior to 1992 the Lawyers' Fund was called the Clients' Security Fund of the Bar of New Jersey (Clients' Fund).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> The current annual contribution ranges from $48 to $145 depending on the number of years at the Bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> Regulation 3.2(b) is still in effect.
