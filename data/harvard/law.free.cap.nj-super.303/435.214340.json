After the jury\u2019s verdict was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>turned, defendant pleaded guilty to a severed fourth count of the indictment charging possession of another handgun and to the severed fifth count of the indictment charging the unlawful possession of hollow nose bullets. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment subject to a thirty-year parole ineligibility term on the murder conviction, a consecutive five-year term on the conviction of one count of possession of a handgun without a permit, and a concurrent three-year term on the conviction of the second count of possession of a handgun without a permit. The hollow-nose bullet charge was dismissed and the charge of possession of a handgun with the purpose of using it unlawfully was merged into the murder conviction. Appropriate VCCB and SNSF penalties were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In challenging the judgment of conviction, defendant makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">I.

We agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>defendant that he was prejudiced by the combination of the testimony of the State\u2019s expert witness, Charles A. Peters, an F.B.I. physical scientist, and the references made to that testimony by the prosecutor in his summation, and, in the circumstances, the court\u2019s failure to give the jury adequate instructions to assist it in dealing with that testimony. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The victim of this senseless, brutal and tragic killing was a young man who was shot repeatedly on his front porch as he was returning to his home on Sanford Avenue in Newark in the early evening. There was no suggestion of any motive for the murder. No robbery was involved and there was no evidence at all suggesting any reason for this attack on the victim. According to the police testimony, on information received, neither the source nor content of which was disclosed, the police believed there might be a suspect at a house at 43 Silver Street, close to the intersection of Sanford Avenue and Silver Street. They went to that house in the early hours of the next morning and surrounded it with guns drawn. As they took up their positions, a bag of cocaine was thrown out of an upstairs window. The officers gained admission to the house and were given consent to search. The search took them eventually to the two-room attic, on whose landing they found another bag of cocaine containing some thirty vials. Four young people were sleeping in the attic rooms, among whom were Lamar Brown, who lived in the house, and his fifteen-year old girlfriend, Malika Williams, who frequently slept there. The four young people were taken to police headquarters for interrogation. Brown and Williams, in separate interviews, both said that they had witnessed the shooting and that defendant, with whom both were acquainted, was the gunman. Neither Williams nor Brown was ever charged with drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Based on the information received from Brown and Williams, the police tracked down defendant and found him several hours later. He was asleep in the pre-parole halfway house in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>then resided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant was awakened and placed under arrest. A bag containing eighteen bullets was found in his locker. Nine of the bullets were nine-millimeter bullets stamped with the manufacturer\u2019s name, Speers. The police had also recovered spent bullets and bullet casings at the crime scene. The shell casings were also stamped with the same manufacturer\u2019s name. Defendant also told the police that he had a handgun in his bed. The police seized that weapon, which was not, however, the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Before we address the expert-testimony problems, we note that without that testimony, the State\u2019s proofs consisted entirely of the two eyewitness identifications and defendant\u2019s possession of nine-millimeter Speers bullets. There was no evidence linking defendant in any way with the victim prior to the shooting. With respect to the eyewitness identifications, we point out first that Brown had recanted, asserting at trial that he had identified defendant as the gunman at the police station both because he had been beaten by the police and had been threatened with drug charges. He testified that he had not even been in Newark on the day of the shooting but had been visiting a friend in another city. His prior inconsistent statement identifying defendant was admitted pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>808(a)(1) following a hearing as mandated by <em>State v. Gross, 121 N.J. </em>18, 577 A.2d 814 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Malika Williams, Brown\u2019s girlfriend, testified that she had spent most of the day \u201changing out\u201d at a store at the corner of Sanford Avenue and Silver Street with a group of other young people, including her boyfriend Brown, whom she claimed to be a drug dealer operating at the corner. She had seen defendant in the area during the latter part of the afternoon, and, in fact, had gone into the house at 43 Silver Street to make two telephone calls for him at his request, reporting to him that there had been no answer. Not long after the second telephone call and after she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>had returned to the corner, she heard the sound of shooting. Although all the other people at the corner ran away, she ran into the middle of the street to see what was happening. She saw the gunman shooting the victim and then running away past her. She testified that although the gunman was masked, the mask slipped down as he ran past her and she was able to identify him as the defendant. The police conceded that none of the other young people who had been standing at the corner had been interviewed regarding the shooting although Williams had given them the names of a number of them. One of them testified for the defense, asserting that she too had been at the corner, heard the shooting, and ran away. She also testified that she had seen Williams and another young woman leave the corner prior to the shooting and asserted that Williams was not present when the shooting took place. Finally, this defense witness further testified that Williams had admitted to her that she, Williams, had lied in making her identification of defendant and that the identification was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Thus, with respect to the eyewitnesses, both of whom were found in the house where a suspect was believed to be and both of whom were evidently involved with drugs, one recanted and the testimony of the other was contradicted by an apparently disinterested witness. We think it plain that without the expert bullet evidence, the State\u2019s case, so heavily dependent on the prior inconsistent statement of Lamar Brown and the testimony of Williams, was a close one, and we further note that the jury was also obviously concerned since it had asked for a read-back of Williams\u2019 testimony. Nor do we think that the evidence that defendant possessed bullets of the same calibre and manufacture as those used in the shooting tipped the scales overwhelmingly. It was surely a link, but in view of the ready availability of such bullets, hardly a conclusive one. In our view, the bullet match, without the expert testimony, had much the same effect as a suspect\u2019s possession of a shoe of the same manufacture and wide distribution as one that had left an incriminating footprint. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>evidence to be considered, but it does not carry great probative weight. In sum, the State\u2019s ease was adequate but not strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We consider the expert testimony, to whose admission defendant objected, in this context. The State produced Charles A. Peters, a physical scientist employed for some twenty years by the F.B.I. in its material analysis unit. Peters is highly experienced in lead bullet analysis, which, as he explained to the jury, is now performed by a complex process called coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP analysis), a process whose theory and application he also explained to the jury in excruciating technical detail complete with charts. The import of his testimony was that lead bullets are made from an initial source of molten lead. The source is also referred to as a batch or a pouring. It was his opinion that there is variation in each batch of the presence and percentage of trace elements, including antimony, bismuth, silver, tin, copper, and arsenic, and it is highly improbable that any two batches could have the identical composition. Since his spectroscopic analysis of the nine-millimeter bullets found in defendant\u2019s possession had the identical composition to those that killed the victim, the expert opined that the bullets had all come from the same batch. Peters also testified that in the bullet-manufacture process, the molten lead constituting the source is poured into seventy-pound blocks called billets and that the bullets are made out of the billets. It was his opinion that about 43,000 nine-millimeter bullets could be made from a single billet. Although he opined that a single batch would produce \u201cmany\u201d billets, he was unable to quantify the number of identical billets any more specifically. It was, however, clear that at least hundreds of thousands of identical nine-millimeter bullets could be produced from the same batch. We further note that Peters expressly disavowed expertise in the manufacturing or marketing process, a disavowal no doubt accounting for his inability to quantify the number of billets produced by a batch. Nor was any testimony offered as to marketing, that is, whether, as seems likely, bullets from the same billets would be shipped together by the manufacturer and hence that there would be a concentration of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>bullets in a specific geographical region. Mr. Peters did, however, opine that bullets manufactured from the same billet are ordinarily immediately boxed and hence shipped together.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Obviously, the prosecutor\u2019s purpose in offering the testimony of Mr. Peters was to persuade the jury that the identical composition of the two sets of bullets significantly enhanced the strength of the link between defendant and the crime, that is, the link that had already been established by the identity of calibre and manufacture. That is clear from his summation, by which he attempted to impart scientific certainty to an implied conclusiveness of that link, bolstering that argument with a patently improper voucher for the credibility of his witness. This is what he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">Finally Mr. Charles Peters of the FBI. I realized that was some sophisticated testimony and I know I personally had trouble following it. But I hope the conclusions are what came clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">It is a very precise, scientific process that has been used for, I believe, he said about, about 30 years to test these bullet leads and his testimony is critical to this ease because it completely blows away the murder theory advanced by the defense that Malika and Lamar somehow engineered the murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">Now do you think Mr. Peters was a liar? He\u2019s not a cop. He\u2019s not even an FBI agent. Challes Peters is a scientist and he looked like a scientist; didn\u2019t he? You could almost see him in a white lab coat. You could see him in math class in a high school in the back. He had all the answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">He\u2019s a straight shooter. Did not testify beyond what the results of his examination were. Didn\u2019t try to make it out to be more than what it was but it is something very critical in this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">Basically what he told us was that an examination of bullets, whenever a manufacturer is going to run a line of bullets, they order a source of lead from a lead smelter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">I asked him if that was like a \u201cbatch.\u201d He said it was. The scientists like using the word \u201csource.\u201d I think it is easier to conceive of as a batch of lead and he said that there are millions, literally millions of these batches of lead out in circulation. And from those millions of batches of lead out in circulation, there are billions of bullets produced each year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">The key, I submit to you, is not what Mr. Roberts said it is, not about the number of billets produced \u2014 the number of bullets produced, <em>the key is the number of sources of lead; the number of batches. Millions of batches; each one unique like a snowflake; like a fingerprint.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">At that point defense counsel objected to the characterization. The judge\u2019s response was \u201c[mjetaphor; overruled,\u201d and the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>cutor continued, summarizing the technical testimony and emphasizing the asserted significance of the batch identity. Finally, we note that in his charge to the jury regarding expert testimony, the judge gave only the brief and standard form of instruction, merely telling the jury that an expert is a person with special knowledge, skill, experience or training, permitted for that reason to express an opinion but that the jury is not bound by that opinion. There was no reference to the content or significance of Mr. Peters\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">To begin with, we have no doubt that ICP analysis of lead bullets is a process adequately accepted by the scientific community and producing sufficiently reliable results to warrant the admission of expert testimony regarding the test and the test results. Although the issue has not been addressed in a reported opinion in this State, we reach that conclusion based on Peters\u2019 testimony and the rationale employed in those jurisdictions so holding in respect of both ICP bullet analysis and predecessor, less sophisticated tests. <em>See, e.g., Bryan v. Oklahoma, </em>935 P.2d 338 (Okla. Crim.App.1997); <em>U.S. v. Davis, </em>103 F.3d 660 (8th Cir.1996), <em>cert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2424, 138 L.Ed.2d 187 (1997); <em>State v. Freeman, </em>531 N.W.2d 190 (Minn.1995); <em>State v. Strain, </em>885 P.2d 810 (Utah.Ct.App.1994); <em>State v. Grube, </em>126 <em>Idaho </em>377, 883 P.2d 1069 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>1098, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1828, 131 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>749 (1995); <em>People v. Johnson, </em>114 <em>Ill.2d </em>170, 102 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>342, 499 N.E.2d 1355 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>951, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1618, 94 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 802, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>1060, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2205, 95 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>860 (1987); <em>State v. Ware, </em>338 <em>N.W.2d </em>707 (Iowa 1983); <em>Jones v. State, </em>425 N.E.2d 128 (Ind.1981) (Hunter, J. dissenting). <em>See also </em>Erwin S. Barbre, Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence of Neutron Activation Analysis, </em>50 <em>A.L.R.3d </em>117 (1973) and supplemental service.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Consequently, we are satisfied that the State was entitled to have the jury apprised that its expert had concluded, for the reasons he explained, that the two sets of bullets had the identical composition and came from the same batch of lead. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>nevertheless persuaded that prejudicial foundational omissions from that expert testimony, coupled by the way in which it was commented upon, deprived defendant of a fair trial. The concerns we have appear not to have been either raised or addressed by the out-of-state opinions holding the evidence admissible except in Justice Hunter\u2019s dissent in <em>Jones v. State, supra, </em>425 N.E.2d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Our essential difficulty with the evidence is this. As we have noted, defendant\u2019s possession of the same calibre bullets of the same manufacture as those that killed the victim constitutes a link between defendant and the crime, but of limited, or at least potentially limited, probative weight. Establishment of the fact that the two sets of bullets came from the same source of lead clearly enhances the probative weight that a jury would be inclined to accord to mere similarity of calibre and manufacture. The problem is in what we regard to have been an unwarranted enhancement of probative weight inherent in the expert\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s comment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We think it plain that the enhancement value to be placed on the same-batch conclusion must be basically a statistical probability exercise, that is, an assessment by the trier of fact of how much more likely it is that both sets of bullets were defendant\u2019s because they not only matched in calibre and manufacture but also in composition. That assessment must necessarily depend on how many nine-millimeter bullets could have been produced from a single batch, what the likelihood is that those same bullets wound up for sale in the same geographical area, and what percentage of nine-millimeter bullets marketed in the Newark area came from Speers. Obviously, the strength of the link created by identical composition is a factor of how many bullets of identical composition were simultaneously available for sale in the Newark area, and, just as obviously, the statistical probability of defendant having possessed both sets of bullets declines as the number of identical bullets increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Peters was unable to testify to the total number of such bullets because he could not say how many billets come from a single batch. Nor did he testify as to how many bullets are shipped for sale in a single consignment or in what quantity the manufacturer boxes bullets. It is probable that the jury\u2019s assessment of the strength of the link would be affected by whether defendant had a handful of similar bullets out of 1,000, or out of 10,000, or out of 100,000, or out of a million.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The critical significance of affording the jury a statistical basis upon which to evaluate inconclusive scientific evidence has been recognized by at least one scholar. Thus, as explained by Professor Margaret A. Berger in <em>Procedural Paradigms For Applying the Daubert Test, </em>78 <em>Minn. L.Rev. </em>1345,1356-1358 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Prior to <em>Daubert [Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>579, 113 <em>S.Ct </em>2786, 125 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>469 (1993) ], courts admitted scientific evidence without noticing that, in some instances, the probative value of the evidence depends on background statistical information. If, for example, the samples of tape to which a defendant had access at his place of work match samples of tape used to manufacture a bomb sent through the mails from an unknown location, the probative value of that evidence is virtually non-existent if thousands of identical rolls of tape were distributed throughout the world. The crucial scientific inquiry in these cases is not only whether the technique is capable of producing matches, but also the probability that other matches exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">It is true of course that when a test can reliably match two samples, such as samples of a defendant\u2019s blood, hair, drugs, or bullets, with samples taken at the crime scene, the resulting evidence passes the basic Rule 401 relevancy test. A match does have a \u201ctendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable ... than it would be without the evidence.\u201d We allow eyewitnesses to testify that the person fleeing the scene wore a yellow jacket and permit proof that a defendant owned a yellow jacket without establishing the background rate of yellow jackets in the community. Jurors understand, however, that others than the accused own yellow jackets. When experts testify about samples matching in every respect, the jurors may be oblivious to the probability concerns if no background rate is offered, or may be unduly prejudiced or confused if the probability of a match is confused with the probability of guilt, or if a background rate is offered that does not have an adequate scientific foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">[Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">In sum, the consequence of Peters\u2019 expertise in bullet lead composition but his lack of expertise in bullet manufacturing and marketing deprived the jury of a fair basis on which to evaluate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the significance of the bullet-lead identity testimony. Thus, as Justice Hunter observed in <em>Jones v. State, supra, </em>425 N.E.2d at 135:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">The lack of certainty in Agent Riley\u2019s ultimate conclusion is further emphasized by his testimony that as many as 100,000 bullets are produced from the same batch of lead, that 200 boxes of bullets of similar composition would in turn result, and that all retailers in a particular geographic area might consequently market bullets of similar composition. Furthermore, Agent Riley stated that \u201cthere are other leads that are going to be manufactured some place along the way that can be very close to this composition, if not the same.\u201d In stating that the bullets \u201ccould have come\u201d from the same source, he offered little more than an educated guess ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\"><em>See also, </em>directly addressing the type of bullet-match scientific evidence here involved, Andre A. Moenssens, et al., <em>Scientific Evidence In Criminal Cases, </em>541 (3d Ed.1986) noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">that while courts have admitted neutron activation analysis, to match bullets and to link the accused to a crime involving the use of a firearm, \u201cthe number of bullets manufactured with similar elemental characteristics by the same manufacturer may be so numerous as to make the likelihood of the accused\u2019s link to the evidence bullet statistically tenuous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">[Berger, <em>supra, </em>at 1357 n. 71.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The New Jersey Supreme Court, in <em>State v. Spann, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>484, 617 A.2d 247 (1993), has addressed the problem of expert opinion, whose significance, as here, is necessarily affected by variables that are not explicated. The issue in <em>Spann </em>involved bloodtesting to establish paternity. As the Court there noted, traditionally available modes of bloodtesting were sufficient to exclude the conclusion of paternity but not to prove paternity. But although only evidence of exclusion was admissible in a civil action to establish paternity, non-exclusion evidence was admissible in a criminal trial despite its light probative weight, because, as the Court explained, even though such evidence was \u201cinsignificantly probative,\u201d it nevertheless was admissible as a \u201clink in the chain of evidence in criminal trials just as the alleged assailant\u2019s blond hair is used against a blond defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 617 A.2d 247. In <em>Spann, </em>the expert, using HLA (human leukocyte antigen) testing, concluded that based on Bayes\u2019 Theorem, a mathematical probability formula, the probability of defendant\u2019s paternity was 96.55%. Employment of that formula was predicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>on assumptions and variables the jury clearly did not understand or have before it and as to which it was not instructed, resulting in inevitable confusion on its part as to how to evaluate and assess the expert testimony and, therefore, resulting in prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We appreciate that <em>Spann </em>dealt with probability testimony expressed in percentages and that the expert testimony here did not quantify the probability of the ultimate conclusion, namely, that defendant had possessed both sets of bullets. But we think the principle is the same, and that principle, as we understand it, is that when the probative significance of expert testimony is dependent on statistical probabilities and the testimony is likely to be misleading out of the context of the relevant variables determining the statistical probabilities, the jury must be given sufficient guidance, either by additional foundation testimony or by the court\u2019s instruction, to be able to understand and assess the true import of the testimony. This necessity is obviously further compelled by the well-recognized phenomenon, as stated by Justice Hunter in his <em>Jones </em>dissent, that \u201cextensive and impressive credentials such as those revealed here, together with the testimony of a sophisticated technological nature far beyond the average layman\u2019s understanding, may impress a jury and influence inordinately the weight which is attached to the expert\u2019s testimony.\u201d 425 N.E.2d at 137. And when that expert is an F.B.I. agent, inappropriately vouched for by the prosecutor, that eventuality is exaggerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In our view, the expert testimony here had a clear capacity to confuse the jury and mislead it into ascribing significantly more probative weight to the identical-composition expert opinion than it warranted. This problem could have been avoided by requiring the State to submit foundation evidence of the nature we have suggested and by instructions from the court explaining to the jury the inherent probative limitations of the expert opinion. Nor would we exclude the necessity of a hearing-under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 in the event no curative foundation evidence were proffered for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>purpose of permitting a judicial determination of whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. As the United States Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Daubert, supra, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at 595, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2798, 125 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 484, with respect to expert evidence having an inordinate capacity for prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Finally, Rule 403 permits the exclusion of relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury____\u201d Judge Weinstein has explained: \u201cExpert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it. Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 of the present rules exercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses.\u201d Weinstein, 138 F.R.D., at 632.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\"><em>See also </em>Berger, <em>supra, </em>at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Beyond the inherent problems with the expert testimony itself, we are also persuaded that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201csnowflake or fingerprint\u201d comment during closing must necessarily have further misled the jury in its task of assessing the probative value of Peters\u2019 identical-composition testimony. We recognize that to some extent the comment did not actually mischaracterize the testimony that the batches were most likely unique, although there was no real evidential basis for the \u201cmillions of batches\u201d comment. The point, of course, is that the relationship of batches to billets to bullets was already confusing enough and insufficiently developed by the expert testimony. Thus, the clear import of the fingerprint and snowflake comparison was to suggest to the jury a scientific certainty in the inference that defendant had possessed both sets of bullets and to suggest to the jury a conclusiveness of that inference that clearly was not warranted. We conclude, therefore, that no matter how indulgently we might view the problems with the expert testimony itself, the prosecutor\u2019s summation, uncorrected by the court on defendant\u2019s objection, injected a high degree of prejudice into this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">We recognize that to some extent, the defense could have dealt with some of the problems we have identified by way of cross-examination and summation. But it had no opportunity to correct the prosecutor\u2019s summation. And the fact remains that the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>pert\u2019s testimony, taken as a whole, nevertheless had the inherent capacity, because of the omissions we have identified, to have misled this lay jury. Because we are persuaded that the State\u2019s case was close, we conclude that defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was prejudiced by the expert testimony and the comment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We have carefully considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and have concluded that they are without sufficient merit to warrant disposition by written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). The judge did not mistakenly exercise his discretion in dealing with the agitated juror; the reasonable doubt charge, read in context, was entirely correct; and there was no reasonable basis in the record to charge aggravated manslaughter. This was an assassination.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> The jury, of course, was not made aware of the nature of that communal residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b478-7\">HUMPHREYS, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Antwan Hargrove died on his front porch in a hail of bullets. Two eyewitnesses identified the defendant as the killer. When arrested a few days later, the defendant had bullets in a bag in his locker at the State prison half-way-house. The bullets were of the same caliber as those used to shoot Antwan Hargrove. Tests by the State\u2019s expert showed that some bullets in the defendant\u2019s bag and some bullets at the crime scene were of identical composition, came from the same batch of lead and were manufactured by the same manufacturer, the Speer Company. The defendant did not offer any contrary expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">My colleagues reverse this conviction largely on \u201cplain error\u201d grounds, that is on issues not raised below. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2. They consider this case to be \u201cclose.\u201d They reverse because they are \u201cpersuaded\u201d that the testimony of the State\u2019s expert coupled with a one sentence proper comment by the prosecutor in his summation might have confused the jury as to the probative force of the test results on the bullets. They conclude that the \u201cfoundation\u201d for the expert\u2019s testimony was insufficient. They would require the trial judge to <em>sua sponte </em>fashion a charge \u201cexplaining to the jury ... the inherent probative limitations of the expert opinion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Majority opinion, op. at 448, 697 A.2d at 164. I disagree with all of these conclusions and would affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The State\u2019s case was strong, not close. The testimony of the female eyewitness to the shooting was clear and certain. She was subjected to extensive cross-examination. Her credibility is for the jury, not for an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The other eyewitness had given the police a written statement under oath in which he said he saw the defendant shoot Antwan Hargrove. At trial, he claimed that he had lied to the police because five or six police officers beat him. A hearing was held outside the presence of the jury. The eyewitness testified at the hearing and admitted that the alleged beatings had left practically no marks and that he had not sought medical attention. A police officer testified at the hearing that the witness was not beaten in any way and that the witness\u2019s statement was entirely voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">At the end of the hearing, the trial judge ruled that the statement was admissible. The judge found that the witness\u2019s written statement identifying the defendant as the killer was \u201cinherently believable.\u201d The judge said that he did \u201cnot believe the witnesses] testimony with respect to pressure placed upon him or any coercion placed upon him to make the statement. I believe the officer in that regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The two eyewitnesses and the evidence of the defendant\u2019s possessing bullets of the same caliber and manufacturer as those used to shoot Antwan Hargrove add up to strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">My colleagues state they are satisfied that \u201cthe State was entitled to have the jury apprised that its expert had concluded, for the reasons he explained, that the two sets of bullets [the ones from the shooting and the ones in the defendant\u2019s bag] had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>identical composition, and came from the same batch of lead.\u201d Nonetheless, the majority finds that there were \u201cprejudicial foundational omissions\u201d to the introduction of this evidence. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The expert\u2019s testimony was well founded. He was a physical scientist employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He had worked for the FBI for nearly seventeen years and was their chief chemist in bullet lead analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">He was well qualified on the subject. He had testified as an expert on bullet lead analysis on numerous occasions and had analyzed tens of thousands of bullets. He was a co-author of two papers that deal with bullet lead analysis. He was \u201cfamiliar with the bullet manufacturing process.\u201d He had toured the Speer manufacturing plant and had reviewed their manufacturing processes for bullets. This testimony provided ample support for the trial judge\u2019s decision to permit the expert to testify on these subjects. <em>See Dawson v. Bunker Hill Plaza Assoc., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 323, 673 A.2d 847 (App.Div.) (a proper foundation has been laid if the witness is in possession of such facts as will enable the witness to express a reasonably accurate conclusion as distinguished from a mere guess or conjecture), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>569, 683 A.2d 1164 (1996); <em>see also State v.

Frost, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>601, 615, 577 A.2d 1282 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>321, 604 A.2d 596 (1990). (\u201cThe credibility of the expert, and the weight to be accorded his or her testimony, is assessed by the trier of fact; any testimonial or experience weaknesses in the testimony may be exposed by cross-examination.\u201d); <em>see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>579, 596, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2786, 2798, 125 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>469, 484 (1993) (\u201cVigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Furthermore, the expert\u2019s testimony about the test results and the manufacturing process was virtually undisputed. Defense counsel in his summation did not question the accuracy of the testimony of the State\u2019s expert. Nor does defense counsel in his appellate brief appear to seriously question the accuracy of the expert\u2019s testimony. My colleagues also do not appear to question the accuracy of his testimony. Their challenge to the expert\u2019s testimony centers on the strength of its probative force, but this is an issue which the jury should determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The expert\u2019s testimony was balanced and fair. Basically, the expert testified that the initial source of bullets is a pot of lead sometimes called a batch. A manufacturer orders a billet of lead. A billet is a seventy pound cylinder of lead taken from a batch. Bullets are then extruded from the billet. Bullets from the same billet would have the same composition, i.e. the same amount of trace metals. It is not unusual, the expert testified, to find bullets in a box of ammunition which have several compositions. This is because, the expert testified, \u201cwhat we have in between bullets being made, they\u2019re being stored and some mix occurs and that is why in a box of ammunition we\u2019ll get several compositions of bullet lead.\u201d However, \u201cif you find several of these compositions within bullets, it suggests that they came from that box of ammunition or a box that was manufactured or packaged around that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The expert tested nine bullets from the defendant\u2019s bag and six spent bullets from the crime scene. The tests were for trace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>metals. The bullets were all nine millimeter and all manufactured by Speer. The tests showed that all but one of the bullets could be divided into four different groups. The bullets in each of the four groups were \u201canalytically indistinguishable\u201d from each other, i.e., each bullet in that group had the same amount of trace metals. Each group contained bullets from the defendant\u2019s bag and a spent bullet or bullets from the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Thus, some bullets from the crime scene and some bullets from the defendant\u2019s bag came from the same batch and billet used at Speer. That does not mean that the bullets used to shoot Antwan Hargrove necessarily came from the defendant\u2019s bag. The expert readily conceded on cross-examination that over 4,300 bullets could be manufactured from one billet; that there could be many billets with the same lead composition; and that there were many thousands of bullets, \u201cat least 50,000\u201d, with the same composition as those he had tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The expert was forthright and candid in his testimony. Defense counsel and the judge agreed that the expert had not significantly hurt the defense. At a side bar conference, the judge said: \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound to me like he\u2019s done anything you\u2019re afraid of.\u201d Defense counsel responded: \u201cHe certainly had not. He\u2019s been pretty straight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The expert\u2019s testimony was clearly admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">If scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\"><em>[Ibid.; see also </em>Biunno, <em>Current N.J.

Evid. </em>702).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The expert was not asked and did not give any opinion about the probability that the bullets from the crime scene came from the defendant\u2019s bag. His testimony was not, as the majority says, a \u201cstatistical probability exercise.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 445, 697 A.2d at 162. In essence, he testified that his tests showed that some of the bullets from the crime scene and some of the bullets found in the defendant\u2019s bag had the identical amount of trace metals. His testimony merely added another link to the chain of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Such evidence is eminently proper. <em>See State v.

In <em>State v. Krummacher, </em>269 <em>Or. </em>125, 523 P.2d 1009 (1974), the State introduced the results of bullet lead analysis to establish that the fatal bullet could have come from the same batch of metal as the group of bullets taken from the defendant\u2019s home. The Supreme Court of Oregon upheld the trial judge\u2019s admission of the test results notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s contentions that it had not been shown the bullets came from a particular batch and that there was insufficient evidence of the total number of batches of similar bullets manufactured by that company. <em>Id., </em>523 P.2d at 1017. The Oregon Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>said that the defendant\u2019s contentions \u201cgo to the evidence\u2019s convincing power rather than to its admissibility.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also State v.

That party may on cross-examination, supply the omitted conditions or facts and ask the expert if his or her opinion would be changed by them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The case of <em>State v. Spann, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>484, 617 A.2d 247 (1993), relied on by the majority is clearly distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Spann, </em>the defendant was convicted of sexual assault. A child resulted from the assault. The State\u2019s expert testified that based on blood and tissue tests, the \u201cprobability\u201d of the defendant\u2019s \u201cpaternity was 96.55%.\u201d The Court pointed out that the expert knew \u201cabsolutely nothing about the facts of the case except those revealed by the blood and tissue test of defendant, the victim, the child and that the defendant was the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 617 A.2d 247. The Court noted that this type of mathematical probability opinion testimony is highly prejudicial because if, for example, it could be conclusively proven that the defendant was out of the country at the time when conception could have occurred, the \u201cexpert still would have concluded that the probability defendant was the father was 96.55%.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 617 A.2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The problem arose, the Court said: \u201cwhen a mathematical computation is added to the [evidence] mix, one that purports precisely to calculate the probability of the ultimate issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 617 A.2d 247. Further evidence is required, the Court said, before such mathematical probability opinion testimony is admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 617 A.2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The Court in <em>Spann </em>carefully distinguished mathematical probability opinion testimony from the admission into evidence of the blood test results. The Court pointed out that the results of the test are admissible not to prove paternity conclusively but as a link in the chain of evidence. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>Even though insignificantly probative, it [the test result] nevertheless was admissible as \u201ca link in the chain of evidence\" in criminal trials, </em>just as the alleged assailant\u2019s blond hair is used against a blond defendant. <em>See State v. Beard, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>50, 58-59, 106 A.2d 265 (1954) (holding type 0 \u2014 the victim\u2019s blood type and also the most common type \u2014 blood stains on defendant\u2019s clothing admissible as \u201clink in the chain of evidence\u201d); <em>see also State v. Alexander, </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>585, 593-94, 83 A.2d 441 (1951) (allowing evidence of defendant\u2019s blood type at murder trial for purpose of showing it was of the same type as blood found on the murder weapon), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 <em>U.S. </em>908, 72 <em>S.Ct </em>638, 96 <em>L. Ed, </em>1326 (1952).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\"><em>[Spann, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 617 A.2d 247 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In the present case, the expert did not present any mathematical formula nor express any conclusion based on such a formula. Furthermore, he gave no opinion as to the probability that the bullets from the crime scene came from the defendant\u2019s bag. His opinion was that some of the bullets in the defendant\u2019s bag and some of the bullets from the crime scene came from the same batch or source of metal from which the seventy pound billet was made and from which bullets were extruded. Such evidence is simply a link in the chain of evidence and thus clearly admissible in criminal trials. <em>See ibid.; see also Andre A. Moenssens et al.; Scientific Evidence in Criminal Cases </em>\u00a7 4.21 at 246 (3d ed. 1986) (\u201cThe use of various instrumental techniques to analyze the trace elements in bullet lead has enabled an expert to identify a bullet as having come from a particular batch of bullets. If bullets having trace elements similar to a crime bullet are found in a defendant\u2019s possession, this may be <em>significant circumstantial evidence of guilt.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Moreover, the defendant had the opportunity to conduct and did conduct a probing and able cross-examination of the expert. The defendant also had the opportunity to produce his own expert witn\u00e9ss if he seriously challenged the testimony of the State\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Further, if the expert\u2019s testimony was misleading or prejudicial, the defendant could have asked the judge for a specific charge. The defendant did not ask for such a charge, perhaps agreeing with Justice Hunter\u2019s statement in <em>Elza v. Liberty Loan Corp.: </em>\u2018We entrust juries to evaluate the degree of reliability which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>should be attached to testimony in such highly technical matters as the nuances of [bullet] neutron activation analysis.\u201d 426 N.E.2d 1302, 1311 (Ind.1981) (Hunter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In any event, there is no sound basis for my colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the trial judge was required in this case to <em>sua sponte </em>fashion a charge for the jury. The charge the judge gave contained the usual instructions regarding the testimony of an expert. The defendant had no objection to the charge. The failure to object bars any later challenge to either the charge or any omission therefrom unless the charge or the omission is clearly capable of prejudicing a substantial right. <em>See R. </em>1:7-2; <em>R. </em>1:7-5; <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>see also State v.

(a court may infer from a party\u2019s failure to object at trial that \u201cin the context of the trial, the error was actually of no moment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">My colleagues\u2019 reliance on Justice Hunter\u2019s dissent in <em>Jones v. State, </em>425 N.E.2d 128, 135 (Ind.1981) (Hunter, J., dissenting), is misplaced. In <em>Jones, </em>the State\u2019s expert compared the bullets taken from the defendant\u2019s pocket with a portion of the bullet removed from the victim. The expert testified that based on his testing, the bullet taken from the victim\u2019s body \u201ccould have come\u201d from the box of ammunition which contained bullets seized from the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 131. Justice Hunter viewed this evidence as lacking \u201creasonable scientific certainty to imbue it with probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135 (Hunter, J., dissenting). In contrast, the expert in the present case did not testify that in his opinion the bullets from the crime scene <em>could have, </em>or did, come from the defendant\u2019s bag. Instead, the expert presented to the jury the results of his scientific analysis of the bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Authorities in other jurisdictions almost uniformly permit bullet lead analysis to be introduced into evidence. In <em>Johnson, supra, </em>the FBI agent testified that the absence of a particular element in the samples prevented him from ultimately designating a match between the bullets found in the defendant\u2019s home and the bullets recovered from the victim. 102 <em>Ill-Dec. </em>at 353, 499 <em>N.E.</em>2d at 1366. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The expert testified, however, that there was a \u201csignificant correlation\u201d and that the samples he tested \u201cwould commonly be expected to be found among bullets in the same box of cartridges with compositions just like these and____could best be found from the same type and manufacture packaged on the same day.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The Court found in <em>Johnson </em>that the testimony of the FBI agent \u201cwhile not conclusive, clearly supports more than a possibility of common origin.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court therefore found the evidence admissible stating that \u201cany lack of certitude in a qualified expert\u2019s testimony, or inconclusiveness in the results of an otherwise reliable neutron-activation analysis goes to the weight and not to the admissibility of such evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354, 499 N.E.2d at 1367. The Court said: \u201c[cjlearly the. test results were relevant in establishing, as more probable, the material fact that the bullets from the ... murder were from the same box as the cartridges found in defendant\u2019s home.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">In <em>Bryan, swpra, </em>the court found as proper circumstantial evidence that bullet fragments in the victim\u2019s head were manufactured by the same company and \u201cappeared to be from the same source or batch\u201d as those found in the defendant\u2019s possession. 935 P.2d at 359. The court said that the FBI agent\u2019s testimony \u201cprovides more than speculation that the bullets came from the same box, and did not invade the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. The court explained that the evidence assisted the jury \u201cin understanding the evidence suggesting that the bullets in this case came, not only from the same manufacturer, but from the same metallurgical source and were probably found in the same box.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Freeman, supra, </em>531 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 195 (permitting this evidence to be considered by the jury); <em>Jones, supra, </em>425 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 131 (same); <em>Krummacher, supra, </em>523 P.2d at 1017 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The prosecutor did not make a misstatement in his summation. The prosecutor said that there are \u201c[mjillions of batches; each one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>unique like a snow flake; like a fingerprint.\u201d Defense counsel objected, saying that was not the testimony as to \u201cbatches or billets.\u201d The judge responded, \u201c[mjetaphor; overruled.\u201d The prosecutor continued saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[the expert! said they were unique and all could be distinguished. I\u2019m giving you an example, like snowflakes could be distinguished. Use your own recollection, of course, but that\u2019s the key to the examination. They could take any two batches of lead and they could distinguish them, based on the amount of the various elements in them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s statement was not incorrect. The statement was fair comment based on the evidence presented by the expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">In sum, my colleagues have spun out of gossamer threads a chimera of an unfair trial. <em>See Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 <em>U.S. </em>97, 122, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 338, 78 <em>L. Ed. </em>674, 687 (1934) (Cardozo, J.) (\u201cgossamer possibilities of prejudice\u201d should not \u201cset the guilty free.\u201d). The reality is quite different. No error was committed in this trial, plain or otherwise. The rulings of the experienced trial judge were sound and well within his discretion. No \u201cnovel questions\u201d are presented in this case. See majority opinion, at 437, 697 A.2d at 158. The testimony of the State\u2019s expert was unexceptionable and patently admissible. His testimony was not crucial or highly prejudicial evidence of a type which would sway a jury. Indeed, the jury here focused not on the testimony of the expert but rather on the testimony of the eyewitnesses as shown by the jury asking for a read-back of the eyewitness testimony but not for the expert\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor\u2019s statement in summation was a fair comment on the evidence. The State\u2019s case was strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The defendant received a fair trial. The jury having heard the evidence and having been properly charged on the law decided that the defendant murdered Antwan Hargrove. The jury\u2019s verdict should stand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
