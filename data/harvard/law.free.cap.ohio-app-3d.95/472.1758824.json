Kay (\u201cKay\u201d) timely appeals from three judgment entries of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas awarding damages to plaintiff-appellee Kenneth R. Yackel (\u201cYackel\u201d) against Kay in the sum of $312,600 with interest. Yackel originally brought this action against both Kay and Zatko Pulley Manufacturing Corporation (\u201cZatko\u201d) but subsequently voluntarily dismissed Zatko as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">Zatko, a close corporation, <em>i.e., </em>a corporation having only a few shareholders, was formed in 1971 by Kay who at the time of incorporation caused one hundred shares of stock to be issued. At the time relevant herein, Kay was President of Zatko and owned, along with three of his adult daughters, sixty percent of the stock in Zatko which he controlled. In 1979, Yackel purchased ten percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Zatko stock for $25,000 and was made Vice President of Sales.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The remaining thirty percent of stock was owned by Max Horvat, Executive Vice President of Zatko, who essentially managed the. Zatko corporation for Kay since Kay was also President of Premier Manufacturing Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In his complaint, Yackel alleged that from 1980 through 1990, Kay breached his fiduciary duty owing to minority stockholders of Zatko by using his position as majority shareholder to derive personal financial benefit from Zatko thereby depriving minority shareholders of their just share of the corporation\u2019s profits. In his appellate brief, Yackel specifically stated the evidence revealed Kay breached his fiduciary duty by causing Zatko to, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) pay Kay an excessive salary of $67,500 per year plus bonuses which in 1989 and 1990 alone amounted to $412,000; (2) pay Kay\u2019s personal automobile and gasoline expenses in the amount of $73,244<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; (3) pay the premium for medical insurance covering Kay, his former wife and an unidentified party named Rose Kline in the amount of $39,793; (4) pay Kay\u2019s personal American Express and Diner\u2019s Club bills in the amount of $193,672; (5) pay lease payments to Kay for equipment used by Zatko which was already owned by Zatko in the amount of $930,000; (6) pay Kay\u2019s personal travel expenses in an amount not stated; and (7) pay property taxes on real property owned by Kay also in an amount not stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Yackel also alleged in his complaint that Kay conspired with the remaining shareholders and subsequently orchestrated Yackel\u2019s removal as Vice President of Sales for Zatko in retaliation for Yackel\u2019s institution of the within action. Yackel prayed for Kay to reimburse the corporation and Yackel for monies wrongfully taken, for Kay to cease his illegal actions and for compensatory and punitive damages totalling $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In response, Kay filed a counterclaim against Yackel claiming that Yackel, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) engaged in extortion and exerted undue influence and duress upon Kay; (2) intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Kay; and (3) libeled Kay. Thereafter, Kay filed a motion for summary judgment which the court overruled and the case proceeded to trial before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">At the close of all the evidence, Yackel moved for directed verdict on all counts of Kay\u2019s counterclaim. The trial court granted the motion with respect to the claims of extortion and intentional infliction of emotional distress but permitted the claim of libel to proceed to the jury. Kay then moved for a directed verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>on the grounds Yackel had no standing to pursue an action directly against Kay, <em>ie., </em>Yackel\u2019s action should have been brought as a derivative action against Zatko pursuant to Civ.R. 23.1 and on the ground that Yackel had not presented evidence sufficient to support his claims against Kay. The court overruled Kay\u2019s motion for directed verdict and the case was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Kay then submitted fourteen proposed jury instructions and seventeen interrogatories for the jury on which the court declined to charge. Kay objected to the court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury with his jury instructions but made no further objections to the jury instructions given by the trial judge or to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to submit Kay\u2019s interrogatories to the jury. Thereafter, the jury found for Yackel against Kay on the issues of breach of fiduciary duty and wrongful discharge and awarded compensatory and punitive damages. The jury also found for Yackel with respect to the charge of libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Kay subsequently filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, new trial which the court denied. He then filed a motion for relief from-judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(A) and (B) with respect to only the award of prejudgment interest. The court granted this motion in part and ordered Kay to pay interest on only the compensatory damages from the date of judgment entry. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Logically, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error will be considered first and follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u201cII. The trial court erred by permitting a minority shareholder to bring a direct action to recover alleged damages arising out of excessive compensation paid to the controlling shareholder of a close corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">This assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Appellant claims in this second assignment that Yackel\u2019s direct action against Kay should have been brought as a derivative action against only Zatko in accordance with Civ.R. 23.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court, however, in <em>Crosby v. Beam </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 105, 109-110, 548 N.E.2d 217, 220-222, confronted a fact situation analogous to that in the case <em>sub judice </em>in which majority shareholders acted to exclude minority shareholders from sharing in corporate profits. The Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">\u201c[I]f we require a minority shareholder in a close corporation, who alleges that the majority shareholders breached their fiduciary duty to him, to institute an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>action pursuant to Civ.R. 23.1, then <em>any recovery would accrue to the corporation and remain under the control of the very parties who are defendants in the litigation. Thus, a derivative remedy is not an effective remedy because the wrongdoers would be the principal beneficiaries of the recovery. </em>* * *</p>\n<author id=\"b509-5\"><em>U* </em>* ;]j</author>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u201cAccordingly, we hold that claims of a breach of fiduciary duty alleged by minority shareholders against shareholders who control a majority of shares in a close corporation, and use their control to deprive minority shareholders of the benefits of their investment, <em>may be brought as individual or direct actions </em>and <em>are not subject to the provisions of Civ.R. 23.1.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). See <em>Cousins v. Brownfield </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 782, 615 N.E.2d 1064; <em>Frank Lemer &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Vassy </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 537, 599 N.E.2d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Yackel also alleged in his complaint he was wrongfully discharged and Kay\u2019s actions deprived him of his share of corporate profits; Yackel prayed to be compensated accordingly. Yackel, therefore, possessed a cause of action against Kay which was properly brought, pursuant to <em>Crosby, supra, </em>directly or individually against Kay. As the Supreme Court astutely foresaw, if Kay had been ordered to reimburse only the corporation, Kay as majority shareholder would have been the \u201cprincipal beneficiar[y]\u201d of the recovery. <em>Crosby, supra. </em>Based upon the foregoing analysis, the trial court did not err when it denied Kay\u2019s motion for directed verdict and, consequently, permitted the within action to proceed directly against Kay. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is, therefore, not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error raises five distinct allegations, each of which claims the trial court erred when it charged the jury. The theme of this assignment of error is stated in \u201cI\u201d and follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">\u201cI. In a minority shareholder\u2019s direct action against the controlling shareholder of a close corporation for breach of fiduciary duty, the trial court erred when it failed to provide the jury with proper instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Civ.R. 51<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> permits any party to timely file written requests of proposed jury instructions. Ordinarily, requested jury instructions should be given by the trial judge provided (1) they are correct statements of the law as applied to the facts in a given case; and (2) where reasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the instructions. <em>Sapp v. Stoney Ridge Truck Tire </em>(1993), 86 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>App.3d 85, 619 N.E.2d 1172; <em>Hardiman v. Zep Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 222, 14 OBR 250, 470 N.E.2d 941. Civ.R. 51 also precludes a party from assigning the jury charge as error on appeal where the party did not object to the charge at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we note appellant proffered written requests of proposed jury instructions as well as jury interrogatories. At trial, he objected to only the trial judge\u2019s decision not to charge the jury pursuant to Kay\u2019s jury instructions. In order to provide clarity, each of the five allegations contained in Assignment of Error No. I will be considered seriatim as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201c(A) By failing to explain the proper legal standard for determining whether the controlling shareholder breached his fiduciary duty by receiving excessive compensation and instead focussing [sic ] the jury on whether all amounts paid by the corporation were proportionate to stock ownership [the trial court erred].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Kay proffered Jury Instructions No. 9 and 12, which addressed the issue raised in allegation (A), <em>i.e., </em>breach of fiduciary duty. A relevant portion of Kay\u2019s Jury Instruction No. 9 follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\u201cThe board of directors of an Ohio corporation has the authority to establish reasonable compensation for directors and officers for services to the corporation, including their own compensation. Therefore, <em>it is not a violation of fiduciary duty for the directors of Zatko, including Mr. Kay, to have paid Mr. Kay a salary, bonus, executive fringe benefits and other forms of compensation, if such compensation was reasonable. </em>If you find that Mr. Kay\u2019s aggregate compensation from Zatko, in light of all the facts and circumstances, was reasonable, <em>then you must find in favor of Defendant Leslie Kay.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Kay\u2019s Jury Instruction No. 12 contained a comparable argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">In a close corporation, a majority shareholder breaches a fiduciary duty when that shareholder manipulates his or her control over the close corporation in order to unfairly acquire personal benefits owing to or not otherwise available to minority shareholders of the close corporation. <em>Crosby, supra; McLaughlin v. Beeghly </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 502, 617 N.E.2d 703; <em>Cousins, supra; Gigax v. Repka </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 615, 615 N.E.2d 644. Since the issue is not whether the acts of the corporate president were reasonable but, rather, whether the acts worked to the deprivation of entitled minority shareholders, Kay\u2019s statements of the law in Jury Instructions Nos. 9 and 12 based upon the cause of action herein were not correct law. Therefore, in accordance with <em>Sapp </em>and <em>Hardiman, supra, </em>the trial judge did not err when he refused to charge the jury in this manner, and allegation (A) lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Appellant\u2019s second allegation follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201c(B) By failing to instruct the jury how to calculate the minority shareholder\u2019s damages caused by the controlling shareholder\u2019s receipt of excessive compensation [the trial court erred].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We initially note appellant\u2019s proposed jury charges did not address the issue Kay assigns as error in allegation (B), <em>ie., </em>neither Kay\u2019s jury instructions nor Kay\u2019s jury interrogatories addressed the correct manner in which the jury should calculate Yackel\u2019s damages. Kay may not assign as error on appeal the trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jury with a proposed jury instruction that Kay never submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">As to the issue Kay raises with respect to calculation of damages, an appellate court will not consider issues which the appellant failed to raise in the trial court. <em>Stores Realty Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 41, 70 O.O.2d 123, 322 N.E.2d 629; <em>Cleveland v. Assn. of Cleveland Fire Fighters, Local 93, Internatl. Assn. of Fire Fighters </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 220, 596 N.E.2d 1086. Thus, Kay may not raise this issue on appeal. In accordance with the foregoing analysis, allegation (B) lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Appellant\u2019s third allegation follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\u201c(C) By instructing the jury that, in addition to a direct action for breach of fiduciary duty, the minority shareholder had a separate cause of action against the controlling shareholder for wrongful termination of employment [the trial court erred].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">In allegation (C), Kay asks this court to find the trial judge erred when he charged the jury that Ohio law provided Yackel with a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Whether Ohio provides a cause of action for wrongful discharge to a plaintiff is a question of law rather than of fact. It is axiomatic that only questions of fact are within the province of the jury while the trial judge resolves questions of law. We note Kay raised the issue of whether Yackel possessed a cause of action for wrongful discharge in his motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied Kay\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Ohio recognizes an action for wrongful discharge and the trial court properly charged the jury on the subject. <em>Gigax, supra, </em>held a minority shareholder/employee who was terminated from his job by majority shareholders did, in fact, possess a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Based upon the foregoing analysis, Kay\u2019s allegation (C) lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Appellant\u2019s fourth allegation follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">' \u201c(D) By failing to instruct the jury to determine whether the minority shareholder waived his right or was estopped to complain about lease payments made by the corporation to the controlling stockholder [the trial court erred].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Kay proffered Jury Instruction No. 1 which addressed the defenses of waiver and estoppel. Essentially, this request would have charged the jury to determine whether Yackel had waived, or was estopped from exerting, his breach of fiduciary duty claims by both his actions and omissions as a vice-president of Zatko. However, the breach by a majority shareholder in a close corporation of a fiduciary duty imposed by law does not rest upon whether or not a minority shareholder consented or acquiesced to that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Moreover, the doctrine of estoppel is based upon the premise that a party, by his or her conduct, has induced another to change position in good faith reliance upon that conduct. <em>Kosa v. Pruchinsky </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 649, 612 N.E.2d 1291. When this statement of law is applied to the facts in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the following anomalous argument is generated: <em>Kay was induced by Yackel\u2019s silence to breach Kay\u2019s fiduciary duty owing to Yackel </em>and <em>Kay, .therefore, relied in good faith upon Yackel\u2019s silence as Yackel\u2019s implied consent to Kay\u2019s breach of the fiduciary duty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">From this perspective, Kay\u2019s proposed jury instruction was both absurd and immaterial to the resolution of the case <em>sub judice </em>and the trial judge was not required to so charge the jury. Civ.R. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">More important, however, there exists a presumption that the one owing a fiduciary duty by virtue of superior position must go forward with the burden of proof on the fairness of business transactions. The fiduciary must demonstrate that the one to whom the fiduciary duty was owed had full knowledge of and approved the transactions. <em>Testa v. Roberts </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 161, 542 N.E.2d 654. In the case <em>sub judice </em>Kay offered no evidence to support his claim Yackel <em>knowingly </em>ratified or approved of Kay\u2019s business transactions or that Yackel waived his rights with respect to Kay\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities. On the contrary, Kay presented mere allegations which were drawn from ambiguous inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In addition, Yackel testified at trial he did not realize he possessed, as a minority shareholder, the right to bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty against Zatko or Kay until after Yackel, in 1990, consulted an attorney and then commenced the within action. Moreover, Yackel possessed no direct cause of action against Kay prior to December 20, 1989 when <em>Crosby, supra, </em>was decided. Had Yackel instituted a derivative action against Zatko prior to 1989, rather than a direct action against Kay subsequent to 1989, any recovery would have accrued to Kay as majority shareholder rather than to Yackel and as noted in <em>Crosby, </em>Kay would have been the primary beneficiary of the recovery. Based upon the foregoing analysis, the trial judge did not err when he refused to charge the jury with the elements of estoppel and waiver, and allegation (D) lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Appellant\u2019s final allegation follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u201c(E) By failing to submit to the jury the substance of the controlling shareholder\u2019s written interrogatories [the trial court erred].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In issue (E) of Kay\u2019s first assignment of error, Kay challenges the trial judge\u2019s refusal to charge the jury -with the \u201csubstance\u201d of his submitted interrogatories for the jury. We note Kay did not object to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to submit either the \u201csubstance\u201d of his interrogatories or the interrogatories themselves. Since Kay did not formally object at trial, Kay may not raise this issue on appeal and allegation (E) lacks merit. Civ.R. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Appellant\u2019s entire first assignment of error, <em>ie., </em>allegations (A) through (E), therefore, lacks merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Appellant\u2019s third and final assignment of error follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u201cIII. The trial court erred when it awarded punitive damages:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">\u201c(A) By awarding punitive damages where the allegedly wrongful conduct did not cause the minority shareholder to suffer any compensable damage; and</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">\u201c(B) By awarding punitive damages that were more than five (5) times greater than the maximum amount of damages caused by the allegedly malicious conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">This assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">Kay first alleges Yackel did not suffer actual damages due to his wrongful termination and was not, therefore, entitled to punitive damages. Pursuant to R.C. 2315.21,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an award of punitive damages must be based upon the existence of two prerequisites, <em>viz., </em>(1) proof of actual damages; and (2) proof that the defendant\u2019s conduct was so reckless, intentional, wanton or grossly negligent that actual malice is demonstrated. <em>Cousins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Kay did not deny the business transactions or the termination of Yackel but, rather, defended his actions as being reasonable and based upon legitimate business purpose. On June 25, 1992, the jury awarded compensatory damages to Yackel in the amount of $212,600 which the jury expressly proportioned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">1. $194,000 for Kay\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty; and</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">2. $18,600 for Yackel\u2019s wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>In addition, the jury, in its answer to Interrogatory No. 3, found Kay \u201cliable to defendant Kenneth R. Yackel for punitive damages\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2315.21(C)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In compliance with the statute, the amount of punitive damages was determined by the trial judge. The trial court held a hearing on October 22, 1992 with respect to the award of punitive damages and, on December 17, 1992, awarded Yackel $100,000 in punitive damages against Kay based upon the $212,600 awarded by the jury in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Appellant contends Yackel sustained no actual damages from his wrongful termination but, rather, suffered actual damages with respect to only Kay\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty. We. note the jury award of compensatory damages for wrongful discharge in the amount of $18,600 and for Kay\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty in the amount of $194,000 was based upon the evidence introduced by Yackel at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Yackel presented evidence that, prior to his wrongful termination from Zatko, he earned a salary of $10,400 per year in addition to any share of the profits he was entitled to receive. Yackel also presented evidence that Zatko had declared year-end bonuses on a number of occasions which were paid to, <em>inter alia, </em>Kay, Yackel and nonsalaried employees of Zatko who were not shareholders. When Yackel was wrongfully discharged, he not only lost his salary but also his bonuses. Yackel also presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could have concluded he suffered actual damages in the amount of $194,000 due to Kay\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The .transcript before us demonstrates the trial judge twice charged the jury to distinguish between Yackel\u2019s loss due to Kay\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty versus Yackel\u2019s loss due to wrongful termination. Based upon the evidence introduced at trial, a reasonable jury could have made this distinction and awarded compensatory damages to Yackel for both wrongful discharge in the amount of $18,600 and breach of fiduciary duty in the amount of $194,000. Kay\u2019s contention that Yackel suffered no actual damages from the wrongful discharge, therefore, lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">As noted <em>supra, </em>although Yackel incurred actual damages from his wrongful discharge, he was also required to demonstrate Kay discharged Yackel with actual malice in order to prevail on the claim for punitive damages. Actual malice requires intentional, conscious wrongdoing, without which punitive damages cannot be found. When adjudicating whether actual malice was present, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>trier of fact is charged with determining the credibility of the witnesses and weighing the evidence. <em>Cousins, supra. </em>Kay did not object when the trial judge instructed the jury with respect to actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Furthermore, Yackel stated at trial that prior to seeking advice from his attorney and prior to instituting the within action, he addressed personal letters to Kay requesting Kay to remedy the business transactions that worked deprivation upon Yackel. Yackel further testified he expressed these concerns in person to Kay, and Yackel stated as follows with respect to Kay\u2019s response:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">. \u201cAnd he said I\u2019m a minority shareholder, I don\u2019t have any rights and I should be happy with what I\u2019m getting and that\u2019s the way it was going to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In addition, the following colloquy occurred while Yackel was under direct examination at trial in which Yackel described his confronting Kay with Kay\u2019s questionable business transactions:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u201cQ. By benefits you\u2019re talking about these things here we\u2019ve got on the board [the list of Kay\u2019s alleged illegal business transactions]?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\u201cA. [Yackel] Well, I really didn\u2019t go into personal expenses, I went into things like cars and health insurance and things like that for the most part. I didn\u2019t really go into the personal credit card thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">\u201cQ. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">\u201cA. But I was just trying to show Les [Kay], I was saying I am not getting my fair share, fair distribution. I indicated what his salary was, what Max\u2019s salary was and my salary. I said, in order to bring things to partity [sic ], they were both making 67 [$67,500] plus cars and other fringes, I indicated my salary should be raised at least $5200 from 10,400, and I wanted to know what was the best way to go about having this done.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">\u201cAnd he came back and said I was being greedy and things weren\u2019t going to change, that I didn\u2019t have any say so, again, okay, as far as the corporation was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">\u201cAnd then I \u2014 at that point I said, but look how unfair this is. I said, in addition to all this, you\u2019re taking all these personal expenses which the corporation was paying for which is income to you, I said, it\u2019s really unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">\u201cAt which point he got very upset with me and indicated that his other partners at Premier had never dare [sic ] challenged him on that kind of thing before and I\u2019d better watch my step and he never watned [sic ] to hear me talk about it, again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">Certainly, a reasonable trier of fact could have found Kay\u2019s foregoing statements were made with actual malice especially when considered in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>heightened fiduciary duty owing minority shareholders in close corporations by majority shareholders. The <em>Crosby </em>court spoke of this duty at 47 Ohio St.3d at 108, 548 N.E.2d at 220, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u201cCourts in sister states and Ohio appellate courts have found a <em>heightened, fiduciary duty </em>between majority and minority shareholders in a close corporation. This duty is similar to the duty that <em>partners owe one another in a partnership </em>because of the fundamental resemblance between the close corporation and a partnership. [The standard of the duty has been found] to be of the \u2018 <em>\u201cutmost good faith and loyalty.\u201d \u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis added and footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In sum, the jury determined the credibility of the witnesses, weighed the evidence and found Yackel sustained compensatory damages in the amount of $18,600 from his wrongful termination from Zatko. Based upon the foregoing evidence, <em>i.e., </em>Yackel\u2019s salary of $10,400 per year and the payment of year-end bonuses, a jury could reasonably have reached this conclusion. In addition, a reasonable jury, based upon the foregoing colloquy, could reasonably have found Kay acted with actual malice and, in so doing, owed punitive damages to Yackel. <em>Cousins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">We also note an interesting occurrence when the trial judge conducted the hearing on punitive damages. The trial judge requested a financial statement from Kay at the first hearing with respect to punitive damages. In response, <em>Kay produced a statement of financial condition showing his net worth to be $690,300. </em>In his supplemental post-trial memorandum on punitive damages, however, <em>Yackel produced a financial statement Kay had submitted to American National Bank on March 18, 1992 which showed Kay\u2019s net worth to be $3,333,-500. </em>Kay\u2019s net worth was calculated in the statement by subtracting his total liabilities of $666,500 from Kay\u2019s total assets of $4,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Appellant finally alleges the trial court\u2019s punitive damages award of $100,000 was excessive since the jury awarded only $18,600 in compensatory damages to Yackel for wrongful discharge. Kay argues the award of punitive damages was over five times the amount of the compensatory damages awarded. Appellant\u2019s analysis is flawed. The compensatory damages included the $194,000 for breach of fiduciary duty and the $18,600 for wrongful discharge, which amounted to a total of $212,600. Thus, the amount of punitive damages was not more than five times greater than the maximum amount of compensatory damages. In addition, standing alone, a large disparity between compensatory and punitive damages is insufficient to justify an appellate court\u2019s interference with a decision that is within the province of the trier of fact. <em>Villella v.
