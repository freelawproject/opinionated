Appellee joined his wife, Mary Hawkins, who had been convicted of complicity in the destruction of the car,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and appellant, the insurer of the automobile, in the suit as third-party defendants and filed complaints against both the impleaded defendants. Huntington received a judgment against appellee for the outstanding balance on the note, and appellee received a default judgment against Mary Hawkins for indemnification on the amount owed to the bank. Appellant filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that Mary Hawkins\u2019s intentional conduct in destroying the insured automobile relieved appellant from any liability on the contract. The court denied the motion for summary judgment, on the ground that there were material issues of fact to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Appellant then filed a second motion, submitting documentary evidence to support its argument on the issue that the court had determined was outstanding when the first motion was filed. The court had decided that the case rested upon the issue of whether appellee\u2019s wife was an insured under the policy at the time she conspired to defraud the insurance company by destroying the insured automobile. Appellee made no response to either motion, and filed no motion of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The court again denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, determining that, pursuant to the policy\u2019s own definitions, Mrs. Hawkins was not an insured under the policy because she and appellee were not \u201cresidents of the same household\u201d due to appellee\u2019s incarceration. However, the court further granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, stating that there remained no issues of fact to be determined. In its judgment entry, the court, finding that appellant had violated the terms of the insurance contract by refusing to pay appellee for the loss of the automobile, ordered appellant to \u201chonor the policy of insurance on defendant Donald L. Hawkins\u2019 automobile and satisfy the sums owed to plaintiff Huntington National Bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Motorists Mutual has appealed the court\u2019s judgment, asserting the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in its determination that Mary Hawkins was not an insured and/or living in the same household as Defendant Donald L. Hawkins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in determining that all relevant evidence was before the court, thereby rendering it appropriate to grant summary judgment to a nonmoving party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s entry of judgment against Motorists Mutual Insurance Company is in error as it orders Motorists to satisfy a lien owed by Donald L. Hawkins to Huntington National Bank as opposed to ordering Motorists to pay the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of the loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">Following our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court did err in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">Under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, a trial court may grant summary judgment only when a review of all the pleadings and properly submitted evidentiary materials would convince a reasonable person that there is no disputed issue requiring resolution through a determination of the weight and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>credibility of the evidence, and the movant is entitled to judgment \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C). The trial court is limited to a review of the evidence properly certified and submitted under Civ.R. 56(C), and is not permitted to weigh the evidence and decide the factual issues when reviewing a summary judgment motion, since it is the role of the jury at trial to determine the facts of a case. <em>Viock v. Stowe-Woodward Co. </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 7, 15, 13 OBR 8, 16, 467 N.E.2d 1378, 1386 (\u201cIt is imperative to remember that the purpose of summary judgment is not to try issues of fact, but rather to determine whether triable issues of fact exist.\u201d). See <em>Wolfe v. Woods </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 569, 570-571, 620 N.E.2d 870, 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The trial court in this case grounded its decision favoring appellee upon the conclusion that Mary Hawkins, whose fraudulent actions resulted in the destruction of the automobile, was not an insured under the policy, and that therefore appellee, the named insured, was not liable for the destruction of his own insured automobile. However, the trial court was asked only to review the threshold issue of whether Mary Hawkins was insured under the policy in light of the fact that appellee, her husband, was not living in the same household due to his incarceration. We find that determination irrelevant to the coverage that is at issue here, and therefore overrule the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Mary Hawkins was a named driver on appellee\u2019s policy for the purpose of accidental collision and liability insurance. If either of these coverages had been at issue, then the issue of whether Mary was a named insured would have been relevant to a determination of the action. However, at issue herein is the comprehensive coverage, which is to compensate appellee or his \u201closs payee\u201d for the accidental loss, \u201cother than [by] collision,\u201d of the insured automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Part \u201cD\u201d of the parties\u2019 insurance contract (\u201cCoverage for Damage to Your Auto\u201d), which is the comprehensive coverage portion of the policy, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u201cWe will pay for direct and accidental loss t\u00f3 <em>your covered auto. </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u201cLoss or damage under this policy shall be paid as interest may appear to you and the loss payee shown in the Declarations. This insurance covering the interest of the loss payee shall not become invalid because of your fraudulent acts or omissions unless the loss results from your conversion, secretion or embezzlement of <em>your covered auto.\" </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Appellant argued that since the terms \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d included Mary Hawkins, pursuant to the policy definitions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> her actions in arranging for the destruction of the automobile were sufficient to void the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>However, under a policy of automobile insurance, comprehensive coverage is actually a type of property insurance which protects the owner of the insured property against loss from physical damage to the property. Thus, it is a separate policy of \u201cother insurance,\u201d provided only for an additional and separate premium, to which the definitions under the liability and collision provisions are not generally applicable. See Jerry, Understanding Insurance Law (1987) 267-268, Section 60(b). If the definitions applicable to the liability and collision sections of the policy were also applied to the comprehensive coverage in this case, the result would in effect be a vesting of ownership of the vehicle in the spouse of appellee. Such a result was clearly not intended by the parties. Furthermore, it is beyond the scope of an insurance contract to provide for the transfer of an ownership interest in the property insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Consequently, Mary Hawkins\u2019s status under the liability and collision policies is irrelevant, since there is no disputing the fact that appellee is the sole owner of the destroyed automobile, sole purchaser of the policy at issue, and the sole debtor on the bank note, and any loss is compensable only to appellee or the bank, since appellee was required to purchase the comprehensive policy to protect his own and the bank\u2019s financial interest in the car. Thus, only appellee\u2019s actions and intent are relevant to whether appellant has been defrauded.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Appellant is correct when it argues that there are genuine issues of material fact to be determined in this case. Appellant should have the opportunity at trial to prove its defense that appellee\u2019s loss was not accidental, due to his own intentional actions. While there potentially is coverage for the loss of appellee\u2019s automobile under the comprehensive coverage of the policy, coverage is excluded by the policy if and only if appellee himself was involved in the conspiracy to defraud appellant by destroying the automobile. Therefore, we find that the pivotal issue in the case, raised in the pleadings of the parties, is whether appellee participated in the fraud. If this issue had been presented to the trial court uncontested by the opposing party, summary judgment may have been appropriate. Since it was not presented, disputed, argued, or determined by the trial court, it remains a material issue in the case. The second assignment of error is sustained^</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Appellant complains with its third assignment of error that the court improperly ordered judgment for full payment of the amount due on the bank loan. If, in fact, this is what the trial court ordered, we agree with appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">We find that the order, while perhaps not incorrect, is ambiguous. The court\u2019s actual order provided only that appellant was to \u201csatisfy the sums owed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>plaintiff Huntington National Bank.\u201d The court may have intended its order to mean only that appellant was to pay the bank the amount owed on the loss under the contract of insurance, or \u201cthe actual cash value of the stolen or destroyed automobile,\u201d which is the compensation provided for in the insurance contract. This would have been a proper order. In any event, since we are vacating the summary judgment in this case, we sustain the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Having found prejudice to the appellant in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, but reverse the summary judgment in favor of appellee, as well as the trial court\u2019s judgment ordering appellant to satisfy appellee\u2019s debt to Huntington National Bank. The cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-7\">Shaw, P.J., and Hadley, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-13\">.
