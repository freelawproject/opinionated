The facts will be found stated in the opinion of this court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">This appeal is from a judgment based upon the referee\u2019s report to the superior court that defendants owed plaintiff $13,167.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">The trial judge approved the referee\u2019s findings, after hearing defendants\u2019 objections to them; and denied a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">Defendants assert two grounds of appeal: First, that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment based upon the referee\u2019s findings, \u201cfor any sum in excess of $875.34.\u201d Secondly, that it was error for the court to allow interest from the time of the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">Neither ground of appeal is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">There is considerable argument in the briefs concerning facts found by the trial court in the original decision as affirmed by this court; and also as to evidence before the referee, upon which it is contended that a different balance should have been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">This court has given little consideration to the argument about the findings in the original decision, because it is well settled that these findings, as approved by this court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>are the law of the case. <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>California Mutual B. &amp; L. Assn., </em>22 Cal.2d 474, 481 [139 P.2d 321]; 4 Cal.Jur.2d 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The referee\u2019s findings are based upon conflicting evidence, the judge heard and denied defendants\u2019 objections to them; and there is ample evidence in the record to sustain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">A reviewing court will not ordinarily set aside referees\u2019 findings, approved by a trial court. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Puget Sound Lbr. Co., </em>123 Cal. 97 [55 P. 788] ; <em>Ritchie, Osgood &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Bradshaw &amp; Co., </em>5 Cal. 228, 229; <em>cf. In re De La Roi, </em>27 Cal.2d 354 [164 P.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Turning now to the question of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The action was commenced after defendants had built and sold houses upon a tract of land owned by plaintiff. The contract between plaintiff and defendants provided, among other things, that defendants would pay plaintiff one-half of the net profits after the houses were sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Defendants did not deny the allegations in plaintiff\u2019s complaint that the houses had been sold and that no part of the profits had been paid to him. Therefore, it was right for the trial court to order interest from the date of commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">The law awards interest upon an obligation if its time of payment and its sum are certain or ascertainable. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3287; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Magneson, </em>207 Cal. 617, 622 [279 P. 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">White, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-17\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
