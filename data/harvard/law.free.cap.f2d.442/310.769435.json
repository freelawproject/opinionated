The record discloses a plain violation of the Illinois statute prohibiting extortion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue for us to decide is whether defendants are also guilty of violating either the federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, or the federal statute enacted in 1961 \u201cto prohibit travel or transportation in commerce in aid of racketeering enterprises,\u201d 75 Stat. 498, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. Although the \u201cTravel Act\u201d can be read to cover this case, we have concluded that this prosecution is beyond the limits of the criminal jurisdiction which Congress intend- \u25a0 ed to confer on the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b369-20\">The jury found both appellants guilty on both counts. To clarify the federal question, we shall first- summarize the evidence disclosing a violation of Illinois law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-21\">The participants in the extortion were appellants Altobella and Moxley and a young entertainer named Joan Patterson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Patterson\u2019s testimony described the plan. She agreed to help Altobella and Moxley \u201cto make a fast buck.\u201d She was to pick up a businessman, preferably one who was married and had a family, in one of the hotel bars in the loop area. \u201cAfter I met him I was supposed to lead him to believe that he was a Don Juan, and then take him- to an apartment and * * * get him into a compromising position so that pictures could be taken.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>In early October Patterson made the acquaintance of a Philadelphia businessman in the Essex Motel bar. Before they parted he told her that he would be returning to Chicago in about ten days, and requested her to call him at the Sherman House. Promptly thereafter Patterson reported to Altobella that she had \u201cfound just the type of guy we were looking for.\u201d They then agreed upon the procedure for taking pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">On Thursday, October 19, Patterson reached her victim at the Sherman House and made a date for that evening. During dinner she excused herself, telephoned the defendants, and then led the badger into the trap. In due course the flashbulbs went off, Altobella accompanied by Moxley came into the bedroom with a gun, and Patterson departed with the camera and film. Except for receiving $50 from Altobella the next day, Patterson had no further contact with the extortion. She destroyed the camera and film on Saturday, after learning that Altobella had been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The victim testified that after Patterson departed, Altobella made a demand for $5,000 for the return of the negatives. He responded that \u201cUnder no circumstances would I ever be able to get that kind of money * * * then they reduced the amount to * * * $2500, which I said was just as ridiculous * * * and after about an hour and a half or so, I told them that the best thing that I could do under any circumstances was to give them maybe $500 or $600. They wanted me to go down to the hotel and get it from friends. I told them that I couldn\u2019t do that, but that I would give them $100 now, plus the money that I had on the table, which was about $50 or $60, and they took $50 of it and left me with the $15. I told them I would go down to the hotel and write a cheek and give them $100.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Moxley told him that he would be contacted at home and would have to bring the rest of the money to Chicago; Al-tobella and Moxley stated that they would tell him when and where the meeting would take place. They did not state whether the contact would be by phone or letter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Altobella then drove the victim to the Sherman House and waited outside for 10 or 15 minutes while he went to his hotel room, obtained his checkbook and wrote a cheek, which he cashed at the desk. He then delivered $100 to Altobel-la who was waiting about a block from the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Appellants concede that the foregoing facts established a violation of the Illinois Criminal Code. They dispute the sufficiency of the following additional facts as a basis for federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">Appellants knew their victim was from Philadelphia. They knew he intended to obtain the $100 by cashing a personal check. The check was drawn on a Philadelphia bank. After being cleared through two Chicago banks, it was forwarded to Philadelphia by mail on October 24. Altobella accepted the $100 proceeds and thereafter distributed $50 to Patterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">Both counts of the indictment focus on the use of the mails to carry on an unlawful activity, to wit, extortion in violation of Illinois law. Both counts charge that the unlawful activity continued after the use of the mails.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>It is the government\u2019s theory that the mails were used on October 20, 1967, when appellants caused their victim to cash a $100 cheek which was then irrevocably started on its way to Philadelphia. The defendants contend that the mails were not used until October 24, 1967, when the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago forwarded the item to Philadelphia. Both parties agree that the charges in the indictment required proof that appellants\u2019 unlawful activity was carried on after the \u201cuse\u201d of the mails within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. The requirement of unlawful activity \u201cthereafter\u201d is satisfied, according to the government, by Altobella\u2019s acceptance of $100 and his delivery of part of those proceeds to Patterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Theoretically, the conspiracy charge and the substantive charge could raise different issues. On the peculiar facts of this ease, however, both counts present us with the question whether a violation of the Travel Act has been established. There is no evidence in the record of any actual or intended use of the mails by appellants with the single exception of their acceptance of their victim\u2019s offer to cash a check for $100 at his hotel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the purpose of decision, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the use of the mails occurred on October 20 or October 24, 1967, within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. We assume with the government that causing the check to be cashed on October 20 established the time when appellants\u2019 use of the mails occurred. We do not agree, however, that that one act, plus what happened \u201cthereafter,\u201d was sufficient to invoke the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">The relevant statutory language reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-16\">\u201c\u00a7 1952. Interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-17\">\u201c(a) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility in interstate or foreign <em>commerce, </em>including the mail, with intent to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-18\">\u201c(1) distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-19\"><em>\u201c(2) </em>commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-20\">\u201c(3) otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-21\">and thereafter performs or attempts to perform any of the acts specified in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3), shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-22\">In general, the purpose of the Travel Act was to attack criminal activities extending beyond the borders of one state by providing federal assistance in situations in which local law enforcement was ineffective. United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 290-292, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two principal ingredients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of the offense were specified: the kind of unlawful activity characteristically pursued by organized crime; and the use of interstate facilities in aid of the criminal enterprise.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">That Congress did not intend to exercise its full constitutional powers in the area of local law enforcement is demonstrated by the wording of the Act and specifically by the use of the word \u201cthereafter.\u201d As the Senate report on S.1653 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201c * * * to come within the provisions of the bill some activity in furtherance of a racketeering enterprise, subsequent to the performance of the travel, must take place * * * accordingly the gravamen of the offense will be travel and a further overt act to aid the enterprise.\u201d S.Rep.No.644, 87th Cong., 1st Sess.1961, p. 2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">To warrant federal intervention we believe the statute requires a more significant use of a facility of interstate commerce in aid of the defendants\u2019 unlawful activity than is reflected on this record. Cf., United States v. Hawthorne, 356 F.2d 740 (4th Cir. 1966), cert. denied 384 U.S. 908,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 86 S.Ct. 1344, 16 L.Ed.2d 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Thus, a gambling operation conducted on an interstate carrier, United States v. Brennan, 394 F.2d 151 (2nd Cir. 1968), cert denied 393 U.S. 839, 89 S.Ct. 117, 21 L.Ed.2d 110, or by regularly traveling across a state line to obtain essential supplies, United States v. Puntillo, 440 F.2d 540 (7th Cir. 1971); the employment of out-of-state specialists in aid of the criminal enterprise, United States v. Roselli, et al., 432 F.2d 879 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 924, 91 S.Ct. 883, 27 L.Ed.2d 828; the use of interstate \u201ccredit cards\u201d and mailing lists to attract out-of-state patrons, United States v. Rizzo, 418 F.2d 71 (7th Cir. 1969); and the use of a Western Union ticker tape recording information received from out of state as a regular and continuous element of the illegal enterprise, United States v. Miller, 379 F.2d 483 (7th Cir. 1967); all provide examples in which federal assistance to local law enforcement is entirely appropriate and clearly contemplated by the history and language of the Travel Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">But there is nothing about the appellants\u2019 enterprise, as disclosed by the evidence, which suggests any reason why state police powers need to be supplemented by the federal government. The use of the mails by the bank through which appellants\u2019 victim\u2019s check was cleared, a few days after it had been cashed at the Sherman House, was purely incidental to appellants\u2019 sordid scheme. Their purpose would have been achieved equally well if the victim had borrowed $100 from associates at the hotel or written a check on a local bank. Moreover, the unlawful activity which followed the cashing of the cheek was merely the payment of $50 to Patterson. Unquestionably, the distribution of proceeds of criminal activity may satisfy the \u201cthereafter\u201d requirement of the statute in a proper case. But when both the use of the interstate facility and the subsequent act are as minimal and incidental as in this case, we do not believe a federal crime has been committed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Unquestionably appellants\u2019 unsuccessful attempt \u201cto make a fast buck\u201d is punishable as a crime.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We merely hold that the State of Illinois is the appropriate sovereign to prosecute their offense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not believe <em>Congress </em>intended to authorize federal intervention in local law enforcement in a marginal case such as this. We are guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition \u201cthat in ascertaining the scope of congressional legislation a due regard for a proper adjustment of the local and national interests in our federal scheme must always be in the background, * * * \u201d Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U.S. 349, 351, 61 S.Ct. 580, 582, 85 L.Ed. 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\">.

Patterson was separately indicted; after the conviction of Altobella and Moxley, the charges against her were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">. In the ensuing several days Altobella showed her an apartment he had rented (lie paid tlie weekly rent of $30 in advance on September 27, October 5, and October 12). He explained liow the pictures would be taken, and pointed out that a telephone had been installed to enable her to call before she brought the badger to the apartment. In general, Al-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tobella reported that the project was going \u201cpretty good except we need some money for photographic equipment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. The witness testified that he assumed the contact would be by telephone, but that assumption was stricken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\">. Count One of the indictment charged a violation of 18 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 371. It charged that appellants engaged in a conspiracy with Patterson beginning on or about October 1, 1967, and continuing until October 20, 1967, to use \u201cfacilities in interstate commerce, to wit, the United States Mail,\u201d to carry on \u201can unlawful activity, to wit, extortion, in violation of the laws of the State of Illinois,\u201d and thereafter to \u201cperform acts of promotion, management, establishment and carrying- on of the said unlawful activity, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Count Two charged that on October 20, 1967, appellants and Patterson did use and cause to be used the United States Mail to carry on an unlawful activity, \u201cand thereafter, on or about October 20, 1967,\u201d they did perform acts facilitating the carrying on of said unlawful activity-in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\">. Except for the evidence tending to prove the substantive violation, the record contains no evidence tending to prove the conspiracy charged in the indictment. The government argues that the indictment may be read to contemplate future mailings in aid of the criminal enterprise. But if that reading is warranted, it is unsupported by proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b371-25\">. \u201cTestimony produced at the hearings clearly demonstrated the interstate network of criminals engaged in such unlawful activities. It further demonstrated the need for the assistance of the Federal Government in view of the fact that law enforcement authorities are limited and hindered by the interstate nature of these activities.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.966, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 1961 p. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"ag-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>In a letter dated April 6, 1961 (reprinted in H.R.Rep.X'o.966, <em>supra, </em>at p. 4), addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Attorney General Kennedy stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201cOver the years an ever-increasing portion of our national resources has been diverted into illicit channels. Because many rackets are conducted by highly organized syndicates whose influence extends over State and National borders, the Federal Government should come to the aid of local law enforcement authorities in an effort to stem such activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u201cThe bill which I submit to the Congress would impose criminal sanctions upon the person whose work takes him across State or National boundaries in aid of certain \u2018unlawful activities.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u00bb!&gt; ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">\u201cThe effect of this legislation would be to impede the clandestine flow of profits from criminal ventures and to bring about a serious disruption in the far-flung organization and management of co-ordinated criminal enterprises. It would thus be of material assistance to the States in combatting pernicious undertakings which cross State lines.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b372-13\">. \u201cThe Attorney General testified before the committee on May 17, 1961, in support of the bill. In this testimony he cited numerous instances of the use of the facilities of interstate commerce by racketeers and hoodlums to promote the illegal enterprise, to distribute the proceeds among the syndicate members of illegal gambling, liquor, narcotics, and prostitution business and the use of the facilities for the commission of crimes of violence in furtherance of the unlawful activities.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.966, <em>supra </em>at p. 2. See S.Rep.No.644, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 1961; Pollner, \u201cAttorney General Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s Legislative Program to Curb Organized Crime and Racketeering,\u201d 28 Brooklyn L.Rev. 37 (1961); Miller, \u201cThe \u2018Travel Act,\u2019 a New Statutory Approach to Organized Crime in the United States,\u201d 1 Duquesne L.Rev. 181 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b372-20\">. The conference report accompanying the final version of S.1653, which is now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952, makes it clear that adoption of the House proposal, which combined the two sections of the Senate draft and eliminated the words \u201cafter such travel\u201d as superfluous, did not change the bill substantively. H.R. Conference Report No. 1161, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 1961, p. 4. The government has not argued that the scope of the Act is broader when use of the mails is charged. The Senate report explains the Keating amendment to S.1653 extending the coverage of the statute to use of the mails. There is no suggestion in the report that the scope of the Act is intended to be broader when the mails or other facilities of interstate, rather than travel, are involved. See S-Rep. No.644, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b372-21\">. The following excerpts from the Attorney General\u2019s testimony at the Senate hearings on June 6, 1961, are quoted in the Senate report accompanying S.1653:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-22\">\u201cLet me say from the outset that we do not seek or intend to impede the travel of anyone except persons engaged in illegal businesses as spelled out in the bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-23\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-24\">\u201cThe target clearly is organized crime. The travel that would be banned is travel \u2018in furtherance of a business enterprise\u2019 which involves gambling, liquor, narcotics, and prostitution offenses or extortion or bribery. Obviously, we are not trying to curtail the sporadic, casual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>involvement in these offenses, but rather a continuous course of conduct sufficient for it to be termed a business entex'pi\u2019ise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cWhen the tightly wx-itten px-ovisions of this bill are set against the tx'e-mendous area of interstate commex-ce which involves traveling by individuals,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">I believe it is clear that we have carefully delineated an area of law enforcement which will disrupt the organized criminal syndicates without intei\u2019fei\u2019ing with general travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cOur investigations also have made it quite clear that only the Federal Government can shut off the funds which pex-mit the top men of organized crime to live far from the scene and, therefore, remain immune from the local officials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">So we believe that the Federal Government has a definite responsibility to move against these people and limit their use of interstate commerce.\u201d S. Eep.No.644, <em>supra, </em>at p. 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">In summarizing the bill on the floor of the Senate, Senator Eastland stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">\u201cThe Committee has received testimony that the complex operations of today\u2019s ox\u2019ganized ei'iminal syndicate x-ecognize no state bouxxdai'ies.

We have no occasion to consider the constitutional limits of federal power over local crimes because it is clear that Congress did not intend to exercise its full power over cx-iminal activities that merely affect interstate commerce. It was primarily concerned with the interstate activity itself. Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U.S. 349, 351, 61 S.Ct. 580, 85 L.Ed. 881, with United States v. Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., 324 U.S. 293, 298, 65 S.Ct. 661, 89 L.Ed. 951. See also, Marshall v.

The government also suggests that the application of the statute is warranted by the fact that appellants\u2019 victim was from out of state. That theory, however, is not set forth in the indictment and there was no evidence of a plan to lure out-of-state victims to Chicago, or even that the conspirators intended to select an out-of-town victim. Moreover, the application of the statute on a comparable theory has just been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court. Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (decided April 5, 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b374-23\">.
