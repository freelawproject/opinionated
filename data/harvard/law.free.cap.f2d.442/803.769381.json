On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court entered judgment for the Secretary. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-23\">I. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-24\">Plaintiff was born in the Philippines on September 22, 1910. Prior to finishing high school, he served with the United States Army as a Philippine Scout from 1938 to 1947, the source of his employment coverage for Social Security purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 20, 1947, he suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>fered a heart attack. His condition was diagnosed as myocardial infarction due to coronary occlusion. He was hospitalized until October 22, 1947, when he was honorably discharged as unfit for military service because of a finding by a Board of Medical Officers that he was \u201c[ijncapacitated for further duty because of possibility of subsequent cardiac damage on strenuous activity.\u201d He never fully recovered from his weakened heart condition; in fact, his death in 1968 was caused by a heart attack. However, the relevant period of disablement under the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c) (1) is the period before either June 30 or September 30,1950, the last date of plaintiff\u2019s insured status.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was examined by the Veterans\u2019 Administration in October, 1948, and September, 1951, for rating purposes. The electrocardio-graphic report at the latter examination noted that his clinical record was \u201c [definitely * * * abnormal.\u201d The VA rating board rated his disability \u201c100% from 10-23-47 to 4-22-48\u201d and \u201c60% from 4-23-48 to 2-3-52.\u201d The record also indicates a subsequent rating of 30% until 8-14-55, when it was increased to 60%; it went to 100% in 1958.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">After his military discharge, plaintiff took a radio technician course for ten months in 1951-52, and he worked as a strawberry picker and assistant bartender briefly in 1955. He had to quit both jobs because of his heart weakness.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-3\">II. <em>Governing Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The Social Security Act, as amended, provides that \u201cEvery individual who * * * is insured for disability insurance benefits * * * and * * * is under a disability * * * shall be entitled to a disability insurance benefit.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cDisability\u201d is defined as \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable\u2018physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">an individual * * * shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work. For purposes of the preceding sentence (with respect to any individual), \u201cwork which exists in the national economy\u201d means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>We reverse because the claimant showed inability to resume his former work and the Secretary failed to meet the burden, which then devolved on him, of introducing evidence of \u201csubstantial gainful work that exists in the national economy\u201d for a person of appellant\u2019s \u201cage, education, and work experience\u201d and suffering from his sort of physical impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The Government claims that the Secretary has no burden whatever of offering evidence of job availability for disability claimants. We think such a burden of coming forward does shift to the Government when the claimant has made a showing of inability to return to his former work, and the record does not otherwise contain any evidence of claimant\u2019s ability to engage in substantial gainful work. If the Government meets its burden of coming forward, then the claimant has the overall burden of showing that his disability precludes substantial gainful work.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The Government bases its argument on the effect on prior law of \u00a7 158(b) of the Social Security Amendments of 1967.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is clear, of course, that the 1967 amendments were designed to tighten the definition of disability in light of court decisions interpreting the prior statutory language which had \u201cput the burden of proof on the Government to identify jobs for which the individual might have a reasonable opportunity to be hired, rather than ascertaining whether jobs exist in the national economy which he can do.\u201d Congress amended the disability section so that \u201c[Wjhether he would or would not actually be hired * * * may not be used as a basis for finding an individual to be disabled under this definition.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such a showing may no longer be required. Gentile v. Finch, 423 F.2d 244, 246 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Nevertheless, the 1967 Amendments have not jettisoned the rule that once the claimant shows evidence of his physical impairment disabling him from his former employment, the Secretary has the burden of going forward with evidence of other available employment. The only change wrought by the 1967 Amendments relates to the kind of evidence that must now be adduced. The Secretary need not show that the claimant would actually be hired. But he must show that there are jobs in the national economy that the claimant can do. In cases arising both before and after the 1967 Amendments it has been clearly stated that claimant\u2019s evidence of physical impairment undercutting ability to engage in former employment puts a burden on the Secretary to come forward with evidence of capacity to perform jobs, in accordance with the statutory criterion. The burden of coming forward that is shifted to the Government has most recently been restated in Gray v. Finch, 427 F.2d 336 (6th Cir. 1970), where the claimant, a former foundry worker, presented evidence of lung disease that rendered him unfit to return to foundry work. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-12\">* * * The burden was on appellant to convince the Secretary that he was disabled from engaging in his former employment. He satisfied this requirement, thus shifting to the Secretary the burden of going forward with evidence to demonstrate the existence of available employment compatible with appellant\u2019s disability. (427 F.2d at 338) <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>The precedents relied on by the Government with regard to the 1967 Amendments are not to the contrary, they either hold that (1) the Secretary does not have to show that the claimant would actually be hired, Gentile v. Finch, 423 F.2d 244 (3d Cir. 1970), Wright v. Gardner, 403 F.2d 646 (7th Cir. 1968); or that (2) when the claimant fails to show that he cannot return to his usual job the burden does not shift to the Secretary, Martin v. Finch, 415 F.2d 793 (5th Cir. 1969). In the other cases cited by the Government there was simply no evidence adduced by claimant of any inability to engage in employment. In Labee v. Cohen, 408 F.2d 998, 1000 (5th Cir. 1969), the evidence showed that \u201c[i]t is the appellant\u2019s attitude and not his aptitude which prevents him from engaging in gainful employment.\u201d See <em>also </em>Ryan v. Secretary of H.E.W., 393 F.2d 340 (9th Cir. 1968). Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 323 F.2d 989 (5th Cir. 1963), is not relevant here, because the hearing examiner had the benefit of vocational reports in his finding that the claimant was capable of substantial gainful activity. <em>Cf. </em>Breaux v. Finch, 421 F.2d 687, 689 (5th Cir. 1970), where claimant was only 20% disabled and \u201cperfectly capable of engaging in an infinite variety of jobs which can be classified as light work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">In Gotshaw v. Ribicoff, 307 F.2d 840 (4th Cir. 1962), Mrs. Gotshaw could have continued doing the same work she had done for years if her employer had not installed a heavier spinning machine. It was also found \u201cquite significant\u201d that she made no effort to find other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">As to prior decisions of our court, the Government invokes Mitchell v. Gardner, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 195, 198, 358 F.2d 826, 829 (1966). There we rejected the claim of an epileptic, saying: \u201cthere would appear to be no reason why, with continuing medication, he could not return to his former work when he is released.\u201d Today we focus on the rule that establishes the Government\u2019s burden of going forward once the claimant has shown a medical impairment which prevents him from returning to his former type of work. A host of precedents attest to the vitality of that rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">These cases make clear that the 1967 Amendments lighten the burden of what the Government must show, but claimant\u2019s showing of inability to return to former work does shift to the Government a burden of coming forward. Now the Secretary need only come forward with proof that there are substantial job opportunities in the national economy that can be occupied by persons of the claimant\u2019s background and condition. As already indicated, once the Secretary comes forward with such proof claimant must shoulder the overall burden of showing, <em>i. e., </em>convincing the Secretary, that the disability precludes any gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Finally, we refer to the Government\u2019s claim based on the putative effect of Section 223(d) (5) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) (5) (Supp. Y 1965-69), included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>in the 1967 Amendments, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\">An individual shall not be considered to be under a disability unless he furnishes such medical and other evidence of the existence thereof as the Secretary may require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">However, a similar sentence, containing the word \u201cproof\u201d instead of the current \u201cmedical and other evidence,\u201d was a part of former \u00a7 223(c) (2), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(c) (2) (1964). Neither sentence is inconsistent with the requirement that after an initial showing by claimant, the Government has the burden of coming forward with vocational evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The legislative history of (d) (5) is unenlightening, the Senate Report merely repeating the statutory language.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No pertinent requirement concerning the furnishing of evidence of disability appears in any order or regulation issued under subsection (d) (5) that has been called to our attention. Substantially the same language was part of the former disability definition under which the rule shifting the burden of going forward was established. <em>See </em>Kerner v. Flemming, 283 F.2d 916, 921-922 (2nd Cir. 1960), where, considering the effect of former subsection (c) (2), the court said, \u201cHowever, it does not follow that the court is bound to sustain a denial of disability benefits where the applicant has raised a serious question and the evidence affords no sufficient basis for the Secretary\u2019s negative answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">III. <em>Application of Principles to the Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">The ease before us is unique in terms of the facts and state of the record. Plaintiff was a resident of the Philippines. When he inquired about a hearing on his claim he was informed by an H.E.W. official that \u201csince no provision has been made for hearings to be held outside the United States, you would have to come into the United States at your own expense. * * *\u201d (Tr. 98).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He could not afford such a journey, so we do not have the kind of record often available in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">This ease is unique also in that plaintiff\u2019s former employment was with the Army, rather than any of the almost infinite variety of civilian employments usually involved in benefit cases. Congress provided that service in the Army during and after World War II gave rise to Social Security benefits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiff went into the Army as a Philippine Scout before finishing high school and stayed in until his 1947 heart attack. On his Discharge Certificate, the Board of Medical Officers found that his heart disease was \u201caggravated by active service\u201d and deemed him to be \u201c[\u00bfIncapacitated for further duty.\u201d This is a sufficient showing of inability to return to former employment to shift to the Secretary the burden of coming forward with evidence that plaintiff\u2019s condition left him gainfully employable.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>The Hearing Examiner referred to plaintiff\u2019s training, in 1951-52, as a radio technician at Feati University, concluding that plaintiff \u201cpresumably could have performed the tasks of a radio technician since it is common knowledge that this is light work performed at a bench where one can work seated.\u201d Assuming that it is common knowledge that there are jobs available in the national economy for high school graduates with radio technology credits, we do not think it is subject to judicial notice, and the record is devoid of evidence on whether or to what extent there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy which could be filled by a person with plaintiff\u2019s limited training and suffering from his sort of Class III heart condition. The record shows he was the kind of person who was at least willing to try his hand at jobs that in the event proved too much for his physical condition. One of these, bartending, would not seem to involve \u201cstrenuous\u201d activity, but it was beyond his powers at a time when he was designated at Class III.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">No evidence whatever was adduced by the Secretary, neither testimony of a vocational expert such as he often provides, nor deposition or interrogatories. Since the Secretary had the burden of coming forward on this point, his failure to adduce evidence leaves his findings without the support of substantial evidence as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>Cf. </em>Mitchell v. Gardner, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 195, 197-198, 358 F.2d 826, 828-829 (1966). Accordingly, we reverse and remand for entry of a judgment directing that plaintiff be granted the disability insurance benefits to which he would have been entitled had his application been approved, and to which he was entitled on the record as made.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-12\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-13\">.

Flemming, 302 F.2d 470 (5th Cir. 1962) stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-16\">\u201cTo establish a disability under [the Act] a claimant must <em>do more than show that he is unable to do his former work; </em>he must be unable to perform any substantial, gainful work, including work of a physically or emotionally lighter type. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Celebrezze v. Raley, <em>supra, </em>330 F.2d at 757. (Emphasis added.) A claimant is required to be unable to do the type of work that he was formerly engaged in <em>and demonstrate </em>his lack of particular experience for any other type of work. <em>See </em>Rosin v. Secretary of HEW, 379 F.2d 189 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">To support its interpretation of the rule on burden of coming forward, the majority has cited many cases. In most of the cases the claimant has either initially <em>demonstrated, </em>besides a physical handicap, his <em>lack of particular experience </em>or <em>educational background </em>for another job, <em>see, e. g., </em>Mullins v. Cohen, 408 F.2d 39 (6th Cir. 1969); Long v. Cohen, 293 F.Supp. 370 (W.D.Va.1968)<footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or has failed even to establish incapacity to return to his former work, thus rendering a discussion of the matter unnecessary. <em>See, e. g., </em>S.tumbo v. Gardner, 365 F.2d 275 (6th Cir. 1966). In the other cases cited the courts were more concerned with the Secretary showing that claimant would actually be hired. <em>See, e. g., </em>Rosin v. Secretary of HEW, <em>supra. </em>This, of course, is no longer a requirement under the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Typical of the cases cited by the majority is Stumbo v. Gardner, <em>supra. </em>In this case the claimant failed to even establish that she was disabled from returning to her former employment. The court then was not even faced with the issue of whether the Secretary would have been compelled to go forward if .the claimant had shown <em>only </em>an inability to return to her former employment. Though <em>Stumbo </em>may have implied the majority\u2019s interpretation of the rule, a careful study of the cases relied on by the <em>Stumbo </em>court shows the majority interpretation to be incorrect. <em>Stumbo </em>and other cases from other circuits that supposedly support the majority position can be found to ultimately rely on Thompson v. Celebrezze, 334 F.2d 412 (6th Cir. 1964) and Ellerman v. Flem-ming, 188 F.Supp. 521 (W.D.Mo.1960) for their statement of the law. In <em>Thompson </em>the claimant \u201cproved his <em>total </em>disability.\u201d Thompson v. Celebrezze, <em>supra, </em>334 F.2d at 414. (Emphasis added.) The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-9\">[H]e <em>need </em>only <em>establish that </em>he has become disabled from employment in <em>any work </em>in which he could profitably seek employment, in the light of his <em>physical </em>and <em>mental </em>capacities and his education, training and experience; and he need not be totally helpless or bedridden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-10\"><em>(Id.) </em>(Emphasis added.) In <em>Thompson </em>it was <em>only </em>because the claimant had established that he could not read, had very little movement of his back and was unable to even do some types of light work that the burden shifted to the Secretary. In <em>Ellerman </em>the claimant made his case when he showed his lack of training and experience for anything other than physical labor. In neither <em>Thompson </em>nor <em>Ellerman </em>did the court hold that the initial burden was met by <em>merely </em>showing an inability to engage in former employment. In Justice v. Gardner, 360 F.2d 998 (6th Cir. 1966) the court dispelled any notion that its past decisions gave vitality to a rule the majority now states as being supported by a \u201chost of precedents.\u201d The court in <em>Justice, </em>assuming claimant\u2019s inability to do <em>only his prior work, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avz\">\"Our relevant decisions have been made m the <em>factual contexts of each case </em>and we <em>did not announce a mechanical rule </em>which would relieve each applicant from <em>his'initial burden </em>of proving disability. It is not the burden of the Secretary to make an initial showing of non-disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-11\"><em>(Id. </em>at 1002) (Emphasis added.) In Gray v. Finch, 427 F.2d 336 (6th Cir. 1970), which is quoted by the majority, it was stated that \u201cthe claimant must show that he is suffering from a medical disability which prevents him not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>from performing his previous work, but also from obtaining any gainful employment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 337.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">It is quite evident from the record in this case that the claimant has utterly failed to meet his burden. All that we know of claimant\u2019s physical condition prior to June or September of 1950, when his insured status terminated, is that he was given a disability discharge from the Army because of a finding by a Board of Medical Officers that he was \u201c[i]n-capacitated for further duty because of <em>possibility </em>of subsequent cardiac damage on <em>strenuous </em>activity.\u201d (Tr. 25) (Emphasis added.) Though the status of claimant\u2019s health after 1950 is irrelevant, it is interesting to note that he was at all times since April 23, 1948, cleared to perform moderate activity. The majority, however, seems to take great comfort in relating the claimant\u2019s physical condition some five years after his insured status had expired. If this type of evidence were proper food for thought, though I don\u2019t concede it as such,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it would be quite a bit more helpful to consider what claimant did only <em>one </em>year after his insured status expired. At that time the claimant was in good enough health to start and then successfully complete a full year\u2019s load of university courses. Claimant offered no evidence, medical or otherwise to show that by his lack of education, experience or good health that he was unable to perform any other substantial activity. The record indicates that claimant was a high school graduate and spent a year at Feati University taking courses in radio technology,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a trade that hardly requires \u201cstrenuous activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">It is contrary to logic and prior case law to hold that a claimant, with the educational background of our claimant, has met his burden by merely establishing an incapacity any longer to serve m the Army. It is indeed quite conceivable that while in the Army claimant might well have had duties that required a certain degree of skill and responsibility that would have put him in good stead for transition to the civilian way of life. He had achieved the rank of staff sergeant and was described as intelligent. (Tr. 26.) Claimant could have provided the Secretary with information about his particular job experience or lack thereof in his application for disability. He failed to do so by leaving unanswered question 9 of the disability form which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\">What kind of job did you work at most in the 3 years before the date [of your impairment] (give job title, nature of employer\u2019s business, <em>brief description of your duties)?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">(Tr. 16) (Emphasis added.) Neither are we told of plaintiff\u2019s activities in relation to job experience prior to 1938 when he became'a Philippine Scout. It is the duty of the claimant to provide this information in order to show his lack of qualification for any other line of work. Not until this is done can it be said there is any burden on the Secretary. To borrow a phrase from Gotshaw v. Ribicoff, 307 F.2d 840 (4th Cir. 1962), I too, find it \u201cquite significant\u201d that claimant does not allege that he made any effort to look for another job prior to 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">Even if I were to hold that the burden had shifted to the Secretary, the record would still support his ruling. It is obvious that claimant\u2019s educational background would qualify him for the thousands of light jobs that exist in the community. It would be absurd to require vocational evidence to prove the obvious \u2014that jobs not requiring strenuous ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>tivity are available in the national community for high school graduates with additional credits in radio technology. Breaux v. Finch, 421 F.2d 687 (5th Cir. 1970). If we are to assume that it is common knowledge that such jobs are available for people possessing claimant\u2019s educational background, then it is a proper subject for judicial notice. See Brown v. Piper, 91 U.S. 37, 23 L.Ed. 200 (1875); Burr v. NLRB, 321 F.2d 612 (5th Cir. 1963); Mills v. Denver Tramway Corp., 155 F.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1946); Lowe v. United States, 83 F.Supp. 128 (W.D.Mo.1949). \u201cCourts need not be blind to what all others know.\u201d Burr v. NLRB, <em>supra,, </em>321 F.2d at 624. Such things as economic and business conditions have often been subject to judicial notice. Antonio Roig Suers. S. En C. v. Sugar Bd. of Puerto Rico, 235 F.2d 347 (1st Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 928, 77 S.Ct. 225, 1 L.Ed.2d 162 (1956); Barlow v. Budge, 127 F.2d 440 (8th Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 647, 63 S.Ct. 42, 87 L.Ed. 521 (1942); Superior Trucking Co. v. United States, 274 F.Supp. 196 (N.D.Ga. 1967); In re Chaney, 76 F.Supp. 911 (W.D.Va.1947), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. </em>Chaney v. Stover, 167 F.2d 471 (4th Cir. 1948); Gualtieri v. Sperry Gyroscope Co., 67 F.Supp. 219 (E.D.N.Y.1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Unless we are to adopt a practice of abandoning reason and of interpreting cases beyond their intended scope, this case should be affirmed. I agree wholeheartedly with the majority that \u201cthe court is [not] bound to sustain a denial of disability benefits where the applicant has raised a serious question and the evidence affords no sufficient basis for the Secretary\u2019s negative answer.\u201d It is obvious to me, however, from a painstaking examination of the record that the applicant has not raised a \u201cserious question\u201d and that there is a more than \u201csufficient basis\u201d for the Secretary\u2019s holding.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">. In <em>Mullins </em>and <em>Long </em>appellants could neither read nor write. This is particularly relevant, since in our case claimant lias had a high school education and a year of training in radio technology at Feati University.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-6\">. <em>See </em>Johnson v. Celebrezze, 217 F.Supp. 741 (S.D.W.Va.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. Despite claimant\u2019s academic achievements the majority refers to his training as \u201climited.\u201d No such classification is justified. In 1950-51 only 11 percent of the total school population in the Philippines was enrolled in high school and 3.5 percent in college. <em>See </em>15 Collier\u2019s Encyclopedia 660 (1955). Claimant, who actually <em>finished </em>high school and spent a year in college, was certainly a member of a select minority group.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
