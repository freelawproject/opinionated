Several points of error are raised. The defendant attacks the admissibility of stolen traveler\u2019s checks found in his possession at the time of arrest, the court\u2019s instruction relating to the possession of stolen property, and the court\u2019s instruction and evidence relating to a \u201cthieves\u2019 market\u201d in establishing \u201cvalue\u201d of the money orders. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The traveler\u2019s cheeks and the stolen money orders were taken in a burglary from a boy\u2019s school in Colorado on the 2nd or 3rd of April, 1970. Defendant was employed nearby. He was arrested on May 7, 1970, when he attempted to sell the money orders to undercover agents of the Iowa Bureau of Investigation. The traveler\u2019s checks were admitted into evidence as bearing on the wrongful intent of the defendant. United States v. Bessesen, 433 F.2d 861 (8 Cir. 1970); United States v. Lewis, 423 F.2d 457 (8 Cir. 1970); cert. denied. 400 U.S. 905, 91 S.Ct. 146, 27 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); Von Feldt v. United States, 407 F.2d 95 (8 Cir. 1969); Love v. United States, 386 F.2d 260 (8 Cir. 1967), cert. denied 390 U.S. 985, 88 S.Ct. 1111, 19 L.Ed.2d 1286 (1968). Cf. United States v. Crawford, 438 F.2d 441 (8 Cir. 1971). Our review of the record satisfies us that sufficient foundation was laid for the checks. We find that under the cautionary instruetion of the court they were clearly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">The point raised concerning the instructions and permissible inference arising from the possession of recently stolen property has been discussed too frequently to be repeated. Counsel raises no new challenge. The principle of these cases refutes defendant\u2019s contention. See Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613, 619, 16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090 (1896); Teel v. United States, 407 F.2d 604 (8 Cir. 1969); Pigman v. United States, 407 F.2d 237 (8 Cir. 1969); Sewell v. United States, 406 F.2d 1289 (8 Cir. 1969); Anderson v. United States, 406 F.2d 529 (8 Cir. 1969); Burke v. United States, 388 F.2d 286 (8 Cir. 1968); Aron v. United States, 382 F.2d 965 (8 Cir. 1967); Lee v. United States, 363 F.2d 469, 474 (8 Cir. 1966), cert. denied 385 U.S. 947, 87 S.Ct. 323, 17 L.Ed.2d 227 (1966); Cloud v. United States, 361 F.2d 627 (8 Cir. 1966). For a specific refutation of defendant\u2019s argument that the burden of proof is changed, see Harding v. United States, 337 F.2d 254, 257 (8 Cir. 1964). Cf. United States v. Jones, 418 F.2d 818 (8 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Argument is made that possession of stolen money orders without equipment to validate them does not in itself prove that the blank money orders have value. The fact that Johnson himself asked $150 for eight of these orders establishes \u201cvalue\u201d under the statute. Cf. Montgomery v. United States, 403 F.2d 605, 610 (8 Cir. 1968), cert. denied 396 U.S. 859, 90 S.Ct. 126, 24 L.Ed.2d 110 (1969). There was additional testimony as to the value of the stolen items in a \u201cthieves\u2019 market.\u201d As recognized in United States v. Kramer, 289 F.2d 909, 920 (2 Cir. 1961): \u201c[I]t does not follow that a stolen blank money order can never be worth more than the nominal value of the paper.\u201d Defendant\u2019s contention is similar to one disposed of in Churder v. United States, 387 F.2d 825, 833 (8 Cir. 1968). The fact that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>additional equipment was found in Johnson\u2019s possession does not detract from the remaining evidence that the stolen money orders did in fact have a value within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
