The District Court found as a fact that the appellee \u201cdid not discharge or refuse to hire [appellant] because of his race, color or national origin.\u201d In the light of all the testimony heard by the District Court, we cannot say that its quoted finding was clearly erroneous. Thus, the judgment must be, and it hereby is,</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1405-18\">. The appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss was based upon its contention that it was not served with a copy of the appellant\u2019s opening brief in this court. The opening brief was apparently received in our Clerk\u2019s office on December 29, 1970. The motion to dismiss the appeal was not filed until April 6, 1971, after the appeal had already been scheduled for oral argument on May 3, 1971. It is because of this delay on the part of appellee\u2019s counsel and because the appellant represents himself in <em>propria persona </em>that we deny the motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
