He filed an action in the District Court against certain of his custodians, claiming that they had violated his civil rights to his damage in the sum of over $23,000,000. The District Court dismissed the complaint upon the ground that its allegations were not \u201cplain and concise\u201d and that they were \u201cgarbled,\u201d vague, and unintelligible. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that applicable Rules pertaining to pleading required that Dougherty\u2019s complaint not be entertained. Accordingly, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A9b\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1403-18\">. The appellant has requested the appointment of an attorney to assist him with this appeal. This being a civil action, we have declined to make the requested appointment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
