KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">Cali, plaintiff and appellant in this patent infringement action, is a mechanic employed by one of the pioneers in the airlines industry, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). The kernel of the patented invention which is the subject of this suit was contained in an idea which Cali submitted to Pan Am on a standard form soliciting employees\u2019 suggestions in December 1962. Although of course Eastern Airlines, Inc., the appellee and alleged infringer, seeks to minimize its value, Cali\u2019s proposal apparently resulted in the correction of a persistent defect in the design of the JT-4 jet engine, then used in Pan Am\u2019s Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 aircraft before the introduction of the fan jet. Cali\u2019s \u201csuggestion-box\u201d solution had eluded the industry\u2019s professional engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">The sole question raised on this appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded on the basis of the pleadings, affidavits, and depositions before it, that no material fact remained to be tried, thus justifying the grant of Eastern\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Judge Dooling, whose opinion is reported at 318 F.Supp. 474, decided that Cali\u2019s \u201cinvention was * * * in public use\u201d and not used primarily for experimental purposes \u201cmore than one year prior to the date\u201d Cali filed his application for a patent and hence the patent was invalid, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). Accordingly, the action was dismissed. While Eastern may yet ultimately prevail on the question of prior use or on other defenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>raised below which are not before us on this appeal, we disagree with the district court that the relevant factual issues have been resolved with such clarity at this stage in the litigation as to justify summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Cali applied for his patent on September 1, 1964. The key date for purposes of the \u201cpublic use\u201d bar of Section 102(b) is thus September 1, 1963. As will appear in more detail, the central question before us involves the nature and purposes of the uses to which Pan Am put Cali\u2019s invention prior to that date. Before we evaluate those uses, the contours of Cali\u2019s concept must first be sketched.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Cali\u2019s patent relates to the design of the front or low pressure compression section of the \u201caxial-flow\u201d compressor, the type of compressor used on the JT-4, manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation (Pratt &amp; Whitney). This front end section includes several cylindrical stages, consisting of alternating fan-like rotor sections sandwiched between stationary \u201cstator\u201d sections. Successive rotors blow air back against the blades (or vanes) of the stators (or shrouds), which in turn guide the air inward through the tapering compressor chamber to an outlet section called the fairing. The last, or seventh, stator on the JT-4 was designed by Pratt &amp; Whitney so that it connected loosely to the fairing by means of lugs and slats. The loose interconnection permitted the \u201cfloating\u201d fairing to vibrate against the seventh stator assembly, causing abrasive wear of the stator lugs and fairing.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">As a mechanic employed by Pan Am since 1957, Cali became familiar with the usual practice of periodically repairing worn stators and fairings. This was done by first rebuilding the worn surfaces by welding them and then machining the rebuilt surfaces to their proper dimensions. Cali\u2019s suggestion, submitted to his supervisor in December 1962, proposed as an alternative to this practice \u201cto permanently weld the fairing to the 7th stage vane and shroud\u201d and thus by rigidly interconnecting them to eliminate the abrasive wear and hence the need for periodic repairs. Although this solution was \u201csimplicity itself once it was conceived and expressed,\u201d as Judge Dooling characterized it, \u201cintroducing rigidity may have been powerfully counter-indicated by engine building lore,\u201d 318 F.Supp. at 475, primarily because of the danger of damage from stresses that might accumulate in the two vibrating assemblies.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">While precise temporal relationships are unclear in many respects from this record, at approximately the time that Cali\u2019s suggestion was being evaluated, Pan Am engineers devised a variant application of the basic rigid-connection idea suggested by Cali\u2019s proposed weld technique. By this alternative method, the vibrating parts would be connected by means of long bolts or tie-rods. The tie-rod technique is conceded by both parties to be within the teaching of Cali\u2019s patent, whose critical language describes the two vibrating parts as being \u201crigidly connected\u201d or secured. The primary advantage of the tie-rod variant appears to have been to permit easier assembly and servicing of the engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Both parties agree that Cali\u2019s suggestion initiated a period of indefinite length during which Pan Am, in the words of Eastern\u2019s brief, evaluated the rigid-connection concept at least with the object \u201cof finding out whether the idea was worth using.\u201d Specifically, Judge Dooling identified three foci of \u201cproblems and hesitations that preceded Pan Am\u2019s unrestricted use of the invention.\u201d Thus, Pan Am was concerned with the relative merits of the weld and tie-rod methods. Second, as indicated above, the weld method caused difficulty in assembling the compressor (the solution finally hit upon for this problem, the details of which are irrelevant here, is included in Cali\u2019s patent). Third, the court referred to certain \u201cconsequential effects,\u201d such as cracking of the welded assembly which may have caused Pan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Am for a time to doubt the efficacy of Cali\u2019s approach. 318 F.Supp. at 475-476.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Certain essential details of this period prior to Pan Am\u2019s unreserved acceptance of Cali\u2019s concept, are not in dispute. Thus, by a telegram dated January 4, 1963, Pratt &amp; Whittney authorized use of the tie rod on a \u201ctrial basis.\u201d Similarly, on February 8, 1963, Pratt <em>&amp; </em>Whitney wired Pan Am that it had \u201cno objection\u201d to use of the weld \u201con token number of engines based on your assertion that no assembly difficulty will be encountered.\u201d Pursuant to this authorization,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pan Am subsequently installed and used engines incorporating the tie rod technique on one engine and incorporating the weld approach on at least three other engines. In each instance, the engines were installed and used on commercial aircraft in the normal course of Pan Am\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The district court viewed each of these commercial uses as a \u201cpublic use\u201d within the meaning of Section 102(b), and this conclusion can hardly be challenged. That an invention or process employed in the regular conduct of a business is a \u201cpublic use\u201d for this purpose is a proposition settled long ago and never disturbed. Smith &amp; Griggs Manuf. Co., 123 U.S. 249, 8 S.Ct. 122, 31 L.Ed. 141 (1887). See Electric Battery Co. v. Shimadzu, 307 U.S. 5, 20, 59 S.Ct. 675, 684, 83 L.Ed. 1071 (1939) (defining \u201cpublic use\u201d to include \u201cthe ordinary use of a machine or the practise of a process * * * in the usual course * * * for commercial, purposes\u201d); Egbert v. Lippmann, 104 U.S. 333, 26 L.Ed. 755 (1881). This settled concept of \u201cpublic use\u201d is \u201cextraordinarily broad,\u201d Watson v. Allen, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 5, 254 F.2d 342, 345 (1958) (Burger, Circuit Judge). It is a matter of legal indifference that the \u201cpublic\u201d use may be necessarily concealed from public awareness by the structure of the design or the manner of its use, Hall v. Macneale, 107 U.S. 90, 2 S.Ct. 73, 27 L.Ed. 367 (1882); Egbert v. Lippmann, <em>supra; </em>Metallizing Engineering Co. v. Kenyon Bearing &amp; Auto Parts Co., 153 F.2d 516 (2d Cir. 1946), cert. denied, 328 U.S. 840, 66 S. Ct. 1016, 90 L.Ed. 1615 (1946). Public use by a third party, with or without the knowledge or consent of the patentee, will generally defeat the patent as readily as public use by the inventor himself. Shaw v. Cooper, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 292, 8 L.Ed. 689 (1833); A. Schrader\u2019s Sons, Inc. v. Wein Sales Corp., 9 F.2d 306, 308 (2d Cir. 1925). See Lorenz v. Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co., 167 F.2d 423 (3d Cir. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">We have previously explained the purposes of this sometimes harsh standard as intended \u201cto require the inventor to see to it that he filed his application within [the statutory period] from the completion of his invention, so as to- cut off all question of the defeat of his patent by a use or sale of it by others more than [the statutory period] prior to his application\u201d and as designed to avoid the \u201cperplexing questions which must frequently arise when the intent of the user and the bona fides of the use are questions to be determined. * * * \u201d Eastman v. Mayor, etc., City of New York, 134 F. 844, 854 (2d Cir. 1904). See Walker on Patents 700 (2d Ed. 1964). It is thus clear beyond cavil that Pan Am\u2019s use of Cali\u2019s invention in commercial aircraft prior to September 1, 1963, would defeat Cali\u2019s patent, were the uses not included within the \u201cexperimental use\u201d exception to the prior use bar which we shall discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">On the other hand, although the parties have not dwelt on the matter, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>necessary to add that the present record would not appear to support a holding that <em>Cali\u2019s </em>action in submitting his suggestion to Pan Am constituted a \u201cpublic use\u201d regardless of the manner of Pan Am\u2019s subsequent exploitation of his idea. Cali did not conceal his invention from the public while using it to his commercial advantage more than a year before his application, thus extending the period of his monopoly beyond that protected by the patent laws. To prevent such an abuse and evasion of the patent laws seems to have been accepted by courts as an important purpose of the \u201cpublic use\u201d bar, see Watson v. Allen, <em>supra, </em>254 F.2d at 346; Koehring v. National Auto Tool Co., 362 F.2d 100, 103 (7th Cir. 1966); Metallizing Engineering Co. v. Kenyon Bearing &amp; Auto Parts Co., <em>supra, </em>153 F.2d at 520, but one which has little importance in the circumstances of this case. Cali does not appear to stand in the position of an inventor who sells his patented device in the ordinary course of his business, for a predominantly commercial purpose, and without restriction or control over the uses to be made of the invention by the buyer. In such a case, the <em>buyer\u2019s </em>acts and purposes become irrelevant since the inventor\u2019s sale of the device is itself sufficient to defeat the patent. See Tool Research &amp; Engineering Corp. v. Honcor Corp., 367 F.2d 449 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 919, 87 S.Ct. 2032, 18 L.Ed.2d 972 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Eastern does stress the absence of any indication in this record that Cali attempted to control or in any way limit Pan Am\u2019s use of his idea. Similarly, the district court observed that Cali \u201cput no restrictions on Pan Am\u2019s use\u201d nor did he or <em>could </em>he \u201ccontrol the time * * * extent and nature of [Pan Am\u2019s] use\u201d of his conception. 318 F. Supp. at 478. But the absence of any control by Cali, or any attempt to impose control, should not be elevated to the status of a per se test under the circumstances disclosed here and in the posture in which we receive this case. Cali lacked the means to develop his idea on his own resources byond the bare conception of it. See Ry. Register Man-uf. Co. v. Broadway &amp; 7th Ave. Ry., 22 F. 655 (2d Cir. 1884); Harmon v. Struthers, 57 F. 637 (W.D.Pa.1893). Nor was Cali, as an employee of Pan Am, in any position to dictate or even propose the terms' of Pan Am\u2019s entirely gratuitous application of his concept. See General Electric Co. v. Continental Fibre Co., 256 F. 660, 663 (2d Cir. 1919). No purpose consonant with the scheme of the patent laws would be served were the statutory \u201cpublic use\u201d period to run in every case from the time that an employee communicated a raw idea to his superiors for evaluation and exploitation in their unfettered discretion. Indeed, such a doctrine might stifle inventiveness. See Note, The Public Use Bar to Patentability: Two New Approaches to the Experimental Use Exception, 52 Minn.L.Rev. 851, 855-56 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">We do not imply that an inventor in Cali\u2019s situation might sell an idea to his employer and thereafter manifest no interest in the development, success, or failure of his invention, and yet take advantage of his employer\u2019s trial or experimental period. Such inaction and indifference would indicate that the inventor\u2019s intent was commercial \u2014 to secure the reward for the submission of the submitted concept, whatever its value\u2014 and not experimental, and would therefore constitute a \u201cpublic\u201d and non-experimental use within the meaning of Section 102(b). Cali\u2019s acceptance of a financial reward for his idea, however, <em>after it was examined, tried, and ultimately adopted by Pan Am, </em>is consistent with a purpose to follow the idea through to its ultimate perfection and fate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, we do not see the purposes of the patent laws enhanced were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the public use period to run from the date of submission, assuming Cali at that time and thereafter continued to maintain an interest in the progress of his suggestion, merely because Cali\u2019s inventiveness and thereafter his interest in the invention may have been whetted by the possibility of a financial reward should the concept prove useful to Pan Am.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Eastern does not now contend that Cali ever abandoned his idea to Pan Am in the sense suggested by the preceding paragraph. In any event, the evidence that Cali remained interested in the progress of his idea until and beyond the time it was unreservedly accepted by Pan Am is more than sufficient for purposes of our review of a grant of summary judgment. Accordingly, the determinative question becomes the nature and purpose of Pan Am\u2019s use of Cali\u2019s idea, as the parties and district court apparently seemed to agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We turn to the issue principally briefed and argued, <em>viz., </em>whether Pan Am\u2019s public use of Cali\u2019s invention prior to September 1, 1963 falls within the judicially created exception to the \u201cpublic use\u201d bar for uses which are shown by \u201cfull, unequivocal, and convincing\u201d proof, Smith &amp; Griggs Manuf. Co., 123 U.S. 249, 264, 8 S.Ct. 122, 31 L.Ed. 141 (1888), to have been primarily intended as experimental rather than commercial. Aerovox Corp. v. Polymet Mfg. Corp., 67 F.2d 860 (2d Cir. 1944). Specifically, the question is whether this factual issue was resolved by the papers before the district court with sufficient clarity to permit an award of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">At the threshold, we differ with the district court\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the \u201cexperimental use\u201d exception. Judge Dooling appears to have believed that even Pan Am\u2019s \u201cfirst use\u201d of the tie rod and weld was not predominantly experimental even assuming that the primary purpose of the use was to determine whether Cali\u2019s idea should be adopted or rejected. Apparently the district court assumed that a use may not be \u201cexperimental\u201d if the purpose is to see if the idea in question has any value at all, rather than to explore ways of improving the invention or \u201cto determine or guide the direction of <em>modification </em>of an <em>emergent </em>inventive concept.\u201d 318 F.Supp. at 477 (emphasis added). The district court appears to have equated \u201cexperimental\u201d with \u201cdevelopmental.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">This conception of the scope of the experimental use exception apparently underlay the whole of the district court\u2019s decision. We find it unduly restrictive. We see no good purpose in attempting to distinguish sharply between experimentation with an eye to going \u201cback to the drawing board\u201d for modification and rethinking in the event of initial failure on the one hand and experimentation directed more toward discovering whether a novel invention should be adopted and marketed or discarded in its entirety. Indeed, we have previously said as much in Aerovox Corp. v. Polymet Mfg. Corp., 67 F.2d 860, 862 (2d Cir. 1933) where we \u201cassumed\u201d that an inventor may experiment with an idea \u201cnot only to put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>it into definitive form, but to see whether his ideas are worth exporting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The leading case defining the reach of the experimental use exception, Elizabeth v. Pavement Co., 97 U.S. 126, 24 L. Ed. 1000 (1877) involved experimentation to test the <em>durability </em>of the inventor\u2019s new kind of pavement. There was no indication that the inventor put the pavement to the test of six years\u2019 public wear to determine what improvements he might make, rather than simply to discover whether the idea was worth pursuing. Indeed, the Court\u2019s decision in favor of the patentee was premised on the assumption that the aim of the test might be \u201cto bring his invention to perfection, <em>or </em>to ascertain whether it [would] answer the purpose intended.\u201d 97 U.S. at 137 (emphasis added). Either sort of experimental use \u2014 if indeed any such sorting is tenable \u2014 would bring the invention within the experimental use exception because \u201cit is the interest of the public, as well as [of the inventor] that the invention should be perfect <em>and </em>properly tested. * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The crucial date therefore becomes that when Pan Am first publicly used Cali\u2019s concept with a predominantly commercial intent, rather than with the primary purpose of determining whether or in what form the idea should be put into general use.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">On this review of the summary judgment, the issue is more properly phrased as being whether Cali has succeeded by other than \u201cvague allegations,\u201d Dressler v. M. V. Sandpiper, 331 F.2d 130 (2d Cir. 1964), in raising a \u201cgenuine issue,\u201d F.R.Civ.P. 56(c) as to whether Pan Am\u2019s first public and non-experimental use of Cali\u2019s concept occurred on or subsequent to September 1, 1963. We have recently had occasion to admonish courts in this jurisdiction to approach summary judgment with less trepidation than had sometimes been displayed in the past, Dressler v. M. V. Sandpiper, <em>supra. </em>But to recognize that the purpose of summary judgment \u201cis to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see if there is a genuine need for trial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 132 (quoting Advisory Committee note on 1963 amendments to F.R.Civ.P. 54) does not entail abandoning the \u201cfundamental maxim that on a motion for summary judgment the court cannot try issues of fact; it can only determine whether there are issues to be tried.\u201d American Manuf. Mutual Ins. Co. v. American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc., 388 F.2d 272, 279 (2d Cir. 1967). See Empire Electronics v. United States, 311 F.2d 175, 179-180 (2d Cir. 1962). Moreover, when the court grants summary judgment, it must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences favorable to the party against whom summary judgment is sought, United States v. Diebold, 369 U. S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962), bearing in mind that the moving party has the burden of showing an absence of any material factual issue for trial, Adickes v. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). If undisputed evidentiary facts disclose competing material inferences as to which reasonable minds might disagree, the motion must be denied. Lemelson v. Ideal Toy Corp., 408 F.2d 860 (2d Cir. 1969). \u201cThis admonition should especially be kept in mind when the inferences which the parties seek to have drawn deal with questions of motive, intent, and subjective feelings and reactions.\u201d Empire Electronics Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>311 F.2d at 179-180. See also Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962); White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 259-260, 83 S.Ct. 696, 9 L.Ed. 2d 738 (1963); Consolidated Elec. Co. v. United States ex rel. Gough Indus., 355 F.2d 437 (9th Cir. 1966); Levin v. Jt. Comm\u2019n on Accreditation of Hospitals, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 354 F.2d 515 (1965); Vermont Strucutural Slate Co. v. Tatko Bros. Slate Co., 233 F.2d 9 (2d Cir. 1956) (suggesting that for this reason district courts might exercise special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>caution before granting summary judgment in patent cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Applying these familiar standards to this record, we conclude that the motion for summary judgment should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">A recitation of each element of the evidence relied on by Eastern to sustain its summary judgment would serve no useful purpose. It is sufficient to indicate the \u201cspecific facts\u201d set forth in the documents before us which show that there is a \u201cgenuine issue for trial.\u201d F. R.Civ.P. 56(e). Thus, apart from the bare use of the tie rod or weld on four aircraft in the normal course of Pan Am\u2019s business prior to September 1, 1963, Eastern relies on evidence that (1) on April 4, 1963, Pan Am issued an amendment to its overhaul manual explaining the tie-rod method; (2) on June 19, officials of Pan Am answered a request from the Royal Dutch Airlines by describing in detail the weld operation; (3) on August 1, Pratt &amp; Whitney authorized Pan Am to proceed with further weldings; (4) and on August 27, Pan Am issued a further amendment to its overhaul manual incorporating both the weld and tie rod methods of repairing worn JT-4 compressors. But against this, Cali points to internal Pan Am memoranda and telegrams from Pratt &amp; Whitney expressly referring to impending uses on commercial aircraft as \u201ctests\u201d or the like.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Also, on July 27, Claude G. Newton, an engineer for Pratt &amp; Whitney, wired the Pratt &amp; Whitney Service Department that the welding technique presented assembly problems and advised Pratt &amp; Whitney to \u201cgo slow on granting official approval\u201d of the weld. On July 30, Pratt &amp; Whitney sent a telegram to Pan Am expressly disapproving the weld technique because of insufficient experience with it. Although its August 1 telegram, on which Eastern relies, did evince a less hostile attitude toward the weld, Pratt <em>&amp; </em>Whitney still recommended that the use of the technique \u201cbe held to a minimum.\u201d There was evidence that the weld technique continued to create problems with assembling the compressor into September, 1963, and Cali was not rewarded for his successful innovation until October, 1963.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">In sum, we find that the record discloses a genuine issue of fact as to whether Pan Am publicly used Cali\u2019s invention prior to September 1, 1963, for predominantly non-experimental purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">. The tentative nature of the initial uses of Cali\u2019s idea at this early stage is indicated by two internal memoranda that passed between a Pan Am engineer, Frederick D. Curtin, and Pan Am\u2019s Inspection Department in February, 1963. These memoranda refer to an impending \u201ctrial installation\u201d of the tie rod and \u201ca service test\u201d of the weld method. The tie rod was expressly forbidden for use \u201con any other engines until the results of the service testing were known.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\">. We do not imply that acceptance of an award upon submission of an idea would necessarily be <em>inconsistent </em>with a primarily non-commercial purpose or would necessarily evidence the inventor\u2019s lack of a continuing interest in the progress of the invention,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">. That the appropriate test here is the purpose of Pan Am\u2019s use of Cali\u2019s idea, may appear at first to be inconsistent with the leading ease defining the \u201cexperimental use\u201d exception to the public use bar, Elizabeth v. Pavement Co., 97 U.S. 126, 24 L.Ed. 1000 (1877). In the <em>Pavement </em>case, the experimenter laid down seventy-five feet of his newly designed pavement on a public road adjoining a toll house. In finding that the commercial use of the pavement was subordinate to its experimental use, the Court focused on Nicholson\u2019s purposes, and not those of the public in permitting use of the road. However, Nicholson, the inventor in <em>Pavement, </em>unlike Cali, was able to and did in fact closely supervise and control the use of his invention. Here, it would have been unrealistic and inconsistent with the purposes of the patent laws to require that the inventor maintain control; accordingly, the decisive purpose necessarily becomes that of the party to whom control is transferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">. <em>See </em>note 1 and accompanying text, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">. An \u201cInvestigator\u2019s Report\u201d dated October 7, 1963, reported that the weld procedure \u201clias been adopted and incorporated into the overhaul manual.\u201d An award of $500 for Cali was recommended. Cali subsequently received both the $500 and a trip <em>to </em>Jamaica. In May, 1964, Pan Am told Cali that he was free to apply for a patent, since Pan Am did not desire to do so. A condition to this was that Pan Am retained royalty free shop rights in Cali\u2019s welding procedure. Eastern incorporated the weld procedure into its repair manual on December 9, 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
