Appellant was named in counts two and three only as an aider and abettor. After a motion for severance had been granted and trial held, appellant was found guilty and given concurrent sentences of ten years on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The incidents leading up to the indictment in this case commenced on the evening of February 13, 1967, when customs inspectors at San Ysidro, California, found 108 kilos of marihuana concealed in co-defendant Johnson\u2019s automobile as Johnson was attempting to reenter the United States from Tijuana, Mexico. Following his arrest, Johnson was taken by customs agents to his apartment in Los Angeles. The apartment was located in a building owned by appellant. Johnson and Customs Agent Epps entered the apartment in the morning hours of February 14th, and Epps positioned himself out of sight in a back bedroom. About 9:30 A.M., appellant entered the apartment and asked Johnson if he got the \u201cstuff.\u201d When Johnson said, \u201cYes,\u201d appellant left the apartment saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to make arrangements.\u201d Epps overheard this conversation and took notes on it. Appellant returned about 1:00 P.M. and suggested that he and Johnson go down to the former\u2019s apartment in the same building. When they arrived, according to Johnson\u2019s testimony at the trial, appellant seemed quite apprehensive, kept looking out the window and several times asked if Johnson had been \u201cstopped or followed or anything.\u201d Johnson asked appellant about the \u201crest of the money.\u201d Appellant responded by asking, \u201cHow many kilos or \u2018k\u2019s\u2019 did you get?\u201d When Johnson replied that he did not know, appellant suggested they go outside and take a look. At the car, appellant opened the trunk and when he saw there were only two kilos \u2014 the agents having unloaded the balance\u2014 said, \u201cWhat? Only two k\u2019s?\u201d At that point, the customs agents converged on the scene and placed appellant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">At the trial, Johnson was called as a witness for the prosecution. A note found on his person at the time of the arrest was admitted into evidence over objection. The note contained the words, \u201cBull Ring.\u201d Johnson testified that appellant had written these words after telling him that the contact in Tijuana would be at the Bull Ring. Johnson also fully corroborated the testimony of the government witnesses on what occurred in his apartment and at the time of the appellant\u2019s arrest. Moreover, Johnson denied appellant\u2019s story that his job was to procure color TY sets for appellant, testifying that he made the trip to Tijuana at the request of the appellant in order to bring up some marihuana. Johnson rejected appellant\u2019s original proposition of $200.00 to transport the marihuana, but accepted a subsequent offer of $400.00, whereupon he was instructed by appellant on the method by which he was to pick up the drug. Having been paid $200.00 in advance, Johnson then made the trip to Tijuana, met the contact at the Bull Ring, procured the marihuana as planned and was arrested upon his return to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">At the outset, appellant claims that the court erred in failing to give a definitive instruction on the element of knowledge. We note that no exception was taken by appellant\u2019s trial counsel to the exhaustive instructions given by the district judge. We, therefore, invoke Rule 30, F.R.Crim.P., which precludes a party from assigning error on any portion of the charge to the jury unless he objected thereto before the jury retired. In any event, we believe that the jury was fully and adequately instructed on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Next, appellant charges that the admissions made by him in Johnson\u2019s apartment, in the listening presence of Customs Agent Epps, after Johnson was in custody, were not corroborated and consequently not admissible. We need only point to the fact that Johnson\u2019s statements were fully corroborated' by the testimony of Agent Epps. Additionally, the \u201cBull Ring\u201d note written by the appellant was received -in evidence, together with appellant\u2019s observed actions at the trunk of Johnson\u2019s automobile. Added to that is the fact that defense counsel made no objection to the statements. No doubt this failure to object was in line with the defense theory that the entire conversation in the apartment related to color TV sets, rather than marihuana. We fail to find error in this assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Closely related to the previous contention is appellant\u2019s claim that Epps was surreptitiously eavesdropping and that his testimony as to what occurred in Johnson\u2019s apartment should not have been admitted. In the main, appellant relies on Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) and United States v. White, 405 F.2d 838 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. granted 394 U.S. 957, 89 S.Ct. 1305, 22 L.Ed.2d 559. Neither of these cases supports his position. In <em>Katz </em>there was no consent by either of the participants to the bugged telephone conversation; here, Johnson worked out an arrangement with Epps whereby the latter could listen in on Johnson\u2019s dialogue with appellant. Aside from that, the <em>Katz </em>decision, handed down after the events in the case at bar occurred, is not retroactive. Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969). As for <em>White, </em>the United States Supreme Court recently reversed the Seventh Circuit decision upon which appellant relies, and held that the type of \u201cpermitted\u201d eavesdropping as is here under scrutiny was not constitutionally, or otherwise, objectionable. United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Finally, appellant\u2019s attack on the sufficiency of the evidence against him does not merit extended discussion. Suffice to say, the evidence was far more than sufficient for the jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on each of the three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
