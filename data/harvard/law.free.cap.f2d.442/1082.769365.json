No responsive pleadings were filed and, after hearing argument, the district court entered on March 3, 1970, an order denying the temporary restraining order and dismissing the complaint \u201cfor lack of federal jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-19\">The complaint claims jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1964) (federal questions) and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1964) (mandamus against a federal official). The district court dismissed because it considered Section 10(b) (3) of the Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 460(b) (3) (Supp. IV 1969), to be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-20\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that in 1967, while he was married but living apart from his first wife and son, he was reclassified from Class III-A <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Class IA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He and his first wife wrote to the Local Board advising that she and their son were dependent upon him, and he was reclassified III-A. On February 4, 1969, plaintiff and his first wife were divorced and on May 4, 1969, he remarried (p. 23a). The complaint alleges that he continued to support his first wife and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>infant son and is their sole means of support.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">On June 11, 1969, the Local Board wrote to plaintiff requesting that he appear before it on June 18,1969, to discuss his classification. Because he was in transit from New Jersey to Arizona he did not receive that letter until after June 23, 1969, when the Local Board mailed him a notice that he had been classified I-A (Exhibit A to Memorandum of Law In Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Order to Show Cause). On July 23, 1969, his letter appealing that classification to the New Jersey Appeal Board was received by the Local Board (Exhibit B to above Memorandum of Law).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On September 5, 1969, the Appeal Board concurred in the I-A classification of the Local Board and an induction order was mailed September 24, 1969, directing plaintiff to report for induction on October 8, 1969 (par. 8 of Complaint and Exhibit E to the above Memorandum of Law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">After the induction order issued, the plaintiff requested a personal appearance before the Local Board and submitted documentation, including affidavits of witnesses and medical history which the Local Board did not have before it at the time of its I-A classification. However, neither the complaint nor the letters and affidavits in the record state at any place that the plaintiff or his dependents developed any medical conditions after the notice of the induction order was mailed to plaintiff on September 24, 1969, or at any definite date prior thereto. The date for reporting for induction under the above order was postponed prior to October 8, 1969, and several times thereafter (pars. 21 &amp; 22 of Complaint). By letter of January 5, 1970, the Local Board requested plaintiff \u201cto appear for a meeting with [it] * * to discuss your case,\u201d but after this meeting of January 15, it wrote plaintiff on January 21, 1970:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-15\">\u201cThis will advise you the recent evidence submitted concerning your case has been reviewed by this local board but it does not justify the reopening of your case and reconsideration of your present classification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-16\">\u201cYou will therefore be subject to further processing for induction. Notices will be mailed to you in due course.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-17\">Both plaintiff and his former wife requested an appeal from this letter of the Board. On January 27, 1970., the Execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>tive Secretary of the Local Board wrote plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-4\">\u201cThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter requesting another appeal, this is not possible, you appealed when you received your 1-A classification and was forwarded to the Appeal Board returned still classified I-A- as of June 18th, 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-5\">\u201cYou had a non-statutory hearing which was requested, you have no further rights, you will be subject to call at our next Induction which is overdue pending the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">On February 19, 1970, plaintiff received a postponed date for induction, and this lawsuit followed. He alleges that the failure of the Selective Service System to afford him an appeal was erroneous as a matter of law, and that it should be corrected by mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">Taking the above allegations as true, Judge Gibbons, by orders of March 3 and 6, 1970, and thereafter a panel of this court on March 16, 1970, granted temporary relief pending appeal, to consider the district court\u2019s adverse determination of jurisdiction in light of Bucher v. Selective Service System, 421 F.2d 24 (3d Cir. 1970), and of Hunt v. Local Board No. 197, 438 F.2d 1128, No. 18,076 (3d Cir. 1971), then still <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">The issue presented by this case is whether the district court was correct in holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain registrant\u2019s action for pre-induction judicial review. A plaintiff has the burden of proving that a federal court, a court of limited jurisdiction, has subject matter jurisdiction, and there is a presumption that a federal court lacks jurisdiction in a particular case until it has been demonstrated that subject matter jurisdiction exists.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> F.R. Civ.P. 12(h) (3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-12\">\u201cWhenever it appears by suggestion of the parties <em>or otherwise </em>that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-13\">In view of these principles, this court has dismissed cases for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on its own motion on the basis of documents which were neither before the district court nor before this court. <em>See, </em>e. g., Berkowitz v. Philadel-delphia Chewing Gum Corp., 303 F.2d 585 (3d Cir. 1962).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-14\">The power resides in the Congress to define the jurisdiction of federal courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of federal courts over suits brought by registrants, prior to their induction, to challenge actions of the Selective Service System in section 10(b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) (Supp. III, 1967), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-16\">\u201c *- * * isr0 judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of any registrant by local boards, appeal boards, or the President, except as a defense to a criminal prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>* * * after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction * * *\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">In Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 238, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968), the Court rejected a literal interpretation of section 10(b) ,(3) on the ground, suggested by the Solicitor General, that \u201csuch literalness does violence to the clear mandate\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the section of the Act granting ministerial students exemption from training and service under the Act. <em>Oestereich </em>involved an attack on an administrative procedure challenged as being invalid on its face, in a context where \u201cit was plain on the record and on the face of the Act that an exemption had been granted.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The registrant had had his statutorily mandated exemption taken away through delinquency proceedings because of conduct unrelated to the merits of continuing the exemption, and the Solicitor General had confessed that the use by the Selective Service System of delinquency proceedings for that purpose was error. Since a construction of the Act requiring the registrant to submit to induction before obtaining judicial review would have been unnecessarily harsh under the circumstances, the Court concluded that pre-induction review was not precluded in cases of that type.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\">The Court in <em>Oestereich </em>by way of statutory construction engrafted an exception on the literal terms of section 10(b) (3) in order to reconcile the clash between explicit statutory mandates. Observing that entitlement to the claimed exemption was \u201cin no way contested\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by the government, the Court noted that \u201c[w]e would have a somewhat different problem were the contest over, say, the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a Board\u2019s classification.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This ease does not involve a clearly mandated defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>ment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that has been taken away by improper means. Registrant claims that the local board should have given him a III-A deferment because of the extreme hardship <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that would result to his divorced wife and child, as well as to his present wife, were he inducted. The right to this deferment, like the right to the conscientious objector exemption involved in Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968), is not an unconditional right, but rather is dependent on local board action which, \u201cinescapably involves a determination of fact and an exercise of judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Here, there is no doubt that the local board had the authority to change registrant\u2019s classification,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and registrant does not challenge the legality of the procedure by which the change was effectuated. This situation is thus very similar to that in Clark v. Gabriel, where pre-induction review was held unavailable, the Court noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-5\">Here the Board has exercised its statutory discretion to pass on a particular request for classification, \u201cevaluating evidence and * * * determining whether a claimed exemption is deserved.\u201d Oestereieh v. Selective Service Bd., supra, at 238, 89 S. Ct., at 416. A Local Board must make such a decision in respect of each of the many classification claims presented to it. To allow pre-induction judicial review of such determinations would be to permit precisely the kind of \u201clitigious interruptions of procedures to provide necessary military manpower\u201d (113 Cong.Rec. 15426 (report by Senator Russell on Conference Committee action)) which Congress sought to prevent when it enacted \u00a7 10(b) (3). 393 U.S. at 258-259, 89 S. Ct. at 426.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1145-12\">Thus we conclude that this complaint does not present a clash between clear mandates of the Act, and that further judicial erosion of the literalness of section 10(b) (3) is therefore unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-14\"> The registrant alleges that the Local Board unlawfully refused to reopen his classification after he had received an induction order, and thereby unlawfully denied him the right to appeal that would follow a reopening.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The regulation governing reopening after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>receipt of an induction order provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1146-4\">\u201c1625.2 When Registrant\u2019s Classification May Be Reopened and Considered Anew. \u2014 The local board may reopen and consider anew the classification of a registrant (a) upon the written request of the registrant, * * * any person who claims to be a dependent of the registrant * * * if such request is accompanied by written information presenting facts not considered when the registrant was classified, which, if true, would justify a change in the registrant\u2019s classification ; * * * provided * * * the classification of a registrant shall not be reopened after the local board has mailed to such registrant an Order to Report for Induction * * * unless the local board first specifically finds there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\"><em>See </em>Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (opinion of 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">While it is not clear that a regulation promulgated by the President, on a subject not even mentioned in the Act, can so conflict with the Congressional mandate in section 10(b) (3) as to require a construction of section 10(b) (3) that would permit pre-induction judicial review, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has so held in Shea v. Mitchell, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 227, 421 F.2d 1162 (1970). Assuming, without deciding, that this court would accept the reasoning of <em>Shea</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a different result is not called for in this case. Unlike the statutorily mandated exemption in <em>Oestereieh, </em>and the statutorily mandated deferment in Breen v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 396 U.S. 460, 90 S.Ct. 661, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970), reopening after an induction order has been mailed is not a clear legal right. To the contrary, this court\u2019s decision in Clark v. Volatile, 427 F.2d 7 (3d Cir. 1970), emphasizes that, in view of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2, reopening after an induction order has been mailed is not required, indeed, is not permissible, until the Local Board specifically finds that there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We do not believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>right to reopening after an induction order has been mailed, the existence of which is contingent upon the resolution of factual issues by the Local Board, presents such a clash with Section 10(b) (3) as to require a construction of Section 10(b) (3) that would permit pre-induction review on this record.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Rather, this record<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> presents a situation similar to that in Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968), where the Court held that Section 10(b) (3) barred pre-induction review. Like the registrant in <em>Gabriel, </em>this registrant was not \u201cunconditionally\u201d entitled to have his classification reopened. And, as in <em>Gabriel, </em>\u201cthere is no doubt of the Board\u2019s statutory authority to take action which [the registrant] challenges, and that action inescapably involves a determination of fact and an exercise of judgment.\u201d <em>See also </em>Boyd v. Clark, 393 U.S. 316, 89 S.Ct. 553, 21 L.Ed.2d 511 (1969). This conclusion is consistent with the observation of this court in Bucher v. Selective Service System, 421 F.2d 24 (3d Cir. 1970), that \u201c[section 10(b) (3)] bars judicial review only where there is a challenge to the System\u2019s resolution of factual questions in the classification or processing of a draft registrant.\u201d 421 F.2d at 27. Three other circuits have indicated their adoption of the result we reach here. Edwards v. Selective Service Local Board No. 111, 432 F.2d 287 (5th Cir. 1970); Bookout v. Thomas, 430 F.2d 1343 (9th Cir. 1970); Evans v. Local Board No. 73, 425 F.2d 323 (10th Cir. 1970); Sloan v. Local Board No. 1, 414 F.2d 125 (10th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">Because the registrant in Hunt v. Local Board No. 197, 438 F.2d 1128, No. 18,076 (3d Cir., filed Feb. 5, 1971), had not received an induction order when he requested reclassification from the local board on the basis of changed conditions, the holding in <em>Hunt </em>is inapplicable to the facts presented by this record. Also, in <em>Hunt, </em>as in <em>Oestereich, </em>the parties conceded that the registrant was entitled to a classification that would render him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>ineligible for induction, and there is no such concession in this case. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">The order to report for induction was mailed September 24, 1969. The registrant does not allege that it was ever specifically cancelled by the Local Board, but instead alleges that he was granted several postponements of the date to report for induction. The date on which the registrant was finally ordered to report for induction was March 4, 1970. The new random selection method of determining the order of selection of registrants became effective on December 1, 1969. The registrant seeks pre-induction review of his claim that the Local Board unlawfully refused to accord him the random selection procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that Section 10(b) (3) does not bar pre-induction judicial review in cases where there is a conflict between that section and rights to procedures mandated by regulations or executive orders, this record does not establish that the regulation<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and executive order<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> creating the random selection method conferred rights to the random selection procedure on the registrant. We have examined the contention of the registrant regarding his entitlement to the random selection method and find it without merit.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">Under the principles stated above, registrant is entitled to have judicial review of the merits of his claim to a III-A deferment, as well as of any denial of procedural fairness by the administrative authorities, after induction or refusal to be inducted by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus or entry of a not guilty plea in a criminal action. <em>See </em>note 10. Furthermore, registrant may apply to the State Director of Selective Service or the Director of Selective Service for a reopening as provided in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">Accordingly, the March 3, 1970, order of the district court dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">.

House Report No. 267, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. at 30-31 (1967), reprinted at 1967 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News p. 1333:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-8\">The Committee was disturbed by the apparent inclination of some courts to review the classification action of local or appeal boards before the registrant had exhausted his administrative remedies. Existing law quite clearly precludes such a judicial review until after a registrant has been ordered to report for induction and has responded either affirmatively or negatively to such order. In view of this inclination of the courts to prematurely inquire into the classification action of local boards, the committee has rewritten this provision of the law so as to more clearly enunciate this principle. The committee was prompted to take this action since continued disregard of this principle of the law by various courts could seriously affect the administration of the Selective Service System.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-9\">B.

The registrant also urges that there was a de facto reopening of his classification after the induction order was issued, and that he was therefore unlawfully deprived of his right to appeal.

The Local Board granted the registrant a \u201cnon-statutory hearing\u201d to hear from him regarding his alleged change in status over which he had no control, which change was a prerequisite to reopening, concluded that he had not demonstrated such a change, and voted unanimously not to reopen his classification. The Supreme Court has recognized that a courtesy interview does not automatically amount to a reopening, Mulloy v.

As noted above at p. 4, the allegations concerning the medical conditions of the registrant and his dependents do not state that they arose after September 24, or even June 18, 1969. <em>See </em>note 23 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">. The reopening regulation (32 C.E.R. \u00a7 1625.2) undoubtedly has the force of law, and the registrant will be able to get judicial review, after his induction or refusal to be inducted, of his claims based on violations of the regulations. <em>See </em>Mulloy v.

The complaint probably should be read as establishing conclusively that registrant was <em>not </em>entitled to have his classification reopened after he received the induction order. Paragraph 18 of the complaint alleges that \u201c[t]he <em>only </em>change in circumstances affecting plaintiff\u2019s status is that he is now remarried and has an additional obligation of support to his present wife.\u201d That change in circumstances occurred in May 1969 (paragraph 5), and the induction order did not issue until September 1969 (paragraph 8). Since we conclude that pre-induction judicial review is not available when a local board, after an induction order has issued, considers evidence and decides that the evidence does not warrant reopening, we have not so treated the complaint. We reiterate the fact that the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1031.5(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">.

The regulations make clear that a postponement of the induction operates only to postpone the reporting date. <em>See </em>United States ex rel. Luster v.

Selective Service System Local Board No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968) and Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968) set forth in Judge Van Dusen's opinion was tacitly rejected by a majority of this court in Hunt v. Local Board No. 197, 438 F.2d 1128, No. 18,076 (3 Cir. 1971). In that case a majority of the court could not agree on an opinion. But as the next to last sentence in Judge Freedman\u2019s plurality opinion makes clear, he intended no more than to decide the case on a narrower ground presented by virtue of an agreement by the parties, at the bar of this court, as to certain facts. I objected in <em>Hunt to </em>the practice of deciding an appeal on a record not considered by the district court. I believed that the case could not be decided on the narrower ground selected by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>Freedman and the judges who concurred in his opinion. The actual disposition of the <em>Hunt </em>case ordered by a majority of the court is consistent with the views expressed in the opinions filed by Judge Hastie and by me. I do not claim that either his opinion or mine is a binding precedent for this case. I do, however, continue to adhere to the interpretation of Section 10(b) (3) of the Selective Service Act which I set forth in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">As authority for the proposition that an appellate court can decide an appeal on a record other than that which was before the district court Judge Van Dusen cites Berkowitz v. Philadelphia Chewing Gum Corp., 303 F.2d 585 (3 Cir. 1962). That case is hardly authority for the action taken here. In <em>Berkowitz </em>the court took judicial notice of the record of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Delaware County, Pennsylvania which raised a question whether the plaintiff in a negligence suit was a guardian ad litem rather than a general guardian. If the latter, and if the guardian plaintiff was a New Jersey resident, there would have been federal diversity jurisdictions. If the former, there would be no diversity. This court did not, as the majority proposes to do, decide the case on matters outside the record. It remanded to the district court for a determination of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">The procedure adopted by the majority here offends due process, for the appellant had every right to assume that this court would review the decision actually made below on a Rule 12(b) motion rather than exercise original jurisdiction on a different record. Rule 10(e), Fed.R. App.P., far from sanctioning what has been done here seems to me, rather, to prohibit it. It contemplates correction of omissions in the record, and the record, as defined in Fed.R.App.P. 10(a) comprises only matters considered by the district court. It is true, as Judge Van Dusen points out, that counsel for appellant attached to his motion for an injunction pending appeal certain exhibits from the Selective Service file. These, however, were never claimed to present a complete picture. The plaintiff was denied a hearing under Rule 65, Red.R.Civ. P., in the district court on jurisdictional grounds. On his motion under Rule 8(a), Fed.R.App.P., he brought before this court some of the evidence which should have been received in the Rule 65 hearing. That course was proper since in applying for an injunction pending appeal appellant must \u201c * * * show the reasons for the relief requested and the facts relied upon, and if the facts are subject to dispute the motion shall be supported by affidavits or other sworn statements or copies thereof.\u201d Rule 8(a), Fed.R.App.P. But the limited record contemplated by the rule governing applications for injunctions pending appeal is not intended to be a substitute for the district court record. The use to which these exhibits have been put by the majority is fundamentally unfair to the litigant, who might have included other exhibits had he known we proposed to exercise original rather than appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">The complaint claims jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1964) (federal questions) and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1964) (mandamus against a federal official). The district court dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b) (1), Fed.R.Civ.P., because it considered Section 10(b) (3) of the Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) (Supp. IV 1969) to deprive it of subject matter jurisdiction. To decide this appeal we should be confined to the pleading on which the district court acted. It alleges that plaintiff, separated from, but supporting a wife and child, not only was entitled to a III-A hardship classification, but actually had such a classification until the Local Board\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>reclassification of June 18, 1969. It alleges that the request for reclassification brought before the Local Board the additional facts of his remarriage, his continued sole support of his former wife and son, and the present medical conditions of two dependents. Certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>these allegations, if true, prima facie establish facts in addition to those considered when the registrant was classified, and which entitle him to a hardship deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">In this case, unlike <em>Hunt, </em>the Local Board did afford the applicant a personal appearance. Plaintiff-appellant contends that this was an actual reopening pursuant to 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.11 (1970), and that such reopening brought into operation 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.13 (1970) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-5\">\u201cEach such classification shall be followed by the same right of appearance before the local board and the same right of appeal as in the case of an original classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">Respondent contends that the personal appearance was a \u201cnon-statutory hearing\u201d and a matter of pure grace. In either event plaintiff was at least foreclosed from the right of administrative appeal which is mandated by the governing statute. If the personal appearance was a hearing upon reopening it was \u201csubject to the right of appeal to the appeal boards herein authorized.\u201d 50 U.S. C.App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) (Supp. IV 1969). If it was not a hearing upon reopening it was, additionally, a denial of procedural due process. Hunt v. Local Board No. 197, <em>supra, </em>and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">\u25a0 Another difference between this case and <em>Hunt </em>is the time when the facts'on which the applicant relies were called to the attention of the Local Board. The plaintiff in <em>Hunt </em>alleged that he gave the board notice of changed circumstances after classification but before receipt of an induction order. Here plaintiff\u2019s application for reclassification took place after the issuance, in September, 1969, of an order to report for induction (SSS Form No. 252) but before the issuance of a different notice to report for induction on or about February 19, 1970. The Local Board\u2019s letter of January 21, 1970, states that plaintiff will be subject to further processing for induction. This indicates that the September order to report for induction was cancelled or postponed, but there is nothing in the record before us which discloses how or why that was done. Judge Van Dusen states that the September 24, 1969 order to report for induction was never specifically cancelled by the Local Board. The complaint does not so allege, and the source of the facts on which he bases this conclusion is not disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">A registrant who has received an order to report for induction bears a heavier burden in obtaining reopening and reclassification than does an applicant who has not yet been ordered up. Not only must he present \u201cwritten information presenting facts not considered when the registrant was classified, which, if true, would justify a change in the registrant\u2019s classification,\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 (1970), but he must convince the Local Board that \u201cthere has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 (1970). Thus the prima facie showing, after any induction order issues, requires three elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">1. information not considered by the board when it made the classification;</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">2. information which would justify a change in classification;</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">3. change in circumstances over which the registrant had no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">If these three requirements are met the board must reopen and afford new appearance and appeal rights \u201cas in the ease of an original classification.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.13 (1970). United States ex rel. Vaccarino v. Officer Of Day, 305 F.Supp. 732 (S.D.N.Y.1969). In the ease of an original classification, and hence in the case of a reopening and reconsideration, there is an automatic stay of an induction order pending an appearance before a Local Board, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1624.3 (1970), and pending administrative appeal, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.41 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-15\">As pointed out hereinabove, the present record does not disclose how or why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>the September order for induction was cancelled or postponed. Induction was postponed, however, and this fact considered with the regulations on reopening, and automatic stay of induction orders, lends substance to plaintiff\u2019s contention that the Local Board actually reopened his classification. No regulations other than those referred to provide for stay of an order for induction, and those referred to would come into operation in plaintiff\u2019s situation only if 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.13 (1970) came into operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">In any event, an application for reconsideration made after an order for induction is treated, procedurally, in the same manner as one made before such an order. Substantively, however, the applicant must make the additional showing of change in circumstances beyond his control. Thus, if we assume the September induction order remained in effect, the only difference between this case and <em>Hunt </em>is the necessity for such an allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Reading the complaint with the liberality required when reviewing an order dismissing for want of jurisdiction, it sufficiently alleges all three required elements. It alleges that plaintiff gave the board notice of remarriage, of continued support of the first wife and child, and of health conditions about which it had no prior information. Certainly the illness of the registrant\u2019s wife and former wife were circumstances over which he had no control. The complaint could, perhaps, have been more specific about the nature and seriousness of these illnesses, but on a motion to dismiss it was clearly sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">The majority rely, in affirming the dismissal, on the fact that the illnesses began prior to the September induction order. Conceding that the registrant has no control over the health of his wife or former wife, the majority say that the complaint fails to allege that their health changed for the worse after receipt of the September induction order. If they were ill both before and after the receipt of the order the registrant would not be entitled to reopening. If they became ill after receipt of the order reopening would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">To put in context the gross unfairness of such a distinction consider these allegations, which as the case is presented here must be accepted as true. The registrant on September 13,1967, was classified III-A. On June 11, 1969, the Local Board requested him to appear for a personal appearance on June 18, 1969. Because he was in transit from New Jersey to Ari2iona when the June 11,1969 letter was mailed he did not receive it until after June 18, 1969. The Local Board ex parte reclassified him I-A. Without the benefit of a personal appearance or opportunity to submit documentation in support of his request for a III-A classification, he appealed this reclassification. On September 8, 1969, his appeal was denied and on September 24, 1969, the induction order issued. After the September induction order issued, and with legal advice for the first time, he submitted new information which the Local Board considered at a personal appearance. When, following this personal appearance, he was continued in class I-A he attempted to appeal again, but was told that he had no further rights and would be subject to call at the next induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">If the Local Board had rescheduled a personal appearance rather than <em>ex parte </em>reclassifying from III-A to I-A, the health circumstances would have been called to the board\u2019s attention before the issuance of the September induction order, and the distinction relied upon by the majority would have been unavailable. I cannot imagine that 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 was intended to produce so patently arbitrary a result. The registrant was in circumstances entitling him to a hardship deferment before the Local Board reclassified him I-A. Now, say the majority, the fact that the hardship antedated the resulting induction order is the reason for refusing to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">Assuming that the induction order which triggered applicability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>\u201cchange in circumstances beyond his control\u201d requirement was the September order, I would hold that any illness not previously called to the attention of the Local Board was a change in circumstances beyond the registrant\u2019s control for purposes of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. On this record, however, such a decision may not even be proper, since the applicable induction order for purposes of \u00a7 1625.2 may be the February, 1970, order. In that event the \u201cbeyond his control\u201d requirement would not be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">The difficulty as to the applicable order for purposes of \u00a7 1625.2 underscores the impropriety of appellate courts deciding appeals on procedural bases different from those of the district court. The district court obviously took a much narrower view of its jurisdiction than did any of the judges who comprised the majority in Hunt v. Local Board No. 197, <em>supra. </em>Indeed its interpretation of \u00a7 10 (b) (3) was narrower than that of the majority in this case. It dismissed not because it found that the Local Board acted properly but because it thought there was no jurisdiction to hear the matter. The majority affirms because the Local Board acted properly in refusing to reopen, on a record which does not even contain the complete Selective Service file.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">I also take issue with the majority holding in Part III of the opinion, \u201cWe have examined the contention of the registrant regarding his entitlement to the random selection method and find it without merit.\u201d The district court never considered this issue, and if, as in the other parts of the opinion it so strenuously urged, we lack jurisdiction, why should that issue be reached and decided on appeal? The approach on jurisdiction seems to be \u201cheads the Selective Service System wins, tails the registrant loses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">I would reverse and remand to the district court for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
