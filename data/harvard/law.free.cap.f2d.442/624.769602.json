Petitioner was offered assistance of counsel in open court and refused such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-24\">2. More than six years intervened between his plea of guilty and sentencing [and the filing of his petition for habeas corpus in the state court], yet petitioner did not attempt to withdraw his guilty plea or seek counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-25\">3. The record affirmatively shows that the petitioner told the judge that he fully understood the consequences and possible sentence that might be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-26\">4. During the week before the six-year sentence was imposed the same defendant plead guilty to an armed robbery charge in an adjoining parish. There, he was represented by appointed counsel. This is evidence sufficient to show that he knew of his right to have counsel and knew of his right that counsel would be furnished to him without charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-27\">We find no clear error in the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, and agree that the files and records refute appellant\u2019s contention that his waiver of counsel was invalid. <em>See </em>Lujan v. United States, 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-28\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
