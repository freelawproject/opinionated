Judge Bonsai\u2019s order also designated the firm of Kaufman, Taylor, Kimmel &amp; Miller as \u201clead counsel for all the plaintiffs in the consolidated action\u201d and directed that \u201call pleadings, papers and notices of any kind, nature or description to be served hereafter by or upon defendants * * * shall be issued by or served hereafter by or upon defendants * * * shall be issued by or served upon said lead counsel * * Judge Bonsai\u2019s order further specified that \u201cthe trial of the consolidated action shall be conducted on behalf of the plaintiffs by lead counsel, with leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>counsel for other plaintiffs to participate to such degree as the Court at the time of trial may determine * *</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">On November 23, 1970, Norman An-nenberg, Esq., attorney for appellants here, moved for summary judgment, before Judge Croake, after lead counsel had rejected Annenberg\u2019s request to make such a motion on the ground that Annenberg\u2019s proposed strategy would interfere with Kaufman\u2019s orderly presentation of the case on behalf of all the shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">On December 16, 1970, Judge Croake ruled, pursuant to Judge Bonsai\u2019s order appointing Kaufman as lead counsel, that he would not entertain Annenberg\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Perco-dani v. Riker-Maxson Corp., D.C., 51 F.R.D. 263. He further \u201crestrained and prohibited\u201d Annenberg \u201cfrom taking any further action in violation of the order by Judge Bonsai, including the making of motions or service of process where such action would violate the aforementioned order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Appellants contend that the quoted language, enjoining Annenberg from acting inconsistently with Judge Bonsai\u2019s order of consolidation, is too vague and oversteps the bounds of the court\u2019s admittedly broad discretion in supervising and administering this complicated action with its obvious potential for confusion and delay. Appellants rely primarily on certain language in MacAlister v. Guterma, 263 F.2d 65 (2d Cir. 1958), where we described the salutary and indeed essential functions performed by lead counsel such as the Kaufman firm here, in supervising and coordinating the conduct of a consolidated or class action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But we did not intend to intimate in <em>MacAlister </em>that each individual plaintiff and lawyer must be permitted to do what he pleases in litigation as complex as this, and can behave in total disregard of the interest of other litigants and of the class, nor that the district judge lacked the power to direct otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">We do not interpret Judge Bonsai\u2019s order as barring Annenberg from applying to the district court for permission to make a motion in this action. Thus, we find no justification for Annenberg\u2019s apparent view that Judge Croake\u2019s order, which simply requires compliance with Judge Bonsai\u2019s order, bars him from even requesting the Judge for an opportunity to participate in the case. Of course, since the Kaufman firm has been, designated as lead counsel, an attempt by Annenberg to by-pass Kaufman or to participate directly in the case without first requesting Kaufman to take the action Annenberg suggests, or if Kaufman refuses to take such action, first securing the permission of the court to proceed directly, would violate both Judge Bonsai\u2019s order of consolidation and Judge Croake\u2019s order of December 16. As we thus interpret these orders, we do not find it inconsistent with the proper function of a lead counsel, nor does it deny appellants an appropriate opportunity to participate in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">We note the desirability in a \u201clong and complicated\u201d case such as this, for assignment of a single district judge to preside for all purposes over the future course of this action and we suggest that such action be taken promptly.

We have jurisdiction over this action as an appeal from a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d 28 U.S.O. \u00a7 1291, under the \u201ccollateral order\u201d doctrine enunciated in the lead case of Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). See MacAlister v. Guterma, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
