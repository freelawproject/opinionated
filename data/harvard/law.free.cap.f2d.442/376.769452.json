United States, 58 Cust.Ct. 329, C.D. 2978 (1967), has led us to conclude that the lower court\u2019s decision was correct and its judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We agree in particular with the findings of the Customs Court that the involved machines embody a function which bears an essential resemblance to and is a technological advancement over the basic process of lithography, and with its holding that the rationale of our decision in Lanston Industries, Inc. v. United States, 49 CCPA 123, C.A.D. 807 (1962) thus requires that these machines be treated for tariff purposes as coming under the eo nomine provision designed to cover machines which carry out that process. The function of the lithographing process involves the setting of type by means of photo-composing on sensitized material. Since lithography was in existence on the date of enactment of the 1930 Act and clearly had to be included within the duty-free provision for \u201call typesetting machines\u201d in 1(1643 of that act and since the involved machines \u201care used by the same trade, the same people, and for substantially the same purpose, <em>viz., </em>the production of printing plates\u201d, it follows that they should also be entitled to classification under the provisions of that paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-22\">. 63 Cust.Ct. 230, C.D. 3901, 327 F.Supp. 556 (1969). Familiarity -with the lower court\u2019s opinion is presumed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
