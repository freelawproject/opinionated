The district court ruled on its own motion that the suit could not be maintained, because, as consumers, as opposed to commercial plaintiffs, appellants lacked standing to sue under \u00a7 43(a). Without the benefit of any opposition on appeal to appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s able brief, which sets forth the issues with beguiling simplicity, for the reasons stated below we nevertheless affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">The two appellants, parochial school children, by their parents and next friends, brought this suit on behalf of themselves and as members of two classes: (1) 153 students of the Sacred Heart Academy of Hempstead, New York, who allegedly were deceived and damaged by \u201cdefendants\u2019 use of false descriptions and representations of the nature, sponsorship, and licensing of their interstate ski tour service\u201d; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) all high school students within the New York metropolitan area who are likely to be deceived and thereby injured by defendants\u2019 similarly deceptive practices in the future. The factual substance of the complaint is summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">Appellants and their 151 classmates prepaid defendant Activities Club of New York, Inc. (the Club), $44.75 per person as the full price for a ski tour to Great Barrington, Massachusetts to be conducted during the weekend of January 24, 1970, in reliance upon the Club\u2019s representations that: each child would be provided with adequate ski equipment and qualified instruction; safe, reliable and properly certified transportation would be provided between New York and Great Barrington; and all meal costs would be included in the prepaid tour price.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These representations were conveyed by means of flyers, allegedly deceptively similar to those of National Ski Tours, a well known and reputable ski service, and by means of other written and oral communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">The ski weekend began as represented but was cut short and proved otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>unsatisfactory by the following developments, which for purposes of reviewing the dismissal of a complaint we assume to be true: only 88 pairs of skis and boots were provided for the 153 children; only one \u201cqualified\u201d ski instructor was provided, who because of the equipment shortage spent all of Saturday morning fitting the children with such skis and boots as were available; the other \u201cinstructors\u201d were high school and college students whose agreements with defendants provided for only a few hours of instruction per day; one of the buses broke down on a country road en route to Great Barrington, stranding 40 children and two chaperones in the middle of the night; another bus had faulty brakes and only one headlight and was ticketed by the Massachusetts police; another bus en route back to New York poured exhaust fumes into its interior; one of the bus drivers was intoxicated and therefore unable to drive his bus on the return trip to New York; neither the buses nor the Club were licensed or certified by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and one busload of children was required to pay an unrefunded total of |71.75 for an extra meal in Great Barrington due to unsafe bus transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">In seeking redress of this apparently misfortune-strewn ski weekend brought about by the Club\u2019s misrepresentations, appellants have sought to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, rather than turning to traditionally available state court forums and remedies and have appended their state common law claims by way of invoking the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. Seemingly unable to bring themselves within other federal statutes specially conferring federal court jurisdiction, and additionally unable to meet the minimum monetary requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, appellants imaginatively have brought this action pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 43(a) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">The issue of consumer standing to sue under \u00a7 43(a) is one of first impression for this and apparently any federal court. In concluding that it lacked jurisdiction, the district court below relied on Marshall v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which in turn relied without discussion on this court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>opinion in the first reported \u00a7 43(a) case, Carpenter v. Erie R. Co.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because both these cases are clearly distinguishable from the issue at bar,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and therefore not conclusive authority for the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>court\u2019s position, we find it necessary to explore in detail whether there is any basis for appellants\u2019 standing to sue under \u00a7\u00a739 and 43(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">SECTION 43(a) AND \u201cPLAIN MEANING\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Appellants\u2019 principal contention is that the language of \u00a7 43(a), specifically the term \u201cany person,\u201d is so unambiguous as to admit of no other construction than that of permitting consumers the right to sue under its aegis. On the face of the complaint all the prerequisites of \u00a7 43(a) seem to be met: (1) defendants are persons (2) who used false descriptions and misrepresentations (3) in connection with goods and services, (4) which defendants caused to enter commerce; (5) appellants are also persons (6) who believe themselves to have been in fact damaged by defendants\u2019 misdescriptions and misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">Viewing the terms of \u00a7 43(a) in isolation there do not appear to be any vague words or inconsistent phrases which might permit any other inference than that which appellants would have us <em>draw </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that \u201cany person\u201d means exactly what it says.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is further suggested that if Congress had desired, it could and would have limited or narrowed the class of protected plaintiffs to commercial parties merely by saying so. We reject this line of maxims of statutory construction in favor of Judge Learned Hand\u2019s more practical instruction that \u201c[w]ords are not pebbles in alien juxtaposition,\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and therefore turn first to \u00a7 43(a)\u2019s legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">We agree with appellants that \u201c[t]he Lanham Act of 1946 has a very long and convoluted legislative history,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>with respect to \u00a7 43(a) we find to be inconclusive and therefore of little or no help in resolving the issue decided today. We are cited by counsel to certain statements, actions and inactions and are asked to make certain causal connections among them and then to draw a set of preferred inferences therefrom. Counsel lay stress, for example, on the following statement made before a joint congressional committee in 1925 by a representative of the U. S. Trademark Association with respect to the language of a bill\u2019s provision, which, in substantially modified form, became \u00a7 43(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">\u201cIt provides that any person who is damaged by the false description may start the suit. Obviously the purchaser might claim that he has been misled and damaged and start suit. At any rate, if it is intended to limit the right to start such a suit, that limitation should be stated.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">None of the committee members or draftsmen of \u00a7 30 of the 1925 bill expressed any disagreement with this statement, and the provision remained unchanged, containing no express limitation barring consumer suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We are asked to conclude from this ancient history that the committee\u2019s silence, followed by its inaction with respect to amending this portion of the bill, must mean that Congress clearly intended to create standing for consumers under the 1946 Act. On this flimsy record, it would be self-serving for us to invoke the doctrine of \u201csilence as acceptance\u201d as a basis upon which to draw any consequential inference with respect to \u00a7 43 (a)'s legislative history.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We believe it more likely that the committee members evidenced no disagreement or agreement with the interpretation given \u00a7 30 by the above-quoted statement because neither was necessary; the committee members probably were sufficiently confident of their own interpretation that they felt that no clarification by way of reply and/or amendment was needed to implement their intention to confer standing solely upon commercial plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">It is also suggested that since the statutory predecessor of \u00a7 43(a), \u00a7 3 of the Trademark Act of 1920,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was addressed solely to the prohibition of false designations of origin and authorized suit only by persons, corporations, etc., <em>\u201cdoing business </em>in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin [emphasis <em>supplied],\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and since this type of language was preserved in several early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>drafts of what became \u00a7 43(a) <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but was ultimately dropped by the A.B.A. Trade-Mark Committee in favor of a provision permitting suit by \u201cany person, firm or corporation who is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any false description or representation,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we should conclude that the A.B.A. rejection of the earlier colorably restrictive language and the congressional acceptance of the colorably broader A.B.A. language \u201cclearly indicates an intent [attributable to Congress] <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> not to restrict the provision to actions by businessmen and tradesmen,\u201d and \u201ca [congressional] concern to expand the class and type of person authorized to sue.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We, on the other hand, construe the deletion of the phrase \u201cin his trade or business\u201d from the earlier A.B.A. drafts to be equally consistent with a clearly expressed congressional purpose<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to create a federal statutory tort of unfair competition <em>sui generis,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>thus rendering the subject phrase to the status of mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">PURPOSE OF \u00a7 43(a) AND PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Appellants urge that under the test of Association of Data Processing Serv. Org. v. Camp,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> they as consumers have standing under the Lanham Act because they have demonstrated injury in fact and that they come within a group \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> by the Act. Although the scope and effects of <em>Data Processing </em>have not yet been clearly delimited,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we hold that that case does not bring these appellants under its protective wing.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">The congressional statement of purpose of the Act<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> is contained in \u00a7 45,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> which in pertinent part states: \u201cThe intent of this chapter * * * is to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition.\u201d In this, the only phrase referring to the class of persons to be protected by the Act, as defined by their conduct and the source of the injuries sought to be protected against, no mention at all is made of the \u201cpublic\u201d or of \u201cconsumers.\u201d The legislative history of the Act, such as it is, adds nothing. We do know to a reasonable certainty, however, that the consumer protection explosion and the wholesale displacement (though not preemption) of traditional state statutory and common law remedies \u2014 matters pregnant with manifold consequences of great importance \u2014 -were never considered or foreseen by Congress prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the enactment of \u00a7 43(a). We conclude, therefore, that Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting \u00a7 43(a) was to create a special and limited unfair competition remedy, virtually without regard for the interests of consumers generally<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and almost certainly without any consideration of consumer rights of action in particular. The Act\u2019s purpose, as defined in \u00a7 45, is exclusively to protect the interests of a purely commercial class against unscrupulous commercial conduct.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">This view is supported by the leading case of L\u2019Aiglon Apparel v. Lana Lobell, Inc.,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> which, while expanding the statutorily protected class by giving an expansionary reading to the substantive content of \u00a7 43(a), still limited the protected class to commercial, though not necessarily competitive,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> plaintiffs.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Although admittedly the <em>L\u2019Aiglon </em>court was not presented with the question of consumer standing under \u00a7 43(a), we deem the court\u2019s opinion in context to set the outer limits of the class of \u00a7 43(a) plaintiffs contemplated by Congress. As the court noted, although \u00a7 43(a) was intended to create a federal unfair competition count, since \u201cthe Lanham Act was not intended to bring all unfair competition in commerce within federal jurisdiction,\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> it was intended to be a special, limited one covering only those cases in which false description and/or false designation of origin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>are alleged.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Since Congress deliberately excluded from coverage virtually all categories of unfair competition but for false advertising, it could not have intended to create a whole new body of substantive law completely outside the substantive scope of unfair competition. Yet this is what appellants would have us find, under the guise of granting them standing, for the question of consumer standing and that of the creation of wholly new federal common law of consumer protection under \u00a7 43(a) cannot be disentwined.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Moreover, consumers\u2019 use of \u00a7 39 of the Act, which requires the allegation of neither a minimum monetary amount in controversy nor diverse citizenship, in combination with the expansive jurisdictional delineation given the phrase \u201cin commerce,\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and the procedural advantages of bringing suit in federal court, would lead to a veritable flood of claims brought in already overtaxed federal district courts, while adequate private remedies for consumer protection, which to date have been left almost exclusively to the States, are readily at . hand. Great strides are now being made in this area to expand the already numerous remedies available in state courts,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and this court has no desire to interfere with that process by an unprecedented interpretation of longstanding federal law.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-20\">One of appellants\u2019 arguments favoring a literal interpretation of \u201cany person\u201d is that \u201c[h]ad Congress desired to limit actions under section 43(a) to those brought by competitors or by commercial concerns generally, it could and would have so provided.\u201d Our analysis requires that the manner in which this issue be posed is precisely the reverse: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>had Congress contemplated so revolutionary a departure implicit in appellants\u2019 claims, its intention could and would have been clearly expressed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Section 43(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">\u201cAny person who shall affix, apply or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any container or containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter commerce, and any person who shall with knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin or description or representation cause or procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be transported or used shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by use of any such false description or representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-18\">.

Finally, Car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>penter, suing for \u201cmisrepresentation of services\u201d in his capacity as an injured former employee of the Erie Railroad, seems to have been a rather litigious person; by the time he raised the \u00a7 43 (a) claim, the court had grown somewhat impatient with Carpenter\u2019s reassertion of previously barred claims, which the court said \u201ccan never justify a recovery.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">.

In effect it says: you may not conduct your business in a way that unnecessarily or unfairly interferes with and injures that of another; you may not destroy the basis of genuine competition by destroying the buyer\u2019s opportunity to judge fairly between rival commodities by introducing such factors as false descriptive trademarks which are capable of misinforming as to the true qualities of the competitive products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">Although the language of the <em>Gold Seal </em>court would seem to permit the interpretation suggested by appellants, it seems very clearly the other way when read in the light of Judge Frank\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Smidler.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b750-16\">. 214 F.2d 649, 651 (3d Cir. 1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b750-17\">.

State authorities have been far from lethargic in responding to the current consumer protection explosion.

Section 3(a) of the Uniform Act has been construed unofficially to confer standing on defrauded consumers seeking injunctive relief (no money damages are provided) although the Uniform Act \u201coriginated as an effort to reform the law of business torts, not consumer torts.\u201d See Dole, Consumer Class Actions Under the Uniform Deceptive Practices Act, 1968 Duke L.J. 1101, 1107, 1109.

Chief Judge Clark in his concurring opinion in the <em>California Apparel </em>case stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-18\">\u201cSo far as the consumer is concerned, he is not dependent upon the private remedial actions brought by competitors for the remedies under the Federal Trade Commission Act * * * are now extensive * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-25\">162 F.2d 896; <em>accord, </em>1 R.
