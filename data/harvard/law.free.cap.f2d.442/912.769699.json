Appellant was granted leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and we assigned counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">We reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-19\">Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint alleges that in \u201cJuly of 1965, or thereabouts,\u201d while he was incarcerated in Auburn State Prison in Auburn, New York, he was summoned to a disciplinary hearing before J. T. Deegan, described as the \u201cprincipal keeper\u201d of the prison. Specifically, appellant charges that as he was being escorted back to his cell by two other prison officials after his meeting with Deegan, these two officials assaulted him without provocation. He alleges that when he attempted to defend himself, Deegan joined the fray and these three \u201cbeat, kicked and otherwise severely thrashed\u201d him. Deegan then struck him in the back with a sharp instrument, inflicting a wound at least two or three inches in length. Appellant alleges that he was removed for an unspecified period of time to a \u201cdark cell\u201d and that he \u201cdid not receive any medical attention until the following day, when several stitches were applied to close the wound.\u201d Appellant requests \u201cequitable relief of some sort,\u201d which can properly be taken as a demand for money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-21\">Citing Swan v. Board of Higher Education, 319 F.2d 56 (2d Cir. 1963), for the proposition that the applicable statute of limitations for a suit brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>under the Civil Rights Act is that which the state courts would enforce in a comparable state action, the district court correctly ruled that the timeliness of appellant\u2019s complaint was governed by the three-year period of limitations prescribed by New York CPLR \u00a7 214(2) (McKinney\u2019s 1963) for \u201can action to recover upon a liability * * * created or imposed by statute * * See <em>id.; </em>Romer v. Leary, 425 F.2d 186 (2d Cir. Apr. 10, 1970). Accordingly the court held that since appellant\u2019s cause of action arose in July, 1965 but the complaint was not filed until more than three years later, in August, 1969, his suit was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Appellant claims that the district court erred in failing to consider the tolling provisions of New York CPLR \u00a7 208 (McKinney\u2019s 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">CPLR \u00a7 208 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">\u201cIf a person entitled to commence an action is, at the time the cause of action accrues * * * imprisoned on a criminal charge or conviction for a term less than for life, and the time otherwise limited for commencing the action is three years or more * * * the time within which the action must be commenced shall be extended to three years after the disability ceases * * \u2022&gt;:\u2022_ The time within which the action must be commenced shall not be extended by this provision beyond ten years after the cause of action accrues * -X- * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">The State attempts to avoid the literal applicability of this tolling statute by urging that it was intended to apply only where New York law prevents an imprisoned felon from bringing suit. See New York Civil Rights Law \u00a7 79 (McKinney\u2019s Supp. 1969-70). The State argues that since New York\u2019s \u201ccivil death\u201d law does not disable a state prisoner from bringing suit under the Civil Rights Act, CPLR \u00a7 208 may not be applied to toll the period of limitations otherwise applicable to appellant\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">It would appear, however, that CPLR \u00a7 208 was motivated at least in part by a recognition of the practical, as well as the legal, difficulties prisoners face in instituting and prosecuting suits. The advisory committee report preceding the enactment of CPLR \u00a7 214 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-12\">\u201cThe provisions for extension because of the existence of the stated disabilities present controversial policy questions, but the committee concluded that no change should presently be made in the grounds for extension. * * * As to a person imprisoned, legal capacity to sue, if it exists, is only a theoretical right. Litigants have difficulty enough, though they be at large, tracking down their obligors and determining the nature of the liability and where, when and whether to sue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">Second Preliminary Report of the Advisory Comm, on Practice and Procedure, New York State Legislative Document No. 13, at 58 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">Thus it would seem that CPLR \u00a7 208 was intended to apply even where a prisoner has the legal capacity to sue. This interpretation is supported by the requirement that suit be brought no later than ten years after the cause of action accrues. If CPLR \u00a7 208 applied only where a prisoner lacked actual legal capacity to sue, an individual remaining in prison for more than ten years after his cause of action arose would be completely without remedy. Far from suggesting such a result, the advisory committee report expresses the view that \u201cThis maximum period provides ample time to protect the rights of prisoners <em>* </em>* Second Preliminary Report, <em>supra </em>at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">We conclude that the district court erred in failing to apply the tolling provisions of CPLR \u00a7 208, and that appellant\u2019s suit was not time barred. See Moviecolor Ltd. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 288 F.2d 80, 83 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 821, 82 S.Ct. 39, 7 L.Ed.2d 26 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>in.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-3\">Since this case appears to us to be governed by the result reached in Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (1971), we reverse the determination of the district court and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-22\">. Appellant was convicted in Supreme Court, New York County, upon a plea of guilty of robbery in the third degree and was sentenced on October 9, 1962 to a term of from 3% to 7 years\u2019 imprisonment. Subsequently, on January 16, 1963, appellant was convicted, after a jury trial in Supreme Court, Bronx County, of assault in the second degree and was sentenced to a term of from 2% to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment. These sentences were made to run consecutively, and accordingly appellant has a current maximum release date of May 27, 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
