The trial court entered an order denying the petition and refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing. We reverse with directions to the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Hunter was charged with first degree murder in an amended information filed in the Circuit Court of Andrew County, Missouri on March 10, 1969. He pleaded not guilty and was convicted after a trial to a jury on May 1, 1969. After his <em>motion for new </em>trial was overruled, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. State v. Hunter, 456 S.W.2d 314 (Mo.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">At Hunter\u2019s trial there was no direct evidence linking him to the killing except his confession. The only issue briefed and argued before the Supreme Court of Missouri was the admissibility of the confession. At his trial and on appeal, Hunter claimed that it was not voluntary in that it was induced by repeated and protracted custodial interrogation without counsel and by false promises of the police that he would receive help and a reduced charge for his cooperation. Hunter also claimed the confession should not have been received in evidence because his constitutional right to counsel was not knowingly and intelligently waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The murder occurred on June 16, 1968. On June 18, 1968, Hunter was interrogated by Sgt. Rhoades of the Missouri Highway Patrol and released. He was again interrogated later the same day by Sgt. Rhoades and Sgt. Shirley, by the prosecutor, Mr. Lance, and by other law enforcement officials. He was interrogated further on June 19 or 20 by Sgt. Shirley. On July 15, Hunter was again questioned while in custody of the police in Atchison, Kansas by Sgt. Shirley and another trooper. The interrogation was continued on July 16 and at that time there was some discussion initiated by Hunter about making a deal for a lesser charge and getting the Kansas charges dropped in return for Hunter\u2019s cooperation. Sgt. Shirley agreed to convey this suggestion to Mr. Lance, the prosecutor. He also told Hunter that another individual made a partial statement about the murder implicating Hunter. Hunter made oral statements at the time indicating some knowledge of the murder but denied having been at the murder scene and declined to make a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">On August 5, 1968, Sgt. Shirley and Sgt. Rhoades, together with a court reporter, Mrs. Sowards, visited Hunter in jail in Atchison, Kansas. This contact was the result of a message to Sgt. Shirley from a friend of Hunter conveying Hunter\u2019s request to talk to Sgt. Shirley again. At that time, Hunter gave a confession to Sgt. Shirley and Sgt. Rhoades which was transcribed by Mrs. Sowards and signed and initialed by Hunter. Prior to signing the confession, Hunter was formally advised of his rights by Sgt. Rhoades from a card which he carried with the standard questions and warnings printed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">These facts are not seriously in dispute. The disputed point is whether or not on August 5, 1968, immediately prior to the confession of Hunter, Sgt. Shirley promised or implied that the prosecutor, Mr. Lance, was willing to consider a reduced charge in return for Hunter\u2019s cooperation in the form of the signed confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The Supreme Court of Missouri commented on that question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">\u201cThere is the further significant fact, which we find from the evidence, that there was no discussion of the so-called \u2018deal\u2019 on the 5th of August when Hunter was finally ready to give his confession. If in fact there had been such an understanding Hunter, who in his testimony showed that he knew there was such a thing as a written guarantee of immunity, would doubtless have insisted upon at least an oral confirmation of the deal before signing away his rights and confessing his crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">State v. Hunter, <em>supra, </em>456 S.W.2d at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The United States District Court in its order denying the writ of habeas corpus made a similar finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Prior to Hunter\u2019s original trial, his attorney filed a motion to suppress the confession. The state trial court (Judge Yeaman) on March 11, 1969 held a hearing on that motion at which hearing Hunter, Sgt. Shirley, and Sgt. Rhoades testified. The motion to suppress was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">At the trial of the murder ease in state circuit court, the Court (Judge Schoenlaub) held a hearing on the vol-untariness of the confession outside the hearing of the jury. During this hearing Hunter and Mrs. Sowards testified, and Sgt. Shirley\u2019s testimony given at the hearing on the motion to suppress was received in evidence by stipulation of the parties. Sgt. Rhoades did not testify at this hearing and his earlier testimony was not received in evidence at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-19\">After the Court had determined that the confession was voluntary and could be received in evidence, the jury returned and the trial continued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8</p>\n<p id=\"b685-20\">Sgt. Shirley then testified eqncerning the circumstances surrounding the confession. Mrs. Sowards also testified to the effect that on August 5, 1968 she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>was not in the interrogation room at all times, but she did not hear either Sgt. Rhoades or Sgt. Shirley make any promise or convey .any message from the prosecuting attorney, Mr. Lance, to Hunter relating to possible reduction of ' the charges. Again Sgt. Rhoades did not testify and his testimony from the hearing on the motion to suppress was not received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The testimony of Sgt. Rhoades which was not presented except at the March 11, 1969 hearing on the motion to suppress was significant in two ways: First, Sgt. Rhoades testified he had not been present when Sgt. Shirley interrogated Hunter on July 15 and 16, so it is obvious that if he heard any communication from Sgt. Shirley to Hunter purporting to convey a message from the prosecutor, it had to be on August 5, 1968. Secondly, his testimony is clear that on August 5, 1968 he overheard Sgt. Shirley tell Hunter immediately prior to obtaining Hunter\u2019s confession something \u201csimilar to \u2018Mr. Lance said it\u2019s possible.\u2019 \u201d Rhoades also testified that he thought Sgt. Shirley meant by this that \u201c[i]f Bert Hunter were to give a statement where he would be testifying against Carl Paxton as to Mr. Lyle\u2019s death, then there might be some leniency shown to Bert Hunter by the prosecuting attorney.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-19\">A study of the transcript of the test-mony at the March 11, 1969 hearing and the testimony at the trial convinces this Court that the conclusions reached by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the Supreme Court of Missouri on the appeal and by the United States District Court in this habeas corpus proceedings were based, at least in part, upon an incorrect determination that the interrogation of Hunter on August 5, 1968 prior to his confession, did not include any discussion of a possible \u201cdeal\u201d on the requested reduction of the charge to be filed. Whether a correct determination of this fact would have changed the decision reached by either court is not known, but Hunter claims that he is entitled to have this decision made on the basis of a correct factual determination after careful scrutiny of the state court record as a whole and after an eviden-tiary hearing to clarify the facts in dispute; especially since both the Supreme Court of Missouri and the Federal District Court for the Western District of Missouri placed some emphasis on the timing of the conversations relating to the possibility of reduced charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">I. EXHAUSTION OF STATE REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The contentions raised by Hunter in this habeas corpus action are substantially the same as those raised on his appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri. Therefore, for the purpose of this action, Hunter has exhausted his state remedies even though he has not complied with state post conviction procedures under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.26, V.A.M.R. This Court held in Edwards v. Swenson, 429 F.2d 1291, 1293 (8th Cir. 1970) that a Missouri prisoner need not pursue his post conviction remedy under Rule 27.26 where the merits of his contentions had already been determined by the Missouri Supreme Court on direct appeal. See also Connors v. State, 422 F.2d 122, 125 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 954, 90 S.Ct. 1881, 26 L.Ed.2d 297 (1970); Kennedy v. Sigler, 397 F.2d 556, 559 (8th Cir. 1968). Accord, United States ex rel. Adams v. Pate, 418 F.2d 815, 817 (7th Cir. 1969); Smith v. Peyton, 408 F.2d 1009, 1010 (4th Cir. 1968); Whippler v. Balkcom, 342 F.2d 388, 390 (5th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">II. ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING ADMISSIBILITY OF THE CONFESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The Supreme Court of Missouri in State v. Hunter, <em>supra, </em>456 S.W.2d at 316, stated the law of the State of Missouri concerning the admissibility of confessions in that state as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">\u201c[Confessions induced by the influence of hope of leniency, State v. Ball, Mo.Sup., 262 S.W. 1043, hope of clemency, State v. Hart, 292 Mo. 74, 237 S.W. 473, or hope of mitigation of punishment for the crime charged, or of \u2018worldly advantage,\u2019 State v. Williamson, 339 Mo. 1038, 99 S.W.2d 76, are not voluntary and are not admissible in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">In so stating the law, the Missouri Supreme Court did not cite State v. White, 316 Mo. 576, 292 S.W. 411 (1927), a case which presents a fact situation very similar to that of this ease. White, while in jail and charged with murder in the first degree, confessed after the prosecuting attorney had promised him he would recommend minimum punishment and had told him that a co-defendant had confessed. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-12\">\u201cBy all the authorities that confession was not voluntary. The defendant was in jail at the time, and his interview was with the prosecuting attorney and the sheriff \u2014 persons in authority \u2014 and the law presumes that a confession thus induced is involuntary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">State v. White, <em>supra, </em>316 Mo. at 580, 292 S.W. at 412. The distinguishing factor between the <em>White </em>case and that of Hunter is that the alleged promise was made directly, rather than indirectly, by the prosecuting attorney and was made after the murder charge had been filed. However, this is a distinction without a substantial difference inasmuch as the alleged promise was made by a \u201cperson in authority\u201d. In Hunter\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>case, Sgt. Shirley was such a \u201cperson in authority\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">This Court, however, must apply the federal standard in cases such as this. As stated in Cummings v. United States, 398 F.2d 377, 381-382 (8th Cir. 1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_5\">\u201cThe standard to be applied by this Court in determining whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary \u2018is controlled by that portion of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, commanding that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d \u2019 Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532, 18 S.Ct. 183, 42 L.Ed. 568 (1897). \u2018Under this test, the constitutional inquiry is not whether the conduct of * * * officers in obtaining the confession was shocking, but whether the confession was \u201cfree and voluntary: that is, [it] must not be extracted by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, nor by the exertion of any improper influence.\u201d \u2019 Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 7, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">See also Shotwell Mfg. Co. v. United States, 371 U.S. 341, 347, 83 S.Ct. 448, 9 L.Ed.2d 357 (1963). In Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 754, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1472, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970), the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\"><em>\u201cBram </em>dealt with a confession given by a defendant in custody, alone and unrepresented by counsel. In such circumstances, even a mild promise of leniency was deemed sufficient to bar the confession, not because the promise was an illegal act as such, but because defendants at such times are too sensitive to inducement and the possible impact on them too great to ignore and too difficult to assess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Since Hunter has stated in his petition for habeas corpus that his confession was procured by false promises of a reduced charge for his cooperation at a time when he was in jail and unrepresented by counsel, we conclude that his petition did make allegations which would, if proven to be correct, properly be the basis for the relief requested. Procunier v. Atchley, 400 U.S. 446, 91 S.Ct. 485, 27 L.Ed.2d 524 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">III. NECESSITY OF EVIDENTIARY HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Since Hunter has exhausted his state remedies and made allegations which if proven to be true could be the basis for granting the writ, we pass now to the question of whether an eviden-tiary hearing should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">In the case of Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 at 313, 83 S.Ct. 745, at 757, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963) the Supreme Court held \u201cthat a federal court must grant an evidentiary hearing to a habeas applicant under the following circumstances: If (1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing.\u201d In 1966 these requirements were codified by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). See Hawkins v. Bennett, 423 F.2d 948, 950 (8th Cir. 1970); Howard v. Swenson, 404 F.2d 469, 472 (8th Cir. 1968); White v. Swenson, 261 F.Supp. 42, 60 (W.D.Mo. 1966) (en banc); Lay, Post Conviction Remedies and the Overburdened Judiciary: Solutions Ahead, 3 Creighton L. Rev. 5, 11-12 (1969). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) provides that the decision of the state court shall be presumed correct unless the petition comes within one of a number of specified exceptions. One of the exceptions is \u201cthat the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (3); Townsend v. Sain, <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>372 U.S. at 313, 83 S.Ct. 745; Hawkins v. Bennett, <em>supra, </em>423 F.2d at 950; Howard v. Swenson, <em>supra, </em>404 F.2d at 472; Roach v. Bennett, 392 F.2d 743, 748 (8th Cir. 1968). Another exception is \u201cthat such factual determination is not fairly supported by the record.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (8); Townsend v. Sain, supra, 372 U.S. at 313, 83 S.Ct. 745; Hawkins v. Bennett, <em>supra, </em>423 F.2d at 950; Howard v. Swenson, <em>supra, </em>404 F.2d at 472. Accord, Anderson v. Nelson, 432 F.2d 55, 56 (9th Cir. 1970); O\u2019Neal v. Smith, 413 F.2d 269, 270-271 (5th Cir. 1969). Both of these exceptions tend to overlap. In looking for guidance to their meaning, we turn to <em>Townsend. </em>In speaking of these exceptions, <em>Townsend </em>observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">\u201cThis Court has consistently held that state factual determinations not fairly supported by the record cannot be conclusive of federal rights.\u201d <em>Townsend, supra, </em>372 U.S. at 316, 83 S.Ct. at 758.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Townsend then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">\u201cWhere the fundamental liberties of the person are claimed to have been infringed, we carefully scrutinize the state-court record. * * * The duty of the Federal District Court on habeas is no less exacting.\u201d <em>Townsend, id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A49\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">\u201cThe duty to try the facts anew exists in every case in which the state court has not after a full hearing reliably found the relevant facts.\u201d <em>Townsend, supra, </em>at 318, 83 S.Ct. at 759.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Having carefully scrutinized the state court records and for reasons already mentioned, this Court believes that Sgt. Shirley\u2019s discussion with Hunter concerning a possible lesser charge on August 5, 1968 was a material and relevant fact which, because of the omission of Sgt. Rhoades\u2019 testimony at the state court trial of Hunter, was not adequately developed. In determining that there was no discussion of the so-called \u201cdeal\u201d on August 5, 1968, the State Supreme Court appears to have made an incorrect fact determination that could have influenced its primary decision that Hunter\u2019s confession was voluntary. Therefore, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (3) and (8) and <em>Townsend, </em>an evidentiary hearing on the allegations contained in Hunter\u2019s petition is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Reversed and remanded with directions to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\">. \u201cOn August 5, before making Ms statement, Hunter, after being explained Ms rights, signed a waiver of those rights, which included the statement, \u2018No promises or threats have been made to me and no pressure of any kind has been used against me.\u2019 <em>Sgts. Shirley wnd Rhodes </em>[sic] <em>and Mrs. Sowards, the stenographer, testified that no discussion took place on this date about a deal.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">In the same opinion, the United States District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">\u201cThere was no definite promise to Hunter, only a statement that a lesser charge might be considered. Hunter did not immediately act upon that statement. In fact, it was almost three weeks later before he made any incriminating statements. At the time he did make a confession, there was no discussion of a \u2018deal\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\">. In ruling on the admissibility of the confession the state trial court made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-14\">\u201cI am concerned about the testimony of Sergeant Shirley that was found on page twenty-seven of the March 11 transcript. The legal effect of those words is a matter that will have to be determined by an appellate court, if this matter is appealed. Also, I do have considerable doubt because of that one point. I am going to overrule the objections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">The testimony of Sgt. Shirley (on pages 26, 27 and 28 of the March 11. 1969 transcript) which concerned the court is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArK\">\u201cQ. And you testified that Hunter asked to relay a message to Mr. Lance concerning a reduced charge? You testified to that? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-21\">Q. Did you relay that? A.

This was your understanding and your impression then from that conversation, or from that statement by Sgt. Shirley to Mr. Hunter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-26\">A.

No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-30\">Q. Did Sgt. Shirley say he was relaying it from anyone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-31\">A. Well, Sgt.

Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-33\">Q. Sgt. Rhoades, this conversation, was it before or after Mr. Hunter signed the waiver, I believe which has been marked Exhibit Number 1? Yes, State\u2019s Exhibit 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-34\">A. I would say that was prior to this statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b689-13\">STEPHENSON, Chief District Judge</author>\n<author id=\"ACo\">(dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">I dissent. I am satisfied, from an examination of the entire record herein, that the factual issues relating to appellant\u2019s claim that his statement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was involuntary were fully developed and resolved in state trial court proceedings, after a full and fair hearing which resulted in a finding that appellant\u2019s statements, written and oral, were voluntary. This finding was amply supported by the record before the state trial court. Appellant is not entitled to another plenary hearing on the same issues. 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312-316, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1913); Wade v. Yeager, 377 F.2d 841, 844 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 893, 89 S.Ct. 218, 21 L.Ed.2d 173 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">On March 11, 1969, more than six weeks prior to trial, the state court conducted a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the statement in dispute upon the grounds that the same was involuntary and given by the appellant while he was under the impression that he was to be given leniency if he cooperated in giving a statement. Appellant, who was represented by two attorneys, testified during this hearing, as did the two officers, Sgt. Shirley and Sgt. Rhoades; who were present when his statement was taken. After hearing the evidence, Judge Yeaman specifically found that the statement in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>\u201c* * * was voluntarily made by the defendant, was not procured by coercion or threats or through fear, was not induced by promises of leniency. The Court finds that the statement in question is competent evidence and therefore overrules the defendant\u2019s objections and admits the statement in evidence.\u201d The Court, in response to a question by counsel for the defendant, made it clear that the ruling of admissibility applied to all oral statements, as well as the written statement in question. After ruling on the motion to suppress, the Court conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to produce, inspect, and copy, during which the prosecuting attorney was examined under oath concerning the existence or non-existence of any information in his possession favorable to the defendant. At the close of the hearing, the Court spoke concerning the prosecutor\u2019s duty and burden in the subsequent trial to establish that the statements taken from the defendant were voluntary, requested the court reporter to transcribe that part of the record having to do with the motion to suppress and directed him to furnish a copy to the court, defense counsel and the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">During the trial which commenced April 30, 1969, a hearing concerning the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s statements was held out of the presence of the jury in compliance with Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). At the commencement of the hearing, the trial court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> made specific inquiry of both of defendant\u2019s attorneys and defendant Hunter as to whether they had had an opportunity to read the transcript of the hearing before Judge Yeaman on the motion to suppress. Both the defendant and his attorneys replied in the affirmative. Counsel for the defendant then stated that the defendant was prepared to agree that Sgt. Shirley\u2019s testimony as it was previously given on the motion to suppress be used in the trial, reserving the right to offer additional testimony. The defendant specifically stated he was in agreement with this procedure. The transcript of Sgt. Shirley\u2019s testimony given in the hearing on motion to suppress was then received in evidence. Lois Sowards, who transcribed defendant\u2019s statement, was then examined and thoroughly cross-examined concerning the taking of the written statement and oral conversations that she heard between defendant and the patrolmen when she was present. Sgt. Shirley was also called for a brief interrogation. Defendant Hunter took the stand and testified in great detail concerning his various conversations with the patrolmen. At the close of his direct testimony, defendant\u2019s counsel invited him to make any statement to the court concerning matters that were not covered. The defendant also offered in evidence a transcript of a part of the testimony of Sgt. Shirley given at the preliminary hearing on October 2, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">After hearing the arguments of counsel, the trial court expressed some concern as to the legal effect of the words used by Sgt. Shirley in the hearing on the motion to suppress and observed that that would be a matter for the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>My colleagues are concerned because the Supreme Court of Missouri (State v. Hunter, 456 S.W.2d 314 at 321) and the United States District Court found there was no discussion of a \u201cdeal\u201d on August 5, 1969, when appellant made and signed his statement. Taking the evidence favorable to appellant, the most that can be said is that Sgt. Shirley advised appellant \u201c* * * its possible that Mr. Lance [prosecutor] would consider a lesser charge if he [appellant] would cooperate.\u201d It is very difficult for me to read into these words a promise, express or implied, that leniency would be shown in exchange for a statement. When other factors are considered, including appellant\u2019s long criminal record<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and his expressed antagonism toward prosecutor Lance in the early stages of the investigation, I find it impossible to conclude from this record that appellant\u2019s statements were involuntary or induced by promises of leniency. The most that can be said for appellant is that he was familiar with the criminal law and knew of his rights as well as the choices open to him. He wanted to make a deal, failing in this he could always claim he thought he had one, or do as he threatened, claim that he was not advised of his rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">I fail to see the value of another evi-dentiary hearing on the issue of volun-tariness. This matter was originally gone into in the preliminary hearing on October 2, 1968. It was thoroughly ventilated in the hearing on the motion to suppress heard on March 11, 1969. Transcripts of the foregoing were available to appellant and his counsel at the time of the-trial. Appellant stipulated that the transcript of Sgt. Shirley\u2019s testimony given in the hearing on the motion to suppress be made a part of the record on the issue of voluntariness. Sgt. Shirley was also available and did testify briefly, and was available for cross-examination by the defendant. A transcript of Sgt. Rhoades\u2019 testimony given during the hearing on the motion to suppress was likewise available to defendant and his counsel. Sgt. Rhoades had testified that he heard Sgt. Shirley say \u201cits possible.\u201d On cross-examination he stated he thought this meant there might be some leniency shown to defendant by the Prosecuting Attorney if the defendant were to give a statement. He also volunteered that \u201cits possible\u201d may have related to the prosecuting attorney coming down to see the defendant. Neither side chose to call Sgt. Rhoades or use the transcript of his tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>timony. After the trial court\u2019s determination of voluntariness, appellant\u2019s statements were admitted. Thereafter, the jury was properly instructed that before the jury could consider an alleged statement of the defendant, oral or written, it must have been made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">I am satisfied that appellant had a full hearing and that all of the relevant facts were developed under the guiding hand of counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Proper findings, amply supported by the evidence, were made by the trial court. The Supreme Court of Missouri has affirmed the finding of voluntariness. I would affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the petition and its refusal to grant an evidentiary hearing herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-16\">. At issue is the voluntariness of a written statement and oral statements made in connection therewith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-5\">. Judge Schoenlaub presided. Defendant was represented by two attorneys, but they were not the same attorneys who represented him at the hearing on the motion to suppress heard before Judge Yeaman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\">. \u201cTHE COURT: I am concerned about the testimony of Sergeant Shirley that was found on page twenty-seven of the March 11 transcript. The legal effect of those words is a matter that will have to be determined by an appellate court, if this matter is appealed. Also, I do have considerable doubt because of that one point. I am going to overrule the objections. It is the finding of this Court that the defendant was adequately advised of his rights under the Constitution as shown by Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 2 and 4 and the testimony of Sergeant Shirley concerning the advice which he did give to the defendant. It is further the finding of this Court that the statements were voluntarily made by the defendant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>that they were not procured by coercion or threats or through fear and were not induced by promises of leniency. The Court, therefore, finds that these statements in question are constitutionally admissible and competent evidence and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s objections are overruled and the statement, Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 3, is received in evidence, and the witness will be permitted to testify concerning the oral statements which the defendant also made.\u201d (the testimony of Sgt. Shirley is set out in Fn. 2 of the majority opinion.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">. Apparently four felony convictions in Kansas.

That he would state that I had not informed him of his rights and that he had not understood his rights and he said, \u2018They will believe me and not you,\u2019 and then again he reiterated the fact he had two witnesses, one of which was a reverend, that would attest to the fact he had stayed at his home that night, and again he said he would have himself declared mentally incompetent.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b692-22\">.
