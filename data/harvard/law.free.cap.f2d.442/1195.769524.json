It was the sort of thing on which a free man would ordinarily have workman\u2019s compensation coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-25\">Apparently believing the civil rights acts a catch-all for miscellaneous grievances, he filed action No. 50,773 in the Northern District of California. This was dismissed with prejudice. Then he filed action No. C69-197 ACW in the same court. This was dismissed on the ground of <em>res judicata. </em>Then he filed No. C70-1016 ACW. (In the three complaints there was some juggling of parties.) The third complaint was likewise dismissed on the ground of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-26\">This appeal is from the dismissal in the third action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-27\">The res <em>judicata </em>ground is good. And, there would be several other good ones.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
