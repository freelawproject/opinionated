Local 74, Wood, Wire and Metal Lathers International et al., 208 F.2d 930 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>(7th Cir. 1953) (explicating Rule 73(a) Fed.R.Civ.P. \u2014 the predecessor to Fed.R. App.P. 4(a) which latter rule according to the Advisory Committee\u2019s note to Rule 4 is \u201cderived from Fed.R.Civ.P. 73(a) without any change of substance\u201d). And although the fact that appellant\u2019s counsel \u201cmisread\u201d the rule to allow sixty not thirty days in which to file the notice does show neglect, it certainly does not make the neglect \u201cexcusable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
