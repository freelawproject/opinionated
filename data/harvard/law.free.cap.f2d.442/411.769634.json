After Assistant Deputy Commissioner Johnson and Loiselle both had filed timely notices of appeal, the Department of Justice decided not to pursue the appeal on belialf of the Deputy Commissioner, and his appeal was dismissed. Loiselle has, of course, persevered in his protest against the District Court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b469-24\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b469-25\">Loiselle, a longshoreman, appeals an order of the District Court which set aside an award of permanent partial disability benefits that had been granted under section 8 of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-26\"> A disability determination by a Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Labor must be accepted unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Max-on, Inc., 340 U.S. 504, 508, 71 S.Ct. 470, 472, 95 L.Ed. 483 (1951). Although Loiselle\u2019s actual earnings increased after his injury, the Deputy Commissioner was not bound precisely to gauge his wage-earning capacity by the actual wages received by him after the time of the disabling injury. Travelers Ins. Co. v. McClellan, 288 F.2d 250 (2d Cir. 1961); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(h). The evidence showed that the increase in Loiselle\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>wages was attributable to salary increases as a result of promotion, a raise in salary, and an extra shift. In light of the limited scope of judicial review in cases such as this, we think that the findings of the Deputy Commissioner should have been allowed to stand. Those findings were not without substantial evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
