A complaint of racial discrimination in employment must be filed with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) within 90 days after the alleged unlawful act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission must investigate the complaint and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that Title VII was violated. If so, the EEOC must attempt to conciliate the claim, using \u201cinformal methods of * * * persuasion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, if within 60 days after filing \u201cthe Commission has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with [Title VII], the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>shall so notify the person aggrieved and a civil action may, within thirty days thereafter, be brought, * * *\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AT2\">Appellant Stebbins filed a charge with the EEOC on May 26, 1969, alleging that he had been denied the position of claims adjuster by appellee Continental Insurance on racial grounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On August 26, 1969, appellant filed this suit without having been notified by the Commission that it had \u201cbeen unable to obtain voluntary compliance.\u201d This notification is commonly referred to as the \u201cnotice of right to sue.\u201d The District Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that notice is a prerequisite to an action under Title VII. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Appellant\u2019s sole claim is that the notice of right to sue is not a condition precedent to a suit in the District Court. We interpret his <em>pro se </em>brief \u2014 which is not a model of clarity \u2014 to raise two arguments in support of his position:</p>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">(1) First, that the notice is unnecessary because Title VII does not require any resort to the Commission\u2019s processes before a civil action can be maintained. Appellant points out that Title VII contains no explicit bar to a court action without prior recourse to the EEOC,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the floor manager of the Civil Rights Act apparently thought that direct access to the courts was permissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The legislative history of Title VII, however, has aptly been labeled \u201cchaotic\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and there are authoritative statements on both sides of the question of direct access to the courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201cCongress established comprehensive and detailed procedures to afford the EEOC the <em>opportunity </em>to attempt by administrative action to conciliate and mediate unlawful employment practices with a view to obtaining voluntary compliance.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This legislative scheme would be undercut if an individual could bypass the Commission at will. We therefore agree with the prevailing view that, in the absence of special circumstances,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the notice of right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>to sue is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">(2) Second, that he complied with the requirement of initial resort to the Commission by filing a complaint with the EEOC, and waiting the statutory 60 days before filing a timely court action; and that since the statute requires the Commission to give notice of its inability to obtain voluntary compliance, its failure to do so cannot bar his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">It is true that the EEOC does not automatically issue the notice when the 60 day period ends. But a Commission regulation provided that the notice would be issued upon the request of the charging party.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This regulation is justified on the following ground: the statutory period of limitations within which a court action may be brought (30 days) commences when the notice is received by the charging party.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a practical matter the EEOC usually cannot reach a complaint within the short period allowed by the statute (60 days).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Hence, automatic issuance of the notice would force the charging party to choose between waiting for the agency to reach his complaint, thereby losing his ultimate court remedy, and immediately instituting a court action, perhaps thereby abandoning hope for voluntary compliance. The EEOC regulation thus furthers \u201cthe statutory scheme * * * by allowing conciliation attempts to continue as long as they may appear fruitful, while at the same time giving either the aggrieved party or the respondent the right to precipitate the EEOC action of notification * * <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The regulation is therefore \u201cwithin the power of the EEOC to supplement the statutory scheme and in accord with congressional intent.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Appellant has never claimed that it is a hardship for him to seek the required notice, nor has he claimed that the Commission refused to give the notice. In these circumstances the notice was a jurisdictional requirement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">We have been urged in a very able <em>amicus curiae </em>brief by the EEOC to hold that the District Court had jurisdiction under the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1964), which provides in part that \u201c[a] 11 persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts * * * as is enjoyed by white citizens. * * *\u201d The Commission argues that this statute creates a cause of action for racial dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>crimination in private employment,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and permits an individual to <em>go </em>directly to court -with his claim. We are urged to refuse to follow Waters v. Wisconsin Steel Works, which held that jurisdiction under this statute exists only when the complainant has \u201ca reasonable excuse\u201d for by-passing the EEOC.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">It is tempting indeed to reach this interesting and important question. But appellant, an experienced <em>pro se </em>litigator, has steadfastly maintained that his sole claim is that the notice of failure to obtain voluntary compliance is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction under Title VII. Neither he nor appellee has briefed the question of jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. In the absence of a full exposition of the problems involved, we decline the invitation to reach beyond the single issue presented to us by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-9\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e to e-15 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b902-18\">. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-5(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b902-19\">. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-5 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b903-7\">. <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>2000e-5(e).
