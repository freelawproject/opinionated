KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">We voted to hear the initial argument of this appeal <em>en banc, </em>a procedure we reserve for extraordinary circumstances, so that we might give plenary review to a complex of urgent social and political conflicts persistently seeking solution in the courts as legal problems, a phenomenon de Tocqueville commented upon many years ago. Democracy in America, vol. I at 290 (Vintage ed. 1945)'. The elaborate opinion and order below raise important questions concerning the federal constitutional rights of state prisoners which neither Supreme Court precedent nor our own past decisions have answered. The sparse authority from other courts is for the most part either inconclusive or conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">PROCEEDINGS BELOW AND JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b239-19\">This is an appeal from an order entered May 14, 1970, by Judge Motley, sitting in the Southern District of New York, 312 F.Supp. 863, which granted plaintiff Martin Sostre punitive and compensatory damages against defendants Follette and McGinnis as well as a wide variety of injunctive relief in his action pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343(3). At the-time Sostre filed his handwritten complaint, he was incarcerated in New York\u2019s Green Haven Prison (now called Green Haven Correctional Facility), serving a sentence of thirty to forty years for selling narcotics, followed by thirty days further imprisonment for contempt of court, imposed on him March 18, 1968. The original defendants included the Governor of New York as well as the State Commissioner of Correction, appellant McGinnis; the Warden of Green Haven, Harold W. Follette, who died shortly before the opinion below was entered;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Warden of Attica Prison (now called Attica Correctional Facility), appellant Vincent Mancusi. Sostre had been confined for one night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>in Attica immediately after sentencing, them transferred the following day to Green Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Sostre does not appeal from the dismissal by the district court of his action against the Governor, in which Sostre had asserted the Governor\u2019s complicity in racial discrimination in the administration of New York\u2019s prison system.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Because there was no finding below that Warden Mancusi had in any way violated Sostre\u2019s constitutional rights, the case against him should also have been dismissed. In refusing this dismissal, Judge Motley observed that Commissioner McGinnis \u201chas the power to re-transfer Sostre to Attica.\u201d 312 F. Supp. at 877 n. 8. The relevance of this admitted fact escapes us. After bringing this law suit, Sostre was transferred to Wallkill State Prison, but we suppose that would not justify an injunction directed against the Warden there.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We agree with the district court that Sostre was not required as a precondition of maintaining this suit to perform the meaningless and plainly futile gesture of writing a letter to defendant McGinnis. See Houghton v. Shafer, 392 U.S. 639, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319 (1968) (per curiam); Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560 (2d Cir. 1969). The record amply supports the district court\u2019s finding that the State Commissioner of Correction \u201chad already been informed of the facts\u201d and further enlightenment from Sostre himself could not have been expected to affect his attitude or his inaction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 312 F.Supp. at 881-882. Nor is exhaustion of state legal or equitable remedies necessary to a Section 1983 action, which provides \u201ca remedy in the federal courts supplementary to any remedy any State might have.\u201d McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 668, 672, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 1435, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963). See King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968); Damico v. California, 389 U.S. 416, 88 S.Ct. 526, 19 L. Ed.2d 647 (1967) (per curiam); Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 522-523 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Moreover, because Sostre \u201cis not challenging the validity of his sentence with the ultimate object of obtaining release\u201d from prison, Hancock v. Avery, 301 F.Supp. 786, 791 (M.D.Tenn.1969), his Section 1983 petition is clearly not a mere sham procedure to avoid the exhaustion requirement of the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b), (c). Cf. Smartt v. Avery, 411 F.2d 408 (6th Cir. 1967); Kalec v. Adamowski, 406 F.2d 536 (7th Cir. 1969); Peinado v. Adult Auth., 405 F.2d 1185, 1186 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 968, 89 S.Ct. 2116, 23 L.Ed.2d 755 (1969); Johnson v. Walker, 317 F.2d 418, 419-420 (5th Cir. 1963); King v. McGinnis, 289 F. Supp. 466 (S.D.N.Y.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">A. <em>Circumstances of Sostre\u2019s Commitment to Punitive Segregation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">On June 25, 1968, Warden Follette ordered that Sostre be committed pursuant to Section 140 of the New York Correction Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 43,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to \u201csolitary confinement\u201d (the words in the statute) or \u201cpunitive segregation\u201d (the term adopted by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Motley and by the parties on appeal, which we will use for that reason and also because he was not as isolated in his segregation as \u201csolitary\u201d would imply) . The parties vigorously disagree as to the considerations that motivated Fol-lette to inflict this punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">On June 25, 1968, the day he put Sostre in segregation, Follette called Sostre to his office. At this meeting, Follette questioned Sostre about his attempt that morning to mail to an attorney, Miss Joan Franklin of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a letter with handwritten legal papers attached, including a motion for use in the trial of Mrs. Geraldine Robinson. Mrs. Robinson is described by Judge Motley and the parties on appeal as Sostre\u2019s \u201ccodefendant.\u201d Although she was joined with Sostre in the indictment which resulted in Sostre\u2019s imprisonment, they were not tried together. Follette told Sostre \u201che must confine his legal activities to his own incarceration\u201d and accordingly that the motion would not be mailed. Follette explained that he objected to Sostre\u2019s attempt to \u201cpractice law\u201d without a license. Sostre believed that he had a right to mail legal papers in behalf of Mrs. Robinson and refused to assure Follette, as Follette requested, that he would discontinue attempting to mail such documents through normal prison channels.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">During the same interview, Follette questioned Sostre about a reference to an organization known as \u201cR.N.A.,\u201d mentioned by Sostre in his letter to Miss Franklin and to which Sostre had referred in earlier correspondence. \u201cR.N. A.\u201d in fact referred to the Republic of New Africa, which Sostre identified at the trial before Judge Motley as a black liberation or black separatist organization. Sostre disputed Follettee\u2019s tstimo-ny that Sostre had lied about R.N.A. at the June 25 interview by persistently claiming at that time that it was a \u201cfederal agency * * * \u2018Recovery National Administration\u2019 or something like this.\u201d Sostre did admit, as Follette asserted at trial, that after responding to a few questions Sostre refused to discuss R.N.A. further. The plaintiff\u2019s justification for his silence was that Follette had persisted in labelling R.N. A. a \u201csubversive organization.\u201d Sostre \u201cclammed up,\u201d as he testified, to avoid antagonizing Follette by further explaining or defending R.N.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Follette testified without contradiction that the organization known as the Republic of New Africa was of sufficient concern to him to have been the object of an investigation before the interview with Sostre. Follette feared that \u201cthis organization was a cloak for an attempt to organize prison inmates for riot and insurrection,\u201d based on information obtained from the F.B.I. and the New York State and Buffalo City Police. \u201c[T]he possibility of insurrection at Green Haven\u201d was a \u201cmajor fear\u201d to Follette at all times, but particularly so in June, 1968. Security at the prison had been weakened, in Follette\u2019s view, by an exceptionally high turnover of correction officers, approaching a rate of about fifty percent each year. An influx of new officers had not yet been cleared through the New York State Identification and Intelligence System. Moreover, Sostre had exacerbated Follette\u2019s concern with the possibility of major disorder because of a statement in a letter that Sostre had written to his sister, dated May 19, 1968:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">As for me, there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that I will be out soon, either by having my appeal reversed in the courts or by being liberated by the Universal Forces of Liberation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">This sentence is included in a broad indictment of militarism and oppression in this country and a prediction that \u201cthe power structure\u201d would soon be overthrown.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Follette insists that his decision to commit Sostre to segregation reflected (1) Sostre\u2019s declared intent to defy Fol-lette\u2019s order by preparing legal papers for his co-defendant; (2) his intransig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ence about R.N.A.; (3) the allusion in the letter to his sister to his impending liberation. Rule 54 of the \u201cInmate\u2019s Rule Book,\u201d a publication of the New York Department of Correction issued to each prisoner when he arrives at Green Haven, limits inmate correspondence to \u201ctheir own personal matters.\u201d Follette interpreted this as proscribing the sending of legal papers in behalf of a co-defendant. Sostre\u2019s refusal to discuss R.N.A. and his persistence about Mrs. Robinson\u2019s legal papers both violated Rule 5 of the Inmate Rule Book which requires that an inmate obey orders \u201cpromptly and fully,\u201d pending whatever appeal he may wish to take to higher authority. In addition, his silence violated Rule 12, enjoining inmates to answer \u201cfully and truthfully\u201d all questions put by prison officials. In sum, Follette assigned as his motive for Sostre\u2019s punishment the fact that Sostre\u2019s \u201cwhole attitude was one of defiance, of flatly refusing * * * to conduct himself as a proper inmate within the rules, regulations and laws set down by the State of New York and the Department of Correction.\u201d Section 140 of the New York Correction Law authorized Fol-lette, by its terms in his unfettered discretion, to commit Sostre to segregation when \u201cnecessary * * * to produce [his] entire submission and obedience\u201d and to keep him there \u201cuntil he shall be reduced to submission and obedience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Judge Motley disbelieved each of Fol-lette\u2019s asserted motives for punishing Sostre, crediting instead Sostre\u2019s testimony that Follette was motivated by Sostre\u2019s threat to sue Follette over his withholding the motion papers intended for Mrs. Robinson. Additionally, Judge Motley attributed to Follette an intent to punish Sostre because of his earlier activism in bringing litigation related to the practice of the Black Muslim religion in New York prisons and \u201cbecause he is, unquestionably, a black militant who persists in writing and expressing his militant and radical ideas in prison.\u201d Judge Motley held that the summary meeting with Warden Follette which resulted in Sostre\u2019s commitment to segregation did not afford due process of law to Sostre before his \u201cliberty\u201d was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Apart from the events of the June 25 interview, Judge Motley also dismissed as one of Follette\u2019s reasons for continuing Sostre\u2019s incarceration in segregated confinement several items of \u201ccontraband\u201d which Follette claimed were the fruit of a search of Sostre\u2019s cell conducted immediately after he entered segregation. These items consisted of (1) two small (3 inches by 5 inches) pieces of heavy black emery paper covered with an abrasive material like sand which, according to Follette, could be flaked off and in some manner attached to a string to fashion an instrument capable of sawing through cell bars; (2) six tables of contents torn from issues of the <em>Harvard Law Review </em>and stamped by prison officials to indicate that the books, Sostre\u2019s personal property, were not to circulate to other prisoners; (3) a letter' dated June 10, 1968, from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York addressed to a fellow-prisoner of Sostre\u2019s, Juan Moline, a Puerto Rican, which Sostre later explained he was translating for Moline from English into Spanish. Judge Motley believed Sostre\u2019s testimony that he had never seen the pieces of emery paper before they were introduced by defendants at trial. 312 F.Supp. at 869. The other contraband indicated that Sostre had violated prison rules by circulating his law periodicals to other prisoners and by giving a fellow-prisoner legal assistance without first securing the Warden\u2019s permission. The Court below not only declined to find that these activities motivated the punishment of Sostre, but held in addition, that Sostre\u2019s activities were protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>B. <em>Conditions of Punitive Segregation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Sostre remained confined in punitive segregation for twelve months and eight days, until Judge Motley restrained his continued punishment <em>pendente lite </em>on July 2, 1969. By regulation, Sostre lost the opportunity to earn 124% days of good behavior credit while he was segregated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We cannot avoid setting forth the precise conditions of Sostre\u2019s long confinement with some particularity because Judge Motley found as a matter of law, that (1) in view of those conditions, Sostre\u2019s punishment \u2014 or any confinement in segregation under similar conditions for longer than 15 days\u2014 was \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d under the Eighth Amendment; (2) this absolute rule aside, Judge Motley held that the penalty inflicted upon Sostre was so disproportionate to the offenses charged against him that his segregation would have been cruel and unusual even crediting each of Follette\u2019s assigned justifications for it. We cannot approve these conclusions. Our reasons for refusing to do so are based in part on undisputed facts in the record which do not appear in Judge Motley\u2019s otherwise entirely accurate description of Sostre\u2019s segregated environment. The following account draws upon those undisputed facts which do not appear in the opinion below, as well as those which do, in an effort to present the whole fabric.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">1. <em>Isolation from Human Contact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Although for four months only one other prisoner was confined with Sostre in his small \u201csegment\u201d of five cells, the entire punitive segregation unit at Green Haven housed on the average about 15 prisoners at any one time. During the period between June 28, 1967, and September 18, 1968, 179 prisoners were held in segregation for a total of 8,960 days. From September 19, 1968 to July 3, 1969, when Sostre was there, a total of 79 inmates were segregated at Green Haven. Of these, about ten percent were held in \u201cprotective\u201d segregation. This term is used to describe those who are segregated from the general population to protect them from harm rather than as punishment. These prisoners were incarcerated in cells entirely separated from Sostre\u2019s cell in the punitive segregation unit. The other prisoners were confined in cells near Sostre\u2019s, so that he would have been able to communicate with them, albeit with some difficulty depending on the distance between Sostre and the other prisoners. We are informed of an incident where one prisoner brought to solitary and placed in another group of cells committed suicide. Sostre was able to communicate with this inmate and indeed was able to dictate a legal document to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Finally, although we do not doubt that \u201cthe crux of the matter is human isolation,\u201d as Judge Motley observed, Sostre aggravated his isolation by refusing to participate in a \u201cgroup therapy\u201d program offered each inmate in segregation beginning October or November 1968. \u201cTherapy\u201d sessions were conducted in groups of about eight per class, generally one each week or ten days, under the guidance of a \u201crecreation supervisor,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Sergeant Louis Profera. Profera had been trained in group counseling in a six month, 40-hour course by a psychiatrist at the New York State Vocational Institution. Special rules for punitive segregation posted in the segregation unit provided that inmates in punitive segregation would be \u201creturned to the general population after demonstrating their willingness to accept and adhere to the institutional rules and regulations as shown by their participation in group counselling sessions. * * * Refusal to participate in group counselling is indicative of the inmate\u2019s unwillingness to accept and abide by the rules and regulations of the institution.\u201d Profera\u2019s favorable recommendation generally resulted in a prisoner\u2019s release from segregation. Although one prisoner who testified at trial returned to the general population without participating in group therapy, there is no doubt that there was significant pressure to participate. Expert witnesses at trial disagreed as to whether coercion would increase or decrease the efficacy of group therapy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">2. <em>Other Conditions of Sostre\u2019s Segregated Confinement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Judge Motley heard extensive testimony describing such important details as Sostre\u2019s diet, his opportunity for exercise, the hygienic conditions of his cell, and the possibility for intellectual stimulation. It can hardly be questioned that his life in segregation was harsher than it would have been in the general population, but neither was it clearly unendurable or subhuman or cruel and inhuman in a constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Thus, Sostre would not be served seconds of the main course upon his demand; but there was no testimony that he would have had that privilege in the general population. He was denied the dessert that would have been available to the general population; but apart from the dessert his diet still consisted of 2800 to 3300 calories a day.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sostre remained in his cell at all times except for a brief period once each week to shave and shower. An hour of exercise with four or five other prisoners in a small, enclosed yard, open to the sky was a daily routine. But the record reveals that Sostre refused this privilege because he would not submit to a \u201cstrip search.\u201d Officials testified that it was necessary to subject prisoners to such an examination each time they entered the exercise yard to prevent them from concealing on their bodies small bits of wire or other material suitable for use as a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">Hygienic conditions were at least minimally adequate to permit Sostre to remain clean and healthy. Thus, Sostre was allowed to shave and shower with hot water once each week. The furnishings of his normal-sized (6 ft. x 8 ft.) cell included a toilet and a face bowl with running cold water, and he was provided with soap and a towel.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">The strictures on Sostre\u2019s intellectual fare were severe. He could not buy or receive books, magazines or newspapers, and his access to the prison\u2019s library collection was limited to a selection among approximately thirty-five volumes, mostly \u201cshoot-em-ups\u201d as Sostre described them, chosen by the prison guards. Still, light from a single bulb, controlled by the guards and usually turned on early in the morning and off at 10 p.m., was adequate for reading. And although he could not attend school or watch television, as could the inmates in the general population, any material related to the law requested by him would be brought to his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>3. <em>Length of Segregated Confinement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Pursuant to the usual practice at Green Haven, Sostre was sentenced to \u201csolitary\u201d confinement for an indefinite period. According to New York Correction Law Section 140, \u201csubmissiveness\u201d was to be the touchstone for his release. Follette testified that Sostre could have returned to the general population either by successful participation in group therapy or by agreeing to live by the rules of the prison. Sostre\u2019s contention is that he refused to agree to obey rules that he considered an infringement of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">C. <em>Censorship and Possession of Literature</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Defendant Follette censored Sostre\u2019s correspondence with Joan Franklin of the NAACP, the attorney of record representing Sostre on appeal from his conviction. Follette regularly excised from letters passing between Sostre and Miss Franklin \u201cobjectionable\u201d material \u2014 anything which \u201cin his judgment was not relevant to Sostre\u2019s appeal.\u201d In accordance with Rule 47 of the Inmate Rule Book which restricts inmates\u2019 correspondence to persons on an approved mailing list, Warden Follette in late September, 1968, refused to forward a letter from Sostre to the United States Post Office Inspector, in which Sostre complained of Green Haven\u2019s practice of not returning to prisoners receipts for certified mail. The district judge found that each of these actions violated Sostre\u2019s First Amendment right to freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">About August 3, 1969, a month after his release from segregation, Sostre was deprived of the use of the prison exercise yard and the privilege of attending movies because he possessed \u201cinflammatory racist literature\u201d in his cell. The literature consisted of articles written by Sostre himself on paper properly in his possession. Most of the articles consisted of extracts from magazines and newspapers which Sostre was also permitted to have and read in his cell. The extracts included quotations from Mao Tse Tung, poetry written by a prison inmate, the names of the officers, the party program, and rules of conduct of the Black Panther Party; the officers and oath of allegiance of the Republic of New Africa; a \u201cprogram\u201d for Black Student Unions; and the poem \u201cIf We Must Die,\u201d by Claude McKay. In addition, guards found in Sostre\u2019s cell an article which he had written himself, entitled \u201cRevoluntionary Thoughts.\u201d The district court found that Sostre\u2019s punishment for possessing this material constituted another infringement of his freedom of expression.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">THE DISTRICT COURT\u2019S ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"AZG\">Upon these findings which we have necessarily sketched, Judge Motley on May 14, 1970, entered the following order, which because of its complexity and importance to the questions we must decide, we reproduce in full. The district court subsequently granted a stay of its order pending appeal as to the bracketed portions. A stay as to the remainder of the order was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">It is now ordered, that defendants Follette, McGinnis and Mancusi, their employees, agents, successors, and all persons in active concert and participation with them be, and they are hereby, perpetually enjoined and restrained from:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">1) Returning plaintiff to punitive segregation for charges previously preferred against him;</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">2) Placing plaintiff in punitive segregation or subjecting him to any oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>er punishment as a result of which he loses accrued good time credit or is unable to earn good time credit, without:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">a. giving him, in advance of a hearing, a written copy of any charges made against him, citing the written rule or regulation which it is charged he has violated;</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">b. granting him a recorded hearing before a disinterested official where, he will be entitled to cross-examine his accusers and to call witnesses on his own behalf;</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">c. granting him the right to retain counsel or to appoint a counsel substitute;</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">d. giving him, in writing, the decision of the hearing officer in which is briefly set forth the evidence upon which it is based, the reasons for the decision, and the legal basis for the punishment imposed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">[3) Censoring, refusing to mail or refusing to give to Sostre: 1) Any communication between Sostre and the following \u2014 (a) any court; (b) any public official or agency; (c) any lawyer; (d) his co-defendant in the criminal matter pending against him; and, 2) Any letter relating to any legal matter to or from any other inmate who requests the assistance of Sostre in translating that letter into English.]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">4) Punishing Sostre for sharing with other inmates his law books, law reviews, and other legal materials, and from refusing to permit Sostre to assist any other inmate in any legal matter as long as defendants have not provided any court approved alternative means of legal assistance for such inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">[5) Punishing Sostre for having in his possession political literature and for setting forth his political views orally or in writing, except for violation of reasonable rules approved by the court regulating freedom of speech.]</p>\n<p id=\"ATC\">[It is further ordered that the above named defendants submit, within 90 days from the date of this order, for approval by this court, proposed rules and regulations governing the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">1) the receipt, distribution, discussion and writing of political literature;</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">2) all future disciplinary charges and hearings with respect thereto where the possible punishments include solitary confinement, punitive segregation or any other segregation, and any other punishment in connection with which there is loss of, or inability to earn, good time credit.]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">It is further ordered that the above named defendants and their agents credit plaintiff with the 124% days of good time credit which he was unable to earn while wrongfully incarcerated in punitive segregation from June 25, 1968 to July 2, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">[It is further ordered that the plaintiff, Martin Sostre, recover of the defendants, Warden Follette, and Commissioner McGinnis the sum of $13,-020.00.]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">PUNISHMENT FOR POLITICAL BELIEFS AND LEGAL ACTIVITIES</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">The question as to the propriety of withdrawing from incarcerated individuals constitutional privileges enjoyed by citizens of the community, although troublesome, is not new to the courts. It is clear that in many respects the constitutionally protected freedoms enjoyed by citizens-at-large may be withdrawn or constricted as to state prisoners, so far as \u201cjustified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>considerations underlying our penal system,\u201d Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1060, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). Federal courts have been reluctant to intrude themselves into the complex and delicate problems of prison administration. E.g., United States ex rel. Knight v. Ragen, 337 F.2d 425 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 985, 85 S.Ct. 1355, 14 L.Ed.2d 277 (1964); Hatfield v. Bailleaux, 290 F.2d 632, 640 (9th Cir. 1961); Childs v. Pegelow, 321 F.2d 487 (4th Cir. 1963). The time is long since past, however, when a court might describe a prisoner as temporarily \u201ca slave of the state,\u201d Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 790, 796, or treat him as such. Among those rights <em>not </em>taken from Sostre when he entered Attica, either \u201cexpressly or by necessary implication,\u201d Coffin v. Reichard, 143 F.2d 443, 445 (6th Cir. 1944), is freedom from discriminatory punishment inflicted solely because of his beliefs, whether religious or secular. Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1964) (per curiam) (unlawful to withdraw prison privileges because of inmate\u2019s religious faith); see Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S. 333, 88 S.Ct. 994, 19 L.Ed.2d 1212 (1968) (per curiam) (racial segregation); Fulwood v. Clemmer, 206 F.Supp. 370, 373-374 (D.C.D. C.1962) (religious discrimination). Moreover, the Constitution protects with special solicitude, a prisoner\u2019s access to the courts. Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034 (1941); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969). Accordingly, Sostre\u2019s lengthy confinement to segregation violated due process of law if, as the district court found, Warden Follette inflicted the punishment either because of Sostre\u2019s militant political ideas or his litigation, past or threatened, against Follette or other state officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Sostre does not shrink from characterizing himself as a \u201cjailhouse lawyer\u201d and the record before us does justice to this label, as does the history of Sostre\u2019s earlier period of confinement in New York prisons from 1952-64 following his first conviction for selling narcotics. It is not unreasonable to suppose, as the district court apparently did, that Warden Follette was aware of Sostre\u2019s Black Muslim activities during that period; of his solitary confinement in Attica Prison for four years, resulting from his religious activism; and of his success in securing through earlier litigation before this court the recognition of certain constitutional liberties for state prisoners. See Pierce v. LaVallee, 293 F.2d 233 (2d Cir. 1961); Sostre v. McGinnis, 334 F.2d 906 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 892, 85 S.Ct. 168, 13 L.Ed.2d 96 (1964). Sostre\u2019s version of his June 25, 1968, interview with Follette, if believed, was a proper basis for Judge Motley\u2019s conclusion that Follette committed Sostre to segregation, if not in retaliation for his black militancy or past litigation, then at least to squelch Sostre\u2019s threat to take Follette to court over his censorship of Sostre\u2019s correspondence. Some substantiation for Sostre\u2019s account might be inferred from Follette\u2019s summary commitment of Sostre, without following the practice described in the New York Department of Correction\u2019s Employees\u2019 Rule Book (Rule 8.4), requiring trial by a \u201cdisciplinary officer or court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">On this evidence, we cannot conclude that the district judge was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in attributing improper motives to Follette, affording as we must \u201cdue regard * * * to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility\u201d of Sostre and Follette, F.R. Civ.P. 52(a). See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969) (reviewing court may overturn finding if on the entire evidence it is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made). On the other hand, McGinnis was not privy to Follette\u2019s interview with Sostre. The record is barren of any justification for attributing to him, in sanctioning Sostre\u2019s continued confinement, any more sinister motive than appropriate deference to the judgment of Warden Follette. McGinnis on the record before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>us, had no reason to suspect Follette of other than proper motivation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">A reflection of maturing sensitivity in this country to the condition of some of our prisons may be seen in the district court\u2019s finding that deprivations such as Sostre endured for a year may not again be inflicted on New York State prisoners for longer than fifteen days, and only then for serious violations of prison rules. Otherwise, Judge Motley held, such punishment would run ashoal of the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, as applied to the states through the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment, Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">We respect the outrage, given form and content by scholarly research and reflection, that underlay the expert testimony at trial of Sol Rubin, for many years Counsel for the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and Dr. Seymour Halleck, a psychiatrist at the University of Wisconsin with long experience in state correctional practices. Mr. Rubin testified that Sostre\u2019s segregated environment was degrading, dehumanizing, conducive to mental derangement, and for these reasons \u201ca gross departure\u201d from enlightened and progressive contemporary standards for the proper treatment of prison inmates. Dr. Hal-leek feared that the isolation from human contact in punitive segregation might cause prisoners to hallucinate and to distort reality. Long-term isolation might have so serious an impact, in fact, as to \u201cdestroy\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cmentality.\u201d Dr. Halleck singled out for particular censure Green Haven\u2019s \u201cgroup therapy\u201d program, whose compulsory aspects he found repugnant to effective treatment of participants and indeed inconsistent with minimal standards of professionalism among trained group counsellors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Nor would candor permit us to dismiss -these opinions as aberrational among those views revealed in relevant sources referred to us by counsel or known to us through our own research. To the contrary, it would not be misleading to characterize many of the opinions of plaintiff\u2019s experts as fairly representative of the perspective of adherents to the \u201cnew penology,\u201d see Knuckles v. Prasse, 302 F.Supp. 1036, 1047-1048 (E.D.Pa.1969), the thrust of whose doctrine may be gauged by the preference for the adjective \u201ccorrectional\u201d rather than \u201cpenal\u201d as more accurately indicating the proper function of a prison system.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The rapidly rising standards in the field of penology and corrections that Mr. Rubin referred to in his testimony are reflected in a growing preoccupation with institutional strictures and techniques designed to \u201creintegrate\u201d prisoners with society or, in the jargon of the experts, to \u201cprovide * * * motivation for acquiring a conventional role in a non-delinquent setting.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Conjugal visiting, daytime work or edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>cational-release programs, vocational training, half-way houses, and inmate publication of prison newspapers are some of the vanguard weapons in the \u201cmodern\u201d approach to prison administration. The key concepts are access and involvement of prisoners with the free society \u201con the outside.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Anathema to this perspective are perhaps more traditional practices which subject prisoners to deprivation, degradation, subservience, and isolation, in an attempt to \u201cbreak\u201d them and make them see the error of their ways.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is suggested by many observers that such techniques are counter-productive, tending only to instill in most prisoners attitudes hostile to rehabilitation, summarized by one author as \u201cdoubt, guilt, inadequacy, diffusion, self-absorption, apathy [and] despair.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We do not question, either, the relevance to an inquiry under the Eighth Amendment of opinions which may represent a progressing sense of humaneness as well as a new calculation as to the efficacy of penal practices. See Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958) (Eighth Amendment invokes \u201cthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">For a federal court, however, to place a punishment beyond the power of a state to impose on an inmate is a drastic interference with the state\u2019s free political and administrative processes. It is not only that we, trained as judges, lack expertise in prison administration. Even a lifetime of study in prison administration and several advanced degrees in the field would not qualify us <em>as a federal court </em>to command state officials to shun a policy that they have decided is suitable because to us the choice may seem unsound or <em>personally </em>repugnant. As judges we are obliged to school ourselves in such objective sources as historical usage, see Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1870), practices in other jurisdictions, see Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910), and public opinion, see Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 666, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), before we may responsibly exercise the power of judicial review to declare a punishment unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Accordingly, we have in the past declined to find an Eighth Amendment violation unless the punishment can properly be termed \u201cbarbarous\u201d or \u201cshocking to the conscience.\u201d See Church v. Hegstrom, 416 F.2d 449, 451 (2d Cir. 1969). Although the conditions Sostre endured were severe, we cannot agree with the district court that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201cso foul, so inhuman, and so violative of basic concepts of decency,\u201d Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519 (2d Cir. 1967),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as to require that similar punishments be limited in the future to any particular length of time. Nor can we agree that Sostre\u2019s own long confinement\u2014 however contrary such prolonged segregation may be to the views of some experts \u2014 would have been \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d had Sostre in fact been confined for the reasons asserted by Warden Fol-lette, rather than on account of his beliefs and litigiousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">It is undisputed on this appeal that segregated confinement does not itself violate the Constitution. See Burns v. Swenson, 430 F.2d 771 (8th Cir., Aug. 31, 1970); Courtney v. Bishop, 409 F.2d 1185 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 915, 90 S.Ct. 235, 24 L.Ed.2d 192 (1969); Graham v. Willingham, 384 F.2d 367 (10th Cir. 1967); United States ex rel. Knight v. Ragen, 337 F.2d 425 (7th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 985, 85 S.Ct. 1355, 14 L.Ed.2d 277 (1965); Krist v. Smith, 309 F.Supp. 497 (S.D.Ga.1970); Roberts v. Barbosa, 227 F.Supp. 20 (S.D.Cal.1964). Indeed, we learn that a similar form of confinement is probably used in almost every jurisdiction in this country and has been described as one of \u201cthe main traditional disciplinary tools\u201d of our prison systems. President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: Corrections 50-51 (1967); S. Rubin, et al., The Law of Criminal Corrections 293 (1963).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Plaintiff has directed our attention to currently operative rules in other jurisdictions which limit the duration of segregated confinement, and to several commentaries recommending or approving such rules.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In several states, however, incarceration in segregated cells seems to be for an indefinite period, as it is in New York.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The federal practice appears to be that prisoners shall be retained in solitary \u201cfor as long as necessary to achieve the purposes intended,\u201d sometimes \u201cindefinitely.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cwillful refusal to obey an order or demonstrated defiance of personnel acting in line of duty may constitute sufficient basis for placing an inmate in segre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>gation.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such analogous practices<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> do not impel us to the conclusion that the Eighth Amendment forbids indefinite confinement under the conditions endured by Sostre for all the reasons asserted by Warden Follette until such time as the prisoner agrees to abide by, prison rules \u2014 however eounter-pro-ductive as a correctional measure or however personally abhorrent the practice may seem to some of us.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-19\">In arriving at this conclusion,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we have considered Sostre\u2019s diet, the availability in his cell of at least rudimentary implements of personal hygiene,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the opportunity for exercise <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>and for participation in group therapy,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the provision of at least some general reading matter from the prison library and of unlimited numbers of law books, and the constant possibility of communication with other segregated prisoners. These factors in combination raised the quality of Sostre\u2019s segregated environment several notches above those truly barbarous and inhumane conditions heretofore condemned by ourselves and by other courts as \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See Ford v. Board of Managers, 407 F.2d 937 (3rd Cir. 1969) (no running water or wash bowl; bread and water diet except one regular meal each third day; held constitutional); Landman v. Peyton, 370 F.2d 135 (4th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 920, 87 S. Ct. 2142, 18 L.Ed.2d 1367 (1967); Knuckles v. Prasse, 302 F.Supp. 1036 (E.D.Pa.1969) (400 days segregation held constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">Finally, we cannot agree with Judge Motley that even if New York might in an appropriate ease subject a prisoner to the conditions of Sostre\u2019s segregated confinement, had Follette\u2019s motives been as he described them, the punishment would in any event have been unconstitutionally disproportionate to the offense. Were we to rule otherwise, we would deny to prison authorities the power to use an entirely constitutional means of discipline in response not only to a credible threat to the security of the prison, but in response to a prisoner\u2019s refusal to answer appropriate questions put by prison authorities and to obey valid prison regulations.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-16\">PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS A divergence of perspectives similar to those we have seen in considering the Eighth Amendment issue is presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>another form by the district court\u2019s order that Sostre may not be punished in the future in such a way as to forfeit earned \u201cgood time\u201d credit or to lose the chance to earn such credit unless he has (a) written notice of the charges against him; (b) a recorded hearing be-, fore a disinterested official with a chance to cross-examine adverse witnesses and call witnesses in his own behalf; (c) the right to retain counsel or counsel substitute; and unless (d) a written decision is rendered.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Sostre presses upon us a variety of cases, relied upon by the district court and said to be analogous to this case, in which federal courts have required states to square corners before exacting a penalty by following procedures similar to those mandated by Judge Motley. Particular importance is attached to Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), where the Supreme Court announced that before states may terminate welfare payments they must adopt \u201cminimum procedural safeguards\u201d and afford those who are to suffer loss \u201crudimentary due process,\u201d including advance written notice and a hearing at which the welfare recipient may cross-examine adverse witnesses and be represented by counsel. In addition, there must be a written statement of reasons for any termination, including some indication of the evidence supporting the adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Our recent decision in Escalera v. New York City Housing Authority, 425 F.2d 853 (2d Cir. 1970), instructed that a state\u2019s withdrawal of the \u201cprivilege\u201d of residing in a public housing project was onerous enough to require it to provide those affected with adequate advance notice, a hearing, access to adverse evidence, cross-examination of adverse witnesses, full disclosure of rules governing the hearing, and a reasoned decision based solely on the evidence adduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Somewhat closer in point to the present case is Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967). The court held that representation of petitioners by counsel was essential to the fairness of their deferred sentencing proceedings.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The imposition of sentence had been suspended and the petitioners placed on probation. In the proceedings under review, defendants were faced with both sentencing and imprisonment on the first convictions for committing second offenses while out on probation. The Supreme Court determined that defendants should have been represented by counsel. Legal skills, the Court reasoned, would have aided petitioners in \u201cmarshalling the facts\u201d and might have ensured that important legal rights were not lost because unexercised at that stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Federal courts disagree as to the reach of <em>Mempa </em>to probation revocation proceedings generally. <em>See </em>the extensive citation of cases in Hewett v. North Carolina, 415 F.2d 1316, 1322 (4th Cir. 1969). In <em>Hewett </em>the court decided that counsel was a necessary component of fundamental fairness at a probation revocation hearing, \u201cthe event which makes operative the loss of liberty,\u201d because a trained lawyer might have prevented the admission against defendant of improper evidence, and, through appropriate objections, exceptions, and assignments of error, have preserved defendant\u2019s right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Escalera </em>and <em>Goldberg </em>are persuasive recent authority that states may not avoid the rigors of due process by labelling an action which has serious and onerous consequences as a withdrawal of a \u201cprivilege\u201d rather than a \u201cright.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Mempa </em>warns us that procedural formality may be required in the operation of the criminalization and incarceration process beyond the determination of guilt at trial. Thus, we do not doubt that Sostre was entitled to \u201cdue process of law\u201d before he was punished for an infraction of prison rules. The exaction of segregated confinement was onerous indeed,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and the distinction between a \u201cright\u201d and a \u201cprivilege\u201d- \u2014 or between \u201cliberty\u201d and a \u201cprivilege\u201d for that matter \u2014 is nowhere more meaningless than behind prison walls.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The difficult question, as always, is what process was due. In answering that question, we may not uncritically adopt the holdings of decisions that take color from contexts where the shadings are as different from the instant case as the cases we have discussed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">[A]s a generalization, it can be said that due process embodies the differing rules of fair play, which through the years, have become associated with differing types of proceedings. Whether the Constitution requires that a particular right obtain in a specific proceeding depends upon a complexity of factors. The nature of the alleged right involved, the nature of the proceeding, and the possible burden on that proceeding, are all considerations which must be taken into account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 442, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 1515, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Beyond the process of guilt determination and initial incarceration, courts have displayed greater reluctance to import all the trappings of formal due process. Thus, a panel of this court has recently held that formal trial-type due process is not a requirement in connection with a parole <em>release </em>determination. Menechino v. Oswald, 430 F.2d 403 (1970).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Like the relationship between Menechino and the parole board, Fol-lette\u2019s relation to Sostre should not be viewed as adversarial in the same sense that a criminal trial is adversarial. Certainly, formal rules of evidence would be entirely inappropriate at a disciplinary proceeding. To dispose sensitively and carefully of each prisoner\u2019s unique case with due regard for the effect of each decision on the total fabric of the prison community, prison authorities must have wide access to relevant information.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Since, in addition, there is no likelihood that substantial rights would be sacrificed if a prisoner failed, for example, to raise a proper objection or to take a timely appeal, the need for legal skills is less acute here than in <em>Mempa, Townsend, </em>or <em>Hewett. </em>Moreover, the evidence as to whether the prisoner has violated a prison regulation is likely to be simpler, more precise, and more readily at hand, than, for example, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>bearing on the question whether welfare payments should be terminated. There is correspondingly less need for cross-examination and calling of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Most important, we think it inadvisable for a federal court to pass judgment one way or another as to the truly decisive consideration, whether formal due process requirements would be likely to help or to hinder in the state\u2019s endeavor to preserve order and discipline in its prisons and to return a rehabilitated individual to society. It would be too simplistic to dissociate the impact of punishment meted out after a disciplinary hearing from the method by which the hearing itself is conducted. As one court has observed: \u201cThe association</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">between men in correction institutions is closer and more fraught with physical danger and psychological pressures than is almost any other kind of association between human beings.\u201d Edwards v. Sard, 250 F.Supp. 977, 981 (D.D.C. 1966). It is sad but true that the study of the prison subculture by psychologists and sociologists has until recently been largely neglected. Those who have looked into the problem, however, do not gainsay the volatility of relationships among prisoners and prison officials. See, e. g., Corrections 46-47; Gibbons, Changing the Law Breaker 200-12 (1965). We would not presume to fashion a constitutional harness of nothing more than our guesses. It would be mere speculation for us to decree that the effect of equipping prisoners with more elaborate constitutional weapons against the administration of discipline by prison authorities would be more soothing to the prison atmosphere and rehabilitative of the prisoner or, on the other hand, more disquieting and destructive of remedial ends. This is a judgment entrusted to state officials, not federal judges.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">We are particularly unwilling to interfere with state administrative processes when reliable, detailed information or empirical studies are as scanty as they are on the subject of prison disciplinary procedures. See Corrections at 16; D. Glaser, The Effectiveness of a Prison and Parole System 172 (1964) (\u201cprison discipline * * * has not received extensive objective research by anyone\u201d). Judge Learned Hand wisely instructed us \u201c [c] onstitutions are deliberately made difficult of amendment; mistaken readings of them cannot easily be corrected. Moreover, if they could be, constitutions must not degenerate into <em>vade mecums </em>or codes; when they begin to do so, it is a sign of a community unsure of itself and seeking protection against its own misgivings.\u201d The Spirit of Liberty 179 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Analogies and recommendations called to our attention do not go far to advance Sostre\u2019s position. Neither the Model Penal Code nor the Manual of the American Correctional Association would require confrontation and cross-examination, calling of witnesses by the prisoner, counsel or counsel substitute, or a written statement of evidence and rationale.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Similarly, Rhode Island has voluntarily adopted new disciplinary procedures for its prisons, under court supervision, Morris v. Travisono, 310 F. Supp. 857 (D.R.I.1970), which include provisions for a hearing, advance written notice, and assistance by a prison of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ficer, but no other of the formal safeguards required by Judge Motley\u2019s injunction. Sostre has referred us to rules adopted for the Missouri State Penitentiary, under which prisoners are assisted during a disciplinary proceeding by a member of the prison staff and where there must be a written summary of the disciplinary proceeding, including a statement of relevant evidence. Personnel Information Pamphlet: Rules and Procedures 3-4 (Sept.1967)'. Again, however, there is no provision for calling witnesses or cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Indeed, it appears that, among those practices known to us, only in the federal correctional system must a formal proceeding, including each of the elements in the district court\u2019s mandate, precede <em>forfeiture of good time </em>allowances. Bureau of Prisons, Policy Statement: Withholding, Forfeiture, and Restoration of Good Time (No. 7400.6 Dec. 1, 1966). Notably, however, these formalities need <em>not </em>accompany discipline that results in the <em>withholding </em>of good time credit, as Judge Motley would require.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We therefore find ourselves in disagreement with Judge Motley\u2019s eon-clusion that each of the procedural elements incorporated in her mandatory injunction are necessary constitutional ingredients of every proceeding resulting in serious discipline of a prisoner. In thus rejecting Judge Motley\u2019s conclusions, however,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we are not to be understood as disapproving the judgment of many courts that our constitutional scheme does not contemplate that society may commit lawbreakers to the capricious and arbitrary actions of prison officials.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> If substantial deprivations are to be visited upon a prisoner, it is wise that such action should at least be premised on facts rationally determined. This is not a concept without meaning. In most cases it would probably be difficult to find an inquiry minimally fair and rational unless the prisoner were confronted with the accusation, informed of the evidence against him, see Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965); Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950), and afforded a reasonable opportunity to explain his actions.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> See Nolan v.

Inmates lose contact with the outside world and become wary of placing intimate thoughts or criticisms of the prison in letters. The artificial increase of alienation from society is ill advised.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">The values commonly associated with free expression \u2014 an open, democratic marketplace of ideas, the self-development of individuals through self-expression, the alleviation of tensions by their release in harsh words rather than hurled objects \u2014 these values that we esteem in a free society do not turn to dross in an unfree one. \u201cLetter writing keeps the inmate in contact with the outside world, helps to hold in cheek some of the morbidity and hopelessness produced by prison life and isolation, stimulates his more natural and human impulses, and otherwise may make contributions to better mental attitudes and reformation.\u201d Palmigiano v. Travisono, 310 F.Supp. 857 (D.R.I. Aug. 24, 1970). Suppression of diversity and dissenting views is probably not less apt in a prison than elsewhere to hasten the stagnation and bureaucratization of the institution that indulges in it. See T. Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment 3-15 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">Whatever wisdom there might be in such reflection, we cannot say with requisite certitude that the traditional and common practice of prisons in imposing many kinds of controls on the correspondence of inmates, lacks support in any rational and constitutionally acceptable concept of a prison system. See McCloskey v. Maryland, 337 F.2d 72, 74-75 (4th Cir. 1964) (\u201cControl of the mail to and from inmates is an essential adjunct of prison administration\u201d). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>also, Diehl v. Wainwright, 419 F.2d 1309 (5th Cir. 1970); Abernathy v. Cunningham, 393 F.2d 775 (4th Cir. 1968); United States v. Stahl, 393 F.2d 101 (7th Cir.) cert. denied 393 U.S. 879, 89 S.Ct. 181, 21 L.Ed.2d 152 (1968); Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483, 485 (8th Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We note that Sostre did not contest the validity of Warden Follette\u2019s action in striking the name of his sister from the list of Sostre\u2019s authorized correspondents after it was learned that he was using letters addressed to his sister as vehicles for unauthorized correspondence. <em>See </em>fn. 4, <em>supra. </em>Discipline and prison order are sufficient interests to justify such regulation incidental to the content of prisoners\u2019 speech. See Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949); Brennan, The Supreme Court and the Meikeljohn Interpretation of the First Amendment, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 11 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><em>Sui generis </em>in both logic and the case law, however, are letters addressed to courts, public officials, or an attorney when a prisoner challenges the legality of either his criminal conviction or tHe conditions of his incarceration. See, e. g., Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969); Cochran v. Kansas, 316 U.S. 255, 62 S.Ct. 1068, 86 L.Ed. 1453 (1942); Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L. Ed. 1034 (1941); Coleman v. Peyton, 362 F.2d 905, 907 (4th Cir. 1966) (no censorship permitted of mail between inmate and court with jurisdiction to hear prisoner\u2019s complaints); McCloskey v. Maryland, <em>supra; </em>Stiltner v. Rhay, 322 F.2d 314, 316 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 920, 84 S.Ct. 678, 11 L.Ed.2d 615 (1963) (\u201creasonable access to the courts is basic to all other rights protected by\u201d the Civil Rights Act). It would be inappropriate on constitutional grounds, ironic, and irrational to permit drastic curtailment of constitutional rights in the name of punishment and rehabilitation, while denying prisoners a full opportunity to pursue their appeals and posteonviction remedies. The generous scope of discretion accorded prison authorities also heightens the importance of permitting free and uninhibited access by prisoners to both administrative and judicial forums for the purpose of seeking redress of grievances against state officers. The importance of these rights of access suggests the need for guidelines both generous and specific enough to afford protection against the reality or the chilling threat of administrative infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Thus, we do not believe it would unnecessarily hamper prison administration to forbid prison authorities to delete material from, withhold, or refuse to mail a communication between an inmate and his attorney, see Burns v. Swensen, 430 F.2d 771, (8th Cir., Aug. 31, 1970) (protecting correspondence with the ACLU), or any court, or any public official, unless it can be demonstrated that a prisoner has clearly abused his rights of access. Obviously, the transmittal of contraband or laying plans for some unlawful scheme would constitute such an abuse. In addition, if it were clear that a prisoner\u2019s recitation of complaints about his confinement in otherwise protected correspondence were a mere pretext to accomplish his sole motivating purpose of communicating instead about restricted matters, then prison officials may block the inmate\u2019s scheme by deleting that portion of such a communication unrelated to the complaints. See Carothers v. Follette, 314 F.Supp. 1014 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 15, 1970); In re Ferguson, 55 Cal. 2d 663, 12 Cal.Rptr. 753, 361 P.2d 417, cert. denied sub nom. Ferguson v. Heinze, 368 U.S. 864, 82 S.Ct. 111. 7 L. Ed.2d 61 (1961). In such a case, the need to restrain the abuse outweighs the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>danger that prison authorities may by inadvertence or design hamper the prisoner\u2019s access.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">On the other hand, if a communication is properly intended to advance a prisoner\u2019s effort to secure redress for alleged abuses, no interest would justify deleting material thought by prison authorities to be irrelevant to the prisoner\u2019s complaint. The danger that an official will improperly substitute his judgment for that of the correspondent\u2019s then preponderates. For similar reasons, prison officials may not withhold, refuse to mail, or delete material from otherwise protected communications merely because they believe the allegations to be repetitious, false, or malicious. See Nolan v. Scafati, 430 F. 2d 548 (1st Cir. 1970) (absent some countervailing interest other than that prisoner\u2019s letter contained \u201clies,\u201d authorities may not prevent inmate from seeking legal assistance); Fulwood v. Clemmer, 206 F.Supp. 370, 377 (D.D.C.1962) (right to seek redress of grievances was abridged by punishment for alleged false accusations about prison conditions in prisoner\u2019s letter of complaint to public officials).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Accordingly, we agree with Judge Motley that it was improper for Warden Follette to delete material from correspondence between Sostre and his attorney merely because Follette thought the material irrelevant to Sostre\u2019s appeal of his conviction. We believe it was also improper for Follette to refuse to mail a letter of complaint to the Postal Inspector. We leave a more precise delineation of the boundaries of this protection for future cases. We need only add that when we say there may be eases which will present special circumstances that <em>would </em>justify deleting material from, withholding, or refusing to mail communications with courts, attorneys, and public officials, we necessarily rule that prison officials may open and read all outgoing and incoming correspondence to and from prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">B. <em>Prisoner Legal Aid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969), instructs that states must permit prisoners to help fellow inmates prepare habeas corpus petitions, subject to reasonable regulation, absent a sufficient showing by the state that through some other means it provides prisoners with an adequate substitute for the \u201cjailhouse lawyer.\u201d Cf. Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034 (1941) (state may not require that habeas petition be approved by a corrections official to see that it was \u201cproperly drawn\u201d); Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F. Supp. 105 (N.D.Cal., filed May 28, 1970) (3-judge court) (woefully inadequate prison law library <em>held </em>unlawfully restricts prisoners\u2019 access to courts). The failure of any such showing in this case makes it mandatory that New York permit prisoner aid to the extent required by <em>Johnson. Johnson\u2019s </em>explicit permission to states reasonably to regulate this right, however, validates the Green Haven rule requiring prisoners to apply to the Warden for permission to help other inmates with legal activities. There would be a violation of <em>Johnson </em>only if the Warden denied permission, or if the conditions on which he granted it were unreasonable.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Since Sostre never requested permission, there is no cause for an injunction to enforce the <em>Johnson </em>rule. We assume that permission would be granted as a matter of course, subject only to reasonable conditions. Nor can we consider unreasonable the Green Ha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ven rule forbidding prisoners from sharing their personal law books with one another. This regulation would not prohibit Sostre, for example, from recommending legal source material to other inmates. We do not see how they would be unduly burdened by being required to acquire the books through prison officials<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> rather than directly from Sostre. See Gilmore v. Lynch, <em>supra, </em>(upholding prison rule prohibiting jailhouse lawyers from keeping in their cells legal material pertaining to other prisoners). In a closely related situation, we held that a prisoner could be refused permission to keep \u201claw books\u201d in his cell where there was no allegation he was denied use of the prison library. Williams v. Wilkins, 315 F.2d 396, 397 (2d Cir. 1963). We cannot ignore the concern of prison officials that strong-willed inmates might exact hidden and perhaps non-monetary fees in return for nominally free privileges at the inmates\u2019 private lending library.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">C. <em>Possession of Literature and Mere Expression of Beliefs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Our holding that prisoners may not be punished for their beliefs carries the necessary corollary that we may not permit punishment for the mere expression of those beliefs. One can hardly speak of beliefs apart from their expression, cf. Fulwood v. Clemmer, 206 F. Supp. 370 (D.D.C.1962). In the absence of arbitrariness or discrimination, see Jackson v. Godwin, 400 F.2d 529 (5th Cir. 1968); Rivers v. Royster, 360 F.2d 592 (4th Cir. 1966); Sewell v. Pegelow, 291 F.2d 196 (4th Cir. 1961), and Pierce v. LaVallee, 293 F.2d 233 (2d Cir. 1961), we do not say on this record that Warden Follette would have exceeded his legitimate authority if he had confiscated the writings that guards found in Sos-tre\u2019s cell following his release from segregation. Whatever doubts we might have as to the wisdom of seizing an inmate\u2019s political writings, we would not lightly overturn a warden\u2019s judgment that possession of the writings might subvert prison discipline if there existed the risk of their circulation among other prisoners.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">However, Sostre was <em>punished </em>simply for putting his thoughts on paper, with no prior warning and no hint that he intended to spirit the writings outside his cell. To sanction such punishment, even though in the judgment of prison officials the writings were \u201cinflammatory\u201d and \u201cracist,\u201d as in the instant case, would permit prison authorities to manipulate and crush thoughts under the guise of regulation. The intimidating threat of future similar punishment would chill a wide range of prisoner expression, not limited to that expression which Follette might in fact deem dangerous enough to discipline. The danger of undetected discriminatory punishment of ideas is particularly acute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>in the absence of statutory standards to guide the exercise of Follette\u2019s discretion. See, e. g., Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 556-557, 85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed. 2d 471 (1965); Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939). Any real threat to prison security that Sostre\u2019s possession of his writings might have posed could have been met by confiscation rather than punishment. See Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Because of the nature of this case, the multitude and complexity of claims raised and the extent of Judge Motley\u2019s considered opinion and the injunctive and other relief granted, we have been compelled to engage in this protracted exegesis. In light of what we have set forth, our conclusions follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">A. <em>Injunctive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">1. Although not necessary to the disposition of Sostre\u2019s complaint, the district court held that several elements of trial-type procedure, enumerated in its order, were required by due process in every instance of prisoner discipline resulting in withholding of good time credit to the prisoner or loss of his opportunity to earn good time. Because of the importance of the question to the state of New York, and the frequency with which similar questions are being litigated in district courts of this jurisdiction, we are compelled to say that the district court was in error. All of the elements of due process recited by the district court are not necessary to the constitutionality of every disciplinary action taken against a prisoner. In light of this, we reverse the district court insofar as it enjoined defendants and others from so disciplining Sostre that he loses accrued good time credit or is unable to earn good time credit without full compliance with all the procedural steps set forth in Judge Motley\u2019s injunction. We do not thereby imply that discipline in New York prisons may be administered arbitrarily or capriciously. We would not lightly condone the absence of such basic safeguards against arbitrariness as adequate notice, an opportunity for the prisoner to reply to charges lodged against him, and a reasonable investigation into the relevant facts \u2014 at least in cases of substantial discipline. However, as consideration of Sostre\u2019s ease does not properly raise any question whether New York prisons regularly or systematically ignore minimal due process requirements, we must reverse the order of the district court that defendants submit for its approval, proposed rules and regulations governing future disciplinary actions. In this connection, we note that New York State has recently promulgated rules and regulations governing prison discipline which appear to give inmates new procedural protections.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">2. The refusal to mail Sostre\u2019s letter to the Post Office Inspector, complaining of prison practices, clearly infringed Sostre\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights. We also affirm Judge Motley\u2019s order insofar as it enjoins defendants Follette and McGinnis, their employees, agents, successors, and all persons in active concert and participation with them, from deleting material from, refusing to mail or refusing to give to Sostre: (1) Any communication between Sostre and the following \u2014 (a) any court; (b) any public official or agency; or (c) any lawyer \u2014with respect to either his criminal conviction or any complaint he may have concerning the administration of the prison where he is incarcerated. We reverse, however, insofar as Judge Motley enjoined nonarbitrary restraint of communication between Sostre and his co-defendant in the criminal matter pending against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">3. There is no cause for an injunction to enforce the principles announced in Johnson v. Avery, <em>supra, </em>since no infractions of those principles have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>shown. Johnson v. Avery permitted reasonable rules regulating the conduct of inmates in assisting other inmates in legal proceedings. Sostre has not proved that the rules regulating his right to assist other prisoners in their legal affairs were unreasonable and that his punishment was for violating such rules. Therefore, we must reverse the district court insofar as it enjoined interference with Sostre\u2019s translation of letters of fellow-inmates since he had failed to comply with the rule requiring that he seek permission of the warden. For the same reason, we reverse the injunction against punishing Sostre for sharing with other inmates his law books, law reviews, and other legal materials, and from refusing to permit Sostre to assist any other inmate in any legal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">4. We have held that Sostre was improperly punished for possession of constitutionally protected literature. We perceive no reason, however, to set <em>political </em>speech apart from other kinds of constitutionally protected speech. We therefore modify the district court order so as to enjoin defendants Follette and McGinnis, their employees, agents, successors, and all persons in active concert and participation with them, from punishing Sostre for having literature in his possession and for setting forth his views orally or in writing, except for violation of reasonable regulations. We do not hereby enjoin officials from taking reasonable measures to prevent prisoners from inciting disturbances and otherwise to protect the security and order of New York prisons, consistent with prisoners\u2019 rights to freedom of expression. Also we do not believe that there is any need for the extraordinary procedure requiring defendants to submit rules and regulations governing the receipt, distribution, discussion and .writing of political literature for the approval of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">5. We have no reason to conclude that New York prison officials will not abide by the constitutional rights of prisoners as we define them today. We have refused to set aside Judge Motley\u2019s findings that Warden Follette unlawfully committed Sostre to segregated confinement because of his legal activities and beliefs. Warden Follette, however, is deceased and we perceive no threat that others will duplicate his improper conduct. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the district court order which enjoined defendants and others from returning Sostre to punitive segregation for charges previously preferred against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">B. <em>Good Time Credit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Since we have held that Sostre was unlawfully confined to punitive segregation on account of his political beliefs and legal activities, we agree with Judge Motley\u2019s order requiring Sostre to be credited with 124% days of earned \u201cgood time.\u201d Sostre may not be penalized because of his time in segregation by remaining incarcerated longer or by becoming eligible for parole later than he otherwise would. We do not consider the argument that Sostre may not have earned the credit even if he had remained in the general population to be of substance. Whether he would or would not have earned it is pure speculation. Since Sostre\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated, we resolve the doubt in his favor. Moreover, this is the only feasible way to ensure that Sostre is not again unlawfully penalized by arbitrary action.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">C. Money. <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> All parties seem to agree upon two principles with which we also are in accord. First, Section 1983 authorizes recovery of compensatory, and, in an appropriate case, punitive damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>against an individual for the unjustifiable violation of constitutional rights \u201cunder color\u201d of state law. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed.2d 492 (1961); Basista v. Weir, 340 F.2d 74 (3rd Cir. 1965). This liability, however, is entirely personal in nature intended to be satisfied out of the individual\u2019s own pocket. Moreover, the doctrine of sovereign immunity, as codified by the Eleventh Amendment, bars the exaction of a fine from a state treasury without the state\u2019s consent, at least on account of tortious actions committed by its agents under the circumstances of this case. Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949); Westberry v. Fisher, 309 F.Supp. 12 (D.Me.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">It follows from these principles <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> that although Sostre was entitled to compensatory damages against Warden Follette,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Follette\u2019s successor as warden, who had no part whatsoever in Follette\u2019s wrongful conduct against Sostre, incurred no personal money responsibility upon Follette\u2019s death. We note also that no application was made in the court below to substitute any party who could be held responsible to assume Follette\u2019s obligation to Sostre, Rule 25, F.R.Civ.P., if such a party existed. Accordingly, there is no party before us against whom appropriately to award damages.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In any event, we are persuaded to reverse the award of punitive damages. Warden Follette\u2019s improper conduct in segregating Sostre so far as appears reflected no pattern of such behavior by himself or by other officials. The deterrent impact of a punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">award would be of minimal use. See Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291, 303 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied sub nom. Troster, Singer &amp; Co. v.

We strongly suspect that many traditional and still widespread penal practices, including some which we have touched on in this case, take an enormous toll, not just of the prisoner who must tolerate them at whatever price to his humanity and prospects for a normal future life, but also of the society where prisoners return angry and resentful. Nevertheless, we would forget at our peril and at the peril of our free governmental process, that we are federal judges reviewing decisions made in due course by officers of a sovereign state. We have interpreted and applied the law as it appears to us in light of circumstance and principle. We do not doubt the magnitude of the task ahead before our correctional systems become acceptable and effective from a correctional, social and humane viewpoint, but the proper tools for the job do not lie with a remote federal court. The sensitivity to local nuance, opportunity for daily perseverance, and the human and monetary resources required lie rather with legislators, executives, and citizens in their communities.

Sostre admitted the infraction, which Follette claimed to have been under in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>vestigation as early as June 25, the day he committed Sostre to segregation.

Judge Feinberg expresses the view in his dissent, that \u201cisolation of an adult prisoner for a sharply limited period as punishment for a serious breach of prison discipline\u201d would be constitutional. But then he goes on to ask rhetorically whether solitary or segregated confinement \u201cfor two years instead.of one, or for five years, or for ten, or more,\u201d would be constitutional. We have made an effort to suggest the impracticality of setting any specific time period for segregated confinement, beyond which the punishment would be \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d In some instances, depending upon the \u2022 conditions of the segregation, and the mental and physical health of the inmate, five days or even one day might prove to be constitutionally intolerable.

In response to Judge Feinberg\u2019s dissent, we emphasize that no one testified that based on his observation or as the result of a physical or psychological examination of Sostre, he concluded that Sostre was being adversely affected or that his physical or mental health was threatened. We note that the record shows that a prison physician visited Sostre\u2019s segregation unit daily, and at no time did the physician observe, or did Sostre call to his attention, any such effects.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa8Y\">Indeed, the experts before the district court were in conflict even over the hypothetical question whether the conditions that Sostre experienced in segregation would be dangerous to the sanity of \u201ca prisoner.\u201d See p. 190 and fn. 11, <em>supra. </em>On the basis of these conflicting expert opinions, Judge Feinberg observes that the district court found as a fact that, these conditions \u201ccould only serve to * * * undermine the sanity of the prisoner\u201d * * * when imposed for more than fifteen days. We do not agree with our brother that we are required to declare this \u201cfinding\u201d to be either right or wrong, either \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d or adequately supported by the record and therefore correct. We are not concerned here with conflicting testimony of witnesses to the same <em>unique </em>historical event. The question, rather, is a <em>general-one: </em>whether the Eighth Amendment absolutely forbids a state to use a means of discipline when there is no evidence of any physical or psychological injury to the health of the prisoner who complains of the measure, and also when the opinions of the experts as to the effects of the <em>type </em>of discipline are in conflict. To hold the district court either right or wrong would be tantamount to ruling that either Dr. Ilalleck or Dr. Johnston is right, and the other is wrong. That is not our function, nor was it the function of the district court.

Nevertheless, I am concerned that the discussion there with reference to Due Process rights of a state prisoner who is threatened with loss of good time credit or with a loss of the chance to earn such credit because of an alleged infraction of prison rules would seem inaccurately to portray the obligation of a federal court asked to \u201cinterfere with state administrative processes\u201d on constitutional grounds. I submit that it is our duty, mandated by the U. S. Constitution, authorized by Congress,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and demanded by conscience, to strike down any practice sanctioned by a State which does not conform to at least minimally acceptable levels of due process. The court, aptly noting that appellant has asked us to determine what process is constitutionally due him, a convicted and imprisoned felon, declines to determine the \u201ctruly decisive issue\u201d because it lacks empiric information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While I most assuredly agree that studies and surveys and the presentation thereof to us might provide further information of value in balancing competing interests, their absence should never mean that the federal courts will ignore or condone state activity obviously violative of individual rights when that activity is indulged in under the guise of preserving order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">.

JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ACP\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">I agree with most of Judge Kaufman\u2019s thoughtful and thorough opinion, but disagree in two respects and therefore dissent in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">I agree with Judge Feinberg that the district court\u2019s finding that Sostre\u2019s segregation for more than one year was cruel and unusual punishment is supported by the record. Punishment of a nature found likely to bring about an inmate\u2019s insanity should be proscribed whether or not it is shown to have succeeded in doing so in the particular case, and whether or not it could be alleviated by \u201csubmission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">This requires also, it seems to me, that recovery against McGinnis be upheld. The court found (and Judge Kaufman\u2019s opinion emphasizes, page 182 and page 189) that McGinnis had been fully informed as to Sostre\u2019s long segregation, a finding supported by the Fol-lette deposition testimony and exhibits, and had done nothing to terminate it although empowered to do so, and although he knew Follette had kept men in segregation for periods as long as four and five years in the past. Follette was liable in damages to Sostre for violation of his civil rights, and I would rule that McGinnis was properly held also liable. I would not, however, assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>exemplary in addition to compensatory damages against McGinnis under these circumstances.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b265-5\">FEINBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"au-dedup-0\">(dissenting and concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Because I agree with most of the exhaustive majority opinion, I regret that I find it necessary to dissent from the treatment of the cruel and unusual punishment point and from the reversal as to defendant McGinnis. As to the former, the majority opinion reaches three results, from each of which I dissent. The most important of these is the refusal to hold that there must be a definite limit on how long a prisoner may be kept in punitive segregation, or solitary confinement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority holds that for \u201cserious\u201d offenses, the Constitution requires no limit so long as the prisoner has the option of submitting to prison discipline. Second, the majority holds that Sostre\u2019s alleged offenses considered together would have been \u201cserious,\u201d if Warden Follette had acted for proper motives. Third, even though the warden\u2019s motives were \u201cimproper,\u201d the majority refuses to rule that Sostre\u2019s punishment was cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Before considering these three aspects of the majority opinion, it must be emphasized that Sostre was segregated for over a year and, as Judge Motley noted, would in all likelihood still be effectively isolated but for the intervention of the district court. There is an intimation in the majority opinion that Sostre was not effectively cut off from usual day to day contact with other human beings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the district judge\u2019s opinion makes clear that he was. The district judge and the majority both agree that \u201cthe crux of the matter is human isolation,\u201d and the district court opinion sets forth in mel-</p>\n<p id=\"pAXG\">ancholy detail the conditions that were imposed upon Sostre and the reasons why. I will not repeat them here except to note that the full vindictive flavor of defendants\u2019 treatment of Sostre is indicated by one incident, relegated to a footnote in the majority opinion. The day after Judge Motley ordered Sostre\u2019s release from over a year of segregation, he was again disciplined for having \u201cdust on his cell bars.\u201d This caused him to miss the regular July 4th celebration, which would have brought him in contact with prisoners from another part of the prison, such contact being permitted only once a year on July 4. Judge Motley found that the punishment was imposed upon Sostre in retaliation for his legal success before her.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The district judge found that the isolation imposed on Sostre was \u201cdangerous to the maintenance of sanity\u201d and \u201c \u2018could only serve to destroy completely the spirit and undermine the sanity of the prisoner.\u2019 \u201d 312 F.Supp. 863, 868, 871 (S.D.N.Y.1970), quoting Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 526 (2d Cir. 1967). This was a finding of fact. The judge also concluded as a matter of law that \u201csubjecting a prisoner to the demonstrated risk of the loss of his sanity as punishment for any offense in prison is plainly cruel and unusual punishment as judged by the present standards of decency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 871. The majority opinion does not make explicit whether it overrules the judge\u2019s finding of fact, although it hints that it does.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But in order to reverse the district court on this issue the majority must hold either that Judge Motley\u2019s finding of fact is clearly erroneous or that, even if true, the punishment imposed on Sostre did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment as a matter of law. Neither holding would be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>As to the first, it is difficult to see how Judge Motley\u2019s factual finding that Sostre\u2019s isolation threatened sanity could be characterized as clearly erroneous. Testimony at trial from experts with impressive credentials clearly supported that finding. Dr. Halleck, in response to a hypothetical question outlining the conditions of Sostre\u2019s punishment, stated that they could undermine the prisoner\u2019s sanity. Sol Rubin supported that view. It is true that Dr. Johnston, testifying for the State, disagreed. But while the district judge, as trier of fact, was free to believe the experts for plaintiff or for defendants, we may do neither. The trial judge chose to believe the former, and I do not see how her finding on this evidence can be characterized as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On the second assumption, what the majority does is to hold that Sostre\u2019s lengthy, unlimited isolation, which was \u201cdangerous\u201d to his sanity, does not violate the eighth amendment. With deference, I disagree. The standard for determining \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d has been expressed in a number of ways, all imprecise; e. g., \u201cthe wanton infliction of pain,\u201d Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 463, 67 S.Ct. 374, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947); conduct which \u201cshocks the most fundamental instincts of civilized man,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 473, 67 S.Ct. at 381 (dissenting opinion); a method of punishment which violates the \u201cevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,\u201d Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). These notions are, of course, subjective to some extent. What may be safely said is that the amendment prohibits \u201ca hard core of inhuman conduct,\u201d see 84 Harv.L.Rev. 456, 457 (1970). There is no doubt, as the majority concedes, that a prisoner is not a constitutional pariah. Were that not the case, there would be no basis for the holding that the first amendment was violated here. But the eighth amendment, no less than the first, protects Sostre.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its command is both spacious and changing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The fact that solitary confinement for an indefinite period has historically been accepted as a viable instrument of prison discipline does not prevent us from finding that it violates the eighth amendment. What might once have been acceptable does not necessarily determine what is \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d today. Recently, the Eighth Circuit has held that whipping by strap is proscribed, although it had once been a familiar practice. Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571 (8th Cir. 1968). Indeed, this court emphasized only a few years ago that the eighth amendment \u201cis not fastened to the obsolete.\u201d See Wright v. McMann, <em>supra, </em>387 F.2d at 525, quoting Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 378, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910). In this Orwellian age, punishment that endangers sanity, no less than physical injury by the strap, is prohibited by the Constitution. Indeed, we have learned to our sorrow in the last few decades that true inhumanity seeks to destroy the psyche rather than merely the body. The majority opinion emphasizes that after all Sostre could have obtained release from isolation at any time by agreeing to abide by the rules and to cooperate. Perhaps that is so, but that does not change the case. That response could be made were a prisoner kept in solitary for two years instead of one, or for five years, or for ten, or more. The possibility of endless solitary confinement is still there, unless the prisoner \u201cgives in.\u201d The same observation could be made if Sostre were tortured until he so agreed, but no one would argue that torture is therefore permitted. The point is that the means used to exact submission must be constitutionally acceptable, and the threat of virtually endless isolation that endangers sanity is not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The crucial holding of the majority-opinion is the refusal to put any limit upon the period of solitary confinement. It is the unusual duration and the open-ended nature of the isolation that the district court and the experts regarded as inflicting the worst psychological harm. Accordingly, as we did in Wright v. McMann, <em>supra, </em>387 F.2d at 526, I would hold that the punishment here, \u201cwhich could only serve to destroy completely the spirit and undermine the sanity of the prisoner,\u201d runs afoul of the eighth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The second fundamental reason why I differ with the majority opinion stems from the contrast between what it finds necessary to decide and what it refuses to decide. As indicated above, the majority states in an extended dictum that if the warden\u2019s motives had been proper, the combined effect of Sostre\u2019s alleged violations would have been \u201cserious\u201d enough to justify the harsh punishment he received. Thus, the majority stresses \u201cthe seriousness of the multiple offenses charged against Sostre\u201d and expresses \u201cno view as to the constitutionality of such segregated confinement if it had been imposed on account of any one or any combination of the offenses charged against Sostre other than all of them.\u201d But the fact is that two of the allegedly serious \u201cmultiple offenses\u201d were Sostre\u2019s refusal to desist from preparing legal papers for a codefendant and his possession of six tables of contents torn from issues of the Harvard Law Review. I would not hold unconstitutional the isolation of an adult prisoner for a sharply limited period as punishment for a. serious breach of prison discipline, e. g., what the majority calls \u201ca credible threat to the security of the prison,\u201d see p. 194, <em>supra. </em>But these two offenses were simply not grave enough to justify the extremely severe punishment visited upon Sostre. Accordingly, the ex-cessiveness of the penalty for these two alleged transgressions would alone violate the eighth amendment\u2019s proscription of cruel and unusual punishment, and I would say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Finally, while the majority reaches out to decide that Sostre\u2019s confinement would have been constitutional under a hypothetical set of facts, it refuses to rule that his punishment was cruel and unusual even though it was actually meted out for improper reasons. It is true that the majority also leaves open the constitutionality of such \u201cconfinement as Sostre experienced,\u201d if imposed for \u201clesser offenses.\u201d The inconsistency of this approach is apparent since if such confinement, in the majority\u2019s view, could ever be so excessive a penalty as to be unconstitutional, it should be declared so when there was no basis for the confinement at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In sum, keeping Sostre in solitary for over a year was \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d because (1) the length and open-ended nature of his confinement threatened sanity; (2) two of the alleged offenses were so minor as to make the penalty constitutionally disproportionate; and (3) the ostensible reasons were a pretext for vindictive action. I also agree with Judge Smith\u2019s opinion with regard to defendant McGinnis. For the reasons and to the extent set forth above, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">HAYS, Circuit Judge, dissenting (with whom MOORE, Circuit Judge, concurs):</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">I dissent from the affirmance of any grant of injunctive relief or damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">In deciding this ease the majority have overlooked two fundamental guiding principles. The first is that although persons serving sentences in prison for crime are not to be denied all constitutional protections, there are significant differences between the constitutional rights such prisoners may assert and the constitutional rights of those who are free from prison restraints. For example, although the majority holds that Sostre is protected by the Constitution in his right orally to set forth his political opinions to his fellow prisoners, it may be that even they would balk at a claim that the Constitution gave Sostre the right, similar to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>right which he would have if he were free, to assemble the inmates and harangue them with revolutionary political doctrines. As the Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit said in McCloskey v. Maryland, 337 F.2d 72, 74 (4th Cir. 1964) , persons in prison have \u201cno judicially enforceable right to propagandize within the prison walls * * The other fundamental principle which receives short shrift at the hands of the majority is that the federal courts should be extremely hesitant to take over the administration of state prisons. We have said that the federal courts should refuse to interfere with the internal affairs of state prisons except in the most extreme case involving \u201c \u2018conduct that shocks the conscience\u2019 \u201d or where the acts of prison officials are \u201c \u2018barbarous.\u2019 \u201d Church v. Hegstrom, 416 F.2d 449, 450-451 (2d Cir. 1969) (citations omitted). See also Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 527-528 (2d Cir. 1967) (Lumbard, Ch. J., concurring); Sostre v.

Correction authorities must have wide discretion in matters of internal prison administration. Smith v. Schneckloth, 414 F.2d 680, 681 (9th Cir. 1969); Beard v. Lee, 396 F.2d 749, 751 (5th Cir. 1968); Lee v. Tahash, 352 F.2d 970, 971-972 (8th Cir. 1965) ; McCloskey v. Maryland, <em>supra, </em>337 F.2d at 74; Sostre v. McGinnis, <em>supra, </em>334 F.2d at 908. Their decisions in matters of prison discipline should not be disturbed when they are supported by evidence and do not result in shocking deprivations of fundamental human rights. See Wright v. McMann, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In the present ease Warden Follette testified that Sostre\u2019s punishment was based upon (1) defiance of Follette\u2019s order to desist from preparing legal papers, (2) refusal to answer proper questions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) statements about his impending liberation, and (4) possession of several items of contraband in his cell.
