The petition was granted on the basis of appellee\u2019s prior use of \u201cPLATINUM PLUS\u201d as a trademark for a haircoloring preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">Both parties filed stipulated testimony below together with accompanying exhibits. There is no dispute as to the asserted facts. These facts show that ap-pellee was the prior user of its mark, that the products involved are substantially similar competing preparations sold through identical trade channels, and that each party has marketed a substantial number of units of its respective products.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-20\">Appellant, in the proceeding below and in its brief here, has referred to a number of third party registrations, apparently as indicating that appellee\u2019s mark is a weak one. While third party registrations are to be considered, they are of little help and not controlling as to the single determinative issue we have before us, which is, of course, whether the marks are so similar that when applied to the respective goods they are likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception. See In re Belgrade Shoe Co., 411 F.2d 1352, 56 C.C.P.A. 1298 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-21\">At this point we note that the board, in defining the issue, used the phrase \u201cconfusingly similar.\u201d Under the circumstances of this case, that characterization of the issue might technically be correct. Nevertheless, we feel that the perpetuation of that phrase confuses the true issue to be determined under the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do feel, however, that the board in its opinion correctly addressed the subject at hand in holding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-22\">While we must agree that the word \u201cPLATINUM\u201d is indicative of color and that the marks here involved are used as secondary marks, we nevertheless cannot ignore the word \u201cPLATINUM\u201d in petitioner\u2019s mark or the fact that the marks with which we are here concerned are \u201cPLATINUM PUFF\u201d and \u201cPLATINUM PLUS\u201d, per se, regardless of the fact that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>plicant\u2019s mark may be used in conjunction with another mark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">We also agree that while \u201cPLUS\u201d and \u201cPUFF\u201d may well have different meanings by themselves, this difference alone does not overcome the conclusion that when the marks are viewed in their en-tireties a likelihood of confusion exists. See In re Helene Curtis Industries, Inc., 305 F.2d 492, 49 C.C.P.A. 1367 (1962). Nor is the fact that there have been no instances of actual confusion controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">In short, it is our opinion that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was correct in holding that appellant\u2019s mark so closely resembles appellee\u2019s mark \u201cPLATINUM PLUS\u201d that, when applied to the goods here involved, it is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive. The decision of that board is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">NEWMAN, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">.
