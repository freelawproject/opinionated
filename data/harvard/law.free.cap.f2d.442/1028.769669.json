In the course of this examination, plaintiff reported, in response to a question concerning any earlier accident, injury or illness, that he had had tuberculosis in 1950. He did not, however, reveal that he once received medical attention for warts on the sole of his right foot. The defendant\u2019s physician x-rayed plaintiff\u2019s chest and found him unfit for duty solely on the basis of suspected tuberculosis. Plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>pursuing his rights under his union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement, obtained another physical examination from the United States Public Health Service Outpatient Clinic in New York City. Since he was found fit for duty he was given employment on defendant\u2019s vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">While plaintiff was serving aboard the \u201cGreen Port\u201d from October 9, 1964 to January 29, 1965, a period of 112 days, there was no recurrence of tuberculosis; but one week before the end of the voyage, a wart developed on the sole of plaintiff\u2019s right foot. Plaintiff obtained a master\u2019s certificate from the \u201cGreen Port\u2019s\u201d chief officer in order to be entitled to medical treatment for the wart. He left the vessel and was treated from February 25, 1965 to August 9, 1965 at the United States Public Health Service Hospital, Staten Island, New York. During this period plaintiff was certified as not fit for duty, and he sought payment of maintenance and cure from the defendant. Upon defendant\u2019s refusal to pay, plaintiff initiated this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court denied the claim for maintenance and cure on the ground that plaintiff failed to disclose to defendant\u2019s examining physician his earlier difficulties with and treatment for a wart on the sole of his right foot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons hereafter set forth we reverse and remand to the district court to fix the amount to be awarded for maintenance and cure, interest, costs, and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">In finding for the defendant, the district court said that a \u201cseaman should provide truthful and complete answers to questions concerning his medical background * <em>* </em>*\u201d and that \u201cconcealment of material medical data prevents entitlement to an award of maintenance and cure * * 305 F.Supp. 1071, 1073 (S.D.N.Y.1969). As authority, McCorpen v. Central Gulf Steamship Corp., 396 F.2d 547 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 894, 89 S.Ct. 223, 21 L.Ed.2d 175 (1968) was cited. The rule of the <em>McCorpen </em>ease, that <em>any </em>concealment of material medical data, prevents an award for maintenance and cure, is not the rule of this Circuit. In Ahmed v. United States, 177 F.2d 898, 900 (2d Cir. 1949), this court held that a seaman \u201cwho believes himself fit for duty and signs on without any fraudulent concealment, is entitled to maintenance and cure, notwithstanding a previous condition of ill health.\u201d The concealment of a previous condition is fraudulent only if the seaman knows or reasonably should know that the concealed condition is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-11\">The record here contains no evidence whatsoever that the plaintiff deliberately suppressed anything which he knew to be relevant. Plaintiff readily revealed his earlier tubercular condition, although that revelation all but cost him his job on the \u201cGreen Port.\u201d Plaintiff testified without contradiction that on the date he joined defendant\u2019s vessel, he felt well and believed himself fully capable of performing his duties. There is no evidence to indicate that he was not in excellent health for the first 109 days of the 112 days which he spent aboard defendant\u2019s vessel. The defendant failed to discharge his burden of demonstrating the falsity of plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he reasonably believed himself fit for duty at the time he joined defendant\u2019s vessel. See Burkert v. Weyerhaeuser Steamship Co., 350 F. 2d 826, 831 (9th Cir. 1965). Nothing in the evidence establishes that plaintiff did not in good faith believe himself fit for duty. An honest failure to disclose his prior condition will not defeat his claim, Ahmed v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Burkert v. Weyerhaeuser Steamship Co., <em>supra; </em>Diaz v. Gulf Oil Corp., 237 F.Supp. 261, 263 (S.D.N.Y.1965) (Feinberg, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1087-13\">. The district court opinion is reported at 305 F.Supp. 1071 (S.D.N.Y.1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
