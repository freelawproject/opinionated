Schoepflin v. United States, 391 F.2d 390 (9th Cir. 1968). He claims to have discovered the \u201ctrue robber\u201d among the inmates of Leavenworth Penitentiary and to have three witnesses to swear the \u201ctrue robber\u201d had confessed. The District Court granted a hearing upon appellant\u2019s motion and the alleged true robber, one Nix, was produced as witness. The court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion was based on its rejection of Nix\u2019s testimony as unworthy of belief. Its refusal to subpoena the three witnesses to Nix\u2019s confession was upon the ground that anything Nix had said to them would be equally unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-19\">We find neither error nor abuse of discretion. Lindsey v. United States, 368 F.2d 633 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
