We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-18\">THE PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-19\">Appellant is a for-profit corporation which conducts beauty contests for young girls, ages five to ten years, at Palisades Amusement Park, New Jersey. It seeks to register the mark \u201cfor promoting the sale of the goods and services of others through the medium of contests.\u201d Chief among those whose goods and services appellant, Palisades Pageants, Inc., has promoted has been Rose-cliff Realty Company, the owner of Palisades Amusement Park, but it has also used the mark in connection with the promotion of the goods and services of various \u201cparticipants\u201d in the annual contests, including a manufacturer of modish clothing for little girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-20\">Appellee is a not-for-profit corporation which conducts beauty contests for young women, ages eighteen to twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>eight years, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. It relies on its common-law rights stemming from use of the mark MISS AMERICA since 1921 and on its Principal Register registration, No. 631,496, issued July 24, 1956, of the same mark for services stated in its registration to be the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-4\">Promotion of education through the granting of scholarships, the recipients being selected in local, state, and national contests, based on such factors as beauty, personality and talent, \u2022X- \u2022* \u2022*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">Money for the scholarships comes from, inter alia, the \u201csponsors\u201d of the pageant, which are for-profit corporations the goods and services of which are promoted in connection with the pageant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-8\">There are three issues. After both sides had taken testimony, appellant moved to amend the statement of services in its application to further distinguish the beauty contests which it runs from the beauty contests run by opposer by adding the words \u201cfor female children between the ages of five and ten\u201d to the description of its beauty contests. The board denied its motion on the ground that the \u201cproposed amendment is [not] determinative of the issues herein,\u201d appellant has appealed the denial here, and the first question is whether we have jurisdiction to determine such an appeal. The second question is likelihood of confusion, and the third question is whether appellee is estopped to oppose appellant\u2019s application by reason of its previous failure to take action to prevent appellant\u2019s use of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-16\">A. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1445-17\">The jurisdiction of this court in trademark matters is set forth in 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1542(2). This section expressly grants us jurisdiction in \u201cappeals from decisions of: * * * the Commissioner of Patents as to trade-mark applications and proceedings as provided in section 1071 of title 15.\u201d Paragraph (a) (1) of the latter section states, inter alia, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-18\">An applicant for registration of a mark, party to an interference proceeding, party to an opposition proceeding, party to an application to register as a lawful concurrent user, party to a cancellation proceeding, a registrant who has filed an affidavit as provided in section 8, or an applicant for renewal, who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner <em>or Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, </em>may appeal to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals * * *. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1445-19\">Despite the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542, appellee is not questioning our jurisdiction to review at least certain decisions of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1445-20\">However, not <em>all </em>\u201cdecisions\u201d of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, in the broad, general sense of the word \u201cdecision,\u201d are appealable to this court any more than are all \u201cdecisions\u201d of the Commissioner, the Patent Office Board of Appeals, or the Board of Patent Interferences. The same appealable versus petitionable dichotomy which obtains in patent matters obtains in trademark matters, In re Railley Corp., 119 F.2d 595, 598-599, 28 CCPA 1122, 1127-1128 (1941), although the question of which side of the line a given matter falls on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>seems to come up less often in the trademark context than in the patent context. Here, the decision of the board dismissing the opposition is clearly appealable, but, as in In re Hengehold, 440 F.2d 1395, 58 CCPA (1971), we must decide whether a secondary decision made in the same case by a tribunal of the Patent Office (there a patent examiner, here the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board) is so \u201clogically related\u201d to the appealable decision that it, too, may be reviewed on appeal. Cf. In re James, 432 F.2d 473, 476, 57 CCPA 1371, 1375 (1970) (concurring opinion of Judge Lane).</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">The jurisdiction-giving issues in this case are whether the service mark LITTLE MISS AMERICA so resembles the service mark MISS AMERICA as to be likely, when applied to the services stated in appellant\u2019s application, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1053, 1052(d), and whether, even if the former does so resemble the latter, the appellee is es-topped from preventing appellant\u2019s registration by reason of laches. 15 U.S.C. 1069. The services described in the application, registration of which has been refused, are \u201cpromoting the sale of the goods and services of others through the medium of beauty contests.\u201d We do not see how the board\u2019s decision to refuse to permit the applicant to amend that description is logically related to either of the above issues. Appellant has argued that \u201clogic and equity would dictate that this' Motion should have been granted\u201d because, as things stand, it has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-5\">* * * had no ruling on a significant issue supported by adduced un-contradicted facts, and will be forced to the needless expenditure of time and expense in re-filing its application and contesting another opposition which Opposer\u2019s counsel has said would be filed * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">Whether or not the board abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion in the face of this argument, however, was a matter to be determined, not by this court, but by the Commissioner of Patents, under well-settled principles of law. Martin v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 422 F.2d 918, 919 n. 1, 57 CCPA 968, 969 n. 1 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">B. <em>Likelihood of Confusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1446-9\">Notwithstanding the facts that (1) appellant is a for-profit corporation, whereas appellee is a not-for-profit corporation, and that (2) appellant\u2019s application states that it uses its mark to promote the goods and services of others, without mentioning the prizes it gives the winners of the beauty contests it runs, whereas appellee\u2019s registration states that it uses its mark to promote education through the granting of scholarships (the scholarships being the prizes which it gives the winners of the beauty contests <em>it </em>runs), without mentioning the promotion of the goods and services of others which it does to earn the revenue from which it pays the scholarships, the board found that \u201cthe services of the parties must be considered as practically identical.\u201d We agree, for though the record discloses vast differences in the scale and details of their operations, it seems to us that both would be perceived by the public at large as being in the same general business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-10\">Appellant has made of record numerous third-party registrations for such marks as MISS TEEN-AGE AMERICA, MRS. AMERICA, MISS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, etc., and it argues here, as it did below, that there are so many, very similar marks in the field of beauty contests that members of the general public would not be likely to assume that any two such contests were run by the same enterprise. While we agree with the appellant that this does, indeed, seem to be a crowded field, we are of the opinion that appellant\u2019s mark is closer to appellee\u2019s than even the closest of the third-party registrations in that it bodily incorporates appellee\u2019s mark, merely adding an adjective to the beginning thereof which, as the board observed, \u201cdirects attention to the words which follow.\u201d Additionally, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>willing to take judicial notice that appel-lee\u2019s mark is exceedingly well known. On balance, we agree with the board that appellee\u2019s mark is entitled to protection from registration of a mark as close thereto as appellant\u2019s, for use in identifying substantially the same services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">C. <em>Estoppel by Acquiescence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">Appellant has argued that, even if there is a likelihood that simultaneous use by the parties of their respective marks will engender confusion as to sponsorship of their respective beauty contests, appellee is still estopped to oppose appellant\u2019s application by reason of its previous failure to take action to prevent appellant\u2019s <em>use </em>of the mark. The record supports the assertion contained in appellant\u2019s application that their mark has been in use (by appellant and its predecessor in interest) since August 30, 1963, and the first action taken against appellant by appellee was its filing of a notice of opposition, which it did on October 20, 1966. Intermediate these dates, the only evidence of record that appellee was aware of appellant\u2019s use of the mark was the testimony of appellant\u2019s publicist that he had written appellee, perhaps in 1963 and definitely no later than 1964, asking if it would like to have the winners of the LITTLE MISS AMERICA contest appear at the finals of the MISS AMERICA contest. Appellee\u2019s associate executive director testified that she \u201cvaguely recall [ed]\u201d receiving a letter from appellant, but appellant\u2019s publicist stated that he had received no response to his letter, and apparently nothing ever came of the contact. However, appellant did submit evidence of extensive advertising in the northeastern United States, including New Jersey (the home state of both parties), and it seems highly unlikely that the publication of appellant\u2019s mark in the Official Gazette was the first that appellee had heard of it. On this record, the board held that appellant had failed to prove that it had \u201crelied on op-poser\u2019s lack of affirmative action in expanding its business or that opposer led applicant to believe that it did not object to the use of its mark,\u201d but that, in any event, \u201cthe period of time here involved is considered too short under the circumstances of this case to give rise to an estoppel.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-8\">As we remarked earlier in this opinion, appellee\u2019s is an exceedingly well-known mark. Furthermore, the field of beauty contests is a crowded one, and, as shown by the third-party registrations in this case, from time to time many marks quite similar to appellee\u2019s have been used at least enough to support the registration thereof. In particular, appellant\u2019s publicist testified that Palisades Amusement Park had previously held contests to choose a MRS. AMERICA, a MISS AMERICAN TEENAGER, a GRANDMA AMERICA, a MISS LATIN AMERICA, a MISS ITALIAN-AMERICA, and a MISS POLISH AMERICA, as well as other such contests \u201cfor every age group, without discrimination, to every ethnic group that we could possibly come up with.\u201d However, his use of the past tense in connection with these contests, as well as appellant\u2019s failure to submit evidence of continued use of even the third-part y registrations in its own name (MISS AMERICAN STARLET and MISS ITALIAN-AMERICA), supports appellee\u2019s contention that \u201cThese ventures come and go.\u201d Under the circumstances, we agree with the board that appellee\u2019s acquiescence in appellant\u2019s use of the mark LITTLE MISS AMERICA was for too short a period of time to estop appellee from opposing appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-9\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-10\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-12\">BALDWIN, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1444-11\">. The Petition of Appeal states that appellant \u2018\u2018has complied with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 142 and 143,\u201d which pertain to appeals in patent rather than trademark cases. However, we have construed the appeal as if filed pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a), the provision governing appeals to this court in trademark cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1445-9\">. We note that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542 was last amended in 1949, while 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1971 was amended in 1958 to authorize appeals to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals by persons dissatisfied with the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and to substitute \u201cTrademark Trial and Appeal Board\u201d for \u201cCommissioner\u201d in a portion of paragraph (a) (1) not quoted. Pub.L. 85-699, 72 Stat. 549 (1958). It seems likely that, were tlie question to be directly presented, we would have to read the more recent enactment as broadening the scope of the older.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
