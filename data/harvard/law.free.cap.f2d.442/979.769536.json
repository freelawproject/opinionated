These shavers utilize \u201celectronic\u201d rectifiers to convert alternating household current to direct current in order to recharge the batteries. In some instances, the \u201celectronic\u201d devices are incorporated within the shavers themselves to enable them to be run directly from household current.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">The board in its opinion pointed out that the word \u201celectronic\u201d is defined in the International Dictionary of Physics and Electronics (1956 Ed.) as \u201c* * * of or pertaining to devices, circuits or systems utilizing electron devices.\u201d It thus concluded \u201c * * * that the word \u2018Electronic\u2019 is merely descriptive of the goods here involved * * * \u201d. The board then reasoned that appellants\u2019 mark LEKTRONIC is substantially the phonetic equivalent of the word \u201celectronic\u201d and therefore would also be merely descriptive of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">We cannot agree with this reasoning. While the word \u201celectronic\u201d may be descriptive of the goods here and the word LEKTRONIC may be phonetically close to \u201celectronic\u201d, it does not necessarily follow that the mark LEKTRONIC is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of appellant\u2019s goods. In the first place, the words are not closely similar in spelling or in sight. More importantly, while \u201celectronic\u201d might suggest an electric shaver, we do not feel that LEKTRONIC is so descriptive of the product as to cause damage to the appellee. The record gives no indication that anyone would ever <em>need </em>to use LEKTRONIC to describe his goods of similar nature. The registration of appellant\u2019s . trademark LEKTRONIC will not interfere with the use of \u201celectronic\u201d by appellee. See Armour and Co. v. Organon, Inc., 245 F.2d 495, 44 CCPA 1010 (1957), concurring opinion by Judge Rich; Pacific Industries, Inc. v. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co., 425 F.2d 1265, 57 CCPA 1282 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">For reasons stated above the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">LANE, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-25\">.
