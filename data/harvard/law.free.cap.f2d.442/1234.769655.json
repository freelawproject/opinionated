The appellant Guild raises issues as to the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority, the refusal of the District Court to vacate the award because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>\u201cnewly available evidence,\u201d and in regard to the exclusion of allegedly \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence by the arbitrator. Finding no error in the judgment of the District Court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">I. <em>Nature and Origin of the Dispute </em>The Washington Post discharged Mrs. Winzola McLendon, one of its reporters, for submitting allegedly plagiarized material for publication in its 10 September 1967 issue. A grievance conference was held that same day, 19 October 1967, at which the Post representatives told the Guild that the reporter had been discharged for \u201cplagiarism which we consider gross misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">As the Guild informed its own members,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-6\">The Guild demanded the employee\u2019s immediate reinstatement because the firing was precipitate and without grounds under the contract, which provides: \u201cNo employee shall be discharged except for good and sufficient cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">On the following day, 20 October 1967, the Guild wrote the American Arbitration Association, demanding arbitration and stating its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-8\">The alleged misconduct involved an unproved charge of plagiarism against Mrs. McLendon. The Guild maintains that the discharge was not for good and sufficient cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">Pursuant to agreement, the Post wrote its discharged reporter, setting forth the grounds for its action, on 26 October 1967, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-10\">You were discharged on October 19, 1967, for gross misconduct, in that in the preparation of the article on Prospect House published in the Washington Post on September 10, 1967, you committed the act of plagiarism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">The arbitrator rendered his award on 12 April 1968, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-13\">The discharge of Mrs. Winzola McLendon was not for willful neglect of duty or gross misconduct, but it was for good and sufficient cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-14\">II. <em>The Issue and the Scope of the Arbitrator\u2019s Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"aql-dedup-0\">The basic contention of the appellant is that the arbitrator went beyond the scope of his authority in rendering his award. Appellant contends that his authority ended when he found an absence of \u201cgross misconduct\u201d on Mrs. Mc-Lendon\u2019s part, and that he had no power to go further to hold that her conduct did, however, constitute \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d for discharge. Accordingly, we are asked to vacate this latter determination, and order Mrs. McLendon\u2019s reinstatement with back pay and seniority rights unimpaired. The District Court refused to do so, and, for reasons that follow, we also conclude that this ground affords no relief to the appellant Guild.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-15\">In determining the scope of an arbitrator\u2019s authority we look to two sources: the collective bargaining agreement, and the submission of the parties to the arbitrator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here the collective bargaining agreement specified in Article XVII:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-16\">In a dispute arising from a discharge of an employee, the authority of the Arbitrator shall be that specified in Article VI of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-17\">Article VI, paragraph (3), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-18\">No employee shall be discharged <em>except for good and sufficient cause. </em>* * * Two weeks\u2019 notice in advance of discharge shall be given to employees with six (6) months or more of continuous employment <em>except in cases of discharge for willful ne-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number><em>gleet of duty or gross misconduct. </em>* * * If the Arbitrator renders an award that the discharge was <em>not for good and sufficient cause, </em>The Post shall be obligated * * * [herein are alternative remedies including reinstatement of the discharged employee or indemnity payments]. * * If the Arbitrator renders an award <em>holding only </em>that the discharge was <em>not for willful neglect of duty or gross misconduct, </em>The Post shall be obligated to pay the discharged employee any sums due him at the time as <em>severance pay </em>under Article X of this Agreement <em>and as payment in lieu of notice </em>under this Paragraph (3) of this Article VI. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">The clear language of this paragraph contains several alternative grants of power to the arbitrator. First, and basically, he is empowered to determine whether an employee was discharged \u201cfor good and sufficient cause.\u201d If he finds for the employee on this issue, he is empowered to order reinstatement of the employee or specific equivalent payments. If he finds for the company, then the employee remains discharged, but the employee is entitled to two weeks\u2019 notice (or payment in lieu thereof) and severance pay under Article X of the agreement. Second, on submission of the issue, the arbitrator undoubtedly is empowered to determine whether an employee was discharged \u201cfor willful neglect of duty or gross misconduct.\u201d If he finds for the company on this issue the employee loses any payment in lieu of notice and his severance pay under Article X.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">If the arbitrator does not fully sustain the company\u2019s characterization of the employee\u2019s action precipitating the discharge as \u201cwillful neglect of duty or gross misconduct,\u201d then the arbitrator may either (a) find the discharged employee entirely innocent of the actions on which the charge of gross misconduct was predicated, <em>i. e., </em>a finding of an absence of \u201cgood and sufficient cause,\u201d and order reinstatement or the equivalent remedy; or, alternatively, (b) the arbitrator can hold <em>\u201conly </em>that the discharge was not for willful neglect of duty or gross misconduct,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>that there was \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d for the discharge, but that the employee\u2019s action precipitating the firing does not rise to the level of \u201cgross misconduct.\u201d Carrying out this latter alternative, the employee is not reinstated, but is paid \u201csums due him at the time as severance pay under Article X of the Agreement. * * * \u201d The first sentence of Article VI, paragraph (3), quoted above, makes it clear that whatever the \u201creason\u201d for discharge, basically <em>such reason must constitute good and sufficient cause for discharge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">As we made clear under the statement of the proceedings at the outset of this opinion, while the appellant Guild phrased the issue for the arbitrator in terms of \u201cgood and sufficient cause,\u201d the Post itself persisted in characterizing Mrs. McLendon\u2019s action as \u201cgross misconduct.\u201d Whatever degree of culpability, the offense charged was plagiarism. Whether it rose to the level of \u201cgross misconduct,\u201d thus causing a forfeiture of severance pay, or whether the offense could only be characterized as \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d for the discharge, thus entitling Mrs. McLendon to severance pay and payment in lieu of notice, was a matter of characterization of the offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">We think the arbitrator made a clear and specific finding, within both the terms of the contract provision and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>terms of the issue as phrased by both parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-4\">The discharge of Mrs. Winzola Mc-Lendon was not for willful neglect of duty or gross misconduct, but it was for good and sufficient cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">The consequences which flow from this arbitrator's finding are those provided in Article VI, paragraph (3), and Article X.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">III. <em>The Denial by the District Court of Appellant\u2019s Motion to Have the Award Vacated on the Ground of \u201cNewly Available Evidence\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">Appellant\u2019s motion in the District Court to have the order sustaining the arbitrator\u2019s award vacated and the cause remanded for a new arbitration hearing under Rule 60(b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> citing \u201cnewly available evidence,\u201d was denied. Specifically, the appellant Guild desires a new arbitration hearing so that the testimony of Mrs. Patricia Firestone Chatham, who refused to testify at the first proceeding but now claims to be willing may be received and considered by the arbitrator. It is alleged that her testimony illuminates the \u201ccentral issue of the case\u201d and \u201cdirectly contradicts the finding of the arbitrator on that issue,\u201d hence might call for a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">Because subpoenas are not available in private arbitration proceedings, appellant was unable to compel Mrs. Chatham\u2019s attendance and testimony. Nevertheless, it was the Guild\u2019s bargain with the Post to have disputes over the discharge of employees settled by arbitration, with all of its well known advantages and drawbacks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To give appellant a rematch before the arbitrator, merely because a witness who refused to enter the original contest has now decided to participate, would be not only to give the Guild more than the benefit of its bargain in this case, but would undercut the finality and therefore the entire usefulness of arbitration as an expeditious and generally fair method of <em>settling </em>disputes. As District Judge Aubrey Robinson put it in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-14\">Unless parties are bound by the records made before the arbitrators, the piecemeal or staggered submission of evidence would be likely to erode the effectiveness of arbitration as a speedy and efficient forum for resolving labor disputes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-15\">Furthermore, the mechanics of the arbitration process do not comport with the procedure espoused by the appellant. Arbitrators are not and never were intended to be amenable to the \u201cremand\u201d of a case for \u201cretrial\u201d in the same way as a trial judge. In La Vale Plaza, Inc. v. R. S. Noonan, Inc.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Freedman made the critical distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO7S\">It is an equally fundamental common law principle that once an arbitrator has made and published a final award his authority is exhausted and he is functus officio and can do nothing more in regard to the subject matter of the arbitration. The policy which lies behind this is an unwillingness to permit one who is <em>not a judicial officer </em>and <em>who acts informally and sporadically, </em>to re-examine a final decision which he has already rendered, because of the potential evil of outside communication and unilateral influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>ence which might affect a new conclusion. The <em>continuity </em>of judicial office and the <em>tradition </em>which surround judicial conduct is <em>lacking </em>in the isolated activity of an arbitrator, although even here the vast increase in the arbitration of labor disputes has created the office of the specialized professional arbitrator. (Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\">These considerations demonstrate substantial cause for not applying Rule 60(b) remedies to final arbitration awards. Of course, neither Rule 60(b) <em>per se </em>nor, for that matter, any other of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was ever designed to apply to proceedings in other than the United States District Courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">In sum, we think that neither Rule 60(b) nor any judicially constructed parallel thereto was meant to be applied to final arbitration awards, and that the District Court was correct in denying appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">IV. <em>Exclusion of \u201cMaterial\u201d Evidence at the Arbitration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Appellant complains that at the hearing the arbitrator prevented it from showing that the report allegedly plagiarized by Mrs. McLendon was itself copied from historical sources in the public domain. The arbitrator, and we think rightly so, ruled that \u201c[i]t would not make any difference if [the author of the report] had lifted the whole report from the Britannica.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">But even if we felt that he had committed an error of law in excluding this line of proof, we would not vacate this award and order another arbitration. The better view is that an award will not be vacated even though the arbitrator may have made, in the eyes of judges, errors of fact and law unless it \u201ccompels the violation of law or conduct contrary to accepted public policy.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> No such violation is compelled by this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">The orders of the District Court are hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">.
