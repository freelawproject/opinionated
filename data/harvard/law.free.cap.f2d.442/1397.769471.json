Two apparatus claims, corresponding generally to the rejected method claims by virtue of functional (\u201cmeans for\u201d) expressions, stand allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>The rejected claims define a method for retrieving symbolic data from a stored string. Claims 1 and 7 are typical:</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">1. The method of processing information which comprises the steps of</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">(1) generating signals specifying a set of locations in memory,</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">(2) generating signals for indirectly addressing said memory,</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-7\">(3) generating signals for combining the signals generated in steps (1) and (2) in a selected relationship to indirectly address said memory with respect to the signals generated by step (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-8\">(4) combining the signals of steps (1) and (2) in accordance with the signals of step (3), and</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-10\">(5) extracting signals from the memory locations addressed by the combination of signals obtained in step (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-11\">7. The machine method of processing signals representing a string of characters stored in. a memory which comprises the steps of</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-12\">(1) indirectly addressing said memory to extract signals representing a plurality of characters of said string,</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-13\">(2) shifting the extracted signals until those representing a desired character occupy a preassigned set of positions in a shift register, and</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-14\">(3) masking the remainder of the shifted signals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-15\">The board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 1-6 under 35 USC 101 as drawn to nonstatutory subject matter, and added its own rejection of claims 7 and 9 on that ground. The board based its conclusion on the premise that only machine-implemented methods can be statutory, at least where information processing is concerned, and that the claims do not require machine implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-16\">We see no reason to set forth here a detailed analysis of the invention defined by the claims. Under our decision in In re Musgrave, 431 F.2d 882, 57 CCPA 1352 (1970), machine implementation versus mental implementation is not a determinative dichotomy in deciding whether a method is statutory under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. Further, in our decision in In re Benson, Oust. &amp; Pat.App., 441 F.2d 682, decided May 6, 1971, we held that \u201ca process having no practical value other than enhancing the internal operation of [digital computers]\u201d was in the technological or useful arts and hence was statutory under \u00a7 101. It is undisputed that the method claimed here is one of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-18\">Since the board\u2019s decision lacks a proper legal basis, it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-19\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
