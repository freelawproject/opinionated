width=\"1200\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-43\">From the multitude of arguments pressed and considered in these consolidated appeals, we have decided that the following questions deserve detailed discussion and analysis:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-44\">1. Was there sufficient evidence to sustain the various convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b578-45\">2. Was there a proper instruction on identification ?</p>\n<p id=\"b578-46\">3. Were defendants deprived of due process by being denied a fair trial by an impartial jury free from outside influence?</p>\n<p id=\"b578-50\">4. Did the district court abuse its discretion in denying the several motions for severance?</p>\n<p id=\"b578-51\">This court has previously discussed the facts giving rise to the indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADO\">The record shows that during the afternoon of October 29, 1968, special agents Frank Grant and James Snyder of the Federal Bureau of Investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>engaged in a search for an Army deserter in Wilmington, Delaware. The alleged deserter was apprehended in the home of his mother at 2209 Pine Street, Wilmington, at approximately 3:30 p. m. As the agents left the house with their prisoner and turned up Pine Street toward their car on Twenty-second Street, a group of approximately fifteen men walked down Pine Street toward them and came face to face with them at or near the corner of Twenty-second and Pine. The agents walked to within five feet of the group and stopped briefly. Grant removed his credentials from his pocket, held them out before him and stated, \u201cF.B.I. We have a man in custody. Make room for us to pass.\u201d The group was informed that the prisoner was a deserter being returned to the Army, and warned that anyone interfering would be arrested for assaulting a Federal officer. Immediately after saying this, the agents proceeded forward and were attacked by several individuals from the group. In the course of the affray, which lasted only a few minutes, agent Grant was knocked down and kicked severely on the side of the face and the prisoner escaped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">429 F.2d 1394, 1395 (1970). Footnote 2 states: \u201cThe testimony indicates that three or four persons assaulted each officer.\u201d To these facts we add that the record indicates that while agent Grant was knocked down and kicked, agent Snyder was seized upon, punched, and forcibly spread across the hood of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">We have no difficulty in concluding there was sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions of appellants Barber and Mowbray. Barber\u2019s uncle testified that Barber was fighting with agents Grant and Snyder. Grant positively identified Barber as being in front of the group approaching them. Debbie Price identified Barber and Mowbray as actually doing the fighting, and said Mowbray and Brunswick were holding the arms of one of the agents while Barber was hitting him. Howard Faulkner stated that Barber and Mowbray were in \u201cthe bunch of boys\u201d who assaulted the agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Catherine Butler Wright testified that Mowbray was punching the agent who was on the ground (Grant). Dora Faulkner said Mowbray forced Snyder across the hood of a black car, \u201cbending him back.\u201d Howard Faulkner placed Mow-bray with Barber when agent Grant was kicked in the head. Mrs. Caroline Parker saw Mowbray standing over Grant. In sum, there was ample evidence to support convictions of Barber and Mowbray on all counts of the indictment involving, and arising from, the actual assaults on both agents, and the subsequent escape of their prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Similarly, we are satisfied that the conviction of appellant Robinson must be upheld. Agent Snyder testified that Robinson was standing in front of him and that he pushed Robinson up to the wall because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-11\">[a]t that time I thought that was the guy that had me around the neck. * * * While at the time I pushed him toward the wall and told him to put his hands up and stay there, he put his hands up and stood towards the wall facing the wall, but he had his head turned toward me looking at me. And I had drawn my service revolver. And simultaneously with this I was hit from behind and picked up in the air. And the person I have identified as Robinson turned off the wall and came toward me. And I was held up in the air. And I remember I tried to hit him with my service revolver. And the next thing I remember I was on the hood of a car, spread out on the hood of a black car that was parked on the opposite side of Twenty-second Street that the bureau automobile was parked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Debbie Price placed Robinson in the fight although she identified him by name as \u201cSteven White.\u201d Twilly Me-Cready identified Robinson as one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>men kicking the agent who was on the sidewalk (Grant).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Appellant Steed, also known as \u201cBop Daddy,\u201d was acquitted of the Snyder assault but found guilty on Counts 1, 3 and 4. Catherine Wright identified him as one of the men in the group. As a hostile witness she conceded that \u201cBob Daddy\u201d had been fighting agent Grant. Debbie Price also said Steed was doing the fighting, and that he was holding Grant on the ground, \u201cholding his legs, holding the ankles.\u201d Charles Price testified that Steed and Mowbray were beating Grant and that Steed was punching and kicking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Steed argues that Charles\u2019 direct testimony is completely without inculpatory force because Charles did not name him as one of the four attackers of Grant he identified in a written statement to the F.B.I. on the night of October 29. After testifying that Steed\u2019s name was not on the list given to the F.B.I., he was asked on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">Q. Is it still your testimony, Charles, that at no time did you see more than four men beating on or fighting with the F.B.I. agent on the northwest corner of 22nd and Pine Streets ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">Q. Only four ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">Q. And the four men\u2019s names are listed in this statement, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-23\">In approaching this contention, we take as a starting point the settled principle that \u201c[i]t is the jury, not the court, which is the fact-finding body. It weighs the contradictory evidence and inferences, judges the credibility of witnesses, receives expert instructions, and draws the ultimate conclusion as to the facts.\u201d Tennant v. Peoria &amp; P. U. Ry. Co., 321 U.S. 29, 35, 64 S.Ct. 409, 412, 88 L.Ed. 520 (1944); see also Renault v. L. N. Renault &amp; Sons, 188 F.2d 317 (3 Cir. 1951). Even where the different parts of a witness\u2019 testimony are inconsistent, \u201cit is for the jury to reconcile the conflicting statements and determine which shall prevail.\u201d Greene v. City of Philadelphia, 279 Pa. 389, 392, 124 A. 134, 135 (1924); Luckenbach v. Egan, 418 Pa. 221, 210 A.2d 264 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-24\">These are cases which hold that \u201cwhen a witness says in one breath that a thing is so, and in the next breath that it is not so, his testimony is \u2018too inconclusive, contradictory, and uncertain to be the basis of a legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But even those cases in which the court has been permitted to invade the jury\u2019s exclusive province of determining credibility, the justification appears to be based on the determination that the inconsistencies and contradictions of the witness\u2019 testimony are so glaring that \u201cno fair minded. man could balance it and find it true,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that, accordingly, no factual dispute remains over which reasonable men could differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-25\">In addition, in considering the effect of a prior, extrajudicial statement of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>witness, it must be borne in mind that such statements are generally admissible for the purpose of demonstrating \u201c \u2018a defect either in the memory or in the honesty of the witness.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where a witness is not a party, the statement is received for impeachment purposes only, to demonstrate \u201c \u2018the repugnancy of his evidence.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is not received assertively or testimonially as substantive evidence to show affirmatively its truth as against that of the in-court statement, but solely for the purpose of setting before the jury two' self-contradictory statements, both of which cannot be correct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is the sworn testimony received in open court which rises to the dignity of substantive evidence, having affirmative testimonial value.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Steed contends that Charles Price\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d reply on cross-examination to questions whether only four men were fighting and whether the four men\u2019s names were listed in the F.B.I. statement amounted to both a complete repudiation of Price\u2019s direct testimony and affirmative substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We are not persuaded that the cross-examination constituted such a disavowal of the direct examination as to remove Charles\u2019 direct testimony from the jury. His was not an unconditional recantation. The cross-examination consisted of leading questions, artfully and professionally phrased by a skilled advocate, and was designed to elicit monosyllabic affirmative answers by a thirteen year old boy. Significantly, no specific statement was extracted from the witness rejecting or withdrawing his testimony, given under oath in open court, that he saw Steed \u201cbeating on the agent\u201d and \u201cpunching and kicking\u201d him. We will not say that the trial judge erred in permitting the jury to assess the probative value of the testimony on both direct and cross-examination. We eon-elude that the collective evidence adduced by eye witnesses Catherine Wright, Debbie Price, and Charles Price constituted sufficient evidence to sustain a guilty verdict. Any conflict in the testimony was for the jury to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Turning to the conspiracy count, we recognize that one who aids in the commission of a crime is as responsible as if he committed the act directly. Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949). It was the theory of the government that this was a concerted effort, albeit somewhat spontaneous in plan and execution, to assist a neighborhood youth to escape from the custody of federal agents. The government proved concert of action that did not come about by sheer coincidence. This, together with proof of the overt acts, was sufficient to sustain the conspiracy count convictions. <em>See </em>United States v. American Radiator &amp; Stand. San. Corp., 433 F.2d 174 (3 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">We are unable to conclude, however, that the evidence against the remaining three appellants, Brunswick, Tate and White, was sufficient to sustain the jury verdicts against them. Although acquitted of the Grant assault and conspiracy counts, Brunswick was found guilty of assault upon Snyder and assisting the prisoner to escape. Catherine Wright testified that Brunswick was trying to get at the agent on the ground (Grant) \u201cwith his hand.\u201d She and Debbie Price also said that Brunswick participated in the assault upon agent Grant. The only testimony implicating. Brunswick in the Snyder assault came from Miss Price: \u201cThere was a car there and there was one man against the car. And he [there?] was three boys and with each on him [and] he [they?] was holding his arms * * * Mowbray, Barber, and Brunswick were holding him * * they were holding him and they had him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>stretched out * * * Barber was the one who was hitting him.\u201d Standing alone, this testimony would have generated a jury question on the Snyder assault count. When considered with other testimony, however, including that of Miss Price, that Brunswick played an active role assaulting agent Grant at about the same time the assault on agent Snyder was being perpetrated, this fragment of testimony that Brunswick was \u201cholding\u201d \u201cone man against the car,\u201d cannot, without a more specific identification of the \u201cone man,\u201d be considered sufficient to sustain a conviction on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">We also conclude there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction on Count 4, assisting in the escape of the prisoner. Ernestine Barber, sister of the prisoner, testified that Brunswick arrived on the scene after the fight was over. Her testimony was that she saw Brunswick come home from work; he asked her where she was running and she hold him of the fight with the two agents which was then going on. She said Brunswick then walked to his house, where he remained for about five minutes. She picked up her boyfriend and thereafter saw Brunswick standing by a car in front of his house a block away from the scene. When she went back to the scene of the fight she did not see Brunswick. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see him * * *. When I ran around there to where the agents was, he was standing outside the car [i e., his own car outside his house], but I didn\u2019t see him down on the corner until it was all over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The evidence is that the prisoner escaped during the early assaults upon the agents. Because the jury found Brunswick not to have been a criminal actor in the conspiracy to prevent agents from performing their duties, it can be hypothesized that the jury accepted the testimony that he was a late entry upon the scene of the fray. When this is considered with the findings of the jury on one assault count, and of this court on the other, absolving him of criminal assault, their remains precious little evidence of probative value to support a verdict against Brunswick on Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">As to Tate, Debbie Price testified on direct examination that he was holding Grant\u2019s feet, but she vacillated on cross-examination, and concluded she was not certain of the identification. The only other implicating witness was Carol White, who said that she saw Tate in the group of men approaching the agents. The testimony against White is equally inconclusive. Snyder said that he \u201cstrongly resembles someone he observed in the group.\u201d Witness McCready saw White run from the scene. Although Debbie Price testified that a person by the name of Steven White was in the fight, she made a courtroom identification of defendant William Robinson as the person she called Steven White.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The verdicts of conviction against appellants Brunswick, Tate, and White on the various counts will not be permitted to stand because the government failed to meet its burden of proving them guilty by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Barber (Appeal of Loper), <em>supra; </em>Hendrix v. United States, 327 F.2d 971 (5 Cir. 1964); United States v. Garguilo, 310 F.2d 249 (2 Cir. 1962). As we previously held in reversing the conviction of another of the defendants in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">The conduct of the individual charged or other special circumstances attending his presence must be such as to show that he has associated himself with and participated in the criminal undertaking. Something of significance beyond the fact of presence is necessary to justify a conviction. This requirement is an essential safeguard against the ever present danger of assuming the complicity of all in attendance whenever group activity is involved, and specially when many members of a group, actors as well as onlookers, are tried together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">United States v. Barber (Appeal of Loper), <em>supra, </em>429 F.2d at 1397.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The court charged on identification as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">Consider each witness\u2019 intelligence, age, motive and state of mind in demeanor and manner while on the stand. Consider the witness\u2019 ability to observe the matters as to which he or she has testified, and whether he or she impresses you as having an accurate recollection of these matters. Consider also any relation which each witness may bear to each side of the case, the manner in which each witness might be affected by the verdict and the extent to which, if at all, each witness is either supported or contradicted by other evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">The accuracy of an identification of a particular defendant by a witness in this case must be determined from all the circumstances relating to that identification. In this connection, if you believe from all the evidence and circumstances pertaining to a particular defendant that there is reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the identification and of that defendant as a participant in the acts charged on the indictment, then you must find him not guilty. On the other hand, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt from all the evidence and circumstances that the identification of that particular defendant as a participant in the acts charged in the indictment is accurate, then you must find him guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Appellants urge that the entangled circumstances of this ease compelled a more exacting charge to underscore the eritical nature of the identification issue\u2014 that the commingling of participants and passersby in the vortex of a sudden mob scene rendered arduous and crucial the task of determining who did what to whom. Indeed, appellants contend that identification was the basic issue in this three-week long trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">Appellants\u2019 contention is not without appeal. An affray of such short duration, involving so many participants, affords but limited opportunities for witnesses to observe and to make positive identifications. Under such circumstances it would be desirable to include, at the very least, an instruction that identification testimony should be received with caution and scrutinized carefully. As Mr. Justice Brennan observed in United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 228, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1933, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-14\">The vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.6 Mr. Justice Frankfurter once said: \u201cWhat is the worth of identification testimony even when uncontradicted? The identification of strangers is proverbially untrustworthy. The hazards of such testimony are established by a formidable number of instances in the records of English and American trials. These instances are recent \u2014 not due to the brutalities of ancient criminal procedure.\u201d The Case of Sacco and Vanzetti 30 (1927). [Footnote omitted.] <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-15\">However appropriate additional instructions would have been in the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>bar, we are, nonetheless, constrained to conclude that no reversible error was committed. The trial court relied on formidable precedential authority which holds that it is necessary neither to instruct the jury that they should receive certain identification testimony with caution, nor to suggest to them the inherent unreliability of certain eye-witness identification. In United States v. Moss, 410 F.2d 386 (3 Cir. 1969), for example, we said: \u201cthe trial judge was under no obligation to give * * * a special instruction\u201d on the uncertainty and unreliability of identification testimony. In Cullen v. United States, 408 F.2d 1178 (8 Cir. 1969), the trial court was requested to charge \u201cthat testimony tending to prove identity is to be scrutinized with extreme care,\u201d and that \u201cno class of testimony is more uncertain and less to be relied upon than that of identity\u201d; on appeal, the court held the instruction properly refused because the trial court fairly instructed the jury as to the government\u2019s burden of proof and the facts to be considered by them before rendering a verdict. See also Barber v. United States, 412 F.2d 775 (5 Cir. 1969); McGee v. United States, 402 F.2d 434, 436 (10 Cir. 1968).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">In our function as a reviewing court, therefore, we hold that there was no trial error in the identification charge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the exercise of our supervisory power over the trial courts in this judicial circuit, however, we believe that the time has come to require new dimensions to jury instructions on identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">We recognize initially the primary rule of evidence that a witness ought to state only those facts of which he has personal knowledge. \u201cThe law requires that he who deposes to a fact should have the means of knowing it.\u201d State v. Allen, 1 Hawks 9 (1820). In identification evidence, what the witness represents as his knowledge must be an impression derived from his own senses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And this impression must be gauged by the geographic proximity of the witness to the event, the length of time involved, and the existence of proper conditions for the exercise of powers of observation and perception. However, the \u201cresult of the witness\u2019 observation need not be positive or absolute certainty * * *; it suffices if he had the opportunity of personal observation and did get some impressions from this observation.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The indefiniteness and un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>certainty in the testimony, of course, affects [sic] its weight.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Eye-witness identification testimony, therefore, is an expression of a belief or impression by the witness. If there is a high degree of precision and certainty in his expression, which is consistent with any prior statements and unshaken on cross-examination, the statement of the witness may be regarded as a statement of fact. If certainty is lacking, the expression is deemed to possess an evidentiary quality of inferior rank.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, where the circumstances surrounding the criminal act gave limited opportunity for observation or utilization of other sensory perception, or where uncertainty is expressed by the witness himself, or exposed by a past history of the witness\u2019 statements or demonstrated by cross-examination, the statement of identity should be considered as only an expression of opinion and should be accompanied by appropriate instructions as to its sufficiency and weight. To be sure, the courts have been generous in the admission of eye-witness identification in order to permit the jury to make its own assessment. The emphasis has been on inclusion of evidence, rather than exclusion; on credibility, rather than admissibility.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We recognize that the trial courts are invested with wide discretionary power in the selection of appropriate language in jury instructions. Conceptually, this discretion is justified because the instructions should be addressed to the specific evidence adduced at trial and the law under which the case is tried. We detect, however, an increasing reliance upon form language for jury instructions \u2014 \u201ctrial-tested and appellate-approved.\u201d We note the use in many states of what have come to be known as \u201cPattern Jury Instructions.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While such resources may be useful for the purpose of supplying guidelines to the trial courts, we believe that instructions to the jury must be molded to fit the fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tual complex of each case. An instruction approved in one case, or indeed in many similar cases, may not be sufficient for the particular case at bar if the comparative circumstances are not identical or substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Consequently, while we endorse the wide latitude to be accorded the trial courts in the area o,f jury instructions, we recognize a compelling need for guidelines which will obviate skeletal, pattern instructions and assure the essential particularity demanded by the facts surrounding each identification. Accordingly, we approve for use in this circuit the approach taken by the Pennsylvania courts concerning jury instructions on identification, and require, for prospective application only, that such instructions satisfy the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">In any ease raising the question whether the defendant was in fact the criminal actor, the jury will be instructed to resolve any conflict or uncertainty on the issue of identification. The jury will be instructed that identification may be made through the perception of any of the witness\u2019 senses, and that it is not essential that the witness himself be free from doubt as to the correctness of his opinion. The identification testimony may be treated by the jury as a statement of fact by the witness: (1) if the witness had the opportunity to observe the accused; (2) if the witness is positive in his identification; (3) if the witness\u2019 identification testimony is not weakened by prior failure to identify or by prior inconsistent identification; and (4) if, after cross-examination, his testimony remains positive and unqualified. In the absence of any one of these four conditions, however, the jury will be admonished by the court that the witness\u2019 testimony as to identity must be received with caution and scrutinized with care.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The burden of proof on the prosecution extends to every element of the crime charged, including the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime for which he stands charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Appellants Mowbray, Barber, and Steed urge that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a change of venue, in view of the widespread publicity concerning the incident, constituted a denial of appellants\u2019 right to due process of law by depriving them of a fair trial by an impartial jury free from outside influence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">At the trial, which was held almost six months after the incident occurred, the trial judge asked the 96 veniremen on <em>voir dire </em>whether they had read about the case. Forty-eight had. Each was then asked if he had formed any opinions about the case and, if so, whether he could decide the case solely on the evidence. Only two felt they could not so decide, and were promptly excused by the court. Only one prospective juror said he had formed an opinion about the Wilmington Youth Emergency Action Council (WYEAC) \u2014 an organization with which appellants had been allegedly associated, and one which had been identified with violence and had become the subject of a United States Senate Subcommittee Investigation into the use of anti-poverty funds.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In ruling on the motion the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">[I] am not convinced that the publicity of the incident was so massive, per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>vasive, inflammatory, and prejudicial as to effect either joint or separate trials * * * With regard to the newspaper publicity, defendants have submitted thirteen articles extending over a six month period from the two daily newspapers published in Wilmington. From some 300 daily papers printed during this period, the defendants offer only 13 articles and claim an \u201cabnormal amount of sensational\u201d commentary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">296 F.Supp. at.800-801.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Appellants\u2019 principal reliance is upon Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966): \u201cwhere there is reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to another county not so permeated with publicity.\u201d The <em>Sheppard </em>case also outlines the scope of judicial review of the denial of this type of motion: \u201cappellate tribunals have the duty to make an independent evaluation of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 86 S.Ct. at 1522. Upon our own independent review of the entire record, we conclude that appellants failed to show the presence of a citizenry so inflamed as to require a change of venue under Rule 21(b) Fed.R.Crim.Pro.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">We turn finally to the question whether the appellants were prejudiced by the joint trial. In the words of the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">Generally speaking where several defendants are jointly indicted they should be tried together, particularly where the charges against them arise out of joint acts allegedly committed by each in the presence of each other. In such cases, joint trials are favored in the interest of conserving judicial economy, avoiding duplicitous, time-consuming and expensive trials, conserving public funds, diminishing inconvenience to witnesses and public authorities, and promptly trying those accused of crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">United States v.

United States, 356 F.2d 680 (8 Cir. 1966). Our review of the record does not disclose a showing of such abuse or prejudice. The argument of appellant Barber that denial of severance prohibited him from calling his co-defendants as witnesses in his behalf has been answered by this court in United States v. Housing Foundation of America, 176 F.2d 665 (3 Cir. 1949), holding that a defendant may not compel another defendant to take the stand.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Moreover, the mere presence of hostility among defendants or the desire of one to exculpate himself by inculpating another have both been held to be insufficient grounds to require separate trials.

Where on cross-examination the witness said the defendant looked like the criminal actor but that the witness might be mistaken, it was held that refusal to strike the testimony was not error; the question was one of credibility not admissibility.

Professor Wigmore defined identity as \u201cthe quality of sameness with another person or thing. The essential assumption is that two persons or things are first thought of as existing, and that then the one is alleged, because of common features, to be the same as the other.\u201d II Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 411 at 385 (3d Ed. 1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\">. Opinion of any kind is a poor quality of evidence, and where admissible at all it is only so because it is the best that is available. In all questions of competency on that subject there must be a sliding scale, the only standard of which is that the witness shall have such knowledge of the subject-matter as can be reasonably expected in view of the circumstances of the particular case.

Balancing the liberal admissibility of identification evidence is the commensurately heavy burden placed upon the prosecution of proving the identity of the criminal actor by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

It would appear axiomatic that the constitutional right of a defendant not to testify at the behest of a co-defendant remains Ms right despite the severance of tlieir trials. Thus, although a defendant may be entitled to call a co-defendant, United States v. Bronson, 145 F.2d 939, 943 (2 Cir. 1944), the co-defendant has the right to refuse to testify, United States v. Carella, 411 F.2d 729, 731 (2 Cir. 1969). But see Cohen v. United States, 363 F.2d 321 (5 Cir. 1966).
