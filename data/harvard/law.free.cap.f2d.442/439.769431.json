Neither argument is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-26\">The Government introduced eleven bills that Krenz passed during the same evening in a gambling casino. Krenz contends that the bills were inadmissible for want of proper foundation. The first bill introduced was linked to Krenz by the testimony of two witnesses. That testimony, together with the circumstantial evidence, adequately tied Krenz to all eleven bills. <em>(See </em>Carrullo v. United States (8th Cir. 1950) 184 F.2d 743, 745-746.) His arguments are addressed to the weight, rather than the admissibility, of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The comments of the trial judge were brief and fair. The court careful;/ instructed the jury that it was the sole judge of the facts and that it could disregard his remarks. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
