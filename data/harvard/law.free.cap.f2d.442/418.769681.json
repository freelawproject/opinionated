Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11500.5 (West 1964). He appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-27\">Ortiz argues that there was no reasonable or probable cause for his arrest and that the evidence obtained from the ensuing search should have been excluded. The arresting officer, who had been assigned to a police Narcotics Division for over thirteen years, knew that great numbers of persons frequently visited Ortiz in his hotel, saw numerous scabs or \u201chype tracts\u201d on Ortiz\u2019s arms, and recognized constricted eyes indicating that Ortiz was possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>under the influence of narcotics. We cannot say that this was insufficient probable cause for an arrest. <em>See </em>People v. Herrera, 221 Cal.App.2d 8, 34 Cal.Rptr. 305 (1963); People v. Di Bla-si, 198 Cal.App.2d 215, 18 Cal.Rptr. 223 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">To us, the prosecution\u2019s evidence that Ortiz possessed the heroin for sale seems weak, but this is not a question of federal constitutional dimension. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). We find no constitutional error on the part of the trial judge or Ortiz\u2019s trial counsel. Although certain statements made by Ortiz about his parole violation may have been introduced for more than establishing probable cause for the arrest, our review of the record convinces us that the admission of this evidence was harmless, beyond reasonable doubt. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
