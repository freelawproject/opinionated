The Commission rejected these proposals, preferring instead to test the efficacy of its newly enacted ban on the option time practice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201cWe do not say that the public interest would never be served by action along some of the lines just mentioned; if it so appears, of course such action will be considered. But for the present, with the major step taken herein, it would be premature to consider further measures until we have the benefit of observation of future developments.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">The rule-making proceeding challenged in the instant ease was formally initiated by the Commission in 1965 by the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rule-Making.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The proceeding was a direct result o'f the \u201cexhaustive and continuing examination, begun in February 1959 * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Declaring that \u201cthe three networks not only in large measure determine what the American people may see and hear during the hours when most Americans view television but also would appear to have unnecessarily and unduly foreclosed access to other sources of programs,\u201d the Commission proposed certain rules designed \u201cto foster free competition in television program markets\u201d by providing \u201copportunity for entry of more competitive elements into the market for television programs for network exhibition\u201d and encouraging \u201cthe growth of alternate sources of television programs for both network and non-network exhibition.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, the Commission proposed rules which would prohibit domestic syndication by networks, prevent networks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>from obtaining financial interests in programs not produced by a network and prohibit networks from offering a weekly evening program schedule \u201cin which more than 50% of the time or a total of fourteen hours per week, whichever is greater, is occupied by programs * * * either produced by the network corporation or in which it has acquired the first-run license directly from an independent producer.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This latter rule was denominated the \u201c50/50 Proposal.\u201d The Commission requested comments on its proposed rules and suggestions for alternative courses of action to deal with the problems it had outlined.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In response, extensive submissions were made by many interested members of the industry and the public. These included a study of the syndicated programming market prepared for the three networks by Arthur D. Little, Inc.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In its comments, Westinghouse again suggested the adoption of its proposal to limit the amount of network programming that could be broadcast by stations. In 1968 the Commission issued an order setting the matter for oral argument and inviting comment, as well, on the Westinghouse proposal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After two extensions of time, additional comments were filed by the networks inelud-ing a second Arthur D.. Little, Inc. study prepared at the request of two of the networks,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which dealt specifically with information pertinent to the Westinghouse proposal. After oral argument on July 22-23, 1969, interested parties were given opportunity to and did file additional comments.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">The Commission released its Report and Order adopting the new rules on May 7, 1970.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It stated that the facts which led to the enactment of the \u201cWestinghouse-type\u201d \u201cPrime Time Access Rule\u201d were \u201crelatively simple and * * * quite compelling.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission found an \u201cunhealthy situation\u201d in which \u201c[o]nly three organizations control access to the crucial prime time evening television schedule.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The purpose and effect of this rule, and the accompanying prohibition against use of off-network shows (re-runs) and feature film previously broadcast in the market was summarized by the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-15\">\u201cThe public interest requires limitation on network control and an increase in the opportunity for development of truly independent sources of prime time programming. Existing practices and structure combined have centralized control and virtually eliminated needed sources of mass appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>programs competitive with network offerings in prime time. To remedy these problems, we have decided first to open access directly to the top 50 markets\u2019 for independent programming by prohibiting network affiliates in these markets where there are at least three commercial television stations from taking more than 3 hours of network programs between 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. [with exceptions for certain programs of uncontrollable duration, on-the-spot news coverage and political broadcasts] * * *. In view of the common practice of the networks of offering only 3% hours of network programs between 7:00 p. m.-ll:00 p.m., the rule we are adopting will open up one half hour of additional time per evening for non-network programs on affiliated stations. Off-network programs may not be inserted in place of the excluded network programming; to permit this would destroy the essential purpose of the rule to open the market to first run syndicated programs. We have also dealt with feature film in this respect, because if the network affiliates were to adopt the general practice of substituting feature film for network fare as a means of meeting the requirements of our rules, it would frustrate the purposes of the rule. We have therefore also proscribed the use of feature film which has been previously broadcast in the market as a means of meeting the requirements of the rule.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">In conjunction with this rule, the Commission adopted the financial interest and syndication rules along the lines proposed in the original 1965 notice, essentially to prevent indirect circumvention of the prime time access rule,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and to encourage the \u201cdevelopment of diverse and antagonistic sources of program service.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">In response to numerous petitions for reconsideration, the Commission issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on August 14, 1970 confirming its earlier findings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">The initial, and perhaps principal contention raised in the petitions is that the prime time access rule constitutes a direct restraint on speech and is therefore a violation of the First Amendment. The restraint, the argument continues, operates on the network distributors whose products are barred for a half-hour period, on the licensees, whose freedom of choice is restricted, and on the viewer, who is denied access to programming he might have preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">It is well settled that First Amendment protection is applicable to * the broadcast industry. United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 166, 68 S.Ct. 915, 92 L.Ed. 1260 (1948); see St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20\u2019 L.Ed.2d 262 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(1968). However, the extent of permissible regulation under the First Amendment is not identical for all means of communication. The peculiar characteristics of the broadcast media require the application of constitutional standards to their regulation which differ from those applicable to other types of communication. Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, 395 U.S. 367, 386, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Technological factors in the broadcast industry make it impossible for all who wish to be broadcasters to do so, even when they have the means to make the substantial capital investment that is necessary in most cases. <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc., supra </em>395 U.S. at 396-400, 89 S.Ct. at 1794. Moreover \u201cexisting broadcasters have often attained their present position because of their initial government selection in competition with others * * *. Long experience in broadcasting, confirmed habits of listeners and viewers, network affiliation, and other advantages in program procurement give existing broadcasters a substantial advantage * * * [that is] the fruit of a preferred position conferred by the Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 89 S.Ct. at 1812. Because of this and because the right to broadcast can be exercised by only a tiny percentage of the general population \u201cthe First Amendment confers no right on licensees * * * to an unconditional monopoly of a scarce resource which the Government has denied others the right to use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 89 S.Ct. at 1807.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The unique structure of the broadcast media requires a determination as to who will have priority in the exercise of First Amendment rights when there is a potential conflict in the operation of the industry. The Supreme Court has ruled that the public\u2019s right to access must prevail over all other claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">\u201c * * * the people as a whole retain their interest in free speech by radio and their collective right to have the medium function consistently with the ends and purposes of the First Amendment. It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 89 S.Ct. at 1806.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Finally it must be remembered that the First Amendment stems from the premise that \u201cthe widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public * * Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 20, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 1425, 89 L.Ed. 2013 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">When viewed in the light of these principles, the prime time access rule, far from violating the First Amendment, appears to be a reasonable step toward fulfillment of its fundamental precepts, for it is the stated purpose of that rule to encourage the \u201c[diversity of programs and development of diverse and antagonistic sources of program service\u201d and to correct a situation where \u201c[o]nly three organizations control access to the crucial prime time evening television schedule.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The specific arguments raised by the petitions reflect basic misconceptions of that purpose and of the First Amendment principles outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">For example, petitioner Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. attempts an analogy between the prime time access rule and an imaginary governmental edict prohibiting newspapers in the 50 largest cities from devoting more than a given portion of their news space to items taken from national news services. This analogy completely overlooks the essential fact that \u201c[w]here there are substantially more individuals who want to broadcast than there are frequencies to allocate, it is idle to posit an unbridgeable First Amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak, write, or publish.\u201d <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc., supra </em>395 U.S. at 388, 89 S.Ct. at 1806.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>To argue that the freedom of networks to distribute and licensees to select programming is limited by the prime time access rule, and that the First Amendment is thereby violated, is to reverse the mandated priorities which subordinate these interests to the public\u2019s right of access. The licensee is in many ways a \u201ctrustee\u201d for the public in the operation of his channel.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The prime time access rule is intended to promote \u201cthe widest possible dissemination from diverse and antagonistic sources * * <em>Associated Press, supra </em>326 U.S. at 20, 65 S.Ct. at 1424-1425. The evidence demonstrates that despite the fairly wide range of choice available to licensees, they have consistently decided to limit themselves to one program source during prime time.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, while the rule may well impose a very real restraint on licensees in that they will not be able to choose, for the specified time period, the programs which <em>they </em>might wish, as a practical matter the rule is designed to open up the media to those whom the First Amendment primarily protects \u2014 the general public. \u201cFreedom of the press from governmental interference under the First Amendment does not sanction repression of that freedom by private interests.\u201d <em>Associated Press, supra </em>at 20, 65 S.Ct. at 1425.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">This is not the first time that governmental regulation in the broadcasting area has been challenged on constitutional grounds. In National Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 63 S.Ct. 997, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943), several rules regulating relationships between networks and their radio affiliates were challenged, among them a provision limiting the amount of \u201coption time\u201d for which an affiliate could contract.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Though these and other restrictions<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> strictly limited the freedom of licensees and networks to contract, the First Amendment was held not to preclude the regulations precisely because unrestricted freedom in this area, in the Commission\u2019s judgment, resulted in a detriment to the public\u2019s ability to receive diverse programming. <em>National Broadcasting Company, Inc., supra </em>319 U.S. at 226-227, 63 S.Ct. 997. See also, <em>id. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The regulation challenged in Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, <em>supra, </em>commonly known as the \u201cfairness\u201d doctrine, required that \u201cdiscussion of public issues be presented on broadcast stations, and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>395 U.S. at 369, 89 S.Ct. at 1796. In essence that doctrine requires licensees to allocate a portion of their time to such discussion, though they may prefer to broadcast network or other programming. The Court upheld the regulation because \u201c [i]t is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail rather than to countenance monopolization of that market, whether it be by the Government itself or a private licensee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 89 S. Ct. at 1806.

Leaving aside the fact that this contention proceeds from the somewhat cynical assumption that the networks themselves will cut back on this type of programming, the argument is amply answered in the <em>Red Lion </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u201cAt this point * * * that possibility is at best speculative. The communications industry, and in particular the networks, have taken pains to present controversial issues in the past, and even now they do not assert that they intend to abandon their efforts in this regard. * * * [I] f experience with the administration of these doctrines indicates that they have the net effect of reducing rather than enhancing the volume and quality of coverage, there will be time enough to reconsider the constitutional implications.\u201d <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc., supra </em>at 393, 89 S.Ct. at 1808.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Statutory authority for the prime time access rule is based upon.the principles of regulation about which the Supreme Court said: \u201cCongress moved under the spur of a widespread fear that in the absence of governmental control the public interest might be subordinated to monopolistic domination in the broadcasting field.\u201d Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 137, 60 S.Ct. 437, 439, 84 L.Ed. 656 (1940).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 303 and \u00a7 303(g) (1964), the mandate of the Commission is expressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\">\u201cfrom time to time, as public convenience, interest, or necessity requires <em>* </em>* * [to -s]tudy new uses for radio, provide for experimental uses of frequencies, and <em>generally encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">The Supreme Court has said that an important element in the Commission\u2019s consideration of the public interest is \u201cthe ability of the licensee to render the best practicable service to the community reached by his broadcasts.\u201d Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 475, 60 S.Ct. 693, 697, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940). The criterion of public interest is not limited to technological considerations but is the end to which the Commission\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive powers to promote and realize the vast potentialities of radio\u201d should be directed.

The burden of the cited legislative history is that Congress did not want the Federal Communications Commission to become a censoring agency. But the challenged regulations are not an exercise of censorship powers. The Commission has found that the wide range of choice theoretically available to licensees is either not in fact available or is not being exercised for economic reasons. It has acted in discharge of its statutory duty in seeking to correct that situation. The Commission does not dictate to the networks or the licensees, or the independent producers whom it hopes to stimulate, what they may broadcast or what they may not broadcast; it is merely ordering licensees to give others the <em>opportunity </em>to broadcast.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The syndication and financial interest rules raise the question of the extent to which the Commission can regulate network activities when it believes that these activities may impede the ability of its licensees to operate in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In 1943 the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201cTrue enough, the Act does not explicitly say that the Commission shall have power to deal with network practices found inimical to the public interest.

The language of the Court, far from suggesting limits on the Commission\u2019s ability to regulate, indicates that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-12\">\u201cthe Act gave the Commission not niggardly but expansive powers.

The significance of its efforts can scarcely be exaggerated, for broadcasting is demonstrably a principal source of information and entertainment for a great part of the Nation\u2019s population. The Commission has reasonably found that the successful performance of these duties demands prompt and efficacious regulation of community antenna television systems.

And \u201cRadio communication\u201d is defined as \u201cthe transmission by radio of writing, signs, signals, pictures, and sounds of all kinds by aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the points of origin and reception of such transmission, <em>including all instrumentalities, facilities, apparatus, and services (among other things, the receipt, forwarding, and delivery of communications) incidental to such transmission.\u201d </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(b) (1964) (emphasis added). In light of these definitions, and in light of the <em>National Broadcasting Company </em>case, one must conclude that when the networks transmit their signals from a network owned station over leased connecting lines, and these signals are then relayed to the public by other network owned stations and by affiliated licensees, both the networks and the licensees are encompassed by the terms \u201cradio stations engaged in chain broadcasting.\u201d 47 U.

It is impossible, and indeed unnecessary, for us to attempt to set forth here the extensive statistical evidence to be found in the record. The Commission\u2019s marshalling of these statistics, principally from the Arthur D. Little, Inc. Reports prepared at the behest of the networks,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> reveals the single most essential fact: between 1957 and 1968, the share of network evening program hours either produced or directly controlled by networks rose from 67.2% to 96.7%.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The record indicates several reasons for this development. One is the increase in \u201cspot\u201d advertising by many sponsors and the concomitant decrease in programs sponsored entirely by one or two advertisers.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This necessitates, the networks assert, increased network control of the creative process in order to insure that programs will have a wide mass appeal.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It has in fact led to a situation where, as the Commission puts it, \u201cthe three national television networks for all practical purposes control the entire network television production process from idea through exhibition.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> A second factor is the \u201cclear preference on the part of television licensees for the security of network programs and network revenues over the initiative and effort required to develop other * * * sources of economic support for non-network programming.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The figures given above, the statistics in the Arthur D. Little Reports, and other figures cited by the Commission in its Report and Order bear upon the significance of this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The evidence in the record leads inescapably to the conclusion that access to network affiliated stations during prime time is virtually impossible for independent producers of syndicated programs. On the basis of this conclusion, the Commission\u2019s attempt to remedy the situation is far from arbitrary; it is directed, in fact to the heart of the problem. As the Commission says in its report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">\u201cA healthy syndication industry composed of independent producers capable of producing prime time quality programs <em>must have an adequate base of television stations to use its prod-uet. </em>Since the stations in the top 50 markets reach over 75% of the available audience, <em>access to these markets is essential to form such a base. </em>The independent stations are not adequate by themselves, in light of the fact that only fourteen of these markets have one or more independent VHF stations. The networks obviously have a tremendous and, we believe, insurmountable advantage in providing programs for their affiliates. Not only is there the natural tendency of an affiliate to do more business with its dominant supplier, but the program distribution process is much simpler via a network * * *. The syndicator is forced to make a new contract with each station for each program. Similarly, it is much simpler for an advertiser to make one arrangement for an entire network than to buy station by station. In short, there is no permanent unified distribution machinery. These disadvantages are inherent in the distribution process and not in the product. They must be recognized as realities in the face of the contention that independent program producers can now compete upon an equal basis.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Despite the demonstrated need to open up access to prime time for independent producers, and the Commission\u2019s power and, it may be, duty to correct the current state of affairs, petitioners argue that the prime time access rule cannot stand because it cannot succeed. It is true that the effect of such a change in the market on independent producers who heretofore had no access to this market is difficult to predict;<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> indeed, the Commission itself has conceded the difficulties in this area <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> As one of the interested parties put it, the Commission is dealing with \u201cestimates and forecasts.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> However it is the Commission\u2019s function to make such estimates and forecasts and the fact that there is vigorous disagreement as to the effect of the rule<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> does not prevent the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>mission from acting or require this court to reassess the probabilities. After careful consideration, the Commission concluded that, as it had stated in an earlier proceeding, \u201cit is highly doubtful that networks are the only agents equipped to perform the entreprenural [sic] function * * *. Prior to 1959 as much as half of network programming was supplied by independent producers who dealt strictly with network advertisers * * There appear to be any number of combinations of commercial groups or organizations which can and undoubtedly would perform the entreprenural functions if permitted to do so.\u201d <footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The Commission has also noted that the trend toward multi-spon-sored programs can be reversed, but in any case, presents no obstacle to the ef-fectuation of the prime time access rule.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> This conclusion is based on a substantial record and is certainly not \u201carbitrary or against the public interest as a matter of law.\u201d Radio Corporation v. United States, 341 U.S. 412, 420, 71 S.Ct. 806, 810, 95 L.Ed. 1062 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Petitioners also challenge the prime time access rule as unreasonable because, they assert, it is too broad. However the Commission\u2019s action is based upon experience as well as upon deliberate and thorough investigation. The Commission first attempted to correct the abuses by eliminating option time. It rejected a prime time access type proposal offered by Westinghouse in order to give the less stringent option time rules a chance to operate.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The enactment of the prime time access rule was necessitated, as the Commission states, because \u201c[t]he record herein demonstrates that our elimination of option time has not operated to make more time available to non-network programs and to multiply competitive program sources.\u201d <footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">The purposes of the prime time access rule justify the off-network and feature film restrictions of that rule. The Commission could properly conclude that \u201cto permit this [use of reruns and film during the freed time period] would destroy the essential purpose of the rule to open the market to first run syndicated programs.\u201d <footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The Commission\u2019s action in staying the effectiveness of these restrictions for one year beyond the effective date of the prime time access rule itself was designed to minimize economic loss to those holding inventories of such products and to provide a transition period \u201cuntil such time as first-run syndicated programs of prime time character and quality are available * * <footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The reasonableness of the financial interest and syndication rules must be considered not in the abstract but in the light of their relation to other elements in the total regulatory scheme.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The financial interest rule prohibits networks from obtaining financial or proprietary rights in the exhibition, distribution, or other commercial use of any television program produced by someone other than the network itself, except the right to network exhibition on affiliated stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The Commission has found a direct relationship between new programs chosen for network schedules and network acquisition of subsidiary rights and interests. \u201cThe overall result is that, save for about six or seven percent of their schedules which were the result of direct dealing between independent producers and sponsors, networks accepted virtually no entertainment program for network exhibition in a five-year period in which they did not have financial interests in syndication and other subsequent use * * * \u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">The Commission pointed out the serious disadvantage suffered by independent producers as a result of the existing situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-13\">\u201cThis is borne out by the customary terms on which they deal with the networks. The ADL Report lists fifteen packagers as participating in all seasons, 1957-1964, by supplying at least one regularly scheduled network series for nighttime television. While in the normal course of competitive business, these producers might be expected to acquire a favorable or preferred bargaining position because of their economic and creative contributions and their desirability as sources of network programs, such was not the case. They fared little, if any, better than one-season producers. These fifteen producers provided a total of 299 programs between 1957 and 1964. Of these, 214 (71.6%) were licensed directly to networks which provided developmental financing in only 64 cases (30.0%). However, networks obtained rights to participate in the profit from the first network run in 207 of this 214 (96.7%) of the series so licensed. In 40, or 18.7% of the series networks obtained the right to distribute, and in 140, or 65.4%, of the cases networks shared in the profits from domestic syndication * * *. <em>[A]lthough in most cases packagers do not recover production costs from the network run of a program series, hut must look to profits </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>from, domestic syndication, foreign sales and other subsidiary uses of the series to recover their costs and make a profit, they almost uniformly \u2018bargain\u2019 away substantial portions of domestic and foreign syndication rights.\u201d </em><footnotemark>53</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Viewed in the context of the purposes of the prime time access rule, the financial interest prohibition may well be a necessary tool to forward the development of the strong independent suppliers who will be needed in the newly created market if the aims of increased diversity and decreased network domination are to be accomplished. At the very least, it was reasonable for the Commission to make this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The financial interest rule was deemed essential by the Commission to effectuate its syndication rule since \u201cas little would be accomplished in expanding competitive opportunity in television program production if we were to exclude networks from active participation in the syndication market and then permit them to act as brokers in acquiring syndication rights and interests and reselling them to those actively engaged in syndication.\u201d <footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Syndicated programs, which can be subclassified into first run syndicated programs, syndicated off-network programs and syndicated feature films, are sold or licensed by a distributor engaged in syndication to stations on a market- \u2022 by-market basis throughout the country. Each station pays the distributor for the right to broadcast the program on its facilities; the distributor, in turn, delivers a print of the program to the individual stations which find advertisers to buy commercial time. The stations then broadcast the program at any time they select. Distributors can either produce the programs themselves or acquire rights to first-run syndicated programming produced by others, or they can acquire syndication rights to programs which have been shown on a network at some previous time. The Commission\u2019s syndication rule will prevent the networks from engaging in the business of syndication, that is from acting as foreign or domestic distributors, whether or'not the programs were obtained for network exhibition.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">That part of the syndication proscription dealing with programs acquired for network exhibition can be and has been justified by the same rationale that was advanced for the financial interest rule; in a sense, the acquisition of syndication rights in these programs operates in the same manner and has the same consequences as the acquisition of any other subsidiary right. \u201cUnder present conditions independent producers who desire to exhibit their products first on a network * * * must first bargain with the networks who are their principal competitors in syndication * * * and are usually required to grant to the networks either the distribution rights or large shares in the profits from domestic syndication and foreign distribution, or both, for the program.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> A prohibition on syndication for this type of program, the Commission believes, will remove the incentive for networks to choose for exhibition only those shows in which these rights are granted, and will increase the profitability of independent productions.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We cannot say that the Commission\u2019s conclusions in this respect are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">The remainder of the syndication rule is aimed at decreasing network domi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>nance and curbing potential competitive restraints. It is not contended that the networks <em>now </em>dominate the syndication business. The Commission itself stated that revenues from syndication \u201cdo not constitute a principal part of overall revenues.\u201d Nonetheless it found, by using data contained in the Arthur D. Little Reports, that \u201crevenues accruing to networks from syndication activities are substantial and are increasing.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark> It is irrelevant that the rule is aimed at potential rather than actual domination or restraints, or that the Commission is not certain that the developments forecast will occur if the rule is not enacted. In United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., <em>supra, </em>the Court said in response to a similar contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cThe Commission acknowledged that it could not predict with certainty the consequences of unregulated CATV, but reasoned that its statutory responsibilities demand that it \u2018plan in advance of foreseeable events, instead of waiting to react to them.\u2019 We are aware that these consequences have been variously estimated, but must conclude that there is substantial evidence that the Commission cannot \u2018discharge its overall responsibilities without authority over this important aspect of television service.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>392 U.S. at 176-177, 88 S.Ct. at 2004-2005 (citations and footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">We hold that the syndication rule is supported by evidence and is \u201creasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the Commission\u2019s various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting.\u201d United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., <em>supra </em>at 178, 88 S.Ct. at 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">With respect to all three rules, we repeat what the Supreme Court said in the <em>National Broadcasting Company </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">\u201cOur duty is at an end when we find that the action of the Commission was based upon findings supported by evidence * * *. It is not for us to say that the \u2018public interest\u2019 will be furthered or retarded * * *. The responsibility belongs to the Congress for the grant of valid legislative authority and to the Commission for its exercise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">It would be sheer dogmatism to say that the Commission made out no case for its allowable discretion in formulating these Regulations.\u201d National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>319 U.S. at 224-225, 63 S.Ct. at 1013.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Several procedural and other miscellaneous contentions remain. The first of these is the challenge posed by the small licensees. The prime time ae-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>cess rule is literally applicable only to stations in the top 50 television markets; nevertheless, the networks have stated that they will no longer offer a full evening schedule to any station. It should first be pointed out that this decision is not the Commission\u2019s. Indeed, the Commission stated that \u201cas commercial UHF stations are rapidly becoming available in the top fifty markets the networks should consider the feasibility of continuing the longer schedule. Not only the public interest in the fostering of UHF would benefit, but affiliates in markets below the top fifty could continue to broadcast the longer network schedule.\u201d <footnotemark>59</footnotemark> However it seems probable that, at least initially, small licensees will be hurt by the prime time access rule.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> This does not mean that the Commission may not adopt the rule. See Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 473-476, 60 S.Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940). As the Commission has indicated, the economic relationships underlying this argument may afford even greater justification for the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">\u201cThe stations in effect are pleading this [network] domination as an element essential to their economic viability. If, as many licensees say in their letters and petitions, affiliates at present are so dependent on national networks that their economic viability and their ability to serve the public interest turn on whether they continue to receive revenues from an additional half-hour of network programming, they clearly are not in a position to exercise the appropriate freedom of choice and the responsibility for television service which are essential to the proper discharge of their broadcast trusteeships.\u201d <footnotemark>61</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">In any event, the Commission has carefully considered the arguments of the smaller affiliated licensees, made findings, and determined that it should act.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s decision cannot be characterized as arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">The contention that the notice was insufficient and that the Commission has thereby violated 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1964) is without merit. This contention is based on the fact that the off-network and feature film restrictions were not specifically proposed in the 1965 Notice of Proposed Rule-Making. All that is required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b) (3), however, is that \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved\u201d be included in the notice. This requirement has been met in this case. The off-network and feature film restrictions are ancillary prohibitions that are implicit in the purpose of the prime time access rule. The rules proposed by the Commission in 1965 were based on the information available to the Commission at that time. As a matter of fact, the prime time access rule itself which is not challenged on lack of notice grounds, was not specifically noticed in 1965; it was substituted at a later date for the \u201c50/50\u201d Rule proposed at that time.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The evolution of these proceedings illustrates why 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b) (3) \u201cdoes not require an agency to publish in advance every precise proposal which it may ultimately adopt as a rule.\u201d California Citizens Band Association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>v. United States, 375 F.2d 43, 48 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 844, 88 S.Ct. 96, 19 L.Ed.2d 112 (1967). The parties in this case had ample opportunity for comment on these aspects of the rule, and utilized that opportunity so effectively that changes in this part of the rule were made in the Commission\u2019s Reconsideration Order.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Finally, the petitioners contend that the citation by the Commission in its Reconsideration Order of certain letters which were not placed in the public docket file until after the release of the order requires a reversal in this case. Although these omissions may be technical violations of the Commission\u2019s own rules, to remand for this reason would be both foolish and wasteful since petitioners are in no way prejudiced. The nine letters in issue <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> all dealt with the probabilities that quality syndicated programming would become available under the prime time access rule. They all supported the Commission\u2019s position, a position which the Commission had taken in its earlier order without the benefit of these comments. They merely offered assurance that the Commission\u2019s estimates and forecasts had some concrete support. Their effect was only cumulative. This is confirmed by the fact that were we reviewing only the May 1970 Order, which did not refer to these letters, our conclusion on all of the issues would be exactly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We have considered all of the other issues raised by the many petitions and find them to be without merit. We therefore deny the petitions for review and uphold the Commission\u2019s promulgation of these rules.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-12\">.
