On January 3, 1969, the District Court sentenced appellant to five to fifteen years for second degree burglary, 22 D.C. Code \u00a7 1801 (b), to run concurrently with a one year sentence for petit larceny. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2202. A motion to revise or reduce sentence was denied on January 24. On February 3, 1969, Delaney filed an appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>from the denial of that motion and from the judgment below, and we appointed counsel to represent him. Subsequently, appellant moved this Court to supplement the record with a copy of his presentence report and to order disclosure of the report to his counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Examination of the report is necessary, he says, in order to \u201cdetermine whether the appellant was sentenced on the basis of accurate information concerning his criminal record and other matters and whether the sentencing procedure otherwise conformed to law. Cf. Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736 [68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690] (1948).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">On March 10, 1970, we entered an order which (1) directed the District Court to furnish us with a copy of appellant\u2019s presentence report, and (2) denied appellant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the report to counsel, \u201cwithout prejudice to its renewal if such a motion is denied by the District Court.\u201d Appellant now informs us that such a motion was denied by the trial court on July 28, 1969. Accordingly, by order today we amend the order previously entered in this case to defer action on appellant\u2019s motion for disclosure pending the District Court\u2019s reconsideration of its denial of his motion. See United States v. Isaac, 142 U.S.App. D.C. -, 442 F.2d 119 (Nos. 22,713 &amp; 23,089, March 10, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">In most cases, an appellate court has no occasion to inspect a probation officer\u2019s report as a matter included in the appellate record. But where, as in this case and in <em>Isaac,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>questions are raised concerning the reasons for which a sentence was imposed, it may become necessary for the presentenee report to be made a part of the record in this Court, to enable us to express a considered opinion on the appellant\u2019s contentions. Whether or not the reports are made available to counsel for the parties, they must be before us <em>in camera </em>if we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>to \u201cscrutinize the sentencing process to insure that the trial judge has considered the information available with some regard for its reliability, and has evaluated the information in light of the factors relevant to sentencing.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">As a result of the order entered in this case today,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the District Court will have before it on remand the questions whether and to what extent appellant is entitled under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c) (2) to inspect the probation officer\u2019s report relied upon by the court in sentencing him. It is possible that, upon viewing the report (should the District Court so allow), appellant will not wish to pursue the sentencing issue on appeal. In such case, there would be no need for a copy of the report to be incorporated in the appellate record. Consequently, we are also today amending, <em>sua sponte, </em>our prior orders in this case and in <em>Isaac, </em>to strike therefrom the requirement that the presentence reports be furnished us at this time. This action is taken without prejudice to a renewal of the motion to supplement the record with the presentence report after the District Court has ruled on the motion for disclosure. If the District Court discloses the entire report, appellant can lodge it with this Court and move that it be made part of the record; if the District Court declines to disclose all or part of the report, appellant can move this Court to order up a copy of the report, sealed for our inspection <em>in camera</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">. The history of this case is as follows: On May 21, 1969, appellant moved in this Court for \u201cadditional transcript to supplement the record.\u201d AVe denied that motion on June 9, without prejudice to its being filed in the court below, and we extend appellant\u2019s time to file his brief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">On June 20, 1969, appellant filed a motion in the District Court to supplement the record with additional transcript and his presentence report. The court on July 28, 1969, granted the motion for transcription of the preliminary hearing and grand jury minutes, and denied it as to the arraignment, hearing on pretrial release, voir dire, and opening and closing statements, and as to disclosure of the pre-sentence report. On August 18, this court ordered preparation of transcript of the arraignment, voir dire, and counsel\u2019s statements, and deferred action on the transcript of the bail hearing and on production of the presentence report for consideration by a motions panel.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-15\">. Isaac assigns as error in his appeal, <em>inter alia, </em>the reasons for which he received a substantially heavier sentence than his codefendant; he argues that the court dealt more harshly with him because he \u201cdemanded his right to a fair trial,\u201d while his codefendant stood mute and indicated his willingness to plead guilty. Isaac contends that his prior criminal record was substantially the same as his co-defendant\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-15\">. Scott v. United States, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 377, 379, 419 F.2d 264, 266 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b181-16\">. This ease is now in the same posture as <em>Isaac, </em>in which we temporarily deferred acting on the motion for disclosure in order to allow the District Court an opportunity to consider the motion further. We instructed the court below that \u201c [i]f, upon reflection, it believes that all or part of the presentence report should not be disclosed to appellant\u2019s counsel, it should state in writing the particular reasons for which it believes specific portions of the report must remain confidential.\u201d United States v. Isaac, <em>supra, </em>142 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 442 F.2d at 120. AVe also observed that the statement of reasons could be transmitted to us for inspection <em>in camera, </em>if the District Court concluded that such a step was necessary to preserve the reports\u2019 confidentiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-19\"> The June 9th order in Isaac, referred to in this opinion, was never entered, because of clerical error. By the time the omission was discovered, the issue was moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
