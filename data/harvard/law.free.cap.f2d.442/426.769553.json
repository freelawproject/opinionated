We conclude that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-20\">Relevant to- both ultimate findings of violations of the Act is evidence that the Company\u2019s manager, Govi, told salesman Hughes that he did not want Hughes involved \u201cwith the Union with Lambrecht\u201d and threatened to \u201ccan\u201d Hughes \u201c[i]f any of this conversation * * * gets out\u201d and that Govi questioned employee McDevitt about the union activities of Lambrecht and Hughes. That evidence, placed in context, was adequate to sustain the Board\u2019s conclusions that the Company had antiunion animus and that the Company had interfered with its employees\u2019 exercise of their section 7 rights. The Board was not required to resolve the conflicts in the evidence in the Company\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-22\">There was evidence that would have supported a finding that Lambrecht\u2019s poor sales performance gave the Company cause to discharge him. The central inquiry is thus a familiar one: Was Lambrecht\u2019s .discharge motivated by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>poor sales performance, or was it motivated by antiunion animus? It is unnecessary to detail all of the evidence in the record that supports the Board\u2019s determination that Lambrecht\u2019s discharge was pretextual. However, we consider especially persuasive the Examiner\u2019s observation that the Company\u2019s January decision to discharge Lambreeht made it highly unlikely that the Company would try to spur Lambreeht to greater sales efforts i-n February.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
