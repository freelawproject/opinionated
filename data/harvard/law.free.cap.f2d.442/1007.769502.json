Bottenfield v. Commissioner, T.C.M. 1335 (1961). No appeal was taken and these decisions therefore became final. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7481(a) (1) (Supp. 1971). Assessments for the amounts determined to be due were made, on July 7, 1961, but taxpayers have refused or neglected to pay the taxes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-25\">In an effort to collect, the government instituted this action, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>to foreclose tax liens which arose, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321, and to sell the property to which such liens attached. Following the filing of taxpayers\u2019 answer, in which they contested the constitutionality of the \u201cmethods and procedures\u201d of the case and alleged that they did not owe the taxes in issue, the government filed a motion for partial summary judgment, attempting to reduce to judgment taxpayers\u2019 income tax liabilities. The district court granted the motion and this appeal resulted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">In support of its motion, the government produced an affidavit of a Justice Department attorney who had been involved in the litigation, certified copies of the Tax Court decisions, and exhibits which included the certificates of assessments and payments, notices of federal tax liens, and deeds to parcels of property owned by taxpayers. Taxpayers, however, filed no response to the government\u2019s motion, but chose to rest on the general denials of tax liability contained in their answer. These formal denials and other vague allegations simply did not disclose any genuine issue of material fact and were, therefore, wholly insufficient to prevent the entry of summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ. Pro. 56(c). \u201c[W]hen deciding a motion for summary judgment, it is no legitimate function of the court to assume the existence of a genuine issue of material fact when in truth none exists.\u201d Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 459 (3 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Furthermore, it is obvious that the government was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Taxpayers\u2019 liabilities for the taxable years 1947-1950 were litigated on the merits in the Tax Court and were established in decisions that were not appealed. These decisions became final, are binding on taxpayers, and are <em>res judicata </em>in this action. See United States v. International Building Co., 345 U.S. 502, 73 S.Ct. 807, 97 L.Ed. 1182 (1953); Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">The partial summary judgment entered by the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1065-16\">. Assessments for the taxable years 1947-1950, including taxes, penalties, and interest, and reflecting a credit for a single payment, totaled $107,707.32. Further assessments were made in 1962 for the taxable years 1958-1960, but these years were not included in the partial summary judgment below and are not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">. Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 54(b) applies to summary judgments that dispose of one or more but fewer than all of the claims asserted. Such judgments are commonly known as \u201cpartial\u201d summary judgments. \u201cIf in an action involving multiple claims * * * the court renders a summary judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of tlie claims * * *, and makes tbe \u2018express determination\u2019 and \u2018express direction\u2019 as provided in Rule 54(b), then the judgment is final\u201d and appealable. 6 MOORE\u2019S FEDERAL PRACTICE \u00a7 56.20 [3. \u2014 1], at 2749 (footnote omitted).
