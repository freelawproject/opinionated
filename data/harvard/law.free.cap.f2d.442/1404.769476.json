There can be no question but that \u201cREGISTRY OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS\u201d possesses a merely descriptive significance as applied to this service. It likewise appears that the services described in the application * * * are all part and parcel of the function of creating and maintaining a registry of medical technologists. It is manifest that if the term</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-21\">\u201cREGISTRY OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS\u201d is merely descriptive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>the service of establishing a roster or registry of medical technologists, it is also descriptive of those services that are incidental to and/or necessary adjuncts thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">The board found nothing in the record to show that the term REGISTRY OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS had any significance other than as a designation describing the nature and character of appellant\u2019s services, adding that the fact that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-5\">* x- x- applicant has received many inquiries addressed to \u201cREGISTRY OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS\u201d is merely a reflection of applicant\u2019s use of the designation in certain literature as a trade name signifying a standing committee of applicant\u2019s organization and does not, in and of itself, dispel the descriptive character of the term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">The parties here are in agreement that the principal issue is whether or not the mark sought to be registered \u201cis merely descriptive of any or all of the services.\u201d There is further agreement that (a) \u201cdescriptiveness of a mark must be determined in relation to the goods or services for which registration is sought,\u201d and (b) \u201cregistration should be refused if the mark is descriptive of any of the goods or services for which registration is sought.\u201d These are well settled legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-7\">Inquiry, therefore, must be focused on the services for which the mark in issue is sought to be registered. In the interest of clarity and convenience, we break these services into four parts: <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">(1) providing national board examinations in medical technology and related specialties;</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-9\">(2) certifying qualified persons according to their qualifications, as medical technologists, histo-logic technicians, etc.;</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-10\">(3) publishing information about requirements for qualification of school curricula and the like; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">(4) publicizing opportunities for careers in medical technology and related specialties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-13\">An examination of the printed pamphlet filed as a specimen with the application reveals that :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-14\">In 1928 the American Society of Clinical Pathologists established a Board of Registry of Medical Technologists to certify qualified personnel in this field.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-15\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (Second Edition) defines \u201cregistry\u201d as \u201c1. Act of registering; enrollment; registration. 2. The state or fact of being entered in a register * * *. 3. The place where a register is kept, a place of registration * * *. 4. A register; an official record book or an entry in one.\u201d In view of appellant\u2019s own pamphlet and the dictionary definition of \u201cregistry,\u201d we think it clear that appellant certifies qualified personnel and maintains a register of personnel so certified. The function of certifying qualified personnel corresponds to service (2), supra, and would by itself indicate that appellant maintains a registration system or roster of qualified medical technologists. The certifying of qualified personnel would, according to Webster\u2019s definition of \u201ccertify,\u201d be the designation of individuals \u201cas fitted to pursue a certain kind of study or work.\u201d A body or agency charged with the responsibility of certifying individuals would normally be expected to maintain a record, roster or list of the individuals certified as qualified for a particular endeavor. It would, therefore, seem to logically follow that service as delineated in (2), supra, would require a registry, record system or roster of qualified medical technologists. The same rationale would apply to service (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-17\">There is no basis for dispute that appellant as a matter of fact maintains a roster or registry of medical technolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>gists. For reasons hereinabove assigned, it is logical to conclude that that service is expressly or at least implicitly indicated by services (1) and (2). The other services, (3) and (4), are manifestly supporting services, ancillary or auxiliary, to the primary function of appellant of \u201cmaintaining a registry of medical technologists for use by medical and hospital groups.\u201d Because the registry of medical technologists and the four services delineated are so mutually interdependent, i. e., the acts of certifying qualified personnel as medical technologists, etc. necessitate maintenance of a registry of medical technologists and the act of registering medical technologists or maintaining a registry generally implies some form of certification, etc., we think the term REGISTRY OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS would immediately convey to one seeing or hearing it the thought of appellant\u2019s services. Therefore, we think the mark \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of those services. Under the facts of this case, the \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d character of appellant\u2019s mark renders it nonregistrable on the Principal Register by reason of the prohibiting terms of section 2(e) (1) of the Trademark Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">We have reviewed and considered appellant\u2019s contentions and argument. We are not persuaded of reversible error in the decision of the board, which we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">LANE, J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1463-22\">.
