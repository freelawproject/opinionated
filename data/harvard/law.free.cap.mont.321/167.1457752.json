We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in upholding a final administrative decision which concluded that a department\u2019s interpretation of an administrative rule as precluding reimbursement of shipping costs for diapers was reasonable and not plainly inconsistent with the rule\u2019s spirit.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">\u00b63 The Montana medicaid program (Medicaid) is a joint federal-state program that provides necessary medical services to qualified individuals. The Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) administers Medicaid in Montana. Section 53-6-101(1), MCA. Juro\u2019s is a Medicaid-enrolled provider of medical supplies-including diapers-and durable medical equipment in Billings, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">\u00b64 Juro\u2019s transported diapers to its customers in the Billings area-including its Medicaid customers-at no extra charge via a company truck and driver. It sent diapers via common carrier to its customers outside the Billings area. Juro\u2019s billed its non-Medicaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>customers outside the Billings area for the costs of shipping diapers. It submitted claims to the Department for reimbursement of costs for shipping diapers to Medicaid recipients outside the Billings area using Medicaid code W2839, \u201cShipping Charges for Minor Supplies.\u201d Between October 1, 1995 and March 31, 2000, those claims totaled $10,220.94. The Department reimbursed the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">\u00b65 The Department subsequently audited paid claims data from October 1,1995 through March 31, 2000 (the audit period). In August of 2000, it notified Juro\u2019s that the $10,220.94 was improperly billed and paid under Medicaid code W2839 because Rule 37.86.1806(7), ARM, the language of which was in effect throughout the audit period, provided that \u201cMedicaid will not reimburse delivery fees in addition to the amount reimbursed for diapers.\u201d Stated differently, the Department interpreted the Rule to preclude Medicaid reimbursement of any costs associated with transporting diapers from the provider to Medicaid recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b66 Juro\u2019s disputed the Department\u2019s interpretation. It contended the Rule only precluded reimbursement for \u201cprovider travel\u201d costs, such as those Juro\u2019s incurred in transporting diapers to its customers in the Billings area via company truck. It also argued that Medicaid code W2839 authorized claims for the costs of shipping \u201cminor supplies,\u201d and noted the Department had previously indicated \u201cminor supplies\u201d included diapers. Juro\u2019s requested a \u201cfair hearing\u201d before a hearing officer of the Montana Board of Public Assistance (Board). The hearing occurred in December of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b67 Juro\u2019s operations manager, Janna Jurovich, testified at the hearing. Frank Malek testified for the Department. The hearing officer\u2019s subsequent Fair Hearing Decision (Decision) ultimately concluded the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Rule\u2019s term \u201cdelivery fees\u201d to include both costs of shipping via common carrier and \u201cprovider travel\u201d costs with regard to diapers was reasonable and not inconsistent with the Rule. Accordingly, it ordered Juro\u2019s to reimburse the Department for the improperly submitted and paid charges associated with shipping diapers to its Medicaid patients outside the Billings area during the audit period.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b68 Juro\u2019s appealed to the Board, which unanimously adopted the Decision, and then petitioned the District Court for judicial review. The District Court affirmed, and Juro\u2019s appeals. Juro\u2019s does not challenge any finding of fact in the Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b69 The interpretation of an administrative rule is a question of law. <em>State Personnel v. </em>Investigators, 2002 MT 46, \u00b6 62, 308 Mont. 365, \u00b6 62, 43 P.3d 305, \u00b6 62 (citations omitted). Under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), a district court may review an administrative decision in a contested case to determine-among other things \u2014 whether the substantial rights of the party seeking review have been prejudiced because the decision is \u201caffected by... error of law.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(iv), MCA. This Court employs the same standard when reviewing a district court\u2019s order affirming or reversing an administrative decision. <em>Marble v. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Serv., </em>2000 MT 240, \u00b6 16, 301 Mont. 373, \u00b6 16, 9 P.3d 617, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted). Consequently, like the District Court, we determine whether the Decision\u2019s conclusion that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Rule was reasonable and not plainly inconsistent with the Rule\u2019s spirit is correct. <em>See Langager v. Crazy Creek Products, </em>Inc., 1998 MT 44, \u00b6 13, 287 Mont. 445, \u00b6 13, 954 P.2d 1169, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b610 Is the Decision\u2019s conclusion that the Department\u2019s interpretation of Rule 37.86.1806(7), ARM, was reasonable and not plainly inconsistent with the Rule\u2019s spirit correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b611 As stated above, Rule 37.86.1806(7), ARM, provided that \u201cMedicaid will not reimburse delivery fees in addition to the amount reimbursed for diapers.\u201d The Decision set forth the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHh-\">Obviously, basic physical differences can be seen between <em>delivering </em>a product to a customer via company truck versus <em>shipping </em>the product by common carrier. But despite the obvious differences, there are obvious similarities as well. Both methods have the ultimate purpose of transferring a product to a customer, and there is a financial cost associated with either mode of transfer. In this case it is concluded that the similarities carry the day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The Decision concluded the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Rule\u2019s term \u201cdelivery fees\u201d to include shipping fees for diapers is \u201creasonable and not inconsistent with ARM 37.86.1806(7).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b612 In <em>Easy v. Dept. of Natural Res. &amp; Conserv. </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 306, 309, 752 P.2d 746, 748 (citations omitted), we determined that an \u201cagency\u2019s interpretation of its rule is afforded great weight,\u201d courts should \u201cdefer to that interpretation unless it is \u2018plainly inconsistent\u2019 with the spirit of the rule,\u201d and the interpretation will be upheld \u201cso <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by the wording.\u201d We note that <em>Easy </em>was not a MAPA case, but we have applied its principles in MAPA cases. <em>See State Personnel, </em>\u00b6 63; <em>Brady v. Montana Dept. of Justice, </em>1999 MT 153, \u00b6 22, 295 Mont. 75, \u00b6 22, 983 P.2d 292, \u00b6 22. Conversely, of course, we do not defer to an \u201cincorrect agency decision.\u201d <em>Grouse Mountain Assoc. v. PSC </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 65, 69, 943 P.2d 971, 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">\u00b613 Juro\u2019s primary assertion of error in the Decision\u2019s conclusion regarding the Department\u2019s interpretation is that the Department changed its interpretation when it assessed the overpayment in 2000. In support of this position, Juro\u2019s points to the 1995 notice of the Rule\u2019s amendment, the actual reimbursement of claims for diaper shipping costs during the audit period, and a 2001 amendment to the Medicaid rules. Juro\u2019s also argues the analysis of similarities and differences between shipping and delivery in the Decision was improper, and the \u201ccommon meaning\u201d of the term \u201cdeliver\u201d indicates the term \u201cdelivery fees\u201d does not include shipping costs. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">1995 Notice of the Rule\u2019s Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b614 Juro\u2019s asserts the following comment and response in the 1995 notice of amendment to the Rule (before it was renumbered) indicates the Department initially interpreted the Rule to prohibit reimbursement of provider travel only, and the Department should be bound by that interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">COMMENT: Why will the department not cover delivery services for diapers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">RESPONSE: [Another rule from the same subchapter regarding Medicaid prosthetic devices, durable medical equipment and medical supplies] states that provider travel is not reimbursable; delivery is a form of provider travel, which is not separately reimbursable for any durable medical equipment. The department believes the proposed fee for diapers is reasonable to reimburse providers and assure access for recipients without an additional delivery fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">18 Mont. Admin. Reg. 1973 (Sept. 28, 1995). According to Juro\u2019s, the Department changed its position in 2000 by interpreting the Rule to preclude reimbursement for both \u201cprovider travel\u201d and common carrier delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">\u00b615 The Department responds that its interpretation of the Rule did not change between 1995 and 2000. It correctly observes that the comment and response relied upon by Juro\u2019s does not address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>meaning of the term \u201cdelivery fees\u201d or limit that term to \u201cprovider travel.\u201d The commentary merely addresses the Department\u2019s reasons for not reimbursing delivery services. Moreover, the description of delivery as \u201ca form of provider travel\u201d suggests that \u201cprovider travel\u201d is a broader term than Juro\u2019s posits here.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b616 The Department also characterizes Rule 37.86.1806(7), ARM, as a cost containment measure which set an all-inclusive fee for diapers. The response quoted above is not inconsistent with this characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b617 In addition, the Department points to another comment and response in the 1995 notice of the Rule\u2019s amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">COMMENT: How did medicaid come up with fees for diapers, shields and pads?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">RESPONSE: The department sent surveys to all suppliers that provide diapers for medicaid recipients and asked them about prices charged for diapers, and the amount needed to continue supplying medicaid recipients with diapers. Prices ranged from 40 cents to $1.50. Suppliers on the upper end of the scale were also increasing prices charged to medicaid because they were delivering as well as selling diapers to their medicaid clients. We then looked at suppliers in particular areas and found that there were already suppliers in all areas supplying diapers at 70 cents or less. The department has not received any comments from suppliers indicating that they would not be providing diapers because of the new medicaid fee schedule. The department believes the proposed fee is reasonable and adequate to reimburse providers and assure access for recipients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">18 Mont. Admin. Reg. 1970 (Sept. 28, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">\u00b618 This commentary reveals that, in setting a \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d fee, the Department considered the impact of transport costs-namely, that some suppliers were \u201cincreasing prices ... because they were delivering\u201d-but providers also existed \u201cin all areas supplying diapers at 70 cents or less.\u201d The Department\u2019s discussion of its fee-setting process indicates that the intent behind the Rule was to contain costs. Other subsections of the Rule reflect a similar intent. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rule 37.86.1806(l)(a), ARM (providing that the Department will pay a provider the provider\u2019s customary charge for the item or the price set by the Department\u2019s fee schedule, whichever is lower). Overall, the commentary lends support to, but in any event does not establish error in, the Decision\u2019s conclusion that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Rule as precluding reimbursement of shipping costs was neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u201cplainly inconsistent\u201d with the Rule\u2019s spirit nor outside the range of reasonable interpretation. <em>See State Personnel, </em>\u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">Actual Reimbursement</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b619 Juro\u2019s next argues the Department\u2019s actual reimbursement of Medicaid code W2839 claims for diaper shipping costs during the audit period \u201creinforced\u201d Juro\u2019s interpretation that the Rule precluded reimbursement for provider delivery only. In other words, Juro\u2019s contends that the Department\u2019s reimbursement of diaper shipping costs over the years equates to the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Rule as authorizing such reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"AaIr\">\u00b620  The record reflects the Department pays claims on an \u201cas submitted\u201d basis and later audits those payments. As a practical matter, the Department-similar to many businesses-cannot audit every claim as received. The Department audits claims and assesses overpayments only after paying claims during an audit period. Thus, the Department\u2019s payments do not constitute an interpretation of the Rule as allowing reimbursement of diaper shipping costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b621 Moreover, the Montana Legislature has expressly provided that the Department \u201cis entitled to collect from a provider, and a provider is liable to the department for ... the amount of a payment... to which the provider was not entitled, regardless of whether the incorrect payment was the result of department or provider error or other cause ....\u201d Section 53-6-111(2)(a)(i), MCA. Juro\u2019s argument that the Department\u2019s reimbursement of claims precluded it from later determining the reimbursed claims constituted an overpayment would render \u00a7 53-6-111(2)(a)(i), MCA, meaningless. We refrain from interpreting a statute in a manner that would defeat its purpose. <em>Hawley v. Board of Oil and Gas Conservation, </em>2000 MT 2, \u00b6 12, 297 Mont. 467, \u00b6 12, 993 P.2d 677, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted). Therefore, we reject Juro\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">2001 Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b622 Juro\u2019s also asserts in a footnote, without any supporting authority, that the Department\u2019s 2001 amendment to its rules \u201cadds credence\u201d to its contention that the Department changed its interpretation. As amended, the rules provide that the Department does not reimburse \u201cany delivery, mailing or shipping fees or other costs of transporting the item to the recipient\u2019s location\u201d for prosthetic devices, durable medical equipment, and medical supplies-including diapers. <em>See </em>8 Mont. Admin. Reg. 605 (Apr. 26, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"A3m\">\u00b623  We generally apply the same principles in construing administrative rules as we do in construing statutes. <em>Glendive Medical </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Center, Inc. v. DPHHS, </em>2002 MT 131, \u00b6 15, 310 Mont. 156, \u00b6 15, 49 P.3d 560, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted). Amendments are presumed to indicate an intent to change existing law. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court, </em>2000 MT 266, \u00b6 18, 302 Mont. 39, \u00b6 18, 22 P.3d 166, \u00b6 18 (citations omitted). The presumption is not conclusive, however, because an amendment may merely clarify the lawmaker\u2019s intent. <em>See Mont. Dept. of Rev. v. Am. Smelting &amp; Refining </em>(1977), 173 Mont. 316, 325, 567 P.2d 901, 906 (citation omitted); <em>Madison v. Pierce </em>(1970), 156 Mont. 209, 216-17, 478 P.2d 860, 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b624 Here, the Department stated that the 2001 amendment would \u201cclarify\u201d its longstanding policy not to pay any delivery fees or shipping costs for diapers and durable medical equipment. <em>See </em>8 Mont. Admin. Reg. 610 (Apr. 26, 2001). Absent both authorities to the contrary and a developed argument, we decline to address Juro\u2019s assertion regarding the 2001 amendment further. <em>See </em>Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Similarities and Differences</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b625 As noted above, the Decision stated shipping and delivery were similar, because both involve associated costs and the ultimate purpose of transferring a product to a customer. Juro\u2019s asserts this analysis is irrelevant to the interpretation of the Rule\u2019s language that \u201cMedicaid will not reimburse delivery fees in addition to the amount reimbursed for diapers.\u201d We disagree. In determining whether the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Rule is reasonable, the central question is whether the term \u201cdelivery fees\u201d includes shipping costs. The analysis of similarities and differences between delivery and shipping relates to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b626 Juro\u2019s also challenges the observation in the Decision that both shipping and delivery incur costs. It contends the failure to distinguish the \u201cincremental\u201d shipping costs added to a business\u2019s overhead from the \u201cfixed costs\u201d of provider delivery constitutes error. However, Juro\u2019s does not support this conclusory statement with citation to authority or substantial discussion. <em>See </em>Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. While it is true that fixed and incremental costs are different, both are costs. Juro\u2019s simply does not articulate a rationale for its notion that the issue of whether the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Rule is reasonable rests in any way on the distinction between types of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u201cCommon Meaning\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b627 Finally, Juro\u2019s argues the Department intended to distinguish the term \u201cdelivery\u201d from the term \u201cshipping\u201d by using the term \u201cdelivery fees\u201d in the Rule and the term \u201cshipping charges\u201d in the description of Medicaid code W2839, under which Juro\u2019s submitted the claims at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>issue. Specifically, it argues \u201cthe most common meaning of the term \u2018deliver\u2019 is to hand over, which implies a direct transaction between two parties. On the other hand, the term \u2018ship\u2019 means to cause to be transported-this implies that a middleman has a part in the transaction.\u201d This analysis apparently stems from entries in <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary, </em>the year and edition of which are not of record, submitted at the hearing. Juro\u2019s does not provide any authority regarding implicit meanings or the selection of a word\u2019s \u201cmost common meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\">\u00b628 As the Department observes, and Juro\u2019s witness conceded at the hearing, the submitted dictionary entry for the word \u201cdeliver\u201d contains more than one definition. Moreover, Juro\u2019s implicitly concedes in its brief on appeal that the word \u201cdeliver\u201d encompasses shipping by using the word \u201c[djeliveries\u201d to describe the transport of packages \u201cshipped via United Parcel Service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b629  An appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>Hawkins v. Harney, </em>2003 MT 58, \u00b6 35, 314 Mont. 384, \u00b6 35, 66 P.3d 305, \u00b6 35 (citation omitted). Based on the multiple dictionary definitions, Juro\u2019s concessions that \u201cdeliver\u201d has more than one meaning, and the lack of authority provided on appeal, we conclude Juro\u2019s has not met its burden of establishing error based on the \u201ccommon meaning\u201d of the term \u201cdeliver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8Y\">\u00b630  We conclude the Decision\u2019s conclusion that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Rule as precluding reimbursement of shipping costs for diapers was reasonable and not plainly inconsistent with the Rule\u2019s spirit is correct. Therefore, we hold the District Court did not err in upholding the final administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-7\">JUSTICES WARNER, REGNIER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
