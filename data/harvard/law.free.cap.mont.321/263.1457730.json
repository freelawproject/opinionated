L. Tvedt Insurance, Inc. (Tvedt), appeal the May 23, 2002, opinion and order of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Judicial District Court, Missoula County, wherein the court granted summary judgment in favor of Farmers Group of Companies (Farmers) on his claims for breach of contract, wrongful discharge, and indemnification of employment expenses. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b62 Tvedt presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Farmers on Tvedt\u2019s two breach of contract claims: (a) the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (b) waiver of the \u201cat will\u201d termination clause?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Farmers on Tvedt\u2019s wrongful termination claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in dismissing Tvedt\u2019s claims for business expense indemnification?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\u00b66 Tvedt commenced working as an insurance agent for Farmers in 1978. Eight years later, on December 1, 1986, when Farmers offered Tvedt the position of District Manager in Missoula, Tvedt entered into a contract with Farmers called the District Manager\u2019s Appointment Agreement (Manager\u2019s Agreement). The Manager\u2019s Agreement appointed Tvedt as \u201cDistrict Manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\u00b67 On February 10, 2000, after serving thirteen years as District Manager, Tvedt formed a corporation called L. L. Tvedt Insurance, Inc., which, according to his affidavit, was for the purpose of facilitating operation of an incorporated insurance agency for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">\u00b68 On January 8,2001, a second agreement, called Corporate District Manager Appointment Agreement (Corporate Agreement), was entered into, this time between L. L. Tvedt Insurance, Inc., and Farmers. The Corporate Agreement appointed L. L. Tvedt Insurance Agency, Inc., as \u201cDistrict Manager,\u201d and Tvedt, individually, as \u201cSupervising District Manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">\u00b69 The Manager\u2019s Agreement and the Corporate Agreement (collectively, Agreements) contained several mutual clauses applicable to this appeal. Both agreements contained an \u201cat will\u201d termination clause which permitted cancellation of the agreement by either party without cause on thirty days\u2019 written notice. Further, both agreements contained a \u201ccontract value\u201d clause which established a liquidated value of the contract based upon years of service with the company. The Corporate Agreement provided that, in the event Farmers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>terminated the agreement, Farmers would pay the liquidated sum to the terminated party. The Manager\u2019s Agreement also required a compensation payment by Farmers upon termination, but provided that an amount less than the \u201ccontract value\u201d could be negotiated by the parties. Both agreements contained an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d clause which stated that nothing in the agreement was intended to create an employer-employee relationship, but, rather, that district managers worked in the capacity of an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b610 In 1996, Farmers published <em>District Manager Performance Standards and Expectations </em>(Standards) which set forth standards for district managers, including Tvedt. In 1998, Farmers published a second edition of the <em>Standards </em>which included, <em>inter </em>alia: (1) a clause indicating the <em>Standards </em>would be applied to determine renewability of district managers\u2019 contracts, and (2) a clause indicating the <em>Standards </em>in no way modified Farmers\u2019 right to terminate on thirty days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b611 Tvedt has maintained throughout the dispute with Farmers that, as District Manager, he met and often exceeded the criteria delineated in the <em>Standards. </em>Tvedt asserted that in the year 2000, his production of insurance sales exceeded the production quotas, as follows: 163 percent of life insurance, 128.4 percent of automobile insurance, 104.4 percent of commercial insurance, and 109.1 percent of fire insurance. In the first three months of 2001, Tvedt alleged similarly high percentages.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b6 12 Nonetheless, on March 6,2001, Tvedt received the first of a series of letters from Bruce H. Gordon, Division Marketing Manager for Farmers, criticizing his performance as District Manager. Shortly thereafter, on May 16, 2001, Tvedt received a termination letter from David Dela Torre, State Executive Director for Farmers, giving him thirty days\u2019 written notice of termination of employment, without cause, effective June 15, 2001. Enclosed with the termination letter was a Notice of Termination of Appointment Agreement(s) and Agencies which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">Please be advised that any and all appointment agreements and any and all agencies existing between you and the undersigned, and any and all appointments, whether as District Manager or as District Agency of and for the undersigned, are hereby terminated pursuant to the terms of said agreement(s); said termination to be effective as of the termination date shown above [June 15, 2001] without further notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">On June 28, 2001, Farmers issued, at Tvedt\u2019s request, another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>termination letter along with another Notice of Termination of Appointment Agreement(s) and Agencies, which extended the effective termination date to June 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b613 Pursuant to their agreements, Farmers calculated Tvedt\u2019s \u201ccontract value\u201d to be $313,225.00 on the basis that Tvedt, at the time of termination, had worked fourteen years, seven months for Farmers. On August 13, 2001, Farmers issued Tvedt a check representing the first of four equal \u201ccontract value\u201d installment payments. Although the record makes reference to further payments, the total amount which has been paid to Tvedt is not specified therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b614 On December 12, 2001, Tvedt brought a three-count complaint against Farmers for breach of contract, wrongful termination, and indemnification of expenses. Tvedt alleged Farmers had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, had waived the \u201cat will\u201d clauses in the Agreements by its actions, and had erroneously characterized him as an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d rather than an \u201cemployee.\u201d Claiming employee status, Tvedt sought relief under Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA), set forth in \u00a7 39-2-901, <em>et seq., </em>MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b615 On F ebruary 13,2002, Farmers moved for summary judgment. On May 8,2002, while its motion for summary judgment was still pending, Farmers filed an answer and contingent counterclaim whereby the counterclaim would not be pursued if the District Corut dismissed Tvedt\u2019s complaint pursuant to Farmer\u2019s outstanding motion for summary judgment. Farmers\u2019 counterclaim stated that, in the event the District Corut found that Tvedt was an \u201cemployee\u201d of Farmers, then Farmers\u2019 obligations to pay Tvedt his \u201ccontract value\u201d should cease, and all payments to Tvedt should be returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b616 On May 23,2002, the District Corut entered its opinion and order granting Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all claims. Tvedt appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u00b617 This Court\u2019s standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Meyer v. Creative Nail Design, Inc., </em>1999 MT 74, \u00b6 13, 294 Mont. 46, \u00b6 13, 975 P.2d 1264, \u00b6 13. <em>See also Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 443, 446, 930 P.2d 661, 663 (citing <em>Motarie v. Northern Mont. Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156). This Court reviews a summary judgment order entered pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>Meyer, </em>\u00b6 13; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 446, 930 P.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b618 In proving that summary judgment is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">[t]he movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. [This Court] review[s] the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\"><em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264-65, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (citations omitted). In order to be granted summary judgment, the \u201cmoving party has the burden of showing a complete absence of any genuine issue as to all facts considered material in light of the substantive principles that entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Meyer, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Kolar v. Bergo </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 262, 266, 929 P.2d 867, 869).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Auu\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b619 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Farmers on Tvedt\u2019s two breach of contract claims: (a) the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (b) waiver of the \u201cat will\u201d termination clause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b620 Tvedt alleges that Farmers breached both Agreements by terminating the contracts without good cause and with inadequate notice, constituting a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in both Agreements. We first address Tvedt\u2019s assertion that Farmers breached the Agreements on grounds of inadequate notice. Tvedt asserts that he received the first notice of termination on May 16,2001, with an effective date of June 15,2001, but Farmers did not follow through on that termination. By June 28, 2001, Tvedt contends he was still district manager. On June 28, 2001, Farmers sent Tvedt another letter and notice of termination with an effective date of June 30,2001. This, according to Tvedt, amounted to a two-day notice of termination which was contrary to the thirty-day notice provision, thus constituting a breach of contract. Farmers asserts that it voluntarily extended the termination notice for fifteen days from June 15th to June 30th at Tvedt\u2019s request. In a letter from Farmers to Tvedt dated June 28, 2001, Farmers wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Mr. Tvedt: Please be advised on May 16, 2001, we gave you a notice of termination to be effective June 15, 2001. This termination date has been extended 15 days after further discussion with you for personal reasons effective June 30, 2001</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGr\">\u00b621  The record reflects that the District Court made specific inquiry at the summary judgment hearing regarding the reason the termination date was extended from June 15, 2001, to June 30, 2001:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0f\">Court: And ... this was at his request the additional 15 days be given?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">Counsel: Yes ... that\u2019s when he wanted to be terminated. I mean he says let\u2019s make it effective that day. Instead of two weeks ago, let\u2019s make it effective the end of the month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">Court: And Mr. Tvedt\u2019s affidavit doesn\u2019t dispute that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Counsel: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Thus, the District Court did not err in concluding no breach occurred based on notice. The fact Tvedt was granted an additional fifteen days before his position would terminate did not constitute inadequate notice under the terms of the Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\n<em>Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\u00b622 Tvedt asserts the District Court erred in concluding the \u201cat will\u201d termination clauses precluded a finding that Farmers breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Tvedt further asserts the District Court erred in disregarding substantial evidence that Farmers used discretion conferred on it by the Agreements in an unreasonable manner to act dishonestly or outside accepted commercial practices, contrary to the mandates of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which deprived him of the benefit of the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">\u00b623 Farmers counters that it did not exercise discretion in terminating Tvedt, but rather a a right. Therefore, Farmers contends it did not breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Farmers alleges that, according to the \u201cat will\u201d termination provisions, it was at liberty to terminate Tvedt on thirty days\u2019 notice, with or without cause. Furthermore, Farmers argues that according to the language of the Agreements, it did not need a reason to terminate Tvedt, and, by signing the Agreements, Tvedt conceded as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">\u00b624 In its order granting Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the District Court found no breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with respect to either agreement, setting forth several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>relevant standards recognized by this Court for contract interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">We must interpret the intent of parties to a contract from only the contract when the terms are unambiguous. <em>See Habets v. Swanson, </em>2000 MT 367, \u00b6 13, 303 Mont. 410, \u00b6 13, 16 P.3d 1035, \u00b6 13. \u201cAn ambiguity exists when the contract taken as a whole in its wording or phraseology is reasonably subject to two different interpretations.\u201d <em>Wray v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 219, 223, 879 P.2d 725, <em>121 </em>(quoting <em>Morning Star Enterprises v. R. H. Grover, Inc. </em>(1991), 274 Mont. 105, 111, 805 P.2d 553, 557). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law that a court must decide. <em>See Carelli v. Hall </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 202, 209, 926 P.2d 756, 761.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b625 With these provisions in mind, the District Court then examined the \u201cat will\u201d provisions of both the Manager\u2019s and the Corporate Agreements. The District Court found no ambiguity in the \u201cat will\u201d provision of the Manager\u2019s Agreement, which stated \u201c[t]his Agreement ... may be cancelled without cause by either the District Manager or the Companies on 30 days written notice ...,\u201d or the Corporate Agreement, which stated, \u201c[t]his Agreement may be canceled with or without cause by either the District Manager Agency or the Companies on thirty 30 days written notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b626 Tvedt argues, however, that even though the Agreements contained this language, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not negated by the \u201cat will\u201d termination provisions. He contends that where, as alleged here, an employer uses discretion conferred by contract to act dishonestly or outside accepted commercial practices to deprive an employee of the benefit of the contract, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is breached despite the existence of an \u201cat will\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b627 This argument relies on the fifth prong of the framework for breach of implied covenant claims as set forth in <em>Weldon v. Montana Bank </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 88, 885 P.2d 511:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">(1) every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (2) a breach of the covenant is a breach of the contract; (3) a breach of an express term of the contract is not a prerequisite to a breach of the implied covenant; (4) the conduct required by the implied covenant is honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade; and (5) <em>when one party uses discretion conferred by the contract to act dishonestly or to act outside of accepted commercial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>practices to deprive the other party of the benefit of the contract, the contract is breached.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><em>Weldon, </em>268 Mont. at 94, 885 P.2d at 515 (emphasis added). In support of their respective positions, both parties cite <em>Weldon </em>for the proposition that, in the absence of contract-conferred discretion, it is questionable whether a breach of the covenant occurs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">Without some attempt by one party to \u201c[use] discretion conferred by the contract to act dishonestly or to act outside the accepted commercial practices to deprive the other party of the benefit of the contract,\u201d it is questionable whether any breach of the covenant occurred, even if the conduct amounts to breaches of other common law obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\"><em>Weldon, </em>268 Mont. at 95, 885 P.2d at 515 (quoting <em>Shupak v. New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(D. Mont. 1991), 780 F. Supp. 1328, 1342 (alteration in original)(citing <em>Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 436, 450, 791 P.2d 767, 775)). Tvedt contends Farmers\u2019 general discretion to terminate the Agreements was subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Farmers, however, contends the Agreements conferred no discretion, and that, according to express language contained therein, it could terminate on a thirty days\u2019 notice, with or without cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b628 The holdings in several decisions of this Court support Farmers\u2019 position. In <em>Farris v. Hutchinson </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 334, 838 P.2d 374, where an employer did not renew an employee\u2019s one-year employment contract pursuant to a non-renewal provision of the contract, we held that an implied covenant claim could not be sustained because the employer had terminated the employee, without cause, under an express provision of the contract. <em>Farris, </em>254 Mont. at 338, 838 P.2d at 376. Similarly, in <em>Prout v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 152, 772 P.2d 288, and <em>Stark v. Circle K Corp. </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 468, 751 P.2d 162, where at-will employees had signed written agreements permitting termination with or without cause, we gave effect to the written agreements by permitting the employer to terminate without cause thereunder. <em>Prout, </em>236 Mont. at 158, 772 P.2d at 292; <em>Stark, </em>230 Mont. at 476, 751 P.2d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b629 <em>Prout </em>and <em>Stark </em>addressed terminations which were purportedly \u201cwith cause,\u201d in contrast to the \u201cwithout cause\u201d termination at issue here. Nonetheless, \u201c[i]n <em>Prout </em>we gave effect to the written agreements and said the employer could fire without cause under the agreements, but that if it asserted the termination was for cause, the employee must have an opportunity to prove that the cause stated was false.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>Farris, </em>254 Mont. at 339, 838 P.2d at 377. Likewise, in <em>Stark, </em>we allowed the jury to decide, given the employer\u2019s termination based upon cause, \u201cwhether or not the employer had cause and had followed its own policies.\u201d <em>Farris, </em>254 Mont. at 339, 838 P.2d at 377. However, \u201c[t]he eventual determination of these factual issues in <em>Stark </em>and <em>Prout </em>did not and would not contradict the express wording of the respective agreements,\u201d which would have allowed termination without cause, and we limited the application of the implied covenant to \u201cthe interpretation of the words \u2018with cause\u2019 and the discretion of the employer thereunder.\u201d <em>Farris, </em>254 Mont. at 339, 838 P.2d at 377. Thus, in both cases, the implied covenant addressed the interpretation of the words \u201cwith cause\u201d only, and not a factual situation where, as here, the employer gave no stated cause for the termination pursuant to an express contractual provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b630 Like the employers in <em>Farris, Prout, </em>and <em>Stark, </em>Farmers not only had included an express \u201cat will\u201d termination clause in both Agreements, but also had further stated in the <em>Standai'ds </em>that \u201c[t]his program in no way modifies the Companies\u2019 right to terminate on 30 days\u2019 notice, with or without cause, anytime during the measurement cycle.\u201d Tvedt, like the employees in each of these cases, was aware that the potential existed for termination upon thirty days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"ANNI\">\u00b631  As we have stated, \u201c[a]n agreement made in writing cannot be altered except in writing or by an executed oral agreement, and not otherwise.\u201d <em>Farris, </em>254 Mont. at 338, 838 P.2d at 376. In <em>Farris, </em>we quoted with approval the Supreme Court of the State of California in its determination of how the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing should be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">We are aware of no reported case in which a court has held the covenant of good faith may be read to prohibit a party from doing that which is expressly permitted by an agreement. On the contrary, as a general matter, implied terms should never be read to vary express terms. \u201cThe general rule [regarding the covenant of good faith] is plainly subject to the exception that the parties may, by express provisions of the contract, grant the right to engage in the very acts and conduct which would otherwise have been forbidden by an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.... [\u00b6] This is in accord with the general principle that, in interpreting a contract \u2018an implication ... should not be made when the contrary is indicated in clear and express words.\u2019 Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 564, p. 298 (1960) .... [\u00b6] As to acts and conduct authorized by the express provisions of the contract, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be implied which forbids such acts and conduct. And if defendants were given the right to do what they did by the express provisions of the contract there can be no breach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><em>Farris, </em>254 Mont. at 338-39, 838 P.2d at 376-77 (citing <em>Carma Developers Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc. </em>(1992), 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 485, 826 P.2d 710, 728 (internal citations omitted). Thus, under Montana law, implied contractual provisions will not be applied where, as here, express provisions govern. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err in granting Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis Farmers did not breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Waiver of \u201cAt Will\u201d Termination Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b632 Tvedt\u2019s next breach of contract claim asserts that Farmers\u2019 conduct waived any \u201cat will\u201d provisions in the Agreements. Specifically, Tvedt argues that, despite the \u201cat will\u201d termination language in the appointment agreements and a reference to the \u201cat will\u201d termination in the <em>Standards, </em>Farmers\u2019 express declarations and conduct reasonably induced a belief that it was waiving its discretion to terminate at will. In support of his argument, Tvedt cites the following language from the Standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">[individual District Managers must have a clear understanding of what is expected of them .... To determine whether the District Manager\u2019s contract is to be maintained or not, current year\u2019s ... results will be evaluated using the following General Component Criteria ... [and] These are the standards which all District Managers are expected to meet as a condition of continuing their District Managers\u2019 Appointment Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Tvedt also states that language contained in correspondence from Bruce Gordon, Division Marketing Manager, also induced the belief that Farmers had waived its discretion to terminate \u201cat will\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">In 2001, you must achieve your net gain requirement of 19 full time agents by yearend. Failure to achieve this performance standard may result in the termination of your District Manager Appointment Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">\u00b633 \u201c[W]aiver is a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right, claim or privilege which may be proved by express declarations or by a course of acts and conduct so as to induce the belief that the intention and purpose was to waive.\u201d <em>Idaho Asphalt Supply v. DOT, </em>1999 MT 291, \u00b6 19, 297 Mont. 66, \u00b6 19, 991 P.2d 434, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Kelly v. Lovejoy </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 516, 520, 565 P.2d 321, 324). Waiver must be \u201cmanifested in some unequivocal <em>manner.\u201d Idaho Asphalt Supply, </em>\u00b6 23. \u201cWhether there has been such acquiescence as to defeat the enforcement of a valid restriction depends upon the circumstances of each case and the character and materiality of the permitted <em>breach.\u201d Idaho Asphalt Supply, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Kelly, </em>172 Mont. at 520, 565 P.2d at 324).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b6 34 The District Court found that, while the <em>Standards </em>stated they would be used \u201cto determine whether the District Manager\u2019s contract is to be maintained or not\u201d and correspondence from Farmers to Tvedt urged him to meet them, the <em>Standards </em>also contained a clause stating: \u201cThis program in no way modifies the Companies\u2019 right to terminate on 30-days notice, with or without cause, anytime during the measurement cycle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFV\">\u00b635  Thus, in moving for summary judgment, Farmers established that it had reaffirmed its right to exercise the \u201cat will\u201d termination provision by reiterating the provision in the <em>Standards. </em>At that point, the burden shifted to Tvedt to demonstrate that Farmers unequivocally, intentionally, and voluntarily relinquished the right to enforce the \u201cat will\u201d provisions in the Agreements. However, Tvedt did not rebut Farmers\u2019 evidence, and thus failed to meet his burden. Farmers\u2019 effort to underscore its right, rather than relinquish it, is \u201cantithetical to a waiver.\u201d <em>Idaho Asphalt Supply, </em>\u00b6 28. Thus, summary judgment in favor of Farmers on the issue of waiver is appropriate as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b636 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Farmers on Tvedt\u2019s wrongful termination claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b637 Tvedt asserts the District Court erred in granting summary judgment against his wrongful discharge claim because genuine issues of material fact exist regarding his employment status and his right to seek damages pursuant to the WDEA. The Manager\u2019s Agreement contained the following clause indicating Farmers\u2019 intention that district managers hold \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">The time to be expended by the District Manager is solely within his/her discretion, and the persons to be solicited and the area within the district involved wherein solicitation shall be conducted is at the election of the District Manager. No control is to be exercised by the Companies over the time when, the place where, or the manner in which the District Manager shall operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>in carrying out the objectives of this Agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The Corporate Agreement contained essentially the same clause, the only difference being substitution of the words \u201cDistrict Manager Agency\u201d for \u201cDistrict Manager.\u201d The existence of this \u201cindependent contractor\u201d clause notwithstanding, Tvedt asserts that at the time of his termination he was nonetheless an \u201cemployee\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Farmers, thus entitling him to seek relief for wrongful termination under the WDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"A6g\">\u00b638 Tvedt offers two arguments in support of his assertion that he qualifies as an \u201cemployee\u201d: (1) he did not meet the statutory criteria for an \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d and (2) he was governed by, and Farmers recognized, both the Manager\u2019s Agreement and the Corporate Agreement at the time of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b639 Tvedt bases his first argument on \u00a7 39-51-201(15), MCA, which sets forth the statutory definition of \u201cindependent contractor\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV8\">39-51-201. General definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">(15) \u201cIndependent contractor\u201d means an individual who renders service in the course of an occupation and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">(a) has been and will continue to be <em>free from control or direction over the performance of the services, </em>both under a contract and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">(b) is <em>engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">(Emphasis added.) Tvedt asserts that from 1986 to 2001, the time period during which he served as District Manager, he was neither \u201cfree from control and direction over the performance of [his] services\u201d either under the contracts, or in fact, nor was he \u201cengaged in an independently established ... business.\u201d Instead, he asserts he continued the activities and business of his predecessor district manager and was compelled to follow the mandates of the company. Tvedt argues he meets neither part (a) nor part (b) of the statutory requirements, thus precluding designation as an \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d despite the inclusion of the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d clause in the Agreements. A review of the record reveals that the District Court did not make specific findings addressing the question as to whether Tvedt properly fell under the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d or \u201cindependent contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">\u00b640 Tvedt bases his second argument, i.e. that the Manager\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Agreement was still in effect concurrently with the Corporate Agreement at the time of his termination, on evidence presented to the District Court indicating that Farmers was still dealing with him as an individual under the Manager\u2019s Agreement. Tvedt presented evidence that the Manager\u2019s Agreement appointed him individually as \u201cDistrict Manager,\u201d and the subsequent Corporate Agreement, while appointing Tvedt\u2019s corporation as \u201cDistrict Manager Agency,\u201d still specifically appointed Tvedt as \u201cSupervising District Manager.\u201d Additionally, the record substantiates that Tvedt presented evidence that Farmers was still interacting with him individually, in addition to his corporation, in the form of correspondence, notices of termination, and checks from Farmers addressed specifically to \u201cL. Lee Tvedt,\u201d \u201cL. LeRoy Tvedt,\u201d or \u201cLee Tvedt.\u201d These documents, according to Tvedt, constitute evidence sufficient to raise the inference for summary judgment purposes that he, not L. L. Tvedt Insurance, Inc., was Farmers\u2019 \u201cemployee.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b641 Further, Tvedt asserts his individual capacity with Farmers continued after the formation of the Corporate Agreement because the Manager\u2019s Agreement was never formally terminated. He first notes that the Corporate Agreement contains no language specifically terminating the Manager\u2019s Agreement. Second, the Manager\u2019s Agreement, although it contains a provision specifying termination events, does not reference formation of the Corporate Agreement. Third, although the procedure specified in the Manager\u2019s Agreement provides for notice of termination of that agreement, no notice was given at the time of the formation of the Corporate Agreement that the prior agreement was being terminated or superseded.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b642 Farmers simply responds that \u201c[t]he new Agreement is presumed to be the only Agreement\u201d on the basis of novation. Section 28-1-1502, MCA, defines three ways in which a novation can occur:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">28-1-1502. Kinds of Novation. Novation is made by the substitution of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">(1) a new obligation between the same parties with intent to extinguish the old obligation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">(2) a new debtor in place of the old one with intent to release the latter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">(3) a new creditor in place of the old one with intent to transfer the rights of the latter to the former.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Farmers states that Tvedt and Farmers, at the time L. L. Tvedt Insurance, Inc., and Farmers signed the Corporate Agreement, entered into a new contract through operation of novation. In support of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>argument, Farmers cites <em>Kenison v. Anderson </em>(1928), 83 Mont. 430, 272 P.2d 679, in which one debtor in a land purchase transaction was substituted for another, with the former being released. However, as Tvedt correctly notes, <em>Kenison </em>represents a novation under subpart (2) of the statute, involving a \u201cnew debtor in place of the old one with intent to release the latter.\u201d Tvedt states that the facts in the case <em>sub judice </em>do not involve a debtor, as in <em>Kenison, </em>but rather fall under subpart (1) which requires substitution of \u201ca new obligation between <em>the same parties </em>with intent to extinguish the old obligation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to Tvedt, the two Agreements were not between the same parties since the Manager\u2019s Agreement was between Tvedt and Farmers, and the Corporate Agreement was between L. L. Tvedt Insurance, Inc., and Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"AoD\">\u00b643  This Court has stated that novation can never be presumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnT\">In order to effect a novation there must be a clear and definite intention on the part of all concerned that such is the purpose of the agreement, for <em>it is a well-settled principle that novation is never to be presumed </em>...; the point in every case, then, is, did the parties intend by their arrangement to extinguish the old debt or obligation and rely entirely on the new, or did they intend to keep the old alive and merely accept the new as further security, and this question of intention must be decided from all of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>Waite v. Andreassi </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 149, 149, 813 P.2d 987, 988 (emphasis added) <em>(citing Harrison v. Fregger </em>(1930), 88 Mont. 448, 454, 294 P. 372, 373). Thus, Farmers\u2019 assertion that a novation may be presumed from this record must be rejected. As noted above, because Tvedt has presented evidence indicating that at certain times Farmers interacted with Tvedt as an individual and other times as a corporation, this comprises facts in conflict which must be resolved at trial. Upon remand, both Farmers and Tvedt would have the opportunity to offer evidence of the presence or absence of novation.</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">\u00b644  Despite these and other indicia that Farmers recognized the continuation of Tvedt\u2019s individual capacity following the appointment of his corporation as a district manager agency, the District Court concluded only that the two agreements revealed a \u201cclear intention\u201d by the parties to substitute the corporation for the plaintiff personally. The court\u2019s rationale in support of this conclusion was: (1) the only way Tvedt could be compensated under the Corporate Agreement, aside from medical insurance, was to be paid by L. L. Tvedt Insurance, Inc., and (2) in their second amended complaint, Tvedt and his corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>chose to refer to themselves collectively as \u201cTvedt,\u201d therefore, \u201cPlaintiff see themselves as one entity.\u201d However, we conclude that, despite these observations, unresolved genuine issues of material fact existed on the questions of whether Tvedt was an \u201cemployee\u201d or an \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d and whether the Manager\u2019s Agreement, which recognized Tvedt individually, was still in effect at the time of termination, thus precluding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b645 Because it concluded that summary judgment was appropriate based upon Farmers\u2019 novation theory, the District Court concluded that Tvedt was not an employee, and, consequently, did not consider the issue of whether Tvedt was otherwise entitled, as a matter of law, to seek relief under the WDEA. Further, the parties\u2019 briefing on appeal did not focus on this issue. Therefore, we decline to address the issue, which may be considered upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b646 <em>Did the District Court err in dismissing Tvedt\u2019s claims for business expense indemnification?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b647 Finally, Tvedt asserts the District Court erred in dismissing his claims for reimbursement of business expenses which he lost, together with prejudgment interest, as a direct consequence of his duties to comply with Farmers\u2019 directives. The District Court summarily dismissed this claim noting: \u201cThe [district court] has already found that the parties were operating as two contracting businesses, thus, there was no employer-employee relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\u00b648 Tvedt\u2019s argument that his right to recover is not limited to Tvedt\u2019s individual employment status on the basis of \u00a7 39-2-101, MCA, is without merit. This section provides \u201c[t]he contract of employment is a contract by which one, who is called the employer, engages another, who is called the employee, to do something for the benefit of the employer____\u201d Although Tvedt attempts to define the word <em>another </em>as \u201ca corporation,\u201d we find neither legal precedent nor legislative intent for doing so. We agree with the District Court that \u201c[i]t is simply axiomatic that one corporation cannot be an employee of another.\u201d Consequently, this issue is contingent upon the District Court\u2019s finding, upon remand, regarding Tvedt\u2019s employment status. If Tvedt would be found to be an \u201cemployee,\u201d this would also revive his claim for reimbursement of business expenses paid by an \u201cemployee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">\u00b649 We reverse and remand for further proceedings on Issue 2 and Issue 3.</p>\n<judges id=\"b300-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\"> An \"employee\u201d is \u201ca person who works for another for hire [excluding independent contractors].\u201d Section 39-2-903(3), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b301-4\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"ASqX\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b650 I dissent to Issue 1. Farmers clearly waived the benefit of the \u201cat will\u201d provisions in the Agreements when it adopted and distributed the following Standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">[[Individual District Managers must have a clear understanding of what is expected of them.... To determine whether the District Manager\u2019s contract is to be maintained or not, current year\u2019s ... results will be evaluated using the following General Component Criteria ... [and] These are the standards which all District Managers are expected to meet as a condition of continuing their District Managers\u2019 Appointment Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b651 The Standards are clear: A district manager\u2019s contract renewal is not \u201cat will\u201d- i.e., not subject to the whim of the employer-but rather is measured by adherence to the General Component Criteria. If there was any doubt as to the import of this language, Farmers\u2019 Division Marketing Manager, Bruce Gordon, clarified that tenure as a manager with Farmers hinged not upon the caprice of the employer but rather on \u201cachievement\u201d and \u201cperformance,\u201d when he wrote: \u201c[Y]ou must achieve your net gain requirement of 19 full time agents by yearend. Failure to achieve this performance standard may result in the termination of your District Manager Appointment Agreement.\u201d The Court finds significance in the fact that Farmers\u2019 Standards covered all the bases and preserved its \u201cat will\u201d option by stating: \u201cThis program in no way modifies the Companies\u2019 right to terminate on 30-days notice, with or without cause, anytime during the measurement cycle.\u201d I do not buy into this Orwellian double speak. If Farmers maintained that it had \u201cat will\u201d discretion to terminate a manager, there would be no need for Farmers to set standards stating that if the manager does not meet certain performance standards, he or she may be terminated. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, the Standards are nothing more than surplusage. In effect Farmers has stated, \u201cif you do not meet the performance standards you may be terminated and if you do meet the standards you may still be terminated.\u201d I disagree. Standards are the antithesis of \u201cat will\u201d discretion. Farmers cannot have it both ways. In adopting the Standards, Farmers clearly promised its managers that if they meet certain standards their contracts will continue. This constitutes a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right to terminate \u201cat will.\u201d <em>Idaho Asphalt Supply v.
