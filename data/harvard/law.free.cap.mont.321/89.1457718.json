Struble (Struble) appeals the judgment of the Third Judicial District Court, Powell County, denying his motion for a directed verdict and his motion in limine and granting the State of Montana\u2019s (the State) motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Struble\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Struble\u2019s motion in limine regarding admission of three types of logbooks used by the Montana State Prison?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in granting the State\u2019s motion in limine regarding introduction of a letter?</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b66 Struble worked at the Montana State Prison (MSP) for 27 years, from 1974 to 2001. Struble was promoted throughout his years of service, and he ultimately obtained the position of third shift captain in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b67 The MSP operates on a hierarchy system, whereby the Warden is responsible for the operation of the prison. Two deputy wardens serve under the Warden, one of whom is Tom Wood (Wood). Three shift captains serve under Wood, while two lieutenants serve under each shift captain. Struble, as third shift captain, served under Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b68 Each shift captain works a different shift. As the third shift captain, Struble worked from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., although due to an overlap in the shift captains\u2019 schedules, Struble could arrive anytime between 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Struble worked four ten-hour shifts, having Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off each week.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b69 Struble worked in the command post, which the Warden of MSP considered the \u201chub\u201d of the prison. While at the command post, Struble supervised the correctional officers on duty; built schedules; reviewed leave requests; conducted security inspections of the prison; and disciplined the officers under his command.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b610 As a command post captain, Struble was required to serve as a duty officer once every two months, whereby he was on-call twenty four hours a day. He earned a guaranteed one hour of overtime Monday through Friday and two hours of overtime on Saturday and Sunday. He earned additional overtime for the time it took for him to handle a situation while on-call. Also, as a shift captain, Struble was required to attend four training sessions per year and to attend regularly-scheduled shift commander and unit manager meetings, which usually occurred once a month. Struble also was occasionally required to serve on committees and to participate in personnel matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b611 Accrual of overtime was a concern at the MSP, and, in an attempt to reduce overtime, the MSP instituted a policy known as \u201cflexing.\u201d When \u201cflexing\u201d one\u2019s hours, for example, an employee who worked two additional hours on Monday would work two fewer hours on Tuesday so as not to accumulate overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">\u00b612 In January 2001, upon reviewing Struble\u2019s time sheet, Wood noticed that Struble had claimed two and one-half hours of overtime during a pay period. Wood did not believe this was correct, so he checked the command post logbook. The logbook indicated that Struble had worked an eight-hour shift on a particular day, thereby making it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>difficult for him to accumulate overtime. Wood also reviewed the checkpoint and lobby logbooks, which also indicated that Struble had worked less than forty hours that week and, thus, should not have accumulated overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b613 The MSP maintains several logbooks to ensure the safety of both the MSP employees and the inmates. The logbooks pertinent to Struble consisted of: (1) the checkpoint logbook; (2) the lobby logbook; and (3) the command post logbook. The checkpoint at the MSP controls the traffic into and out of the prison. It is manned twenty-four hours per day by a correctional officer. This officer must check in and check out each person who enters and exits the prison and the respective times each person enters and exits. Should the officer forget to log-in a person, the officer notes that the entry into the checkpoint logbook is a \u201clate entry.\u201d Several memoranda issued by Wood reiterated the need for the checkpoint officers to strictly adhere to the policy of checking in and checking out all individuals who enter and exit the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b614 The lobby at the MSP is another mechanism used by the prison to screen the individuals coming into and out of the prison. The lobby is open from 6:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. The officers who work in the lobby check in and check out all administrative staff, vendors, visitors, and volunteers who enter the prison. Frequently, Struble was logged in by these officers but not logged out due to the hours that the lobby was open.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b615 The command post is the \u201chub\u201d of the MSP and is manned by shift captains and lieutenants. Only shift captains and their lieutenants make entries into the command post logbook. The purpose of the command post logbook is to record who is on duty and what occurs while that person is on duty. As third shift captain, Struble was required to log in and to log out of the command post by recording both his name and the time he was on and off duty. This requirement was recorded in a memorandum written by Woods to all shift captains, stating that: \u201cEach shift commander is responsible to log himself into the command-post logbook when reporting for duty and, again, when leaving shift for the day. The time and date will be included preceding the entry as standard procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b616 After noticing the discrepancies in Struble\u2019s time sheet, Woods checked Struble\u2019s time sheets for the previous six months and, again, checked them against the logbooks. In so doing, Woods discovered a total of forty-eight hours for which Struble received payment that could not be accounted for by Struble\u2019s logbook entries or by training session or meeting minutes. Thereafter, Woods turned over his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>findings to Vickie Murphy (Murphy), a certified public accountant for the Department of Corrections (DOC), for additional investigation. \u00b617 Murphy began reviewing Struble\u2019s time sheets, leave slips, the logbooks, training records, compliance monitoring records, security audit records, personnel records, and meeting minutes. She entered the information she gathered into a spreadsheet, wherein she calculated the differences between the times Struble logged in and the times Struble logged out (as recorded in the command post logbook) in relation to the times that Struble claimed he had worked on his time sheets. If Struble had failed to log out, the spreadsheet indicated such an occurrence as an uncalculated number. Murphy also reviewed the checkpoint logbooks. Upon her review, she discovered instances where the hours that Struble indicated he had worked did not match the hours as reflected in the logbooks. She termed these instances as \u201cexceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b618 In reviewing the exceptions in her spreadsheet, Murphy considered only those exceptions that indicated a fifteen minute or greater difference. She consulted compliance monitoring records, security audit records, training and personnel records and meeting minutes, shift commander meeting minutes, and committee meeting minutes in an attempt to account for the exceptions that indicated a fifteen minute or greater time difference. Ultimately, Murphy discovered sixty three exceptions for which the time differences could not be accounted. She submitted this information to an investigator with the Department of Justice, and further investigation ensued. The State ultimately charged Struble with felony theft, felony tampering with public records, and misdemeanor official misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b619 Struble testified at trial that the logbook records upon which Murphy\u2019s spreadsheet was based were inaccurate, especially given that he sometimes failed to log in or to log out, he never entered a \u201clate entry\u201d into the logbooks, and he routinely flexed his time. Specifically, he testified that Murphy failed to account for the meetings for which no minutes existed or on which the minutes did not reflect he was in attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b620 A jury trial found Struble guilty of the felony theft and misdemeanor official misconduct charges. The District Court dismissed the felony tampering with public records charge before Struble\u2019s case was submitted to the Jury. Struble was sentenced to three years deferred on the felony theft charge and six months deferred on the misdemeanor official misconduct charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b621 Struble now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>a directed verdict and his motion in limine regarding introduction of a letter. He also appeals the District Court\u2019s granting of the State\u2019s motion in limine regarding introduction of the logbooks as evidence under the business records exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b622 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a directed verdict to determine whether, in denying that motion, the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 21, 290 Mont. 97, \u00b6 21, 966 P.2d 721, \u00b6 21. We review a district court\u2019s rulings on evidentiary matters, such as motions in limine, for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Delaney, </em>1999 MT 317, \u00b6 6, 297 Mont. 263, \u00b6 6, 991 P.2d 461, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u00b623 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Struble\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u00b624 Struble argues that no evidence existed to show that he \u201cwas not entitled to the payroll and benefits he received,\u201d nor was there direct evidence linking him to the alleged offenses. Struble maintains that no witnesses testified that he \u201cwas not working or engaged in employment related functions at the times he reported on his time cards,\u201d Further, the logbooks on which the State heavily relied, Struble argues, were \u201cinaccurate, untrustworthy and unreliable,\u201d as they \u201cwere not designed to keep time records of MSP\u2019s employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b625 The State counters that it \u201cpresented overwhelming evidence of Struble\u2019s guilt,\u201d through testimony of MSP accepted time sheet and logging practices. As such, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Struble\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"A3r\">\u00b626  Under \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, if the prosecution\u2019s evidence is insufficient to support a finding or verdict of guilty at the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence or at the close of all the evidence, then a district court may dismiss the action against the defendant upon a motion from the court or the defendant. However, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict only \u201cif reasonable men could not conclude from the evidence taken in a light most favorable to the prosecution that guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Hocevar, </em>2000 MT 157, \u00b6 118, 300 Mont. 167, \u00b6 118, 7 P.3d 329, \u00b6 118. Thus, \u201cwhen circumstantial evidence is susceptible to differing interpretations, it is within the providence of the jury to decide which will prevail.\u201d <em>State v. Brady, </em>2000 MT 282, \u00b6 28, 302 Mont. 174, \u00b6 28, 13 P.3d 941, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00b627 Upon Struble\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s evidence, the District Court ruled that it could not \u201cconcur\u201d that in considering the evidence \u201cin a light most favorable to the prosecution could it be said that the Jury could not find in favor of the State and convict the Defendant.\u201d Hence, the District Court denied Struble\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b628 Here, the Jury had before them considerable evidence concerning Struble\u2019s time sheets, MSP\u2019s policy regarding logbook entries, and Struble\u2019s duties as a shift captain. This evidence included the \u201cexceptions\u201d Murphy discovered and Struble\u2019s explanation of those \u201cexceptions.\u201d Hence, the Jury had before them evidence that was susceptible to differing interpretations-i.e., the Jury could choose to believe that Struble received payment for hours which he did not work, given the evidence of the hours that he reported against the times the logbooks reflected that he was working; or the Jury could choose to believe Struble\u2019s explanation that the seeming \u201cunaccounted\u201d hours were due to the fact that logbooks were inaccurate and did not reflect hours for which he was in training, on-call, or in civilian clothes. On this evidence, the standard for granting a directed verdict was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"ABE\">\u00b629  Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Struble\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, as the evidence does not meet the criteria necessary under \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b630 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Struble\u2019s motion in limine regarding admission of three types of logbooks used by the Montana State Prison?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b631 Struble argues that the logbooks should not have been admitted under the business records exception of the Montana Rules of Evidence, as the logbooks lack trustworthiness and are inadmissible on that basis. Specifically, Struble contends that because the MSP employees did not accurately maintain the logbooks, nor was there a systematic check in place to ensure the accuracy of the logbooks, the logbook business records cannot be presumed reliable. <em>Bean v. Montana Board of Labor Appeals, </em>1998 MT 222, \u00b6 20, 290 Mont. 496, \u00b6 20, 965 P.2d 256, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u00b632 The State argues that Struble\u2019s contentions regarding the logbooks go to the weight afforded to them as evidence, rather than their admissibility. Specifically, the State argues that it was \u201cundisputed that the logbooks were an intrinsic part of running the prison.\u201d As such, the State \u201cpresented the logbooks for what they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>were-regularly recorded business records and did not attempt to mislead the jury\u201d with the notion that the logbooks kept time records of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b633 Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid. Hearsay evidence is not admissible unless an exception applies. Rule 802, M.R.Evid. One such exception is the business records exception, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, made at or near the time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. Rule 803(6), M.R.Evid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b634 We addressed the business records exception in <em>Bean, </em>wherein we held that the Incident Report upon which the defendant\u2019s wrongful termination claim rested was inadmissible as a business record. <em>Bean, </em>\u00b6 27. We held that the Incident Report lacked trustworthiness because: (1) it was not prepared as part of the employer\u2019s routine business activity, and, rather, was prepared as part of the employer\u2019s activity of disciplining its employees; and (2) the information contained in the Incident Report was provided by a third party who was not an employee, and, thus, had no duty to report accurately to her employer. <em>Bean, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b635 We also addressed the business records exception in <em>State v. Edmundson </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 241, 805 P.2d 1289, wherein we held that the records at issue were trustworthy and admissible because they \u201cwere made in the regular course of business of the [group home],\u201d by an individual who had a duty to record any reported behavioral problems while the incidents were fresh in this individual\u2019s mind. <em>Edmundson, </em>246 Mont. at 244, 805 P.2d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b636 Here, as a shift captain for MSP, Struble was required to log himself in at the command post when he arrived on shift and to log himself out at the command post when he left. This requirement of MSP was documented in several memoranda from Struble\u2019s supervisor. Because the command post was considered the \u201chub\u201d of the MSP, documentation of who was on shift and what occurred during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>that shift was essential to the continued safety of the MSP employees and inmates. These safety concerns also prompted the logging in and logging out procedures applicable at both the MSP lobby and checkpoint stations. And, although not perfect, the policy of entering a \u201clate entry\u201d was instituted for instances when employees forgot to log in or log out either themselves or others.</p>\n<p id=\"AWp\">\u00b637  Unlike the Incident Report utilized in <em>Bean, </em>and similar to the report prepared in <em>Edmundson, </em>the MSP logbook records were prepared as part of MSP\u2019s routine activity. Activity at the MSP consists of operating a prison where inmates serve their respective sentences. These operations also incorporate prison safety for both the employees and the inmates. The logbooks are an essential part of these operations and, being kept in the regular course of MSP\u2019s business, are trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b638 In addition, these logbook records are trustworthy given that they are prepared by MSP employees as part of their routine duties. Unlike the Incident Report used in <em>Bean, </em>the MSP logbook records are prepared by MSP employees whose duties are to report accurately the variety of people who enter and exit the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b639 Therefore, we hold that the logbook records were admissible under the business records exception, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Struble\u2019s motion in limine regarding admission of these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b640 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in granting the State\u2019s motion in limine regarding introduction of a letter?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u00b641 Struble argues that the State lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute him. In support of his argument, Struble asserts that in a letter, which he intended to introduce, the county attorney admitted \u201cthat it lacked evidence\u201d which would establish that six other MSP employees \u201cwere not working or performing employment related functions at the times reported on their pay claim sheets.\u201d Hence, Struble argues that because the State used the same logbooks in its investigation of him as it did for the other six MSP employees, the State, in essence, admitted that it lacked evidence to prosecute him as well. Further, Struble argues that this letter was admissible under Rule 803(6) of the Montana Rules of Evidence, as the State \u201cprepared the letter as part of its regularly conducted business activities,\u201d and the letter was trustworthy because \u201cit was authored by the person against whom it was being offered.\u201d In addition, Struble argues that the State\u2019s admission in the letter was admissible as an admission by a party opponent under Rule 801(d)(2) of the Montana Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b642 The State argues that assuming the letter was admissible under the business records exception, which it was not, it was not relevant to the matters at issue in Struble\u2019s case. Specifically, the State argues that \u201c[a]t issue in Struble\u2019s case was whether Struble received compensation, based upon representations he made on his timesheets, for hours that he did not work.\u201d As such, the States asserts that the District Court \u201ccorrectly concluded that since the evidence against Struble was not exactly the same as the evidence, or lack of evidence, against other prison employees ... [the] evidence was not relevant to the matter at issue in Struble\u2019s case.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b643 Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"Anc\">\u00b644  Here, the issue before the District Court was whether Struble received payment from MSP for hours which he did not work. In attempting to prove that Struble did in fact receive these payments, the State introduced considerable time sheet and logbook evidence through testimony of several MSP employees. The letter that Struble attempted to introduce did not concern whether Struble received payment for hours which he did not work. Rather, this letter, written by the county attorney to the DOC, targeted the county attorney\u2019s concern that he did not have sufficient evidence to prosecute six other MSP employees on charges similar to Struble\u2019s-i.e., theft and official misconduct. Hence, this letter was not evidence tending to make any fact of consequence-whether Struble received payment for hours which he did not work-more probable or less probable. Simply, the letter did not concern Struble and was irrelevant to the State\u2019s prosecution of him. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State\u2019s motion in limine regarding Struble\u2019s attempt to introduce the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b645 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-8\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
