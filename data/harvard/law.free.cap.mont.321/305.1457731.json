A jury in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, found Bailey\u2019s employment was terminated during her probationary period and, as a result, the court entered judgment in favor of Beartooth, the only remaining defendant at the time of trial. Bailey appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion for new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by denying Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by failing to articulate that it had made a conscientious judgment as to Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">\u00b65 KTVH television in Helena, Montana, hired Pam Bailey as an advertising salesperson in 1987. Bailey was still employed at KTVH in July of 1997, when Beartooth purchased the television station and William Stebbins became its general manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">\u00b66 In November of 1997, Beartooth suspended Bailey from employment on grounds that she had violated company policy by disclosing company information to a competitor. Beartooth terminated Bailey\u2019s employment one week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">\u00b67 Bailey sued Beartooth, Sunbelt Communications Company and Stebbins for wrongful discharge, alleging that no good cause existed to justify her termination from employment. Before trial, Sunbelt and Stebbins moved for summary judgment and the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>dismissed the claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b68 Beartooth presented two defenses at trial. First, it asserted that Bailey was a probationary employee whose employment could be terminated without cause. Second, Beartooth contended that, even if Bailey was not a probationary employee, good cause existed for her termination. The jury found Bailey was a probationary employee during her employment with Beartooth and her employment was terminated during her probationary period. As a result, the District Court entered judgment for Beartooth.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">f 9 Bailey moved for a new trial on grounds that defense counsel made improper statements during closing argument and a juror engaged in misconduct. The District Court denied the motion and Bailey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b610 Our standard of review of the denial of a motion for new trial is whether the district court manifestly abused its discretion. <em>Satterfield v. Medlin, </em>2002 MT 260, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 234, \u00b6 14, 59 P.3d 33, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). An abuse of discretion occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>1998 MT 129, \u00b6 17, 289 Mont. 119, \u00b6 17, 960 P.2d 291, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err by denying Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">\n<em>a. Statements made by Beartooth\u2019s counsel during closing argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">\u00b612 During closing argument, Beartooth\u2019s counsel showed the jury an enlargement of a page from an employee handbook which Bailey had signed on July 21, 1997, entitled \u201cAcknowledgment of Receipt of Handbook.\u201d The page read, in relevant part, \u201cI acknowledge that I have received the KTVH Employee Handbook, and I accept responsibility to read it.\u201d The Acknowledgment also stated, \u201cI understand and agree that my employment is for no defined duration and that my employment may be terminated at any time, by either KTVH or myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">\u00b613 Bailey\u2019s counsel objected that the enlargement seemed to refer to at-will employment. In response to the objection, the District Court drew the jury\u2019s attention to the above language in the exhibit and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-13\">[The enlargement] refers to her being an at-will employee. I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>already ruled that that is not a part of this case in Montana. We do not have at-will employees, and the paragraph at the bottom of that page is not the law in Montana and does not apply to this case; and you\u2019re instructed to completely disregard that paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b614 Bailey contends that, because the page from the employee handbook implies employment at will, she was denied a fair trial. Relying on <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, 305 Mont. 446, 30 P.3d 326, she asserts we should grant a new trial to prevent a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">115 <em>Lopez </em>is of no assistance to Bailey. There, plaintiffs counsel persisted in asking numerous objectionable questions and raising impermissible inferences over the course of a two-day trial, despite the district court\u2019s repeated admonishments. We concluded the misconduct of plaintiffs counsel was so pervasive as to compel reversal. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-34. The situation here is far different. The employee handbook had been admitted into evidence as an exhibit pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation. In addition, the defense had shown the page from the employee handbook to the jury without objection during its cross-examination of Bailey and direct examination of another witness. Finally, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that counsel improperly showed the exhibit to the jury, the court cured any error by immediately admonishing the jury that Montana is not an at-will employment state.</p>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">\u00b616  We hold the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion by denying Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial based on statements made by defense counsel during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"AKS6\">\n<em>b. Juror misrepresentations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b617 During <em>voir dire, </em>counsel for both parties asked prospective jury members if they knew any of the parties or witnesses. They did not introduce Bailey\u2019s husband and he was not present at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b618 Bailey\u2019s husband was in the courtroom during trial, however. On the second day of trial, after Bailey rested her case, the court convened in chambers with counsel and Juror No. 7. The judge advised counsel that Juror No. 7 had informed the court she knew Bailey\u2019s husband. The juror stated she saw Bailey\u2019s husband in the courtroom during trial and realized she had briefly met him eight or ten years before when he had borrowed some tools from her husband. She reaffirmed her belief that she could be a fair and impartial juror. The juror then left chambers and the District Court offered counsel an opportunity to put anything else on the record. Bailey\u2019s counsel replied he had nothing more. The court ruled that the juror\u2019s statements did not require that she be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u00b619 Following the jury\u2019s verdict for Beartooth, Bailey moved for new trial on the basis that the juror had not revealed information regarding her past contact with the Baileys. Specifically, Bailey recalled a 1996 legal dispute concerning a proposed Helena Valley subdivision adjacent to property owned by the Baileys. The juror and her husband had contracted to purchase a lot in the proposed subdivision. Bailey submitted a copy of the minutes from a 1996 Lewis and Clark County Commission meeting listing both herself and the juror as attendees. She also submitted documents showing that, following the County Commission\u2019s approval of the subdivision, a homeowners association to which the Baileys belonged brought litigation against the subdivision, Lewis and Clark County, and the juror and her husband. Bailey characterizes her relationship with the juror in the subdivision matter as an adversary situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b620 Bailey cites two cases in support of her argument on this issue, neither of which involved a motion for new trial for juror misconduct. She cites <em>Satterfield </em>for the \u201cmanifest abuse of discretion\u201d standard of review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial. She cites <em>Westmark Intern. Corp. v. Gold Hill Placers, Inc., </em>2003 MT 119, 315 Mont. 492, 70 P.3d 731-a quiet title action in which we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial \u2014 only for the general proposition that irregularities in trial proceedings of a substantial nature justify a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b621 Bailey has not established a prior relationship with Juror No. 7 which rises to the level of adversaries, as she claims. The minutes of the County Commission meeting at which both Bailey and the juror were present do not indicate that either of them spoke publicly at the meeting. Further, the juror and her husband ultimately were dismissed from the subdivision litigation after they withdrew from the contract to purchase a lot. Bailey has established no dishonesty, lack of candor or misrepresentation on Juror No. 7's part. Moreover, until after the trial of this case was completed, Bailey herself apparently forgot about this purported \u201cadversary situation\u201d in which she had previously been involved with Juror No. 7. Her counsel did not advance this argument when the court offered counsel the opportunity to put anything else on the record. Indeed, counsel added nothing to the record and did not object to the District Court\u2019s decision regarding Juror No. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b622  We hold the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion by denying Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial because of juror misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err in failing to articulate that it had made a conscientious judgment as to Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b624 Bailey relies on the <em>Simmons Oil </em>definition of abuse of discretion as arbitrary acts \u201cwithout conscientious judgment\u201d to argue that a district court must make an affirmative showing that it has acted conscientiously in rendering a decision in response to a motion for a new trial. She states the District Court failed to articulate any reason why it denied her motion for a new trial and thus failed to satisfy that \u201crequirement.\u201d Contrary to Bailey\u2019s assertions, the language in <em>Simmons, </em>\u00b6 17, is merely a definition of abuse of discretion. It does not require or even suggest the necessity of an affirmative articulation by a trial court that it made a conscientious judgment in ruling on a motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b625 In relation to this issue, Bailey also mentions \u201cpronouncements\u201d by this Court in <em>C. Haydon Ltd. v. Montana Min. Properties, Inc. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 138, 146, 951 P.2d 46, 51. The page in the <em>Haydon </em>opinion to which Bailey refers reiterates the test for an abuse of discretion discussed above. Moreover, the discussion of the court\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial in that case does not impose any content requirements for an order denying such a motion. <em>See Haydon, </em>286 Mont. at 153-55, 951 P.2d at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b626  The District Court\u2019s order denying Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial states the parties\u2019 arguments were considered. Bailey has not established that anything more is required. We hold the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial by failing to articulate that it had made a conscientious judgment as to Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-9\">JUSTICES WARNER, RICE, REGNIER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
