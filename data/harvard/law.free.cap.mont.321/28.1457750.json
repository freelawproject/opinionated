Did the District Court err in finding that an equitable distribution of marital property automatically required an equal distribution?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b65 2. Was the District Court\u2019s finding of fact valuing each share of the Bartsch Farms, Inc. stock at $3.62 based on substantial evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"Aay\">\u00b66 3. Did the District Court err in awarding Patsy the cash surrender value of Alvin\u2019s life and annuity policies?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">\u00b67 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding Patsy $119,773.50?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">\u00b68 5. Was the District Court\u2019s granting of a security interest in Alvin\u2019s Bartsch Farms, Inc. shares contrary to the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">\u00b69 Alvin and Patsy were married for 30 years before their marriage ended in a dissolution. Throughout the years, Alvin worked on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>family\u2019s farm, known as Bartsch Farms, Inc., while Patsy worked as a homemaker, caring for their two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b6 10 Before he married Patsy, Alvin acquired 24,502 shares in Bartsch Farms, Inc. by gift from his parents. After he married Patsy, Alvin acquired an additional 83,015 shares by gift from his parents, while Patsy acquired 3,012 shares. The net value of Bartsch Farms, Inc. was $985,643.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b611 At their dissolution bench trial, the District Court received testimony regarding Alvin and Patsy\u2019s marital assets. Ultimately, the District Court, in its findings of fact and conclusions of law, awarded Patsy and Alvin each $335,240.50 in value from their $670,481.00 marital estate. In its findings, the District Court stated specifically that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">9. The fair market asset value of the [Bartsch Farms, Inc.] shares is $3.62 per share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">10. Ms. Bartsch contributed to the operation of the farm and her nonmonetary contributions as a homemaker facilitated the maintenance of the farming operation. As such, the Court finds that it is equitable under the provisions of 40-4-202(1), MCA, to award Ms. Bartsch the value of an equitable share of stock of Bartsch Farms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">17. The Court finds that the following [in pertinent part to this appeal] is an equitable division of the marital estate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">Reliastar life insurance cash value - $4,256.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An9\">Life Investors annuity surrender value - $7,582.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZI\">Life investors life insurance cash value - $6,764.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXj\">State Farm life insurance cash value - $16,411.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9t\">22. The marital estate shall be divided as set out in Finding Number 17 above. Mr. Bartsch shall have the option of paying Ms. Bartsch the $119,773.50 cash settlement in equal monthly installments, with interest at the rate allowed for judgments, over a period of twenty years (240 months), commencing on the first day of the month following entry of this order, and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until the $119,773.50 plus accrued interest is paid in full. Ms. Bartsch shall retain a security interest in the Bartsch Farm stock until the $119,773.50 plus accrued interest is paid in full.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">\u00b612 Alvin now appeals the above-quoted findings of fact and decree from the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding a division of marital assets to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Gerhart, </em>2003 MT 292, \u00b6 15, 318 Mont. 94, \u00b6 15, 78 P.3d 1219, \u00b6 15. Findings are clearly erroneous if: (1) they are not supported by substantial evidence; (2) the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or (3) the district court made a mistake. <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>2002 MT 309, \u00b6 17, 313 Mont. 74, \u00b6 17, 60 P.3d 441, \u00b6 17. We will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property, absent clearly erroneous findings, unless we identify an abuse of discretion. <em>Gerhart, </em>\u00b6 16. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the conclusions are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Pfeifer, </em>1998 MT 228, \u00b6 9, 291 Mont. 23, \u00b6 9, 965 P.2d 895, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b614 1. Did the District Court err in finding that an equitable distribution of marital property required an equal distribution?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b615 Alvin argues that the rule is well settled that equity in a marital distribution case does not necessarily mean equality. Because his shares were gifted to him alone and because Patsy did not substantially increase the value of the farm, Alvin contends that Patsy is not entitled to \u201cone-half of the amount at which the [District] Court valued Alvin\u2019s shares in Bartsch Farms, Inc....\u201d As such, he argues that \u201c[t]he testimony and exhibits introduced at trial provide no substantial basis for an equitable share of the stock, let alon[e] an across-the-board 50/50 division of property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b616 Patsy argues that because \u201cAlvin is obviously in control of the Bartsch Farms Corporation,\u201d \u201c[a]warding him the stock and cash... to compensate her for the value of the stock is the only equitable manner to divide the marital estate.\u201d As such, Patsy contends that the District Court did not abuse its discretionary authority in dividing the marital estate, as it \u201cobviously\u201d considered the factors delineated under \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, regarding equitable apportionment of a marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"A1J\">\u00b617 Section 40-4-202(l)(a)-(b), MCA, states in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">(1) .... In dividing property acquired prior to the marriage; property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent ... the increased value of property acquired prior to marriage... the court shall consider those contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">(b) the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b618 We noted in <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser </em>that the district court erred when it calculated the appreciation in one spouse\u2019s premarital assets and awarded the other spouse two-thirds of that appreciated asset value without considering the other spouse\u2019s contribution to the value appreciation of those assets. <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>\u00b6 54. On that basis, we remanded the case to the district court for a reevaluation and distribution of the parties\u2019 marital assets. <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>\u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b619 Here, the District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">Ms. Bartsch contributed to the operation of the farm and her nonmonetary contributions as a homemaker facilitated the maintenance of the farming operation. As such, the Court finds that it is equitable under the provisions of 40-4-202(1), MCA, to award Ms. Bartsch the value of an equitable share of stock of Bartsch Farms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u00b620 Nowhere in its above finding did the District Court discuss its reasoning behind how Patsy, as a homemaker \u201cfacilitated the maintenance of the farming operation.\u201d Therefore, we reverse the District Court\u2019s findings on this issue. We remand this issue to the District Court for findings on whether and to what extent Patsy actually contributed to the preservation or appreciation of the gifted property under \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, and under our holding in <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser </em>regarding this similar issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u00b621 2. Was the District Court\u2019s finding of fact valuing each share of the Bartsch Farms, Inc. stock at $3.62 based on substantial evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u00b622 Alvin argues: (1) that the District Court had insufficient evidence to arrive at the $3.62 figure for the stock; and (2) that use of a fair market asset value is contrary to law, as \u201c[t]he shares should be valued based upon their \u2018present fair market values.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">\u00b623 Patsy argues that the District Court \u201capplied the appropriate valuation technique,\u201d in finding the value of the Bartsch Farms Corporation stock, especially given that \u201cAlvin admitted that the values indicated for the corporate assets in his Exhibit... were based upon fair market value.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">\u00b624  We have held that there exist \u201cthree essential principles of determining valuation of marital property subject to dissolution.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Pospisil, </em>2000 MT 132, \u00b6 44, 299 Mont. 527, \u00b6 44, 1 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>364, \u00b6 44. These principles include the fact that: \u201c(1) proper valuation is not tied to a specific event, (2) there may be more than one valuation point, depending upon the kind of property involved, and (3) preferably, valuation should occur at the time of distribution, or, stated another way, present fair market values should be used.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Krause </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 368, 379, 654 P.2d 963, 968. In addition, we noted that \u201cthese principles are tempered by the rule that a district court has broad discretion in property distribution.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Pospisil, </em>\u00b6 44. Indeed, we have said that \u201c[t]he time for proper valuation cannot be tied to any single event in the dissolution process,\u201d as \u201cthere can be several valuation points rather than one single point for all of the property.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Krause, </em>200 Mont. at 378, 654 P.2d at 968. Further, \u201c[a]s long as the valuation of property in a dissolution is reasonable in light of the evidence submitted ... [this Court] will not disturb the finding on appeal.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Hanni, </em>2000 MT 59, \u00b6 22, 299 Mont. 20, \u00b6 22, 997 P.2d 760, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b625 Here, regarding the value assigned to the shares of stock, Alvin testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">Q: Now how did you arrive at the figure of $3.00 value per share of stock in Bartsch Farms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">A: When it [Bartsch Farms] was incorporated it started as dollar because of inflation was reflected on that paper you had there, the next year it went to $2, then it was increased to $3 to keep up with inflation, so it was a fair value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Q: Was this a calculation that was'made each year to determine the fair market value of the stock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u00b626 On cross-examination, Alvin provided the following additional testimony regarding the stock value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">Q: So you got a book value for your shares, that\u2019s what the $3 a share was. That\u2019s what you carried on the books?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">Q: If you were to actually value it as of fair market value of the assets owned by the corporation you determined it would be $3.62 a share?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">A: Possibly. When we purchased the shares from my nephew and nieces, we paid less than $3. We paid $2.65 a share for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">Q: When was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\">A: The year that Patsy got hers. It was \u201894, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-16\">Q: This exhibit [Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 5 showing number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>shares, book values, and asset values for Alvin and Patsy] is based upon current fair market value; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">Q: You prepared this Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 5?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">A: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACqx\">\u00b627 [2] As the above-quoted language shows, based on Alvin\u2019s testimony, the District Court, in its broad discretion, accepted Alvin\u2019s testimony that the value of the shares was based on the current fair market value, finding the same-i.e., \u201c[t]he fair market asset value of the shares is $3.62 per share.\u201d Under our holdings in <em>In re Marriage of Krause </em>and <em>In re Marriage of Hanni, </em>such valuation is both preferable and reasonable. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in valuing the Bartsch Farms, Inc. shares of stock at $3.62 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">\u00b628 3. Did the District Court err in awarding Patsy the cash surrender value of Alvin\u2019s life and annuity policies?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b629 Alvin argues that because the life and annuity policies are contracts based upon Alvin\u2019s life expectancy, he has no cash or surrender value available to him currently to give to Patsy. In addition, Alvin argues that the insurance and annuity companies are not parties to this lawsuit. Hence, the District Court did not have jurisdiction over them to make findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the value of their policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u00b630 Patsy argues that Alvin\u2019s contention that there is \u201cno cash value or surrender value available to him\u201d regarding the life and annuity policies is \u201ccontrary to Alvin\u2019s own testimony ... and the exhibits he submitted\u201d concerning those values. As such, Patsy argues that the District Court acted within its discretionary authority in awarding to Patsy the cash and surrender value of the policies. In addition, Patsy contends that Alvin\u2019s jurisdictional argument \u201cis without merit,\u201d as a district court does not need jurisdiction over an insurance or annuity company to enter an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u00b631 Again, under \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, \u201c[i]n a proceeding for dissolution of a marriage ... the court ... shall ... finally equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title thereto is in the name of the husband or wife or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\u00b632 Here, the District Court awarded Patsy the following cash and surrender values:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">Reliastar life insurance cash value - $4,256.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF0\">Life Investors annuity surrender value - $7,582.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apx\">Life investors life insurance cash value - $6,764.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>State Farm life insurance cash value - $16,411.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAq\">\u00b633 Alvin identified the Exhibits from which the above-quoted Reliastar and Life Investors values came as the \u201ccurrent, or as close to current, cash values of investments.\u201d These \u201cinvestments\u201d were in Alvin\u2019s name, and were admitted into evidence without objection from Alvin. The District Court found that the State Farm life insurance was a marital asset, valued as quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">\u00b634  We hold that the District Court did not err in awarding Patsy the cash and surrender values of these life and annuity policies, as evidence existed upon which to support the values awarded to Patsy and the District Court has broad discretion for such awards under \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b635 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding Patsy $119,773.50?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b636 Alvin argues that \u201c[i]t is obvious ... that Alvin does not have $119,773.50.\u201d As such, Alvin contends that \u201cMontana law and the Constitution do not allow a party to be ordered to pay such a large amount of money which he does not have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b637 Patsy argues that \u201c[t]he District Court in the present case had substantial evidence to support its finding that Patsy \u2018contributed to the operation of the farm and her nonmonetary contributions as a homemaker facilitated the maintenance of the farming operation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANq\">\u00b638  We reverse the District Court\u2019s findings offact and conclusions of law regarding its distribution of the marital estate. We remand this case to the District Court for specific findings regarding whether Patsy contributed to the preservation or the appreciation of the gifted property, and if so, specifically how she contributed. Hence, because we reverse and remand this case to the District Court, we decline to address Alvin\u2019s issue regarding the monetary award, as Patsy may or may not be entitled to such an award depending upon the outcome of this case on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b639 5. Was the District Court\u2019s granting of a security interest in Alvin\u2019s Bartsch Farms, Inc. shares contrary to the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b640 Alvin argues that the District Court had no authority to grant to Patsy a security interest in Alvin\u2019s stock, as there is no provision in the Montana Code regarding distributions of a marital estate which order such a grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u00b641 Patsy argues that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting Patsy a security interest in Alvin\u2019s stock, namely because of a district court\u2019s \u201cequitable power to grant a security interest or equitable lien to prevent an inequitable result.\u201d Not to grant a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>court the authority to enforce its judgment for an equitable division of a marital estate, Patsy contends, is to render meaningless \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, which actually gives a district court broad discretion in equitably dividing a marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b642 We reverse the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding its distribution of the marital estate. We remand this case to the District Court for specific findings regarding whether Patsy contributed to the preservation or the appreciation of the gifted property, and if so, specifically how she contributed. Hence, because we reverse and remand this case to the District Court, we decline to address Alvin\u2019s issue regarding the security interest, as Patsy may or may not be entitled to such a security interest depending upon the outcome of this case on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b643 In conclusion, we affirm the District Court regarding its valuation of the Bartsch Farms, Inc. stock at $3.62 per share and the cash value and surrender value awards to Patsy. We reverse the District Court regarding its award of fifty percent of the marital assets. We remand for further proceedings to determine whether and to what extent Patsy contributed to the preservation or appreciation of the gifted property. Because we remand this case to the District Court for such findings, we do not address the issues of whether the District Court erred in awarding Patsy $119,773.50 or whether the District Court\u2019s grant of a security interest to Patsy was contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b644 Affirmed in part; Reversed in part; and Remanded in part for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b58-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
