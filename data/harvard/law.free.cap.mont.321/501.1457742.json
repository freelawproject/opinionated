He appealed to this Court which affirmed his conviction. <em>State v. Kallowat, </em>2000 MT 354N. Kallowat then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court, District of Montana. That court advised him that he had not exhausted all of his available state court remedies and ordered him to do so before refiling in federal court. Obeying that order, Kallowat filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Montana Supreme Court which ordered his petition re-filed in the District Court as a petition for post-conviction relief. The District Court denied the motion for post-conviction relief. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">\u00b62 Kallowat raises four issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">\u00b63 1. Whether his conviction was obtained by use of evidence gained pursuant to an unconstitutional search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">\u00b64 2. Whether his arrest was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">\u00b65 3. Whether he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel did not prosecute an appeal on his behalf in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">\u00b66 4. Whether his conviction was unconstitutional because the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">\u00b67 Denial of a petition for post-conviction relief is reviewed to determine whether the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Hanson, </em>1999 MT 226, \u00b6 9, 296 Mont. 82, \u00b6 9, 988 P.2d 299, \u00b6 9. Review of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is de novo. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>v. Turner, </em>2000 MT 270, \u00b6 47, 302 Mont. 69, \u00b6 47, 12 P.3d 934, \u00b6 47. \u00b68 In his first direct appeal to this Court, the issue decided was whether the person who arrested Kallowat had probable cause to do so. Subsequent to arresting Kallowat, the arresting officer was found to have had a felony conviction prior to being hired as a police officer, thus making his legal employment status questionable. The District Court found, and this Court affirmed, that though the officer\u2019s legal status as a peace officer was questionable, he had probable cause, as a private citizen, to arrest Kallowat.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b69  In his motion for post-conviction relief Kallowat filled eighteen of twenty-four pages with allegations relating to whether the arresting officer was qualified to be an officer thereby making the search of his vehicle unconstitutional; whether there was an immediate need to arrest if the officer was in fact acting in his capacity as private citizen; and whether existing circumstances justified his arrest. In his brief to this Court Kallowat reiterates these arguments. The arguments presented by Kallowat are completely subsumed within the issue addressed by this Court in his first appeal, therefore, the doctrine of res judicata, codified at \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, bars any further consideration of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b610  Kallowat\u2019s second argument is that his appointed counsel ineffectively represented him in failing to 1) represent him in his post-conviction proceedings, and 2) follow his instruction to file an appeal in the federal courts. In the first instance, two separate attorneys were appointed consecutively to represent Kallowat in his post-conviction proceedings. The first, Chad Wright of the Montana Appellate Defender\u2019s Office, moved to withdraw because of an excessively large caseload. The second, Carolyn Gill, moved to withdraw citing no discernable basis that would entitle Kallowat to relief. The court granted both motions to withdraw and then granted Kallowat\u2019s motion to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Review of the record shows no error in these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b611 With respect to appealing to the federal courts, Kallowat does not specify who it is he claims failed to appeal on his behalf. However, even if he had named the allegedly offending lawyer, appointed counsel in criminal cases are only required to represent the accused until such time as a final judgment has been rendered, including any direct appeal to the Montana Supreme Court. Section 46-8-103(1), MCA. Kallowat\u2019s appointed trial counsel represented him through his first appeal and was not obligated to represent him further.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u00b612  Kallowat\u2019s final argument in the District Court consisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>solely of the following statement: \u201cPetitioner complains in his fourth ground that his conviction was obtained by the unconstitutional failure of the prosecution to disclose to him evidence favorable to him.\u201d The District Court dismissed this portion of the petition for failure to meet the pleading requirements of \u00a7 46-21-104, MCA, which requires petitioner to identify all facts supporting the allegation in addition to attaching any affidavits, records, or other evidence that support those facts. In his brief to this Court, Kallowat expands the allegation stating that the State did not inform him prior to his trial that the officer had a prior criminal record, and that had he known \u201cthis fact would have been submitted to the jury ... and had the jury been aware of [the officer\u2019s] prior criminal record, in all probability, this case would have had a different verdict.\u201d This highly speculative conclusion does not address the pleading deficiencies pointed out by the District Court and is not supported by the record. Further, we do not address issues raised for the first time on appeal because it is unfair to fault the trial court on an issue it was never given opportunity to consider. <em>In re Marriage of Killpack, </em>2004 MT 55, \u00b6 10, 320 Mont. 186, \u00b6 10, 87 P.3d 393, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b613 The order denying Kallowat\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
