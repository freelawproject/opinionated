Did the District Court err in denying Stone\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search and seizure?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-19\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in imposing on Stone a sentence of five years on his felony animal cruelty charges when Stone was not classified as a felony persistent offender?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b65 Stone lived with his wife Mary Parenti in Clancy, Montana, where he ran an animal zoo, called Stone Cave Reptile/Amphibian Ranch Hatchery and Hospital. At this animal zoo, Stone was responsible for several animals, including rabbits, dogs, cats, and guinea pigs.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b66 Stone kept most of his animals in cages on his property. Because his property was surrounded by a fence, a closed latched gate, and several \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, the cages could not be seen from the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b67 To assist him in feeding the animals and in cleaning their cages, Stone hired two neighborhood boys. With their parents\u2019 consent, the boys worked on Stone\u2019s property after school tending to the animals. The boys ceased working when Stone told them that he could no longer afford to pay them. However, Stone assured them that he would rehire them as soon as he had the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u00b68 Some time later, Stone again asked the boys to assist him with the animals after school. On their first day back in assisting Stone-November 13, 2001-one of the boys went after school onto Stone\u2019s property to begin his work. While on the property, the boy discovered a number of dead and dying animals. The animals did not have the appropriate food and water. The rabbits in some of the cages that were still alive were feeding off of the dead rabbits that were contained within the same cages.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">\u00b69 The boy immediately ran home and called his father. His father left work and rushed home. When he got home he asked his son to tell him again what he saw. The boy did so, after which time, the father called the sheriffs office and relayed the story. Deputy Gleich was dispatched and arrived at Stone\u2019s residence around six o\u2019clock in the evening. Deputy Gleich approached Stone\u2019s residence and found no one home. However, once on Stone\u2019s property, Deputy Gleich and two other officers saw some of the rabbit cages and some of the rabbits that were feeding on the dead rabbits in the same cage. They also found dog and cat kennels behind the garage, and none of the dogs or cats in the kennels had food or water.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u00b610 After seeing the animals, Deputy Gleich and the other officers became concerned for the animals\u2019 well being, as Deputy Gleich testified that it appeared to him \u201cthat the animals were starving to death.\u201d Deputy Gleich immediately called dispatch and ordered them to contact a veterinarian. He also requested that the boy return, as he knew where all of the cages were located. Deputy Gleich and the other officers began cutting the locks to the cages, and all people at the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>began feeding and providing water to the rabbits, dogs, and cats found on Stone\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b611 The boy informed the officers that he knew that Stone had animals in the house. At that point, Deputy Gleich was also informed that Stone was on probation, so Deputy Gleich called Stone\u2019s probation officer in order to get his permission to enter the house. Stone\u2019s probation officer arrived, was apprised of the situation, and consented to the entry of Stone\u2019s house. The boy and the veterinarian\u2019s assistant crawled through a window that the officers opened, so as to minimize any damage to the house. The boy and the assistant then opened the door to the house, after which time the remaining individuals entered and assisted the animals contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b6 12 Stone was charged with one misdemeanor count of animal cruelty; one misdemeanor count of child endangerment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and four felony counts of animal cruelty. He moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of his property as an unreasonable search and seizure. The District Court denied his motion. Stone was ultimately convicted and sentenced to five years on each felony count of animal cruelty with his sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u00b613 Stone now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and the sentencing of him to five years on each felony count.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 11, 315 Mont. 59, \u00b6 11, 67 P.3d 295, \u00b6 11. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">\u00b615 1. Did the District Court err in denying Stone\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search and seizure?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">\u00b616 Stone argues that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy: (1) in the cages around his house, as they were in close proximity to his house; and (2) in the entire fenced area around his house, as he took much effort to protect his privacy by posting several \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>signs. In addition, Stone argues that the exigent circumstances exception does not apply to his situation here because: (1) Deputy Gleich did not act as a reasonable person would have acted under the same circumstances because he could have waited to obtain a search warrant; and (2) this case does not involve a threat to the lives of officers or other persons, nor does it involve a situation where relevant evidence may be destroyed or a suspect may escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b617 The State of Montana (the State) argues that Deputy Gleich\u2019s entry onto Stone\u2019s property and into Stone\u2019s house was justified, as exigent circumstances existed. These exigent circumstances, the State argues, included the fact that prompt entry was necessary so as not to frustrate legitimate law enforcement efforts regarding prevention of continuing animal cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"ARIy\">\u00b618  Under Montana law, a warrantless search is <em>per se </em>unreasonable. <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 307 Mont. 139, \u00b6 36, 36 P.3d 900, \u00b6 36. However, there exists an exception to the warrant requirement if both exigent circumstances and probable cause justify a warrantless search. <em>State v. Saxton, </em>2003 MT 105, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 315, \u00b6 26, 68 P.3d 721, \u00b6 26. Exigent circumstances exist if the situation at hand would cause a reasonable person to believe that prompt action is necessary to prevent physical harm to an officer or other person, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of a suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating law enforcement efforts. <em>State v. Wakeford, </em>1998 MT 16, \u00b6 24, 287 Mont. 220, \u00b6 24, 953 P.2d 1065, \u00b6 24. Probable cause exists \u201cif the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge, or imparted to the officer by a reliable source, are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that the suspect has committed an offense.\u201d <em>Saxton, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b619 Stone concedes that Deputy Gleich had probable cause to enter onto his property. Therefore, with probable cause established, we will only address whether exigent circumstances existed upon which to justify Deputy Gleich\u2019s warrantless search of Stone\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u00b620 Montana has never before addressed whether the exigent circumstances exception applies to situations of threats to animal life. However, several other states have addressed the issue, including the District of Columbia, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u00b621 The defendant in <em>Tuck v. United States </em>(1984), 477 A.2d 1115, moved to suppress the evidence seized during a warrantless search of his business. <em>Tuck, </em>477 A.2d at 1117-18. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals applied the exigent circumstances exception in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>situations of threats to animal life in justifying the warrantless search. <em>Tuck, 477 </em>A.2d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Tuck, </em>a humane society cruelty investigator and two officers visited the defendant\u2019s pet store in response to a citizen\u2019s complaint. While at the pet store, the officers noticed a puppy and a rabbit that appeared to be suffering from the direct sunlight to which they were exposed in the closed unventilated display window of the defendant\u2019s store. The temperature outside that day was 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Although reluctant, the defendant removed the puppy from the window, after which time the puppy \u201cperked up and became playful.\u201d One of the officers then removed the rabbit from the window chamber which the officer testified to being \u201cas hot as a furnace.\u201d The rabbit was immediately rushed to an animal clinic, where a veterinarian diagnosed it as suffering from heat stroke. The defendant was then charged with one count of cruelty to animals. <em>Tuck, 477 </em>A.2d at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">\u00b623 The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ultimately held that exigent circumstances existed to justify the officers\u2019 warrantless search. In addressing the defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments regarding unreasonable searches and seizures, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">[ajlthough the exigency in the present case involved the protection of animal life rather than human life, we believe that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the preservation of life in general and in the prevention of cruelty to animals in particular \u201crequire[s] some flexibility in the application of the general rule that a valid warrant is a prerequisite for a search.\u201d <em>Tuck, 477 </em>A.2d at 1120 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b624 In <em>State v. Bauer </em>(1985), 379 N.W.2d 895, in response to a call regarding a dead horse, a state humane officer and an equine specialist arrived on the defendants\u2019 property. According to the specialist, the horse had died of starvation. With their suspicions heightened, the humane officer and the specialist observed the barn area that contained other horses, wherein they found the horses standing in solid horse manure without any bedding or food. On this observation, the humane officer seized the horses. The defendants argued that this seizure was in violation of their constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Bauer, </em>379 N.W.2d at 896-97.</p>\n<p id=\"AmR\">\u00b625 In addressing the reasonableness of the humane officer\u2019s search, the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin noted that a compelling need to assist the horses was present. Specifically, the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Such a compelling need was demonstrated in this case. This need was to stop the ongoing suffering of the animals. The exigent standard test applies to situations involving mistreatment of animals. Cruelty to animals is a statutory offense. It is therefore state policy to render aid to relatively vulnerable and helpless animals when faced with people willing or even anxious to mistreat them. <em>Bauer, </em>379 N.W.2d at 899.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Based on this compelling need, the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin held that the humane officer\u2019s search of the defendants\u2019 property was justified. <em>Bauer, </em>379 N.W.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b626 Relying on <em>Tuck </em>and <em>Bauer, </em>the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>People v. Thornton </em>(1997), 676 N.E.2d 1024, also applied the exigent circumstances exception in a situation involving a threat to animal life by targeting the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b627 In <em>Thornton, </em>the police responded to a report that a dog had been barking for several days inside an apartment. The manager had tried unsuccessfully to contact the defendant and to look inside the apartment through the window. After these failed attempts, the manager used her key to enter the defendant\u2019s apartment. In a bedroom, the manager found a dog in a cage that \u201cwas so small that the dog could not stand inside the cage.\u201d In addition, \u201c[t]he bottom of the cage was covered with urine and feces; [tjhere was no sign of food or water in the cage; [tjhe dog was very thin and had blood on its paws; [and] [t]he dog was shaking and continuously made a whimpering and yelping sound.\u201d Based on the manager\u2019s report, the police entered the defendant\u2019s apartment to check on the dog. The police found the dog in conditions matching those described by the manager. <em>Thornton, </em>676 N.E.2d at 1026-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b628 The Illinois Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he guiding principle in fourth amendment search and seizure cases is reasonableness.\u201d Hence, the officers \u201ccould have reasonably believed that the dog was not merely \u2018uncomfortable,\u2019 but was in need of immediate assistance to avoid serious injury or, possibly, death,\u201d based on the information provided to them. <em>Thornton, </em>676 N.E.2d at 1028-29. It was on this \u201creasonableness\u201d basis that the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>Thornton </em>held that the emergency exception applied to the officers\u2019 warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s house. <em>Thornton, </em>676 N.E.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u00b629 Further, the Court of Appeals of Texas, in <em>Pine v. State </em>(1994), 889 S.W.2d 625, <em>cert. denied, Pine v. Texas </em>(1995), 516 U.S. 914, 116 S.Ct. 300, 133 L.Ed.2d 206, affirmed, based on the exigent circumstances exception, the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>evidence seized during a warrantless search of his property. <em>Pine, </em>889 S.W.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b630 In <em>Pine, </em>an officer entered upon the defendant\u2019s property to investigate a complaint of cruelty to animals. The defendant was out of town during this occasion. While on the property, the officer observed several animals, \u201call of which appeared unhealthy, with bones and ribs showing.\u201d This officer then observed a colt that was \u201cwet and muddy and could not stand.\u201d The colt had no energy and its ribs were visible. After examining the colt, the officer contacted a veterinarian and the colt was ultimately transported to another ranch where it could be treated. <em>Pine, </em>889 S.W.2d at 628-29. The defendant argued that prior to removing the colt from his property, the officer was required to obtain a search warrant. <em>Pine, </em>889 S.W.2d at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"Acqa\">\u00b631 However, the Court of Appeals of Texas held that ample evidence existed regarding the colt\u2019s need for immediate care. As such, the officer was justified in seizing the colt without a warrant, as the officer\u2019s belief that an emergency existed was objectively reasonable. <em>Pine, </em>889 S.W.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b632 As to the case at bar, because of the sanctity of the home under both federal and State search and seizure law, we address the searches of Stone\u2019s property and his house separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Stone\u2019s Property</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b633 Here, Deputy Gleich arrived at Stone\u2019s house in response to a phone call of animal cruelty. With the knowledge that a neighborhood boy who had previously worked for Stone had seen dead and dying rabbits on Stone\u2019s property, Deputy Gleich entered upon Stone\u2019s property, at which time he saw the dead and dying rabbits exactly as the boy had described. He and the other officers also saw several dog and cat kennels that did not have any food or water in them. At that point, much like the officers in <em>Tuck, Bauer, Thornton, </em>and <em>Pine, </em>Deputy Gleich became concerned for the welfare of the animals, as he believed that the animals were \u201cstarving to death.\u201d And, from this concern, again like the officers in <em>Tuck, Bauer, Thornton, </em>and <em>Pine, </em>Deputy Gleich and the other officers began searching for and assisting all of the animals that they found on Stone\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u00b634 The statute at issue in <em>Tuck </em>stated, in pertinent part, that \u201c[wjhoever... unnecessarily fails to provide the same [any animal] with proper food, drink, shelter or protection from the weather, shall for every such offense be punished....\u201d D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 22-801 (1981). Wisconsin\u2019s statute, in <em>Bauer, </em>addressed the same concerns in stating that \u201c[n]o person owning or responsible for confining or impounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>any animal may fail to supply the animal with a sufficient supply of food and water....\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 948.13 (1985) (now Wis. Stat. \u00a7 951.13 (2003)). Illinois\u2019 statute, in <em>Thornton, </em>stated that \u201c[n]o person or owner may beat, cruelly treat, torment, starve, overwork or otherwise abuse any animal.\u201d 510 Ill. Comp. Stat. 70/3.01 (West 1994). And, Texas\u2019 statute, in <em>Pine, </em>stated that a person commits the offense of cruelty to animals if the person \u201cintentionally or knowingly... fails unreasonably to provide necessary food, care, or shelter for an animal in the person\u2019s custody....\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. 42.11(a)(2) (Vernon 1989) (now Tex. Penal Code Ann. 42.09(a)(2) (Vernon 2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b635 As it read when Stone committed his offense, Montana\u2019s statute regarding animal cruelty stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">(1) A person commits the offense of cruelty to animals if without justification the person knowingly or negligently subjects an animal to mistreatment or neglect by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">(b) carrying or confining any animal in a cruel manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">(c) failing to provide an animal in the person\u2019s custody with:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">(i) proper food, drink, or shelter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">(ii) in cases of immediate, obvious, serious illness or injury, licensed veterinary or other appropriate medical care. \u00a7 45-8-211(l)(b), (c)(i)-(ii), MCA (2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">\u00b636 As evidenced by the various states\u2019 statutory language quoted above, the District of Columbia, Wisconsin, Illinois, Texas, and Montana have all enacted laws evidencing a strong public policy of preventing mistreatment and cruelty to animals. Or, in the words of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, the requirement: \u201cto render aid to relatively vulnerable and helpless animals when faced with people willing or even anxious to mistreat them.\u201d <em>Bauer, </em>379 N.W.2d at 899. Montana\u2019s public policy is the same and is exemplified through the legislative history of \u00a7 45-8-211, MCA, and the legislature\u2019s adoption of increasingly strong protections for animals against the cruelty and mistreatment of those who would abuse them.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">\u00b637 Specifically, Montana enacted its cruelty to animals statute in 1973. Since 1973, Montana has revisited its statute, addressing concerns of: (1) limiting a defendant\u2019s custody of animals after the defendant has been twice convicted of cruelty to animals; and (2) the sport of animal fighting. Indeed, as a direct result of the highly publicized \u201ccollie cases\u201d in Toole County in late 2002, the 2003 Legislature amended \u00a7 45-8-211, MCA, making the crime of cruelty to animals even more stringent.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">\u00b638 Moreover, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the courts in <em>Tuck, Bauer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>Thornton, </em>and <em>Pine </em>all had previously established jurisprudence articulating applicable exigent circumstances exceptions to the warrant requirement. For most of these courts, the issue of whether animal cruelty created a situation of exigent circumstances was an issue of first impression. <em>See Tuck, </em>477 A.2d at 1120; <em>Thornton, </em>676 N.E.2d at 1028; <em>Pine, </em>889 S.W.2d at 631. And, as here, each of the courts in <em>Tuck, Bauer, Thornton, </em>and <em>Pine </em>was presented with evidence of an imminent threat to animal life and with evidence that officers were placed in situations where they needed to take immediate action.</p>\n<p id=\"AOV\">\u00b639  We conclude that Deputy Gleich\u2019s warrantless search was justified given the unrefuted imminent threat to the lives and well-being of the animals on Stone\u2019s property. We agree that, under the circumstances here, the prevention of needless suffering and death of the animals on Stone\u2019s property created exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search for and rescue of the animals. Consequently, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Stone\u2019s motion to suppress, as Deputy Gleich\u2019s warrantless entry onto and search of Stone\u2019s property was justified given the unrefuted probable cause and exigent circumstances present.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Stone\u2019s House</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b640 We have routinely stated that physical invasion of one\u2019s house is the \u201cchief evil\u201d to which the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution are directed. <em>State v. Therriault, </em>2000 MT 286, \u00b6 53, 302 Mont. 189, \u00b6 53, 14 P.3d 444, \u00b6 53. We have also emphasized that entrance into one\u2019s house is where the federal and Montana constitutions draw a \u201cfirm line\u201d regarding entrance without a warrant absent an exception. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6 53 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u00b641 However, we have also noted that a \u201cprobationer has a reduced privacy interest,\u201d as a \u201cprobationer is aware that his activities will be scrutinized.\u201d <em>State v. Burke </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 165, 171, 766 P.2d 254, 257. A probation officer \u201cmust be able to supervise the probationer, and upon his judgment and expertise, search the probationer\u2019s residence or cause it to be searched.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 171, 766 P.2d at 257. A probation officer\u2019s discretion to search is not without limitations, however. The officer cannot search a probationer\u2019s house without first having reasonable cause. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"AGH\">\u00b642  Although the courts in <em>Tuck, Bauer, Thornton, </em>and <em>Pine </em>justified the searches at issue in those cases on exigent circumstances, we need not reach that argument here as to Stone\u2019s house. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>learning that Stone was on probation-a fact which Deputy Gleich later remembered that he already knew-Deputy Gleich contacted Stone\u2019s probation officer. When Stone\u2019s probation officer arrived, he was apprised of the situation. Having reasonable cause to believe that Stone was violating his probation by committing criminal offenses of cruelty to animals inside the house, Stone\u2019s probation officer gave Deputy Gleich permission to enter Stone\u2019s house. On that basis, the warrantless entry into Stone\u2019s house was a justifiable probation search. We hold that the District Court did not err in denying Stone\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from the search of his house.</p>\n<p id=\"A7VG\">\u00b643 2. Did the District Court err in imposing on Stone a sentence of five years on his felony animal cruelty charges when Stone was not classified as a felony persistent offender?</p>\n<p id=\"AcI\">\u00b644 Stone argues that because he was not convicted under the persistent felony offender statute, the statutory maximum sentence he should have received was two years on each count of animal cruelty to run concurrently. In addition, Stone argues that although he did not object to his sentence at the District Court level, the sentence he received exceeds the statutory mandates. And, as such, under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 16, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 16, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 16, Stone argues that this Court should review the sentence imposed although no objection was made at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b645 The State \u201cagrees and concedes\u201d that Stone\u2019s sentence of five years on each count of animal cruelty to run concurrently is illegal, as the statutory maximum sentence for animal cruelty is two years on each count. Further, the State agrees that this Court\u2019s narrow exception regarding its review of sentences that exceed the statutory mandates, as articulated in <em>Brister </em>and established <em>in State v. Lenihan </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997, applies to Stone\u2019s situation here. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b646 Section 45-8-2 ll(2)(a), MCA (2001), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">A person convicted of a second or subsequent offense of cruelty to animals shall be fined not to exceed $1,000 or be imprisoned in the state prison <em>for a term not to exceed 2 years, </em>or both. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b647 Here, Stone was convicted of one misdemeanor count of animal cruelty and of four felony counts of animal cruelty. Stone was sentenced to the Department of Corrections \u201cfor a term of five (5) years, for each count, to run concurrent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AR6\">\u00b648  We hold that, in sentencing Stone, the District Court exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the statutory parameters of \u00a7 45-8-211(2)(a), MCA (2001), when sentencing him to five years on each count of animal cruelty, as evidenced by the above-quoted statutory language. Therefore, we reverse the District Court\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the District Court for resentencing in accordance with \u00a7 45-8-2 ll(2)(a), MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b649 In conclusion, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Stone\u2019s motion to suppress based on the exigent circumstances regarding the present threat to the animals\u2019 lives on Stone\u2019s property and on the basis of the probation search of Stone\u2019s house. We reverse the District Court\u2019s sentencing of Stone to five years on each count of animal cruelty to run concurrently, as the sentencing exceeds the statutory mandates of \u00a7 45-8-211(2)(a), MCA (2001). We remand this case to the District Court for resentencing in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b650 Affirmed in part; Reversed in part; and Remanded in part for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b522-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-12\"> This charge is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
