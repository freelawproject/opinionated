Lanegan filed a Motion to Suppress all evidence seized from his person or vehicle when arrested. On May 22, 2003, the District Court granted the Motion. It is from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Motion to Suppress Evidence that the State appeals. We Affirm. The only issue on appeal is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">\u00b62 Did the District Court err when it concluded that exigent circumstances did not permit the opening of Defendant\u2019s fanny pack immediately following his arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">\u00b63 In the early hours of December 28, 2002, Deputy Shane Hight, Lincoln County Sheriffs Department, patrolled past the Town Pump gas station in Libby on routine patrol. He observed a man standing next to a white Toyota C\u00e9lica, appearing to kick the tires. Surmising that the vehicle may have been disabled, he radioed dispatch to check the license of the vehicle. The check uncovered that the plates were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>actually registered to a red Chevy Nova, and the registered owner of the Nova was known by Deputy Hight to be involved in illegal drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b64 Deputy Hight pulled into the Town Pump parking lot to investigate the license plate discrepancy as the two occupants of the vehicle walked towards the building. Upon asking the two to return to the vehicle, Deputy Hight established that the parties were Patricia Eaker (Eaker) and Albert Lanegan. Deputy Hight commenced questioning Eaker while Lanegan leaned against the car on the other side. Within two minutes of Deputy Hight making initial contact, Officer Josh Harth, Libby City Police Department, arrived on the scene in a separate patrol car and engaged Lanegan in conversation while Deputy Hight interviewed Eaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b65 Upon Deputy Hight\u2019s explanation of the stop, Eaker told him that she had borrowed the car two days earlier and knew nothing of the license plate discrepancy. Due to her nervous appearance, overly emotional state and difficulty standing still, Deputy Hight concluded that she might be under the influence of drugs. Additionally, during Deputy Hight\u2019s questioning of Eaker, Lanegan became agitated and continually injected himself into the discussion both loudly and profanely. In response to Deputy Hight\u2019s inquiry as to if she possessed any weapons, Eaker said no and refused to consent to a purse search after Lanegan shouted advice not to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b66 Upon conclusion of Eaker\u2019s investigation, Deputy Hight approached Lanegan and as he did, he noticed a bulge in Lanegan\u2019s right coat pocket. Deputy Hight testified that he asked Lanegan if he had any weapons, and that Lanegan responded that he did have a gun, although he did not indicate where the gun was located. Lanegan testified that in response to Deputy Hight\u2019s question, he stated that he did not have a weapon but there was one underneath the passenger seat in the car. Lanegan stepped back, and Deputy Hight grabbed Lanegan, informing him that he was not under arrest, however, Hight wanted to pat him down for weapons. Lanegan did not cooperate, struggled and shoved his hands into his pockets, then told Deputy Hight that he refused to submit to a pat down. Concerned for his safety at that point, Deputy Hight handcuffed Lanegan and arrested him for obstructing a peace officer. Deputy Hight then retrieved the item in Lanegan\u2019s right pocket that was making the bulge-a black fanny pack about the size that would accommodate a medium sized pare of binoculars.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u00b67 After Deputy Hight handcuffed Lanegan, he proceeded to unzip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the retrieved black fanny pack and observed a hypodermic needle filled with a clear liquid, a white powdery substance, and other items that appeared to be drug related. He did not find a pistol in the fanny pack and this could have been ascertained by squeezing the pliable fanny pack, however, according to Deputy Hight\u2019s testimony, it is not good policy to squeeze a container that might contain a hypodermic needle as was ultimately the case in this instance. Deputy Hight testified that these events happened within seconds, and Lanegan told him that his gun was under the passenger seat in the car either right before or right after he opened the fanny pack. He further testified that once he handcuffed Lanegan, he no longer felt immediately threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b68 While Deputy Hight questioned Lanegan, Eaker took her purse and entered into the Town Pump building. She later emerged holding a cell phone and ran over to Deputy Hight\u2019s patrol car dumping the contents of her purse on the hood. Officer Harth testified that he retrieved the gun from under the passenger seat after Lanegan was already in the back of the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b69 On February 26, 2003, Lanegan filed a Motion to Suppress the evidence seized from his person or vehicle by Deputy Hight. After a hearing held on May 21, 2003, the District Court granted Lanegan\u2019s Motion. It is from this Order that the State appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b610  The standard of review for a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 476, \u00b6 11, 977 P.2d 974, \u00b6 11. A trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves us with the firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Roberts, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b611 Whether the factual circumstances determined by a district court constitute exigent circumstances is a conclusion of law reviewed for correctness. <em>State v. Saxton, </em>2003 MT 105, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 315, \u00b6 19, 68 P.3d 721, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err when it concluded that exigent circumstances did not permit the opening of Defendant\u2019s fanny pack immediately following his arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">\u00b613 The District Court concluded that Deputy Hight was justified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>performing an investigative stop of Lanegan. When Lanegan refused to cooperate, Deputy Hight was justified in placing him under arrest. The District Court found that once Lanegan was arrested, the stop and frisk procedure authorized under \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, no longer applied. Furthermore, \u00a7 46-5-102, MCA, permitted Deputy Hight to search Lanegan incident to his arrest within certain limitations, none of which the District Court found applicable to the instant set of circumstances. Finally, the District Court found that the exigent circumstances exception to the search warrant requirement did not apply because the necessary element of immediacy was not present when Lanegan had already been subdued and handcuffed by the time Deputy Hight possessed the fanny pack. Therefore, the District Court found if there was probable cause to believe the fanny pack contained evidence of a crime, there was sufficient time to secure a search warrant. Consequently, the District Court granted Lanegan\u2019s Motion to Suppress. We agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b614 The State argues that the District Court erred when it concluded that exigent circumstances did not permit opening the fanny pack. Central to this argument is the theory that the court neglected to consider the totality of the circumstances in reference to officer safety. For instance, the State asserts that the following factors contributed to exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search: (1) Eaker\u2019s unpredictable behavior; (2) Eaker\u2019s use of a telephone, possibly to call for help; (3) the fact that both Lanegan and Eaker were thought to be on methamphetamines, thus a danger to the officers\u2019 safety; (4) the early morning hour contributing to the natural isolation of the officers; and (5) the escalation of the situation changing from a traffic stop to one involving a gun and methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b615 While conceding that federal case law does not permit free-ranging searches incident to arrest, the State cites numerous federal cases to support its claim that law enforcement has the right to search an item incident to arrest even if such item is no longer accessible to the defendant at the time of the search. Moreover, recognizing that the Montana Constitution provides a heightened protection of a citizen\u2019s privacy rights, see <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, \u00b6 40, 307 Mont. 139, \u00b6 40, 36 P.3d 900, \u00b6 40, the State maintains that their position under the totality of these specific circumstances is supported by state case law. Yet, the State goes on to draw our attention to other state and federal opinions, not Montana case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b616 The United States and Montana Constitutions protect persons from unreasonable search and seizure. <em>Saxton, </em>\u00b6 25. Under Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Law, warrantless searches are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, with few exceptions to that rule. <em>See State v. Galpin, </em>2003 MT 324, \u00b6 54, 318 Mont. 318, \u00b6 54, 80 P.3d 1207, \u00b6 54. One such exception to the warrant requirement is where an officer concludes that there are exigent circumstances and probable cause justifies a warrantless search. <em>Saxton, </em>\u00b6 26. We have said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">Exigent circumstances are those that would cause a reasonable person to believe prompt action is necessary to prevent physical harm to police officers or other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of the suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law enforcement efforts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><em>State v. Logan, </em>2002 MT 206, \u00b6 17, 311 Mont. 239, \u00b6 17, 53 P.3d 1285, \u00b6 17. In assessing exigent circumstances, we have said that the court must consider the totality of such circumstances. <em>State v. McCarthy </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 51, 57, 852 P.2d 111, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b617  Based on the facts of this case, we agree with the District Court that there were no exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search of Lanegan\u2019s fanny pack. The State bears the heavy burden of showing the existence of exigent circumstances. <em>State v. Wakeford, </em>1998 MT 16, \u00b6 24, 287 Mont. 220, \u00b6 24, 953 P.2d 1065, \u00b6 24. We conclude that it did not meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b6 18  Deputy Hight arrested Lanegan for obstructing a peace officer. Section 46-5-102, MCA, permits warrantless searches of the area within the arrestee\u2019s presence for the following purposes: (1) to protect the officer from attack; (2) to prevent the arrestee from escaping; (3) to discover and seize fruits of the crime; or (4) to discover and seize any people or items which may have been used in committing-constitute evidence of-a crime. The search of Lanegan\u2019s fanny pack would not have protected the arresting officers from Lanegan due to the fact that he was already handcuffed. Lanegan could not have escaped because he was already under the Deputy\u2019s control. The search conducted would not have resulted in discovery of fruits of the crime of obstructing a peace officer, nor would it have resulted in discovery of anything that may have been used in the commission of the offense of obstructing a peace officer. Consequently, the District Court correctly granted Lanegan\u2019s request to suppress evidence harvested as a result of this warrantless search of his fanny pack.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u00b619  We therefore conclude, from the facts and circumstances present at the time of Lanegan\u2019s arrest, that Deputy Hight\u2019s search of Lanegan\u2019s fanny pack did not rise to the level of exigent circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>as allowed pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-102, MCA. Accordingly, the District Court did not err when it granted Lanegan\u2019s Motion to Suppress evidence obtained as a result of the search.</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b377-5\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AMl\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b620 I respectfully dissent. The District Court\u2019s order granting the motion to suppress failed to consider important evidence relevant to the search conducted here, and, consequently, the court entered conclusions of law which were incorrect. If properly considered by this Court, the evidence would require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b621 First, as a preliminary matter, Respondent Lanegan failed to file a brief. \u201c[W]here a respondent does not appear by brief or argument on appeal, this Court will take appellant\u2019s versions and positions as being correct if they are supported by the record. <em>Alden v. Board of Zoning Comm\u2019rs </em>(1974), 165 Mont. 364, 365, 528 P.2d 1320, 1320.\u201d <em>City of Kalispell v. Cameron, </em>2002 MT 78, \u00b6 15, 309 Mont. 248, \u00b6 15, 46 P.3d 46, \u00b6 15 (Nelson, J., concurring). Here, the State\u2019s positions are well supported by the record and should be taken as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u00b622 The District Court concluded that there were no exigent circumstances to justify unzipping the fanny pack because Lanegan was then \u201csubdued,\u201d and thus, \u201c[t]he necessary element of immediacy [was] not present.\u201d This Court concurs with these conclusions. <em>See </em>\u00b6 13. However, the Court errs, as the District Court did, by narrowly focusing on Lanegan\u2019s handcuffed condition and ignoring the more significant evidence of other exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u00b623 Lanegan, who was \u201cvery verbally abusive\u201d and acting \u201cnervous, flighty, paranoid,\u201d refused to be frisked, told officers he had a gun, and reached for the bulge in his pocket when Hight attempted to frisk him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqg\">[Hight] A. He put his right hand in the same pocket to where the bulge was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">[Prosecutor] Q. How long did all this take?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">A. Seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">Q. Okay. What went through your mind when he put his hand into that right pocket, where you saw where the bulge was, after he told you he had a gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-13\">A. I thought he was going for a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-14\">Q. What did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-15\">A. I grabbed onto him and told him that he\u2019s not under arrest. And he pulled away from me. I told him I was just going to pat him down. He pulled away from me. I grabbed both of his arms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>pulled his hand out of the pocket, and I cuffed him up and arrested him for obstructing at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Q. Did you feel threatened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">A. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b624 <em>Immediately </em>after handcuffing Lanegan, Hight opened the pack \u201cbecause I thought there may be a gun in it.\u201d He testified that there was \u201cprobably a hundred different models\u201d of firearms that would have fit within the fanny pack. Further, Hight expressed a concern about other items in the pack which could \u201cpoke me, stick me, or stab me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJpT\">\u00b625 Then, Eaker, who had \u201cdisappeared\u201d when Hight had turned his attention to Lanegan, and who, according to Hight, \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand still\u201d and was \u201cvery nervous,\u201d came running out of the Town Pump and toward the vehicles. She begun dumping the contents of her purse unto the hood of the patrol vehicle. Obviously, this situation was anything but \u201csubdued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\u00b626 Although Lanegan was handcuffed, and Hight felt no fear of Lanegan\u2019s possible use of a weapon at that point, Hight nonetheless retained legitimate fears about the contents of the pack, given what had occurred. Lanegan had reached for the pack as Hight attempted to frisk him, and very well could have been reaching for a gun, which he claimed to have, or for another kind of weapon. Further, with Eaker running about and dumping items on the patrol car, the situation remained fluid. Under these circumstances, police should be able to open the pack to determine if there was something-such as a loaded firearm- that could harm them or the other people present. Indeed, exigent circumstances \u201care those that would cause a reasonable person to believe prompt action is necessary to prevent physical harm to police officers or other persons ... or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law enforcement efforts.\u201d <em>State v. Logan, </em>2002 MT 206, \u00b6 17, 311 Mont. 239, \u00b6 17, 53 P.3d 1285, \u00b6 17. Regrettably, however, the Court would require the police to \u201cgingerly\u201d hold the potentially dangerous pack until a warrant is obtained, while simultaneously handling another party who was out of control. That is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00b627 The officers acted correctly in the entire incident. They refrained from searching Eaker\u2019s purse when she refused to consent. In contrast, they searched Lanegan\u2019s pack because it presented a legitimate danger. The District Court failed to consider all the circumstances and entered incorrect conclusions of law. I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
