We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Ruiz\u2019s motion for directed verdicts on both charges at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">\u00b63 In June of 2001, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) began investigating Ruiz based on information it received that he was acting as an outfitter without a license. During the investigation, FWP game wardens Randolph Arnold (Arnold) and Michael Martin (Martin) went undercover in an attempt to obtain outfitting services from Ruiz. Arnold posed as a Montana resident who worked as a consultant. Martin posed as one of Arnold\u2019s clients who resided in Iowa, but liked to hunt and fish in Montana. Between June and December of 2001, the two FWP wardens contacted Ruiz on various occasions to plan a waterfowl hunting trip. The hunting trip eventually took place on December 11, 2001, when Ruiz met the wardens at a motel in Missoula, Montana, escorted them to Flathead Lake, and provided equipment and advice for their hunting. In turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Arnold paid Ruiz $275.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b64 At the end of the December of 2001 waterfowl hunting trip, Ruiz and the wardens discussed the possibility of big game hunting the following fall. Martin informed Ruiz that he would like to obtain a Montana resident hunting license, but would not be able to establish residency in Montana in time for hunting season. Ruiz informed Martin that he could use Ruiz\u2019s home address in Stevensville, Montana, to obtain a Montana driver\u2019s license and also that Ruiz knew someone who would sell him a resident conservation and fishing license without a Montana driver\u2019s license. Once Martin obtained the resident conservation and fishing license, as well as a Montana driver\u2019s license, he could purchase a resident big game hunting license.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b65 In May of 2002, Ruiz and the FWP wardens met for dinner in Missoula, during which they discussed the arrangements for purchasing a Montana resident conservation and fishing license for Martin. Following dinner, the three went to a Missoula sporting goods store where a friend of Ruiz\u2019s worked and Martin purchased a conservation and fishing license by using Ruiz\u2019s Stevensville address. Later that evening, Ruiz provided Martin with a fake rental agreement stating Martin was living at Ruiz\u2019s Stevensville address, which Martin could use to obtain a Montana driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b66 Based on the activities outlined above, the FWP issued two tickets to Ruiz charging him with outfitting without a license and assisting an unqualified applicant to obtain a resident license. Ruiz was convicted of both offenses following a trial in the Missoula County Justice Court, and he appealed to the District Court. The District Court held a jury trial in June of 2003. After the State of Montana (State) presented its case-in-chief, Ruiz moved the District Court for directed verdicts on both counts, asserting the State had failed to establish the requisite elements of the offenses. The court denied the motion and the jury found Ruiz guilty of both offenses. The District Court sentenced Ruiz and entered judgment on the convictions and sentences. Ruiz appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a directed verdict to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Maloney, </em>2003 MT 288, \u00b6 13, 318 Mont. 66, \u00b6 13, 78 P.3d 1214, \u00b6 13. In doing so, we determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Maloney, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b68 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Ruiz\u2019s motion for directed verdicts on both charges?</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b69 At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Ruiz moved the District Court for directed verdicts on both charges against him, arguing that the State had failed to prove the elements of the offenses. The court denied the motion and Ruiz asserts the court abused its discretion in doing so. We address each charge in turn,</p>\n<p id=\"Afiv\">a. Outfitting without a license</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b610 Ruiz contends that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a directed verdict on this count because the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any of his alleged outfitting activities occurred in Missoula County. Essentially, Ruiz argues that Missoula County was not the proper venue in which to bring this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b611  Generally, a criminal charge must be brought in the county where the offense was committed. Section 46-3-110(1), MCA. However, where an act requisite to the commission of an offense occurs or continues in more than one county, or where two or more acts requisite to the commission of the offense are committed, the charge may be filed in any county in which any of the acts occurred. Sections 46-3-112(1) and -112(2), MCA. Additionally, while venue is not an element of a charged offense, it is a jurisdictional fact which must be established by the prosecution at trial beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Galpin, </em>2003 MT 324, \u00b6 23, 318 Mont. 318, \u00b6 23, 80 P.3d 1207, \u00b6 23 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b612 Ruiz was charged with violating \u00a7 37-47-301, MCA, based on his activities in taking Arnold and Martin on a waterfowl hunting trip in December of 2001. That statute provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">[a] person may not act as an outfitter, guide, or professional guide or advertise or otherwise represent to the public that the person is an outfitter, guide, or professional guide without first securing a license ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Section 37-47-301(1), MCA. An \u201coutfitter\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">any person, except a person providing services on real property that the person owns for the primary pursuit of bona fide agricultural interests, who for consideration provides any saddle or pack animal; facilities; camping equipment; vehicle, watercraft, or other conveyance; or personal service for any person to hunt, trap, capture, take, kill, or pursue any game, including fish, and who accompanies that person, either part or all of the way, on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>expedition for any of these purposes or supervises a licensed guide or professional guide in accompanying that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Section 37-47-101(11), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b613  Arnold testified at trial that, on the morning of the waterfowl hunting trip, Ruiz met the two wardens at a motel in Missoula and escorted them-albeit in separate vehicles-through Missoula County on their way to Flathead Lake. Thus, Ruiz\u2019s acts of providing services and accompanying the wardens on their hunting expedition occurred, in part, within Missoula County. Consequently, pursuant to \u00a7 46-3-112, MCA, it was appropriate for the State to bring the outfitting without a license charge in Missoula County. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ruiz\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the outfitting without a license charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">b. Assisting an unqualified applicant to obtain a resident license</p>\n<p id=\"Axd1\">\u00b614 The State also charged Ruiz with purposely or knowingly assisting an unqualified applicant in obtaining a resident license, in violation of \u00a7 87-2-106(8), MCA (2001), based on his actions in helping Martin-whom Ruiz believed to be a resident of Iowa, rather than Montana-obtain a resident conservation and fishing license. Ruiz moved the District Court for a directed verdict on this count, arguing that the State did not prove the elements of the offense because Martin was a Montana resident. The District Court denied the motion and Ruiz asserts error.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b615 A person applying for a resident license is required to present identification establishing that the person is a resident of Montana. Section 87-2-106(1), MCA (2001). It is a misdemeanor offense for a person who does not meet the statutory residency criteria-in other words, a person who is an unqualified applicant-to make a false statement in order to obtain a resident license. Section 87-2-106(7)(a), MCA (2001). Ruiz was charged with violating \u00a7 87-2-106(8), MCA (2001), which provides that \u201c[i]t is unlawful and a misdemeanor for a person to purposely or knowingly assist an unqualified applicant in obtaining a resident license in violation of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u00b616 It is undisputed that Martin was a Montana resident at the time he applied for a Montana resident conservation and fishing license and, consequently, was qualified to obtain such a license. Therefore, notwithstanding Martin\u2019s undercover persona as an Iowa resident, Ruiz did not assist an unqualified applicant to obtain a resident license because Martin actually was a Montana resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u00b617 The State contends that, in proving Ruiz violated the statute, it is sufficient that Ruiz believed he was assisting a nonresident in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>obtaining a Montana resident license, regardless of whether Martin was a resident or not. As stated above, however, \u00a7 87-2-106(8), MCA (2001), provides that it is unlawful to \u201cassist an unqualified applicant ...\u201d to obtain a resident license. To interpret the statute in the manner urged by the State would require us to insert language into \u00a7 87-2-106(8), MCA (2001), stating it is unlawful to assist an applicant one believes to be unqualified to obtain a resident license. We may not do so. In interpreting statutes, our role is \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b618  In order to prove a violation of \u00a7 87-2-106(8), MCA (2001), the State must prove that the applicant for the license was unqualified. As a result, the State was required to prove that Martin was not a resident of Montana. The State failed to do so. Consequently, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Ruiz\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the charge that he assisted an unqualified applicant to obtain a resident license.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b619 Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for the entry of an amended judgment dismissing the assisting an unqualified applicant to obtain a resident license conviction and deleting the related sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b384-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AG2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b620 I dissent on the question of whether the State proved venue in Missoula County for the offense of outfitting without a license. The hunting trip in question took place on December 11, 2001, when Ruiz met the wardens at a motel in Missoula, Montana, escorted them to Flathead Lake and provided equipment and advice for their hunting venture outside of Missoula County. Venue is proper in any county in which any of the acts requisite to the commission of the offense occurred. Section 46-3-112(1) and (2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\u00b621 As the Court notes, an \u201coutfitter\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">[A]ny person, except a person providing services on real property that the person owns for the primary pursuit of bona fide agricultural interests, who for consideration provides any saddle or pack animal; facilities; camping equipment; vehicle, watercraft, or other conveyance; or personal service for any person to hunt, trap, capture, take, kill, or pursue any game, including fish, and who accompanies that person, either part or all of the way, on an expedition for any of these purposes or supervises a licensed guide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>or professional guide in accompanying that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Section 37-47-101(11), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b622 Although the actual hunting did not commence until the parties were in the Flathead Lake area, the Court concludes that the fact that Ruiz met the wardens at a Missoula motel and escorted them, in a separate vehicle, to Flathead Lake, constituted the \u201cproviding of personal services\u201d and \u201caccompanying\u201d for purposes of outfitting without a license. In my view, this analysis stretches venue principles beyond credibility. As far as \u201caccompanying\u201d goes, Ruiz was not even in the same vehicle with the wardens. In the context of the criminal offense at issue, \u201caccompany\u201d means to be with a person while that person is engaged in hunting or taking any game, not merely traveling on the same highway to a common destination. As to the \u201cproviding of personal service,\u201d Arnold (an actual Montana resident, posing as a Montana consultant) hardly needed \u201cescorting\u201d to get from Missoula to Flathead Lake. The occurrences in Missoula County were preparatory at best; they were not acts requisite to the commission of the offense of outfitting without a license, which only occurred in the Flathead Lake area-outside of Missoula County. Section 46-3-112(1) and (2), MCA. Outfitting is defined as providing a personal service \u201cfor consideration.\u201d Obviously, Ruiz would not have demanded or received \u201cconsideration\u201d from Arnold and Martin for meeting them at the motel and accompanying them to Flathead Lake. The personal service-i.e the \u201coutfitting\u201d-did not occur until they reached Flathead Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b623 The State failed to prove venue in Missoula County, and, thus, the District Court abused its discretion in denying Ruiz\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the outfitting without a license charge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
