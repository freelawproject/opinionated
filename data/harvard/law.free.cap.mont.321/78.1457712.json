Hall filed motions to suppress evidence and to dismiss the felony charge of driving under the influence of alcohol. The District Court denied both motions. After a bench trial, Hall was convicted of the charges. He now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">\u00b62 On appeal, Hall raises two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">1. Whether the police officer had a particularized suspicion to justify the stop; and</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>2. Whether Hall\u2019s three previous convictions in the state of Washington for driving while under the influence were appropriately used to form the basis of his Montana felony charge of driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, fourth offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b63 Bob and Debra Walker made a stop at the Lone Pine Station on the south side of Hamilton, which resulted in Mrs. Walker calling in a report of a drunk driver. While Mr. Walker waited in their truck, Mrs. Walker went inside for a cappuccino. While she was waiting in line, she noticed a man come staggering through the door who she immediately thought was drunk. The man tripped through the door and almost fell down, but caught himself. The man was disheveled, his hat was askew, his shirt was untucked and his eyes were bloodshot. When Mrs. Walker returned to the truck, the couple conferred, agreeing that the man was drunk. Mr. Walker indicated that after the man parked his truck across the painted parking lines and perpendicular to Mr. Walker\u2019s truck, the man staggered about, reached into his pockets and pulled them out and dropped some money. The man paused for a long time, staring at his hands before staggering into the store, leaving the money he dropped on the ground. The couple agreed that the man was obviously too drunk to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b64 The Walkers watched the man leave the store and get into the driver\u2019s side of his truck. So as not to appear suspicious, the Walkers slowly drove away while Mrs. Walker used her cell phone to call 9-1-1. She identified herself and gave a description of a drunk man driving a black and maroon Ford pickup truck, with a blonde female passenger and a dog in the back-end wearing an orange vest, and gave the truck\u2019s license plate number. Because they were driving away, Mrs. Walker could not say which direction the man was traveling, so the dispatcher called the Lone Pine Station. The clerk confirmed that a drunk man had just been in there, but because it was so busy, he could not give the direction of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b65 Meanwhile, Hamilton Police Officer Hochalter was parked in the parking lot of Al\u2019s Car Care on the 93 strip in Hamilton when he received the dispatcher\u2019s report at 9:16 p.m., relaying the information supplied by Mrs. Walker. Within two minutes, a black and maroon Ford truck driven by a man with a blonde female passenger and a dog in the back-end wearing an orange vest drove by in the lane closest to Officer Hochalter. He followed the truck for four to five blocks, watching for signs of erratic driving. But the truck drove at the 25 mile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>per hour speed limit and appropriately signaled to change lanes. When the truck pulled in to the Gas N\u2019 Grub and Hall got out of the driver\u2019s side, Officer Hochalter pulled in right behind the truck, just turning on his emergency flashers to let Hall know they needed to talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b66 Hochalter\u2019s investigation quickly revealed that Hall smelled of alcohol. Hall admitted to having drunk between six to eight beers. Hochalter then administered field sobriety tests which indicated that Hall was intoxicated. After refusing to take a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT), Hochalter arrested Hall for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2004 MT 13, \u00b6 5, 319 Mont. 250, \u00b6 5, 84 P.3d 25, \u00b6 5. Our review of statutory interpretation is plenary, and our standard of review is whether the tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, \u00b6 5, 310 Mont. 396, \u00b6 5, 50 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>1. Did the police officer have a particularized suspicion to justify the stop?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV5\">\u00b68  Hall claims that Officer Hochalter lacked sufficient reliable objective data to form a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing, and that his stop was therefore illegal. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect persons against unreasonable searches and seizures. Whenever a police officer restrains a person\u2019s freedom, such as in a brief investigatory stop of a vehicle, the officer has seized that person. <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 46, 49, 899 P.2d 540, 542. However, Montana recognizes that an investigatory stop is reasonable when an officer has a particularized suspicion that the person has committed or is committing an offense. <em>State v. Lacasella, </em>2002 MT 326, \u00b6 19, 313 Mont. 185, \u00b6 19, 60 P.2d 975, \u00b6 19; codified at \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. To evaluate whether a police officer has a particularized suspicion to make an investigatory stop, the State has the burden to show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">(1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-10\"><em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 22, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 22, 67 P.3d 207, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u00b6 22. The existence of a particularized suspicion is determined by the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>1998 MT 233, \u00b6 12, 291 Mont. 77, \u00b6 12, 966 P.2d 137, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b69 In <em>State v. Pratt </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 156, 951 P.2d 37, we adopted a three factor test to evaluate the totality of the circumstances when an investigative stop is made pursuant to a tip. <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 16, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 16, 14 P.3d 456. The first factor is whether the informant remains anonymous or subjects herself to civil and criminal liability. The second factor is whether the report is based on personal observations. The third factor is whether the officer\u2019s own observations corroborate the informant\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b610 According to Hall, Officer Hochalter lacked sufficiently reliable objective data to form a particularized suspicion according to the <em>Pratt </em>test. Officer Hochalter testified that he did not know from the dispatcher whether the tip was anonymous or if it was from an identified citizen. Further, the dispatcher did not relay the personal observations of the caller to Officer Hochalter. Lastly, Officer Hochalter admitted that Hall\u2019s driving was not erratic. Thus, according to Hall, the totality of the circumstances fail to support a particularized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b611 However, we rejected this same argument in <em>Pratt, </em>concluding that an officer in the field does not have to personally assess the reliability of the tip given to dispatch. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 167, 951 P.2d at 44. In <em>Pratt, </em>we looked to the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Hensley </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 221, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (an officer unaware of the factual basis for the reasonable suspicion may make an investigative stop in reliance on a report or bulletin from another law enforcement agency so long as the reporting person possessed the requisite suspicion); and <em>Whitley v. Warden </em>(1971), 401 U.S. 560, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (an officer who is unaware of the factual basis for probable cause may make an arrest upon the directive of another officer with probable cause). We also quoted the Ninth Circuit case of <em>United States v. Robinson </em>(9th Cir. 1976), 536 F.2d 1298, \u201ceffective law enforcement cannot be conducted unless police can act on directions and information transmitted by one officer to another and that officers, who must often act swiftly, cannot be expected to cross-examine their fellow officers about the foundation for the transmitted information.\u201d 536 F.2d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b612 Other courts, in considering a motion to suppress based on a citizen\u2019s tip, reject the narrow rule advanced by Hall, that only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>information known to the investigating officer is to be considered. Instead, courts find it appropriate to consider the knowledge of the officer or dispatcher who relayed the tip or other information. The Ninth Circuit, under the totality of the circumstances, looks to the information relayed to the officer in the field and the information known to the dispatcher. <em>United States v. Fernandez-Castillo </em>(9th Cir. 2003), 324 F.3d 1114, 1118 (highway patrol officer had a reasonable suspicion under the totality of the circumstances when a Montana Department of Transportation employee reported erratic driving which was relayed to a highway patrol officer, who then encountered the vehicle and corroborated erratic driving). Massachusetts recently determined there was a reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop premised on the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge and what he relayed to the dispatcher. <em>Commonwealth v. Riggieri </em>(Mass. 2003), 782 N.E.2d 497, 500 (an off-duty reserve officer followed an erratic driver and gave updates via his cell-phone to the arresting officer who did not witness evidence of wrongdoing). In <em>Feathers v. Aey </em>(6th Cir. 2003), 319 F.3d 843, the Sixth Circuit determined that it was appropriate to impute to the arresting officer the dispatcher\u2019s knowledge that the tipster remained anonymous, and therefore, there was an insufficient indicia of reliability to give rise to a reasonable suspicion. Similarly, the Tenth Circuit employs the \u201cfellow officer\u201d rule, which considers the pool of information known to all the officers involved in the stop or arrest in order to determine the existence of a reasonable suspicion under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Hinojos </em>(10th Cir. 1997), 107 F.3d 765, 768 (an anonymous tip was relayed to the investigating officer who independently corroborated the information). \u00b613 Jurisdictions which have limited the scope of inquiry to the knowledge of the arresting or investigating officer also applied the rule from <em>U.S. v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, allowing officers to rely on a report from another officer or dispatch. The resulting combination of the two rules lends to a finding of reasonable suspicion based solely on the officer\u2019s reliance on the report from dispatch, without an inquiry into the basis of knowledge of the dispatcher\u2019s report. <em>See, e.g. City of Maumee v. Weisner </em>(Oh. 1999), 720 N.E.2d 507, 511. Such a situation is ripe for abuse. The Missouri Supreme Court rejected such a rule, stating that, \u201c[t]he requirements of reasonable suspicion and probable cause would be rendered meaningless if police could simply filter a \u2018hunch\u2019 through a radio or cellular phone and have it come out reliable on the other end.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(Mo. 1995), 894 S.W.2d 649, 653 (under the totality of the circumstances the Court considered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>anonymous tip relayed by dispatch as well as the collective information known to the officers involved in the stop, concluding there was no reasonable suspicion). Missouri continues to analyze the knowledge of each of the officers as well as the information told to the dispatcher. <em>State v. Monath </em>(Mo. 2001), 42 S.W.3d 644, 650 (there was a reasonable suspicion when store clerks relayed information of two individuals buying large quantities of pseudoephedrine, which was corroborated by the police investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b614 In Ohio, the appellate courts had a split of authority for situations where an investigative stop was made in sole reliance on a police dispatch. <em>City of Maumee, </em>720 N.E.2d 507. The Ohio Supreme Court resolved the split by requiring the state to demonstrate that the facts which precipitated the dispatch justified a reasonable suspicion, and so rejected the rule which found it was sufficient for the police to merely rely on the dispatch without a showing of the information available to the dispatcher. 720 N.E.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ-\">\u00b615  Based on the foregoing, <em>Pratt </em>was correct in that an officer in the field must be able to rely on reports and dispatches from other officers without having to conduct a cross-examination as to the basis of the report. However, under our three factor analysis of <em>Pratt, </em>when a tip has been relayed from dispatch and an officer has acted on that information, it is appropriate to look beyond the stopping or investigating officer to include the information known to the dispatching or reporting officer. Here, although the dispatcher did not testify, the dispatcher\u2019s transcript and log were entered into evidence. From the record it is apparent that Mrs. Walker called and reported a drunk driver, giving a detailed description of the vehicle. Mrs. Walker stated that the man was, \u201cso drunk, he can\u2019t even hardly walk\u201d and that \u201che just about fell down, he\u2019s so drunk.\u201d The veracity of Mrs. Walker\u2019s report was further supported when the dispatcher called the clerk at the Lone Pine Station, who, when told about the report of a \u201creally drunk guy\u201d responded that, \u201che was just in and went out ...\u201d Thus, there was one named citizen informant who relayed information, and the details of the information support that it was based on personal observations. The indicia of reliability ofMrs. Walker\u2019s report was further bolstered by the affirmative response of the store clerk. These facts lend to a high indicia of reliability in regard to the first two <em>Pratt </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"AUL\">\u00b616  As for the third <em>Pratt </em>factor, Officer Hochalter saw the vehicle only a few minutes after getting the report and it matched the detailed description. Furthermore, Hochalter waited until Hall had pulled into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>a gas station and had gotten out. Neither Hall nor the State address at what point Hochalter\u2019s response became an investigatory stop. In a similar situation in <em>State v. Wagner, </em>2003 MT 120, 315 Mont. 498, 68 P.3d 840, the responding officer found the reported drunk driver had already parked his vehicle and was at a pay phone. There, we concluded that the initial encounter between officers and the defendant was not a stop, because it was at a public venue of the defendant\u2019s own choosing and absent a show of force or authority, the defendant was free to walk away. <em>Wagner, </em>\u00b6 31. Similarly here, Hall himself stopped at the gas station and got out of his vehicle, unaware that Officer Hochalter had pulled in behind him. Hall was unsteady on his feet as he walked around the truck to get gas. When Hall realized that a police car was parked right behind him, he stopped what he was doing and attempted to get into the cab of his truck, at which point, Officer Hochalter grabbed him. Following <em>Wagner, </em>Hall was clearly not free to leave after Hochalter physically grabbed and detained him. For the purposes of the <em>Pratt </em>third factor corroboration, Hochalter\u2019s observations prior to the stop included encountering the described vehicle within a short time of receiving the dispatch, Hall\u2019s eyes were red and watery, he smelled of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet. Furthermore, Hall attempted to leave when he realized a police officer was behind him, implicating <em>Illinois v. Wardlow </em>(2000), 528 U.S. 119, 125, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570, 577 (unprovoked evasive behavior and headlong flight when police officers appear may create a reasonable suspicion). Under the totality of the circumstances, these facts satisfy the factors of the <em>Pratt </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><em>2. Whether Hall\u2019s three previous convictions in the state of Washington for driving while under the influence appropriately used to form the basis of his Montana felony charge of driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, fourth </em>offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b617 Montana law provides that the fourth or subsequent conviction of driving under the influence is a felony. Section 61-8-731, MCA. The previous convictions which may be used in the calculation include violations of Montana\u2019s driving under the influence laws, \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401, &amp; 406, MCA, as well as convictions of similar statutes and regulations of other states. Section 61-8-734, MCA. Hall claims that the state of Washington\u2019s statute is not similar to Montana\u2019s statutes, because the Washington statute requires a lesser degree of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b618 We addressed a similar claim in <em>State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, 310 Mont. 396, 50 P.3d 1080, where we determined that Colorado\u2019s driving while ability impaired (DWAI) statute was insufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>similar to Montana\u2019s statute for the purpose of enhancing a charge to a fourth offense felony DUI. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 22. Although Colorado had a DUI statute, which was similar in nature to Montana\u2019s driving under the influence statutes, there was no statute in Montana comparable to Colorado\u2019s DWAI statute. Colorado\u2019s DWAI standard allowed for a conviction if a person was impaired \u201cto the slightest degree.\u201d The Montana Legislature had considered and rejected using the phrase \u201cto the slightest degree,\u201d and decided to use the standard of \u201cdiminished\u201d in its stead. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 21. We determined that \u201cto the slightest degree\u201d was a lesser degree of culpability than \u201cdiminished,\u201d and therefore, convictions under Colorado\u2019s DWAI statute could not be used in Montana to enhance an offense to a felony fourth violation.</p>\n<p id=\"Admk\">\u00b619 We now consider the issue of whether or not Washington\u2019s drunk driving laws are sufficiently similar so as to enhance Hall\u2019s Montana conviction to a fourth offense. Under Montana law, a person may be convicted for a <em>per se </em>violation of driving under the influence if the person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration is greater than 0.10. Section 61-8-406, MCA (2001) (Hall\u2019s conviction was under the old standard, which the 2003 legislature lowered to 0.08 BAC for a <em>per se </em>violation). Alternatively, a person may be convicted if he operates a vehicle under the influence, meaning that the person\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle had been diminished, which may be supported by certain inferences of the person\u2019s BAC. Section 61-8-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b620 Washington\u2019s statutory scheme also criminalizes driving under the influence, with a generic category, and a <em>per se </em>category. The main difference between Montana and Washington is in the organization of the statutes. Washington only has one offense, rather than two separate offenses as in Montana. However, the Washington statute \u201csets out alternate methods of committing the crime of driving while under the influence.\u201d <em>State v. Franco </em>(Wa. 1982), 639 P.2d 1320, 1323. While each subsection provides alternate methods for committing the same offense, those subsections are analogous to Montana\u2019s two statutes. Both states disallow driving with a BAC in excess of 0.10 (Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 46.61.502(1) &amp; (2), and \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA) and driving under the influence of intoxicating drugs or liquor (Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 46.60.502(3) &amp; (4), and \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b621 Hall claims the Washington standard of culpability is best described by its case of <em>State v. Hansen </em>(Wa. Ct. App. 1976), 546 P.2d 1242, where the Washington Court of Appeals affirmed the use of the following jury instruction: \u201cA person is deemed to be under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor if such person\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>handle a motor vehicle is lessened in any appreciable degree.\u201d 546 P.2d at 1243. Hall places great weight on the use of the phrase \u201cany appreciable degree\u201d and claims it is similar to \u201cin the slightest degree,\u201d which was at issue in <em>McNally. </em>Although <em>Henson </em>interpreted Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 46.61.515, and Hall was convicted of violating Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 46.61.502, which prohibits driving while intoxicated (DWI), the <em>Henson </em>standard of \u201cany appreciable degree\u201d appears to still apply. <em>See, State v. Randhawa </em>(Wa. 1997), 941 P.2d 661, 664. The Washington standard of \u201cany appreciable degree\u201d bears obvious similarities to the Colorado standard of \u201cin the slightest degree,\u201d as was at issue in <em>McNally. </em>However, in <em>McNally, </em>we recognized that Colorado\u2019s DUI statute was similar to Montana\u2019s DUI statutes, but that the culpability of \u201cto the slightest degree\u201d for DWAI (driving while ability impaired) had no comparable counterpart in Montana, because it makes it illegal to drive after consuming any alcohol. Therefore, we concluded that a Colorado conviction for DWAI could not be used to enhance the Montana offense to a fourth or subsequent felony offense. Although Washington established its <em>per se </em>standard after its decision of <em>Hansen </em>in 1976, it is only a <em>per se </em>violation to have a BAC in excess of 0.10 (now 0.08, just as in Montana). Even with a <em>per se </em>standard, the logic of <em>Hansen </em>continues to apply in Washington, that a person may have drunk liquor and yet, not be under the influence of it to the extent that driving is proscribed by law. <em>State v. Franco </em>(Wa. 1982), 639 P.2d 1320, 1324 (citing <em>Hansen, </em>546 P.2d at 1242). Thus, although Washington\u2019s DUI statute has a <em>per se </em>subsection, it is more similar to Montana\u2019s <em>per se </em>statute than it is to Colorado\u2019s DWAI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"ALY\">\u00b622  Hall also claims that it is inappropriate to use his Washington DWI convictions to enhance his Montana DUI conviction because the Washington law combines the <em>per se </em>DWI and regular DWI into one statute. The result, according to Hall, is that Washington does not allow the defendant to establish innocence by way of lack of impairment, in spite of a BAC in excess of the limit, while such a person would be allowed to establish innocence in Montana. Hall is correct, in that a person charged with driving under the influence, \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, who had a BAC over the legal limit might nonetheless be able to establish that his or her ability to safely operate a vehicle had not been diminished, and thus, he or she was not in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. However, Hall\u2019s analysis fails to take into account that such a person would have violated Montana\u2019s <em>per se </em>statute, \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, where a crime would have occurred regardless of the level of impairment. While we do not necessarily know which sub-section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 46.61.502 the defendant violated, whether it was the regular DWI or the <em>per se </em>aspect, <em>see, e.g., Franco, </em>639 P.2d at 1324 (the jury need only be unanimous as to guilt of the overall offense but need not be unanimous as to guilt of a particular subsection), it is nonetheless certain that a person convicted of violating Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 46.61.502 committed an offense for which each sub-section has an analogous statute in Montana. Therefore, the decision of the district court was correct. We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
