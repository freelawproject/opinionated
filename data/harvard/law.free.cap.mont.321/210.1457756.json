The Massees brought a wrongful death action against Sheriff Richard Thompson of Broadwater County (the Sheriff or Thompson) and Broadwater County, as principal. A jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>returned a verdict in favor of the Massees in February 2003, awarding the sons a total of $358,000. On a Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, the First Judicial District Court vacated the jury verdict on the grounds that the Sheriff had no legal duty to protect Vickie from Ray and could not be held liable for failure to do so. The Massees appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b62 The only issue before this Court is whether the District Court erred by granting Thompson\u2019s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b63 The following facts, while lengthy, are critical to the jury\u2019s verdict, the District Court\u2019s Order, and our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b64 Vickie Sue Massee (Vickie) and Ray Doggett (Ray) were married in October 1990. Prior to Vickie\u2019s marriage to Doggett, Vickie had been married to Raymond Massee (Massee). She had three sons during her marriage to Massee, James, Michael and Marcus. For most of the times at issue, the three boys lived with Vickie and Ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b65 Over the course of the Doggetts\u2019 tumultuous marriage, members of the Broadwater County Sheriffs Office (BCSO or Sheriffs Office), and most notably Thompson, became intimately involved in the lives of Ray and Vickie. BCSO\u2019s first involvement with the couple occurred approximately one year after Vickie and Ray got married, when the Sheriffs Office responded to a domestic violence disturbance at the Doggetts\u2019 home. Vickie and Ray had each struck and injured the other. They were sentenced to counseling which they completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u00b66 From the record, it appears that the marriage had frequent ups and downs, with the downs generally occurring after Ray and/or Vickie had been drinking. Ray became unable to work shortly after he and Vickie married and he began suffering from bouts of depression. With his depression came binge drinking, accusations of infidelity, and threats of suicide or murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\u00b67 Just before midnight on October 29,1994, the Broadwater County Undersheriff responded to a call from Vickie. She was at a Townsend bar and asked that an officer come get her, collect her sons, and then drive them all to the county line to be picked up by the children\u2019s grandparents. Vickie indicated that she and Ray were arguing and that she wanted to be away from Ray. Undersheriff Ludwig responded. On the way to the county line, Vickie decided she would let the boys go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>with their grandparents, and she would return home. Undersheriff Ludwig, after confirming there had been no physical violence in the earlier argument, convinced Vickie that she and Ray should spend the night apart while each sobered up. Vickie ultimately conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b68 On Ludwig\u2019s return to Townsend, she was then dispatched to Ray\u2019s house. Ray had called the BCSO threatening suicide if Ludwig did not tell him where Vickie was. When Ludwig arrived at the Doggetts\u2019 home with a reserve deputy, Ray was sitting at a table with a loaded .44 magnum pistol. Ludwig assured him that Vickie was safe, and while the reserve deputy talked with Ray in an effort to calm him, the Undersheriff took Ray\u2019s pistol for safekeeping. The record is unclear as to when the weapon was returned to Ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b69 On December 10, 1994, the BCSO received another domestic dispute call from the Doggetts\u2019 home, and two deputies were dispatched. According to the Sheriffs Office log, Vickie and Ray were intoxicated and engaged in a serious argument. When the two deputies arrived, they could hear the argument escalating. Upon entering the home, they discovered that one of Vickie\u2019s teenage sons was also present. The officers ushered him outside to safety and then returned inside, at which time Ray threatened them with bodily harm. Thompson was then called and advised of the situation. The Sheriff immediately telephoned Ray and began talking to him. At that time, one of the responding officers was called away to another incident. When the remaining officer got on the telephone to talk to Thompson, Ray left the room, ostensibly to go to the bathroom, but moments later emerged from the bedroom with the .44 magnum revolver (the same revolver that had been earlier confiscated). The deputy reported this to the Sheriff who told the deputy to leave the house immediately. The deputy obeyed. Shortly thereafter, the BCSO dispatcher called the Doggett home and Vickie told her that Ray was holding a gun to her head. Within minutes, the officer who had responded to another call returned with a third officer. The three deputies stayed outside and awaited the Sheriffs arrival a few minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b610 Thompson and a deputy entered the home while the other officers remained outside. Ray was agitated, drunk and wielding his .44 magnum handgun. After talking to the Sheriff for a short period of time, Ray put the gun to his own head. The Sheriff and his deputy were able to wrestle the loaded pistol from him. After several minutes of calming discussion, the deputies were told they could leave and the Sheriff remained to counsel Ray. Two deputies left. The third deputy waited in the car parked in a location that allowed him to see inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the Doggetts\u2019 home where Ray and the Sheriff were talking.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b611 At trial, there was substantial testimony presented that one of the responding officers, as recorded in his official report, had seen Ray holding the gun to Vickie\u2019s head. This deputy also indicated in his report that the Sheriff decided not to arrest Ray but did confiscate Ray\u2019s gun. The Sheriff testified that he did not know that Ray had held the gun to Vickie\u2019s head until some later date, and that during the time he was at the Doggett residence, Ray had not done anything that would warrant arrest. The Sheriffs report of this event, however, differs from the Sheriffs testimony. Thompson\u2019s official report dated December 11, 1994, states, \u201cWhile on the way into town, I heard the officers at the scene talking to dispatch and telling her that Ray was pointing the gun at Vickie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b612 After these events, the marriage appeared to stabilize somewhat. However, on October 6, 1996, the BCSO\u2019s log reflects three calls between 4:00 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. from Ray Doggett during which he sounded depressed and requested that the Sheriff come visit him because he needed a friend. Then, again, in the early morning hours of December 18, 1996, Ray called for a deputy. When two deputies arrived, they found Ray alone and drunk. He was complaining, as he had before, that Vickie was being unfaithful. The officers then received an unrelated call, and Ray told them he would be all right and that they could leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b613 About ten days later, Ray asked that the BCSO send a particular deputy to his home. When the deputy arrived, Ray was drunk and claiming that Vickie wanted him dead. Vickie told the officer that Ray was always threatening to kill himself and she was considering leaving the marriage because of the overwhelming stress. Vickie\u2019s son Marcus was also present, and informed the deputy that Ray had a revolver in the back of his pants. The deputy warned Ray that if Ray touched his gun, he would shoot him. The deputy stayed and talked with Ray until he was calm. Vickie and Marcus left the house during this time, upon suggestion of the deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b614 Within a few minutes of the deputy\u2019s departure, Ray called the BCSO to tell them he was going to the local bar. Meanwhile, Vickie and Marcus had arrived at the home of Roger Reiman, a friend of Vickie\u2019s sons. James and Michael were also present. She told them she wanted to spend the night in Helena, but was afraid to return to the house for the overnight items she would need. James and Roger went to get the items for her. When they arrived at the house and walked inside, Ray, who had returned from the bar and whose back was to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>door, turned, pulled his gun and pointed it at them. He lowered it after about 5 seconds. James, who was quite frightened by the experience, retrieved his own .38 pistol while getting his mother\u2019s toiletry items, and hid it under his jacket in case he needed to protect himself while leaving the house. While James was out of the room, Ray pulled his gun on Roger and suggested that they go outside. Just then, however, the BCSO called and Ray answered the phone. While Ray was on the phone with the Sheriffs Office, James and Roger left.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b615 James and Roger immediately went to the BCSO to report what had occurred, but did not sign a formal complaint. Vickie and her sons left Roger\u2019s house, and spent the night with friends in Helena. James gave his gun to Roger before leaving because Roger was afraid Ray would come looking for him when he realized Vickie was not coming home that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b616 Later that night, Roger called the BCSO to report that Ray had called and threatened to kill him and to hunt down Vickie, James and Michael and kill them for taking Marcus away. Shortly thereafter, Roger went to the Sheriffs Office and signed a Voluntary Statement regarding these threats. He did not sign a Complaint because, he later testified, he was afraid that Ray might hurt him. The deputy who took Roger\u2019s statement called and informed the Sheriff. Thompson said he would look into it the following day, but according to his own testimony, he failed to do so. Vickie, her sons, and Roger were never questioned about this incident and no investigation appears to have occurred. The BCSO\u2019s log indicates that when Vickie returned from Helena the following day, she made arrangements for the boys to temporarily stay with their grandparents in White Sulphur Springs.</p>\n<p id=\"AraE\">\u00b617 During the ensuing four months, Ray and Vickie did not seek the services of the BCSO. However, at about 2:00 a.m. on April 20, 1997, then eight-year old Marcus called the BCSO reporting that Ray and Vickie were having an argument and that he and his fourteen-year old brother, Michael, were in their bedroom with their .22 rifle on the bed for protection. According to the Sheriffs Office log, the dispatcher instructed the boys to put the gun away. The Sheriff and a deputy then went to the Doggetts\u2019 residence. According to the deputy\u2019s report, he immediately went to the bedroom with the boys and found the unloaded rifle put away in the closet. He reported that the boys said that the rifle was unloaded at all times during this event.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b618 The boys told the officers that Ray\u2019s gun was in his bedroom. The deputy found Ray\u2019s gun on his bedside table, unloaded it and left the bullets on Ray\u2019s dresser. The deputy did not confiscate Ray5s pistol but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>left it at the residence. Vickie, Michael and Marcus left the residence, followed shortly thereafter by the police officers. Vickie and the boys once again stayed with a friend in Helena.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b619 At trial, Michael testified to a more detailed and slightly different version of the events of that evening. He stated that Ray and Vickie had returned home that night and were arguing. Michael saw Ray holding his .44 magnum pistol, waving it and pointing it at Vickie while arguing. He returned to his bedroom where Marcus was waiting, loaded his .22 rifle, and after listening to the escalating argument for about fifteen minutes, had Marcus call the BCSO. He stated at trial that during the course of the argument, Vickie, scared and crying, had come into their bedroom and shut the door. Ray opened the door and Michael saw that he was still carrying his .44 magnum pistol. However, according to Michael\u2019s testimony and the testimony of the officers involved, no one subsequently investigated the incident; therefore, they did not learn from Michael or Vickie that Ray had threatened Vickie with a loaded pistol that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b620 On May 5, 1997, Ray stopped by the BCSO at 2:00 a.m., in an extremely depressed state. He later called the Sheriffs Office at 3:00 a.m. and again at 3:15 a.m. also quite depressed, triggering serious concerns that he was suicidal. The Sheriffs fears were realized when, less than three weeks later, on May 24, the BCSO responded to the Doggetts\u2019 home and discovered that Ray had shot and killed Vickie with his .44 magnum pistol, and then fatally turned the gun on himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b621 Vickie\u2019s sons sued Sheriff Thompson for negligently failing to take appropriate action to prevent Ray from killing their mother. Between February 24 and February 27,2003, a jury heard substantial evidence pertaining to the above events and the alleged negligence of the Sheriff. The jury concluded that Sheriff Thompson was negligent as defined by the jury instructions, and that his negligence was the cause of Vickie\u2019s death. The jury awarded a total of $358,000 to Vickie\u2019s sons.</p>\n<p id=\"AuL\">\u00b622 On a Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law filed by Thompson, the First Judicial District Court vacated the jury verdict. In its Decision and Order, the court analyzed each of the three domestic abuse statutes underlying the Massees\u2019 claims. These statutes are set forth verbatim below. The court concluded that the \u201cweapon seizure\u201d statute found at \u00a7 46-6-603, MCA (1995), did not impose upon the Sheriff the legal duty to seize Ray\u2019s weapon following the December 1996 and April 1997 episodes. The court further concluded that the provisions of the \u201carrest\u201d statute, found at \u00a7 46-6-311, MCA (1993 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>1995), were discretionary rather than mandatory, and therefore did not impose upon the Sheriff the legal duty to arrest Ray for his assaults on Vickie.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b623 The District Court also determined that no special relationship existed between Vickie and Ray so as to trigger a duty on the Sheriffs part to protect Vickie from Ray. It reasoned that the Sheriff had made no specific promises to protect Vickie from Ray, but rather, had merely responded to calls for assistance. Finally, the court concluded that, while the \u201cnotice\u201d provisions of \u00a7 46-6-602, MCA (1995), imposed a duty on the Sheriff to provide information to Vickie about the availability of legal rights and services to her as a victim of domestic abuse, the statute did \u201cnot create a specific duty ... to protect [her] or guarantee her safety. Moreover, there was no evidence at trial connecting the failure of Thompson to provide such notice with Vickie\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b624 On the basis of the foregoing findings, the District Court concluded that the Sheriff had no \u201clegal duty to protect Vickie Doggett from Ray, and therefore, cannot be held liable to [the Massees] on the causes of action contained in the complaint.\u201d The Massees appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b625 A judgment as a matter of law entered pursuant to Rule 50(b), M.R.Civ.P., may be granted only where it appears as a matter of law that a party could not prevail upon any view of the evidence including the legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom. <em>Somont Oil Co., Inc., v. A &amp; G Drilling, </em>2002 MT 141, \u00b6 38, 310 Mont. 221, \u00b6 38, 49 P.3d 598, \u00b6 38 <em>(citing Ryan v. City of Bozeman </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 507, 510, 928 P.2d 228, 229).</p>\n<p id=\"A7I\">\u00b626  Moreover, \u201c[t]he courts will exercise the greatest self-restraint in interfering with the constitutionally mandated processes of jury decision. Unless there is a complete absence of any credible evidence in support of the verdict, a [judgment as a matter of law] motion is not properly granted.\u201d <em>Ryan, </em>279 Mont. at 510, 928 P.2d at 229-230. \u201cOur review of a jury verdict is very narrow in scope. Substantial evidence need only be evidence which from any point of view could have been accepted by the jury as credible.\u201d <em>Moralli v. Lake County </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 23, 27, 839 P.2d 1287, 1290 (citation omitted). We have also stated that \u201c[s]ubstantial evidence is defined as that evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Although it may be based upon weak and conflicting evidence, in order to rise to the level of substantial evidence it must be greater than trifling or frivolous.\u201d <em>Kitchen Krafters v. Eastside Bank </em>(1990), 242 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Mont. 155, 164, 789 P.2d 567, 572 <em>(overruled on other grounds in Busta v. Columbus Hosp.Corp., </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 916 P.2d 122)(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AhS\">\u00b627  The existence of a legal duty is a matter of law to be determined by the court. <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 299 Mont. 449, \u00b6 18, 999 P.2d 1010, \u00b6 18. This Court\u2019s standard of review of a question of law is whether the legal conclusions of the trial court are correct. <em>MacKay v. State, </em>2003 MT 274, \u00b6 14, 317 Mont. 467, \u00b6 14, 79 P.3d 236, \u00b6 14. Although jury verdicts are treated with deference, the Court also gives deference to a trial court\u2019s post-verdict ruling which is contrary to the jury\u2019s decision. <em>Chambers v. City of Helena, </em>2002 MT 142, \u00b6 44, 310 Mont. 241, \u00b6 44, 49 P.3d 587, \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"AMD\">\u00b628 Lastly, in evaluating a motion for judgment as a matter of law, \u201cthe court must view all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>DeMars v. Carlstrom </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 334, 336, 948 P.2d 246, 248 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b629 We first address a dispute between the parties concerning the scope of the Massees\u2019 appeal. Thompson and Broadwater County argue that, because the Massees did not specifically appeal from the District Court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that violations of the \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cseizure\u201d statutes were negligence <em>per se, </em>they cannot now argue that evidence that these statutes were violated supported the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"A5S\">\u00b630  Negligence <em>per se, </em>or negligence as a matter of law, provides that the violation of a statute renders one negligent under the law. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition. To establish negligence per se, a plaintiff must prove that 1) the defendant violated the particular statute; 2) the statute was enacted to protect a specific class of persons; 3) the plaintiff is a member of that class; 4) the plaintiffs injury is of the sort the statute was enacted to prevent; and 5) the statute was intended to regulate members of defendant\u2019s class. <em>Estate of Schwabe v. Custer\u2019s Inn, </em>2000 MT 325, \u00b6 23, 303 Mont. 15, \u00b6 23, 15 P.3d 903, \u00b6 23. Common law negligence, on the other hand, is the failure to use the degree of care that an ordinarily prudent person would have used under the same circumstance. The four elements of a common law negligence claim are duty, a breach of that duty, causation and damages. Each of these elements must exist for a negligence claim to proceed. <em>See, e.g., Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 20, 319 Mont. 307, \u00b6 20, 84 P.3d 38, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b631 During the trial, the jury was presented with evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Sheriff failed to comply with the following domestic abuse statutes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-\u00a7\u00a7 46-6-602, -603, and -311, MCA (set forth verbatim in \u00b6\u00b6 34-37 below). After all the evidence was presented and prior to jury deliberation, the court instructed the jury on the applicable law. The court informed the jury that 1) \u201cnegligence is the failure to use reasonable care\u201d; 2) \u201cnegligence may consist of action or inaction\u201d; 3) \u201ca sheriff or deputy is negligent if he fails to act as an ordinarily prudent sheriff or deputy would act under the circumstances\u201d; and 4) \u201can act or an omission may be negligent if the actor realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to another through the conduct of a third person which is intended to cause harm, even though such conduct is criminal\u201d [sic].</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b632 The jury was also instructed that it could find the Sheriff negligent <em>per se </em>if it concluded that he failed to provide Vickie with notice of her rights under \u00a7 46-6-602, MCA (1995). The court refused to instruct the jury, however, that it could also find the Sheriff negligent <em>per se </em>for failing to arrest Ray under \u00a7 46-6-311, MCA (1993 and 1995), or for failing to seize Ray\u2019s weapon under \u00a7 46-6-603, MCA (1995). The court concluded that these \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cseizure\u201d statutes gave the Sheriff the discretion to arrest Ray or seize his weapon; therefore, the court concluded, the statutes did not impose mandatory legal duties on the Sheriff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the Massees objected at trial to the court\u2019s refusal to present these negligence <em>per se </em>jury instructions regarding arrest and weapon seizure, they did not specifically appeal the District Court\u2019s Decision on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"AyuV\">\u00b633  We conclude that the Sheriff\u2019s argument that the failure to appeal from the court\u2019s refusal to give negligence <em>per se </em>instructions should limit the scope of Massees\u2019 appeal, is without merit. The jury received the full panoply of instructions on common law negligence. Though the District Court refused to instruct that violation of the \u201cweapon seizure\u201d or \u201carrest\u201d statutes was negligence <em>per se, </em>the Massees were still permitted to-and did-argue that violation of these statutes by the Sheriff was <em>evidence </em>of negligence. We have held that, even if a violation of a statute does not constitute negligence <em>per se, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>such violation may nonetheless be considered as evidence of negligence. <em>Nehring v. LaCounte </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 462, 468, 712 P.2d 1329, 1333. Because the Massees have appealed from the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law, they have preserved their right to argue that the jury had before it sufficient evidence of negligence-including evidence that the subject statutes were violated by the Sheriff-to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b634 As stated above in \u00b6 31, the relevant domestic abuse statutes in this case are \u00a7\u00a7 46-6-602, -603, and -311, MCA. Section 46-6-602, MCA (1993) is the \u201cnotice\u201d statute for victims of domestic assault that was in effect during the 1994 incidents between Vickie and Ray.

Our second charge is to determine whether the jury was presented with any credible evidence that, when viewed in a light most favorable to Vickie\u2019s sons, would support its verdict that the Sheriff was negligent and that his negligence caused Vickie\u2019s death. <em>Ryan, </em>279 Mont. at 510, 928 P.2d at 229-30 and <em>DeMars v. Carlstrom </em>(1997), 285 Mont. at 336, 948 P.2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"A4N\">\u00b641  A negligence cause of action entails four elements-duty, a breach of that duty, causation and damages. <em>Henricksen, \u00b6 </em>20. When considering negligence claims against a public entity or person, such as Sheriff Thompson, it is necessary to consider the \u201cpublic duty doctrine.\u201d The public duty doctrine provides that a governmental entity cannot be held liable for an individual plaintiff s injury resulting from a governmental officer\u2019s breach of a duty owed to the general public rather than to the individual plaintiff. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition. In other words, \u201ca duty owed to all is a duty owed to none.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Driscoll </em>(1999), 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6 21. An exception to the public duty doctrine\u2019s immunity provision arises when a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the victim and officer has been created. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax9P\">\u00b642  As we explained in <em>Nelson, </em>a special relationship gives rise to a special duty, and can be established under any one of the following circumstances: 1) by a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member from a particular type of harm; 2) when a government agent undertakes specific action to protect a person or property; 3) by governmental actions that reasonably induce detrimental reliance by a member of the public; and 4) under certain circumstances, when the agency has actual custody of the plaintiff or of a third person who causes harm to the plaintiff. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22. We now turn to the question of whether such a special duty existed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b643 The Massees maintain that the Sheriff had a special duty to Vickie by virtue of a special relationship that arose under the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>circumstance listed in <em>Nelson. </em>They contend that the domestic abuse statutes were written specifically to protect domestic violence victims, a class of which Vickie was a member. Indeed, these statutes were enacted to prevent domestic abuse from escalating to a point of serious injury or death-Vickie\u2019s exact fate. Significantly, Thompson agreed that Vickie was a member of the protected class of domestic violence victims. Moreover, during the trial, the District Court expressly concluded, \u201cthat Vickie falls within that statutorily protected class of victims of domestic violence, that ... title 46, chapter six, part six, domestic violence provisions. She is clearly a member of that class. And so [Sheriff Thompson] would have a duty to her under that.\u201d Therefore, there was no question at trial-from either the parties or the court-that the Sheriff had a special duty to Vickie as a member of the protected class of domestic abuse victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b644 Because it was undisputed at trial that Thompson had a special relationship with Vickie by virtue of her being within a statutorily-protected class, an exception to the public duty doctrine exists. Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to address the Massees\u2019 request on appeal that we abrogate the public duty doctrine. Moreover, because it was undisputed that a special relationship was created between the Sheriff and Vickie under the domestic abuse statutes, we need not determine whether a special relationship was also created under the second circumstance listed in <em>Nelson, </em>as argued by the Massees.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac2\">\u00b645  With the undisputed existence of a duty running from the Sheriff to Vickie by virtue of her status as a domestic abuse victim, we must now determine whether credible evidence was presented to the jury to support its finding that the Sheriff breached that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b646 We first address the Massees\u2019 claim that, at all times relevant to the case before us, the Sheriff had a statutory duty to provide Vickie with a notice of her rights under \u00a7 46-6-602, MCA. Such notice, as indicated above, informs victims of their rights to have an abuser arrested, to obtain orders of protection, and to remove an abuser from the home. It also provides a victim with information about community organizations and agencies specifically designed and created to offer assistance to domestic abuse victims.</p>\n<p id=\"A9z\">\u00b647  The Sheriff testified that under the 1993 version of \u00a7 46-6-602, MCA, he was required to give Vickie notice only if he arrested Ray, and that because he did not arrest Ray, failure to give notice was not a violation. This testimony, however, was undermined by the Sheriffs further testimony (described in greater detail in \u00b6 49 below) that during the December 1994 incident, he had substantial grounds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>arrest Ray and, inexplicably, chose not to do so. He admitted that the preferred response under the law would have been arrest, at which time his obligation to give Vickie her notice rights would have become mandatory. The Sheriff also agreed that the 1995 version of the statute made it mandatory that he give notice <em>whenever </em>responding to a domestic abuse call, or a call which he suspected was a domestic abuse call. Moreover, the Sheriff repeatedly testified that despite having the notice forms available to him and having given them to numerous other Broadwater County abuse victims, he did not give Vickie notice of her victim\u2019s rights at any time between 1994 and 1997. There was, therefore, substantial evidence from which the jury could conclude that, by failing to comply with the 1995 mandatory notice statute, the Sheriff was negligent, and arguably, negligent <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b648 We now examine the Massees\u2019 argument that the Sheriff breached his duty to arrest Ray and to seize Ray\u2019s .44 magnum handgun on more than one occasion, and that such breach of duty caused Vickie\u2019s death. We note that the jury was correctly instructed that the Sheriffs negligence was a cause of Vickie\u2019s death if \u201cit was a substantial factor in bringing it about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b649 Throughout the trial, the Massees presented substantial evidence describing Ray wielding his pistol and making threats to kill himself and others. Specifically, in December 1994, a deputy of the BCSO stated in his report that he observed Ray holding a pistol to Vickie\u2019s head. The Sheriffs report indicated that he heard, while en route to the Doggetts\u2019 home, that Ray was holding a gun on Vickie. One of the deputies who responded to the call testified that Ray threatened him with bodily harm if the deputy did not leave Ray\u2019s house. The Sheriff and various deputies testified that when the Sheriff arrived at the Doggetts\u2019 house, within minutes, the Sheriff had to wrestle the loaded gun away from Ray to keep Ray from shooting himself. The Sheriff also testified that he had substantial grounds to arrest Ray for holding a gun to Vickie\u2019s head and threatening a police officer and could likely have gotten a conviction. He further testified that it was, in part, his decision to not arrest Ray but he could not explain why that decision had been made. The Sheriff confiscated Ray\u2019s gun for a short period of time after this incident, but returned it later.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b650 Again, the Massees testified that in December 1996, Ray had pulled a gun on Vickie\u2019s son, James, and his friend, Roger. James and Roger reported this incident to the BCSO. Later that evening, Ray called and threatened to kill Roger, as well as Vickie, James and Michael. Roger signed a written statement describing the threats. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>investigation was undertaken, Ray was not arrested, nor was his gun seized. The law at that time mandated that a gun used or threatened to be used in a domestic event be confiscated. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s categorization of this event as a \u201cthreatened suicide\u201d that did not require confiscation of Ray\u2019s gun under \u00a7 46-6-603, MCA, the Sheriff testified that Ray\u2019s pointing of the gun at James constituted family member assault and did require that Ray\u2019s gun be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b651 Lastly, evidence was presented that in April 1997, Vickie\u2019s two younger sons, Michael and Marcus, called the BCSO reporting that Ray and Vickie were having a terrible argument. Marcus made the call while Michael went to get his .22 rifle for protection. Michael had seen Ray point a gun at Vickie before he retreated to his bedroom to stay with Marcus. Marcus did not report Ray\u2019s gun to the dispatcher when he called because he had stayed in his room and was unaware that Ray had it. When the officers arrived, they found Ray\u2019s loaded handgun in his bedroom. Testimony was presented that an officer unloaded the gun, returned the pistol to the bedside table, and left the bullets on the dresser. No officer who responded to the call ever investigated this incident or asked the boys or Vickie if Ray had used his gun that night. Had they asked the boys what happened, the deputies and/or the Sheriff would have had a mandatory obligation to arrest Ray, confiscate his gun, and give Vickie her notice of victim\u2019s rights. However, they did not ask and did not follow up with any further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b652 Over the course of the trial, several deputies testified that they believed Ray should have been arrested and taken into custody for his own protection or the protection of others, and that his handgun should have been seized and kept in accordance with the statute. Additionally, Dr. Mark Mozer, a clinical psychologist with more than thirty years experience, testified about his extensive work in assessing and evaluating persons with mental illnesses and behavioral problems. He stated that he had evaluated hundreds of cases involving battered spouses. He reviewed many of the Sheriffs logs and reports pertaining to emergency calls from the Doggetts\u2019 household or response calls to the Doggetts\u2019 home. He also listened to a summary of 9-1-1 calls from Vickie, Ray, and the boys, and he studied the Sheriffs deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b653 Dr. Mozer testified at length that Ray should have been arrested or taken into custody. He outlined the benefits that could have been derived by getting Ray into the judicial system, including alcohol treatment and a work program, which may have eased Ray\u2019s depression. Moreover, this would have forced him to recognize that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>behavior had consequences and \u201cwould have decreased the likelihood of further aggression and would have likely averted [this] tragic event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b654 Dr. Mozer also stated that mandatory seizure of a weapon used or threatened to be used in a domestic assault situation is an \u201cexcellent idea,\u201d because it removes a deadly weapon from a volatile situation and is an actual punishment for \u201cbad behavior.\u201d He pointed out that after the Sheriff confiscated Ray\u2019s gun in December 1994 and refused to return it for a couple of months, the Doggetts did not request BCSO intervention for two years. He posited that removal of the gun could have, in part, cause this deceleration of calls to the Sheriffs Office. \u00b655 Additionally, Dr. Mozer repeatedly emphasized the importance of having an objective third party inserted into a domestic violence or abuse situation. He explained that victims of recurring and ongoing violence tend to reach a state of \u201cpervasive denial.\u201d He opined that providing the statutorily-required victim\u2019s notice increased the likelihood that the victim would get a third party involved. Such third party involvement, he stated, would help identify the various problems, both with the individuals involved and with their relationship, that could trigger violence. It would keep the victim from \u201cforgetting\u201d about the abuse the next morning, after the almost-inevitable apology is rendered. He maintained that third party agencies help a victim recognize and appreciate the seriousness of the situation and help them address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b656 Dr. Mozer further opined that Vickie did not appreciate the dangerousness of her situation and that had she been told of resources available to her as an abuse victim, and utilized those resources, a treatment plan for the problems may have been developed and kept on track.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b657 In addition, and importantly to our analysis, the Sheriff himself testified that the purpose of notifying victims of their rights is to help them understand the dangerousness of their situation. He agreed that domestic abuse victims rarely recognize this danger but, nonetheless, look to law enforcement for protection. Thus, the District Court\u2019s conclusion in its Decision and Order as a matter of law that \u201cThere was no evidence at trial connecting the failure of Thompson to provide such notice with Vickie\u2019s death\u201d <em>(see </em>\u00b6 23) was patently wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b658 The Sheriff offered no expert or lay testimony to refute Dr. Mozer\u2019s testimony that this tragic event \u201cwould have likely [been] averted\u201d had the Sheriff taken any or all of the above actions. In addition, both defense witnesses-the Undersheriff and one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>deputies who had responded to calls to the Doggetts\u2019 home-agreed with the Massees\u2019 claims that Ray should have been arrested and his weapon seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b659 With the foregoing evidence in mind, we now turn to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that, because the \u201carrest\u201d duty was discretionary, not mandatory, the Sheriff could not be held liable for failing to arrest. We also consider the court\u2019s conclusion that, because the mandatory weapon seizure statute applied only to the December 1996 and April 1997 events, and those events did not give rise to a mandatory duty to seize the weapon, that statute was not violated. In that these legal conclusions formed the basis for the court\u2019s determination that no duty was owed to Vickie, we must examine them for correctness. <em>MacKay, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"ALFq\">\u00b660  Throughout this Opinion, we have set forth significant testimony-from the Massee sons and other witnesses, and, most importantly, from the Sheriff and his deputies-that the Sheriff negligently failed to give notice to Vickie of her statutory rights, that he failed to confiscate Ray\u2019s gun, and that he failed to arrest Ray when he should have. There was also undisputed testimony from the Massees\u2019 experts that these failures were a substantial factor in bringing about Vickie\u2019s death. This being so, it was error for the District Court to conclude as a matter of law that, 1) violation of the mandatory notice statute could not support a verdict of negligence; 2) the mandatory \u201cweapon seizure\u201d statute did not apply to the December 1996 family member and domestic assault incident; and 3) because the \u201carrest\u201d statute imposed no mandatory duties on the Sheriff, its violation could not support a verdict of negligence against the Sheriff. As we discussed above, a jury may base a finding of negligence upon evidence of violation of a statute, even if violation of the statute is not necessarily negligence <em>per se. Nehring, </em>219 Mont. at 468, 712 P.2d at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b661 There is nothing in the record that indicates upon which theory of negligence the jury\u2019s verdict was based. The special verdict completed by the jury simply asked whether the Sheriff was negligent as defined by the instructions, and, if so, whether his negligence was a cause of the Massees\u2019 injuries or damages. The jury responded \u201cyes\u201d to both questions. The jury could well have premised its verdict, in whole or in part, upon its conclusion that the Sheriff negligently violated one, two, or all three of the domestic abuse statutes. Such a conclusion would be permitted under the law, regardless of whether negligence <em>per se </em>instructions were or were not given.</p>\n<p id=\"AQe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u00b662  We conclude that the Massees presented sufficient evidence to the jury for it to conclude under the common law negligence jury instructions that the Sheriff \u201cfailed to use reasonable care\u201d and failed to act \u201cas an ordinarily prudent sheriff or deputy would act under the circumstances.\u201d Contrary to the District Court\u2019s finding, they also presented sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that the Sheriff was negligent <em>per se </em>for failing to give the required notices, and that such failure was a substantial factor in bringing about Vickie\u2019s death. Moreover, as to causation, it is the fact finder\u2019s responsibility to determine the credibility of a witness and to attribute the amount of weight appropriate to a witnesses\u2019 testimony. <em>See Sandman v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>1998 MT 286, \u00b6 40, 291 Mont. 456, \u00b6 40, 969 P.2d 277, \u00b6 40. This Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the fact finder. <em>See State v. Felando </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 144, 148, 810 P.2d 289, 291. The jurors were polled on the question of causation, and nine members determined that the Sheriffs negligence satisfied the causation element of the negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"A2u\">\u00b663  Lastly, we address the concern that a ruling for the Massees would \u201csignify an erosion of law enforcement\u2019s discretion\u201d and render such discretion \u201cillusory.\u201d Amicus Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association argues that Thompson acted within his lawful discretion in this case and that this Court should not \u201csecond-guess law enforcement officers when they are acting within their lawful discretion.\u201d We are not engaging in any such endeavor. We reiterate that while the \u201carrest\u201d statute bestows discretion, the Sheriffs duties under both \u00a7\u00a7 46-6-602 and -603, MCA, were not discretionary but mandatory. As noted above, we simply conclude that, on these facts and under the law as given to the jury, the jury had before it sufficient credible evidence to conclude that the Sheriffs negligence or negligent <em>per se </em>conduct led to Vickie\u2019s death. This being so, the entry of judgment to the contrary was not properly granted. <em>Ryan, </em>279 Mont. at 510, 928 P.2d at 229-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b664 Based on the foregoing, we conclude sufficient credible evidence was presented to the jury to support its verdict. We further conclude that the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions underlying its entry of judgment as a matter of law were incorrect. Therefore, we reverse the District Court\u2019s Decision and Order granting Sheriff Thompson\u2019s and Broadwater Comity\u2019s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, and reinstate the jury verdict and subsequent judgment dated March 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>2003, in favor of the Massees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-6\"> The Massees also argued that the Sheriff failed to comply with \u00a7 46-6-601, MCA (1993 and 1995).

I disagree with our application of the judicially-created public duty doctrine. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from that portion of our Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b666 This case directly raises the question of whether the abolition of sovereign immunity under Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution precludes application of the judicially-created public duty doctrine. We have declined to address this argument in favor of simply applying the public duty doctrine. I would hold that this doctrine is a variant of sovereign immunity, is violative of Montana\u2019s Constitution and, therefore, has no application in Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u00b667 As background for this separate Opinion, I will briefly trace the origins of sovereign immunity and the public duty doctrine and the roles that each theory has played to shield governments from liability for wrong-doing. Sovereign immunity prevents government liability by holding a governmental entity immune from suit even when its officers breach a duty. On the other hand, the public duty doctrine prevents government liability by declaring that no duty exists. Both doctrines preclude a court from awarding just compensation to the injured victim for injury perpetrated by the negligent governmental tortfeasor. Both doctrines frustrate the clear will of the people of Montana expressed in Article II, Section 18 of our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\n<em>A. Sovereign Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">\u00b668 Sovereign immunity, which is synonymous with governmental tort immunity, proclaims that the government is not liable for the negligent acts of its officers and employees. Barry L. Hjort, <em>The Passing of Sovereign Immunity in Montana: The King is Dead!, </em>34 Mont. L. Rev. 283, 283 (1973). With its origins in the divine right of kings as construed by the common law of England, the doctrine held that the King could not be sued in the King\u2019s Court because the Court\u2019s authority was subordinant to the King. Therefore, sovereign immunity functioned as a jurisdictional bar and persons unjustly injured by an action of the crown might properly seek monetary redress in the Court of the Exchequer. <em>Hjort, </em>at 284. The English courts extended tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>immunity to local units of government on the grounds that \u201cit is better that an individual should sustain an injury than that the public should suffer an inconvenience.\u201d <em>Russell v. The Men of Devon </em>(K.B. 1788), 100 Eng. Rep. 359 (holding the men of the unincorporated county of Devon immune from suit by a wagon owner who was injured crossing a poorly maintained county bridge).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b669 Imported to the United States during the Nineteenth Century, the doctrine of sovereign immunity sustained intense criticism by courts and legal scholars as \u201can anachronism without rational basis in a democratic society\u201d and as an abrogation of traditional tort principles, which provide remedies for victims of negligent or wrongful conduct. W. Page Keeton, <em>et </em>al., <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 125 (4th ed. 1971). Nevertheless, sovereign immunity remained a vital legal construct in most states, shielding public coffers and government actors from liability through the late Twentieth Century.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b670 Montana courts embraced sovereign immunity dining the territorial period. <em>Langford v. King </em>(1868), 1 Mont. 33, 38 (holding that citizens may not sue the territorial government in the absence of the government\u2019s consent); <em>Fisk v. Cuthbert </em>(1877), 2 Mont. 593. The Montana Constitution of 1889 neither authorized nor prohibited sovereign immunity and courts struggled through the Twentieth Century to apply the doctrine with consistency and reason. <em>Hjort, </em>at 289-93 (discussing selective application of immunity based upon judicial distinctions between government\u2019s proprietary and discretionary functions and judicial recognition of a waiver of immunity to the extent of government\u2019s liability insurance coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"A7A\">\u00b671 The Delegates to the 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention unequivocally rejected governmental tort immunity concluding that \u201cthe doctrine no longer has a rational justification in law.\u201d Report of the Bill of Rights Committee, 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. II, at 637. As reported by the Bill of Rights Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity bars tort suits against the state for negligent acts by its officials and employees. The committee finds this reasoning repugnant to the fundamental premise of the [sic] American justice: all parties should receive fair and just redress whether the injuring party is a private citizen or a governmental agency. The committee believes that just as the government administers a system of justice between private parties it should administer the system when the government itself is alleged to have committed an injustice. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>committee notes that private firms are liable for the negligence of their employees and points out this fact to indicate the inconsistency of the state\u2019s position in the system of tort law.

State </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 207, 222, 810 P.2d 1177, 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b676 Within four years of enacting the Torts Claims Act, the 1977 Montana Legislature reinstated limited governmental tort immunity by excepting from liability certain discretionary acts of public officials and placing caps on damage awards. <em>See </em>Title 2, Chapter 9, Part 1, Montana Code Annotated (1977). Section 2-9-111(2), MCA (1977), as amended, granted immunity to a governmental entity for \u201can act or omission of its legislative body or a member, officer or agent thereof.\u201d The statute further elaborated that, \u201cthe term \u2018legislative body\u2019 includes the legislature ... and any local governmental entity given legislative powers by statute, including school boards.\u201d Section 2-9-111(1)(b), MCA (1977). Although governmental entities generally remained liable for the torts of employees under \u00a7 2-9-102, MCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>(1977), judicial interpretation of the legislative immunities granted pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA (1977), as amended, yielded a roiling series of decisions by this Court during the next fourteen years that affirmed broad governmental tort immunity. <em>See, e.g., W.D. Constr. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 348, 707 P.2d 1111 (county enjoys immunity from negligence suit for commission\u2019s failure to administer subdivision statutes and regulations); <em>Bieber v.

Rev. 529, 542 (1990) (postulating that judicial use of agency analysis reinstated blanket sovereign immunity for government\u2019s administrative acts).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5k\">\u00b677 The 1991 Legislature addressed the widening scope of governmental tort immunity by amending \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, to limit the terms under which entities enjoyed statutory immunity. <em>See </em>Chap. 821, L. 1991. The amendments restricted legislative immunity by clarifying that \u201cthe term legislative act does <em>not </em>include administrative actions undertaken in the execution of a law or public policy.\u201d Section 2-9-111(1)(c)(ii), MCA (1991) (emphasis added). The amended statute also provides that the purchase of liability insurance does not waive immunity. Section 2-9-111(4), MCA (1991). Regarding environmental torts, the statute specifically denies governmental tort immunity for \u201cany act or omission that results in or contributes to personal injury or property damage caused by contamination or other alteration of the physical, chemical, or biological properties of surface water or ground water, for which a cause of action exists in statutory or common law or at equity.\u201d Section 2-9-lll(5)(b), MCA (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b678 A body of case law since the 1991 amendment affirms that a governmental entity is subject to suit for injury to a person or property resulting from an administrative action of a government employee acting within the scope of employment. <em>See, e.g., Koch v. Billings Sch. Dist. No. 2 </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 261, 833 P.2d 181 (physical education teacher\u2019s instruction to student to squat press 360 pounds not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>legislative act; school board has no immunity for teacher\u2019s negligence); <em>Hedges v.

Public Duty Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b679 The public duty doctrine is a judicially-created precept succinctly expressed by this Court in a logical absurdity: \u201c[A] duty owed to all is a duty owed to none.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6 21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b680 The genesis of the public duty doctrine in the United States may be traced to <em>South v. Maryland </em>(1856), 59 U.S. 396, 18 How. 396, 15 L.Ed 433. In <em>South, </em>the plaintiff alleged that he was kidnapped, held for four days and released only when he paid ransom money to his kidnappers. Asserting that the local sheriff knew that he had been unlawfully detained yet did nothing to obtain his release, South sued the sheriff for nonfeasance. The circuit court awarded South a substantial judgment. The United States Supreme Court reversed and declared that a sheriffs duty to keep the peace was \u201ca public duty, for neglect of which he is amenable to the public, and punishable by indictment only.\u201d <em>South, </em>59 U.S. at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b681 While logic would suggest that a duty to the public is a duty to everyone, rather than a duty to no one, the common law public duty doctrine provides that for one to recover in tort for the failure of a governmental officer to act properly, it must be shown that the duty breached was owed to the injured person individually and not merely to the general public. A popular Nineteenth Century treatise explained the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">[I]f the duty which the official authority imposes upon an officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>is a duty to the public, a failure to perform it, or an inadequate or erroneous performance, must be a public, not an individual injury, and must be redressed, if at all, in some form of public prosecution. On the other hand, if the duty is a duty to the individual, then a neglect to perform it, or to perform it properly, is an individual wrong, and may support an individual action for damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">T. Cooley, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Torts </em>379 (1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b682 The public duty doctrine gained acceptance in the courts of most states, including Montana, where the precept often was applied to cases involving allegations of negligent police protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b683 Generally, those who advocate for the doctrine argue that it protects government entities from a flood of lawsuits that could potentially cripple the public coffers and that it protects those entities which provide much needed but high risk services, where potential liability or the fear of potential liability would eliminate those services. <em>See </em>Frank Swindell, <em>Municipal Liability for Negligent Inspections in Sinning v. Clark-A \u201cHollow\u201d Victory for the Public Duty Doctrine, </em>18 Campbell Law Review 241, 249-51 (Spring 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b684 On the other hand, the doctrine has been criticized because it allows government entities to use the shield of sovereign immunity when the legislature no longer mandates such immunity; when application of the doctrine requires plaintiffs injured by a negligent official suffer solely because of the governmental status of the tortfeasor; when application of the doctrine promotes incompetence by providing no meaningful incentive for the government entity to provide services of optimal quality; and because, even when the doctrine is eliminated, plaintiffs must still prove duty, breach of duty, causation and damages-a substantial burden in any negligence suit. Moreover, given the wide availability of liability insurance, government entities may limit exposure of the public treasury while still compensating injured individuals. <em>Swindell, </em>at 249-51</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b685 In Montana, citing <em>South v. Maryland </em>for the proposition that no liability attaches in common law for a sheriffs breach of duty, this Court rejected the claims of Butte landowners that the county was liable for the sheriffs failure to protect their property during a riot. <em>Annala v. McLeod </em>(1949), 122 Mont. 498, 504, 206 P.2d 811, 814-15. Acknowledging that the sheriff had both a statutory and common law duty to conserve the peace, this Court observed that the duty was to the public and no statute fixed civil liability. Therefore, common law controlled the case and assigned no liability for breach of a public duty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The Court concluded that neither the sheriff nor the local government were liable for the homeowners\u2019 damages. <em>Annala, </em>122 Mont. at 504, 206 P.2d at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b686 Without naming the public duty doctrine, this Court noted in <em>Phillips v. Billings </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 249, 253, 758 P.2d 772, 775, that \u201c[t]he majority rule states that [a police officer\u2019s] general duty to protect does not give rise to liability for a particular individual\u2019s injury absent a greater duty imposed by a special relationship.\u201d Then, in <em>Nelson, </em>we further explained how a special relationship gives rise to a special duty, which attaches liability in common law for the negligent acts of government actors. A special relationship may be created: (1) by a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons from a particular type of harm and the plaintiff is a member of that class; (2) when a government agent undertakes specific action to protect a person or property; (3) by governmental actions that reasonably induce detrimental reliance by a member of the public; and (4) under certain circumstances, when the agency has actual custody of the plaintiff or of a third person who causes harm to the plaintiff. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Day v. State </em>(Utah 1999), 980 P.2d 1171, 1175).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b687 In <em>Nelson, </em>a police officer stopped a couple under suspicion of driving while intoxicated. The officer did not arrest the driver, but directed her to park the car and offered the couple a ride home. The couple declined the offer and began walking along the roadway, where the woman was struck by a drunk driver and died. Her husband sued the officer and the county for negligence. Examining the circumstances in which a police officer enters a special relationship with an individual, the Court recounted that an officer has a special duty to protect a person who is in the officer\u2019s custody or control; to protect third parties from harm by a person in police custody; and to protect persons for whom the officer has voluntarily provided service. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-38. Although the decedent was not in police custody at the time of the accident, the Court concluded that a special relationship existed because the officer assumed a duty to protect the woman from a foreseeable risk of harm when he restricted her driving privilege. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 39. Since a question remained whether the officer failed to exercise reasonable care when he allowed the woman to walk home, summary judgment was inappropriate. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b688 The analysis of the duty owed by governmental entities under the public duty doctrine has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, especially as courts have applied the doctrine to shield governments from liability when sovereign immunity is unavailable as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>a bar against tort actions. Deborah L. Markowitz, <em>Municipal Liability for Negligent Inspection and Failure to Enforce Safety Codes, </em>15 Hamline J. Pub. L. &amp; Pol\u2019y 181, 187 (Spring 1994). A significant number of states where strong statutory provisions or judicial decisions abrogate governmental tort immunity now reject the public duty doctrine altogether. <em>Adams v. State </em>(Alaska 1976), 555 P.2d 235; <em>Ryan v. State </em>(Ariz. 1982), 656 P.2d 597; <em>Leake v. Cain </em>(Colo. 1986), 720 P.2d 152; <em>Commercial Carrier Corp. v. Indian River County </em>(Fla. 1979) 371 So.2d 1010; <em>Fowler v. Roberts </em>(La. 1989), 556 So.2d 1; <em>Jean W. v. Commonwealth </em>(Mass. 1993) 610 N.E.2d 305; <em>Maple v. Omaha </em>(Neb. 1986), 384 N.W.2d 254; <em>Doucette v. Town of Bristol </em>(N.H. 1993), 635 A.2d 1387; <em>Schear v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs </em>(N.M. 1984), 687 P.2d 728; <em>Wallace v.

State </em>(Wyo. 1986), 719 P.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b689 Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution, abolishes sovereign immunity in Montana by ensuring that every person has the fundamental right to sue a Montana governmental entity for injury to person or property. This constitutional provision also provides that governmental entities may be immunized from suit by statute enacted upon a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature. Since the precepts of the public duty doctrine have never been codified, the common law public duty doctrine, as applied by the Court in the case at bar, exists only by dint of judicial decree in Montana. Because the public duty doctrine works to create governmental tort immunity in the absence of an explicit legislative grant of immunity and infringes upon the fundamental constitutional right of persons to sue a Montana governmental entity for injury to person or property, I would hold that the public duty doctrine has no place in Montana jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b690 As for Justice Regnier\u2019s special concurrence, I do not disagree that the Montana Sheriffs\u2019 and Peace Officers\u2019 Association has raised legitimate concerns and arguments. The point is, however, that, <em>under the Constitution, </em>it is the Legislature\u2019s job to deal with those concerns; it is not this Court\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b691 Indeed, the rebuttal to our approach is best articulated by former Chief Justice Jean A. Turnage in <em>Galt v. State Dept. of Fish, Wildlife </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 142, 731 P.2d 912. Chief Justice Turnage cautioned against resolving cases on the basis of judicially-created theories by ignoring the Constitution. Specifically, Chief Justice Turnage stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApZ\">This Court should not resort to creating or finding legal theories when a result can be reached from express constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><em>Galt, </em>225 Mont. at 149, 731 at 916 (Turnage, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b692 Here, the express language of Montana\u2019s Constitution resolves the legal question at issue in this case. We err in relying on a judicially-created legal theory to the exclusion of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b693 I would hold that the unequivocal intent of the Delegates to the 1972 Constitutional Convention, embodied in Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution, was to abolish sovereign immunity and to expose governmental entities to suit for injury to a person and property in exactly the same way that private persons and private nonhuman entities are exposed. Within a year of the ratification of the Constitution, Montana voters approved a legislative referendum that conferred upon the Legislature the power to enact by a two-thirds majority in both houses specific statutory exceptions that limit the exposure of governmental entities to suit. I conclude that the common law public duty doctrine, which provides that government actors owe no duty to the general public in the absence of a special relationship between a governmental entity and a specific individual, works to reinstate governmental tort immunity by judicial decree and frustrates the will of the people as expressed in Article II, Section 18 of our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b694 Indeed, if something akin to the public duty doctrine is to continue as part of Montana law as an exception to Article II, Section 18, of our Constitution, then the Constitution itself unambiguously provides for the method and clearly delineates the proper branch of government to accomplish that task. It is the Legislature\u2019s prerogative, not the Judiciary\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u00b695 I would hold that the constitutional abrogation of governmental tort immunity under Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution precludes judicial application of the public duty doctrine, and I would reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict in this cause without reference to that doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u00b696 I respectfully dissent from our failure to so hold.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\"> The provision allowing the Legislature to provide for governmental tort immunity by a two-thirds majority was approved by referendum vote in 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\"> This Court also held, however, that certain common law personal immunities, separate and distinct, were not affected by Article II, Section 18. <em>See State ex rel.

Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 214, 759 P.2d 173 (the doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity is not affected by Article II, Section 18).

The Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association filed an amicus brief wherein the Association presents a seemingly legitimate argument that we must preserve the Public Duty Doctrine, at least to the extent that law enforcement discretion in effecting arrests and addressing claims of domestic abuse is preserved. The Association urges that Montana statutes grant the discretion to arrest but do not mandate arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">\u00b6100 In my judgment, the Association\u2019s concern should be thoroughly examined and reviewed before this Court seriously considers abolishing the Public Duty Doctrine as it applies to discretionary arrests of law enforcement. The Massees\u2019 reply brief does not address in complete fashion the concerns expressed by the Association. Since the abolishment of the Public Duty Doctrine is not critical to the outcome of this case, I would leave this discussion to another day.</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-5\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
