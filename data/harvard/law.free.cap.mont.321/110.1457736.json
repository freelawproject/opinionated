We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented by the father is whether the District Court abused its discretion in terminating his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Avl\">\u00b63 B.C. is the father of two boys, J.D.B. and L.E.C., who are the subject of this action. The boys have different mothers. J.D.B. was born in 1986 as a result of a brief relationship between B.C. and L.B. B.C. claimed he did not know he had a son until two and one-half years after his birth. J.D.B. lived with his mother for several years in Wyoming, Washington, and Texas until she was incarcerated in Texas for possession of methamphetamine. After living with his maternal grandparents for a year, J.D.B., then seven or eight years old, went to live with his father, B.C., who agreed to adopt him.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u00b64 L.E.C. was bom to B.C. and R.R. in 1997, when J.D.B. was eleven years old. B.C. and R.R. lived together for several years before they separated. Following their separation, they shared custody of L.E.C.</p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">\u00b65 During the six years prior to 2000, when the present proceedings were initiated, the relationship between J.D.B. and his father significantly deteriorated. On April 3, 2000, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) filed a Petition for Temporary Investigative Authority (TIA) relative to J.D.B. and L.E.C., who were then thirteen and two years old, respectively. The petition sought to remove J.D.B. and L.E.C. from their father\u2019s care based on a report that B.C. was verbally and physically abusive to J.D.B. The report indicated that: (1) B.C. constantly assailed J.D.B. with put downs such as \u201cdumb,\u201d \u201cstupid,\u201d and \u201cfucking idiot,\u201d kicked him with cowboy boots, and regularly inflicted pinch marks and other bruises in the shape of a belt; (2) B.C. was verbally abusive to school personnel when they requested his help in testing J.D.B. for severe attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD); and (3) B.C. was verbally abusive to DPHHS staff when they tried to intervene. Following a severe beating incident, J.D.B. told investigators he did not want to see his father ever again. DPHHS made an emergency removal of both children. However, L.E.C. was returned to his father\u2019s care the following day when it was determined that L.E.C., as the favored child, had not been subjected to the same abuse as J.D.B., and, therefore, the risk level to L.E.C. was not sufficient to keep him in foster care. R.R. subsequently relocated to Idaho with L.E.C., retaining primary custody of L.E.C., with supervised visits to B.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b66 DPHHS filed a Petition for Temporary Legal Custody of J.D.B. and L.E.C. on July 26, 2000. B.C. stipulated that temporary legal custody be granted to DPHHS regarding J.D.B., but contested temporary legal custody regarding L.E.C. After a hearing on August 31, 2000, the District Court declared both children youths in need of care within the meaning of \u00a7 41-3-102, MCA, and granted temporary legal custody to DPHHS for a period of six months. Further, the District Court signed a treatment plan which ordered B.C. to: (1) participate in counseling and attend classes on parenting and anger management in an effort to establish a healthy, nurturing relationship with J.D.B.; (2) establish a more cooperative relationship with school staff regarding an upcoming individual education plan for J.D.B.; and (3) maintain appropriate family connections through visitation. The court also signed a treatment plan for J.D.B.\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b67 On March 8,2001, DPHHS moved the District Court to terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the father\u2019s and the mother\u2019s parental rights on grounds that the proposed treatment plans were neither complied with nor successful, rendering the parents unfit, unable or unwilling to give the youths adequate parental care; that the parents\u2019 conduct appeared unlikely to change within a reasonable time; and that continuation of the parent-child relationship likely would result in continued abuse or neglect of both J.D.B. and L.E.C. L.B. subsequently signed a waiver of her parental rights to J.D.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b68 The District Court conducted a three-part hearing on the petition on September 11, 2001, October 3, 2001, and October 15, 2001, at which time testimony was heard from two case managers, three DPHHS social workers, an administrative officer from Child Family Services, an anger management counselor, a clinical school psychologist, an adolescent psychiatrist, J.D.B.\u2019s therapist, B.C.\u2019s therapist, J.D.B.\u2019s biological mother and grandmother, L.E.C.\u2019s biological mother, and B.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b69 On April 25, 2002, the District Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order terminating the parental rights of B.C. relative to both J.D.B. and L.E.C., and awarding permanent custody to DPHHS with the lawful authority to consent to the adoption of the children. B.C. appeals. The parental rights of J.D.B.\u2019s mother are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re A.T., </em>2003 MT 154, \u00b6 9, 316 Mont. 255, \u00b6 9, 70 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 9. The test for an abuse of discretion is \u201cwhether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re D.V., </em>2003 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 316 Mont. 282, \u00b6 14, 70 P.3d 1253, \u00b6 14 <em>(quoting In re K.C.H., </em>2003 MT 125, \u00b6 11, 316 Mont. 13, \u00b6 11, 68 P.3d 788, \u00b6 11). However, because a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, it must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>D.V., </em>\u00b6 14. To satisfy the relevant statutory requirements for terminating a parent-child relationship, a district court must make specific factual findings. <em>D.V., </em>\u00b6 14. We review those findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>D.V., </em>\u00b6 14. Finally, we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly. <em>D.V., </em>\u00b6 14. It is not this Court\u2019s function to reweigh conflicting evidence or substitute its judgment regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the strength of the evidence for that of the district court. <em>In re A.F., </em>2003 MT 254, \u00b6 24, 317 Mont. 367, \u00b6 24, 77 P.3d 266, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b611 B.C. asserts the District Court abused its discretion in terminating his parental rights. First, B.C. contends that the District Court failed to acknowledge that a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. While it is true the District Court\u2019s order does not specifically address this fundamental liberty interest, the court did apply the statutory criteria for parental termination as required by \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">41-3-609. Criteria for termination. (1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding ... that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">(f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">(1) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">(2) In determining whether the conduct or condition of the parents is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the court shall enter a finding that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect or that the conduct or the condition of the parents renders the parents unfit, unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care. In making the determinations, the court shall consider but is not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">(b) a history of violent behavior by the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-12\">(3) In considering any of the factors in subsection (2) in terminating the parent-child relationship, the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af3\">\u00b612  A review of the District Court\u2019s findings, conclusions, and order reveals that the court\u2019s Conclusions of Law Nos. 7 to 9, which concluded that it was \u201cin the best interests\u201d of both J.D.B. and L.E.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>to terminate parental rights, were supported by numerous findings of fact: J.D.B. had been severely abused by B.C., both verbally and physically; J.D.B. suffered from ADHD, but B.C. refused to assist school officials with the necessary educational assessments to help J.D.B. be successful in school; as a result of the strained relationship with his father, J.D.B. was depressed and did not want to see his father again; L.E.C. suffered from an antisocial personality disorder as a result of B.C.\u2019s ineffective parenting procedures; L.E.C. was at risk because he was either present or had knowledge of his brother\u2019s verbal and physical abuse; B.C. had a significant anger problem; and B.C. did not successfully complete the goal of his treatment plan requiring improvement of the emotional relationship with J.D.B., thus, rendering him unwilling, unable or unfit to parent his children. These findings indicate the District Court properly performed the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d analysis as required by \u00a7 41-3-609(3), MCA: \"... the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.\u201d On this basis, we conclude B.C. did not carry his burden of establishing that the court abused its discretion by failing to follow fundamentally fair procedures in terminating his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b613 B.C. also asserts the District Court abused its discretion in giving credence to J.D.B.\u2019s testimony regarding the number of beatings which occurred. J.D.B. testified that he had been assaulted 80 or 90 times by his father. B.C. testified he only beat J.D.B. once. The court stated, \u201cthis is a difficult case, partially because there are two different stories that have evolved from [B.C.\u2019s] evidence as opposed to [J.D.B.\u2019s], in particular, and they\u2019re diametrically opposed, so somebody\u2019s not telling the truth.\u201d As the State correctly notes, \u201c[t]his case largely boiled down to a credibility match between father and son: father minimized the extent of abuse, claiming he only beat his son on one occasion, while the son testified that the abuse was ongoing and significant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANn\">\u00b614  The District Court found J.D.B. to be a credible witness and chose to believe J.D.B. Numerous professionals testified that J.D.B.\u2019s psychological profile was consistent with someone who had been physically and emotionally abused over a long period of time. The District Court was in the best position to hear all of the evidence presented and weigh conflicting testimony. \u201cIn nonjury trials, the credibility of a witness and weight which his or her testimony should be afforded is left to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>In re Inquiry into M.M. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 166, 171, 906 P.2d 675, 678. It is not the role of this Court to reweigh the evidence and substitute our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>judgment for that of the District Court under such circumstances. We therefore conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in placing more weight on J.D.B.\u2019s testimony than on B.C.\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"A2i\">\u00b615  B.C. further asserts that the court\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 26, which states that B.C. did not successfully complete the first goal of the treatment plan, specifically, successful anger management, is erroneous. Finding of Fact No. 26 was based upon the following testimony of Michael Roseborough, anger management counselor at Beta Alternatives where B.C. had been attending classes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">While [B.C.] had completed the anger management classes, [B.C.] was unable to demonstrate changes in his behavior. [B.C.] minimized his own behavior, was not willing to admit that he had an anger management problem and had not made any sincere or long-lasting changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">B.C. argues that a letter written by Roseborough at the conclusion of B.C.\u2019s anger management class which stated B.C. had completed all sixteen steps of the anger management program and that Roseborough had \u201c[n]o concerns at this time,\u201d should have been given more weight than Roseborough\u2019s oral testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b616 However, at trial Roseborough testified that, in light of J.D.B.\u2019s testimony of extensive and severe discipline, B.C. had not been completely open and honest in the anger management classes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">If those disclosures [from the child] are indeed true, then it would indicate to me that [B.C.] had not been honest in the course of the class because there had been no talk of beatings, per se, of the-or of extreme disciplinary action. If what his son is saying is true, that there were as many as 80 beatings, as he calls them, then that to me is pretty dramatic and pretty extreme. Really nothing like that ever came up in class in terms of openness and honesty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">[B.C. never made] any deep personal change or any desire for change in a significant way in terms of how [B.C.] disciplined his children through the course of the class.... There was really never any indication or heartfelt desire to change his way of disciplining his children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">As previously noted, credibility determinations are within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and here, the District Court acted within its discretion in placing more weight on Mike Roseborough\u2019s oral testimony than his earlier letter. We conclude Finding of Fact No. 26, that B.C. did not successfully complete the first goal of his treatment plan, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AbV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u00b617  Finally, B.C. asserts the District Court erred in failing to consider the testimony of Cheryl Leicht, his therapist, in its decision to terminate his parental rights. B.C. argues that she was a well-qualified professional who, after seeing B.C. for approximately one year, offered significant testimony favorable to B.C. At trial, however, Cheryl Leicht admitted she had not personally witnessed B.C.\u2019s anger problem, and she agreed that if J.D.B.\u2019s testimony were true regarding the extent of the beatings, that fact could contribute to J.D.B.\u2019s lack of trust with his father. Again, it was the function of the District Court to accept or reject conflicting evidence and to determine the weight to be given Leicht\u2019s testimony. Clearly, substantial evidence supported the District Court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b618 We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating B.C.\u2019s parental rights to J.D.B. and L.E.C.
