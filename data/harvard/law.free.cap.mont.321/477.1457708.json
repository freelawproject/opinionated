The house under construction was owned by Michael and Ruth Crenshaw (the Crenshaws). In addition to filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim, Grover sued the Crenshaws and Cornerstone Construction for negligently failing to provide a safe workplace. Section 50-71-201, MCA. The Crenshaws and Cornerstone each filed a Motion <em>in Limine </em>requesting that Grover be prohibited from introducing safety standards established under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA or the Act). The Motions were granted. Grover and the Crenshaws subsequently settled. Following a jury trial and defense verdict for Cornerstone, Grover appeals, challenging the entry of the Order <em>in Limine. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u00b62 The only issue before this Court is whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting Cornerstone\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine </em>prohibiting Grover from introducing at trial OSHA safety standards as evidence of Cornerstone\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">\u00b63 In the spring of 1996, the Crenshaws began planning their new home along Flathead Lake. After having plans drawn and obtaining the necessary building permits, they asked their brother-in-law, Stephen Tartaglino, who was married to Ruth Crenshaw\u2019s sister, to act as \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d over the project. The three of them entered into a written contract on May 29, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">\u00b64 Tartaglino had worked in the construction industry for much of his adult life, but for a few years prior to this time, in addition to construction work, he also had worked as a licensed paramedic and emergency medical technician (EMT) in New England. Upon returning to Montana in August 1995, he was unable to secure an EMT/paramedic position in Kalispell, so he began working as a building contractor again. He was working for a contractor in Kalispell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>when the Crenshaws approached him about helping in the construction of their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\">\u00b65 Prior to beginning work on the Crenshaw home, Tartaglino established a sole proprietorship, Cornerstone Construction, N.W., and obtained the necessary licenses, insurance and bonding. In January 1997, a few months after the accident giving rise to this case, Tartaglino incorporated Cornerstone. Because Cornerstone was owned exclusively by Tartaglino at the time of Grover\u2019s injury, we will use \u201cTartaglino\u201d and \u201cCornerstone\u201d interchangeably in this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b66 Tartaglino had only a few small tools when he began assisting the Crenshaws in July 1996, having left his large construction tools in New England. The Crenshaws provided various tools for use on the construction site and over the course of their home-building project, they purchased other needed tools and equipment which Tartaglino agreed to purchase from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b67 Because Cornerstone had no employees, the Crenshaws contracted with Labor Contractors of Kalispell (Labor Contractors) to provide laborers for the building project. The Crenshaws prepaid Labor Contractors a substantial sum from which Labor Contractors would in turn pay the wages, taxes, and workers\u2019 compensation premiums for the laborers it \u201cloaned\u201d to Crenshaws. Grover was employed as a carpenter by Labor Contractors and was one of the workers \u201cloaned\u201d to the Crenshaws. On September 3, 1996, Grover fell from the roof of the Crenshaw home and sustained injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b68 In addition to filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim, Grover filed suit against the Crenshaws and Cornerstone in July 1998, alleging that they negligently failed to provide a reasonably safe place to work. Section 50-71-201, MCA. Prior to the jury trial, the Crenshaws and Cornerstone filed Motions <em>in Limine </em>seeking to prohibit Grover from presenting the OSHA safety standards to the jury as evidence of the Crenshaws\u2019 and Cornerstone\u2019s negligence. The District Court granted the motions. Shortly thereafter, Grover and the Crenshaws settled their claims. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Cornerstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b69 Grover filed a timely notice of appeal. He asserts that the District Court erred in granting Cornerstone\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine. </em>He asks that we set aside the jury verdict and order a new trial in which he would be allowed to introduce the OSHA safety standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion <em>in limine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Brasda, </em>2003 MT 374, \u00b6 14, 319 Mont. 146, \u00b6 14, 82 P.3d 922, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). A district court abuses its discretion if the district court \u201cacts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Brasda, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]his Court will uphold the decision of a district court, if correct, regardless of the lower court\u2019s reasoning in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b611 Grover maintains that, under OSHA, certain safety procedures and equipment were required in the construction of the Crenshaw home. He asserts that Cornerstone failed to provide the required safety equipment and that, as a result, he fell from the Crenshaw\u2019s roof. He further maintains that he should have been able to present the OSHA safety guidelines to the jury in his effort to prove that Cornerstone was negligent in failing to provide an adequately safe work environment. Grover submits that while violations of the OSHA rules in the construction industry are not considered negligence <em>per se, </em>they are evidence of common law, or ordinary, negligence. He argues that because the jury was not allowed to consider the OSHA guidelines, a disproportionate amount of negligence was attributed to him, thus precluding his recovery at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b612 To support his position that the OSHA regulations applied to this construction project, Grover contends that Tartaglino was an experienced and knowledgeable commercial builder who was aware of the industry accepted safety standards. Grover maintains that Tartaglino undertook the construction of a residential home that was not his own, and thus was participating in a construction endeavor that was part of the construction industry as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b613 In reaching its decision, the District Court applied the following two-part rule announced in <em>Lynch v. Reed </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 321, 944 P.2d 218:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">1) A code or standard sought to be admitted for the purpose of \u201cconclusively determining the standard of care imposed upon the defendant\u201d must have been adopted by a governmental agency so as to have the force of law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">2) Where a code or standard does not have the force of law, it may nevertheless be admitted as substantive evidence of negligence if it is coupled with a showing of general acceptance in the industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><em>Lynch, </em>284 Mont. at 328, 944 P.2d at 223. Applying this rule, the District Court pointed to the fact that Grover was employed by Labor Contractors, not Cornerstone. It therefore concluded that Tartaglino was not Grover\u2019s \u201cemployer.\u201d The court stated that OSHA does not impose obligations upon an owner where the worker in question is an independent contractor and not an employee of the owner. The court further concluded, under the second part of the <em>Lynch </em>test, that the Crenshaw construction project-a private residence construction project-was not the type of project that \u201cfits within the scheme of the construction industry in general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b614 We disagree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning, but for the reasons set forth below, nonetheless affirm the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>Hulse, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 15. We conclude that, in order to determine whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting the Motion <em>in Limine, </em>we must analyze not who was the employer, but rather, who had control over the safety of the operations of the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b615 In <em>Shannon v. Howard S. Wright Const. Co. </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 269, 593 P.2d 438, we affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict finding that both the owner Big Sky and the general contractor Wright were liable under \u00a7 41-1710, RCM (1947)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Montana Safety Act for the injuries sustained by the employee of a subcontractor, because Big Sky and Wright \u201ctook an active part in the decision-making which affected the [subcontractor\u2019s] working conditions\u201d and exercised \u201ccontrol over the means by which the subcontractor\u2019s employees could reach their places of work on the upper levels of the condominiums.\u201d <em>Shannon, </em>189 Mont. at 277 and 79, 593 P.2d at 442 and 443. We concluded that \u201cBig Sky not only retained the supervisory capacity ... but exercised that authority in a manner that directly affected the access of the subcontractor\u2019s employees to the condominiums, thereby forcing them to climb ladders and crawl through a window casing. In Wright\u2019s case, as general contractor, it had the authority to order temporary stairs and handrails built, but its project superintendent..., decided not to.... Thus the authority to create safe working conditions rested entirely with Big Sky and Wright.\u201d <em>Shannon, </em>181 Mont. at 281, 593 P.2d at 444-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b616 Subsequently in <em>Gibby v. Noranda Minerals Corp. </em>(1995), 273 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Mont. 420, 905 P.2d 126, we affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of an injured worker and against the majority owner and manager of operations, Noranda, finding that Noranda expressly retained supervisory authority over the subcontractor\u2019s employees and methods of operation, including employee safety. <em>Gibby, </em>273 Mont. at 425, 905 P.2d at 129. We also noted that \u201c[i]n addition to this contractual grant of authority,\u201d evidence presented at trial showed that Noranda extensively exercised this authority on-site, clearly indicating that it was in \u201cactual control\u201d of the worksite. <em>Gibby, </em>273 Mont. at 426, 905 P.2d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b617 We conclude a similar analysis should be applied here. In resolving whether the District Court abused its discretion in precluding the admission of the OSHA regulations against Tartaglino, we will look to the evidence to determine the extent to which he was in actual control over safety and working conditions in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"AAL\">\u00b618 It is apparent from the record that both Michael Crenshaw and Tartaglino exercised varying levels of control over the project. It would appear, however, that Tartaglino\u2019s control over the worksite was much narrower than seen in <em>Shannon </em>or <em>Gibby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b619 The substantive terms of Tartaglino\u2019s contract with the Crenshaws were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">Steve Tartaglino will be the General Contractor and be paid an hourly wage of $25 per hour for those duties. He will be bonded insured and licensed in Montana as a General Contractor. Steve is committed to stay on the job at least until the roof is complete. Labor will be furnished by Labor Contractors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">Purchases and billings will be paid through Bachelor Sales Ltd. [the Crenshaws\u2019 company].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsUt\">\u00b620  Unlike the comprehensive contract in <em>Gibby, </em>Tartaglino\u2019s contract did not address, or even mention, a project safety program, safety devices, safeguards or protective equipment. Therefore, Tartaglino did not expressly and contractually accept responsibility for safety on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b621 The Crenshaws designed the home and assumed responsibility for obtaining the necessary permits. During construction, Michael Crenshaw visited the site on an average of 2-3 days per week. On some visits he performed light carpentry tasks or cleaned up around the site. He constructed a ladder for the comfort and safety of the crew. He frequently observed crew members performing their jobs. Additionally, he provided some of the tools used by various crew members and purchased others during the course of the project. Both Crenshaw and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Tartaglino fired workers during the project. Tartaglino terminated at least two workers based on the need to down-size the work crew. Crenshaw, however, assumed the responsibility for terminating a worker for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b622 From the record it appears that Tartaglino\u2019s primary day-to-day function was to perform construction-just like Grover and the other laborers borrowed from Labor Contractors. Moreover, the record reveals that Tartaglino and Crenshaw selected experienced carpenters from Labor Contractors, all of whom had worked on multiple residential home constructions prior to this project. At the beginning of the project, Crenshaw and Tartaglino instructed the subcontractor\u2019s employees to work safely and utilize any safety practices, procedures or equipment necessary to perform their given tasks. While Tartaglino had general oversight responsibilities designed to move the project forward to completion, unlike Big Sky, Wright Construction or Noranda, he did not exercise actual control over the subcontractor\u2019s employees, nor did he dictate to them in any specific manner how they were to perform their jobs. Finally, nothing in the record indicates that Tartaglino either assumed or exercised \u201c... the authority to create safe working conditions ...\u201d <em>Shannon, </em>181 Mont. at 281, 593 P.2d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">\u00b623  In summary, under the specific facts of this case and given the law as set forth above, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in precluding the admission of the OSHA safety standards as evidence against Tartaglino. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s Order granting Cornerstone\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b505-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\"> Subsequently re-numbered \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
