The answer, after denying the material allegations of the complaint, sets up by way of an affirmative defense that by paragraph tenth of the agreement the plaintiff and his assignor agreed that they will not directly or indirectly, during the period of this agreement, become interested in any theater devoted to the giving of burlesque in the city of Schenectady, or directly or indirectly operate or manage such theater, nor will they directly or indirectly become interested in the booking of any company to be given in the city of Schenectady; that the plaintiff, in violation of said covenant, actually became interested in the booking of burlesque shows at the Van Curler Opera House in the city of Schenectady, and did actually book such shows; and that by reason of the said breach on the plaintiff\u2019s part the defendant terminated the said agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">The defendant, for the purpose of establishing said affirmative defense, made a motion for an order for the examination of the plaintiff before trial, which was granted. The motion papers establish the propriety of the relief required, but the order is too broad. It provides that the plaintiff be examined as an adverse party before trial with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>reference to matters contained in the annexed affidavit, and generally with respect to the pleadings herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">It should be modified, to limit the examination to the facts material and necessary to establish the affirmative defense set up, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
