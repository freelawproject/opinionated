The plaintiff predicates its claim upon an alleged contract signed by the defendant. The alleged contract was made in September, 1907, and is a printed form of order, with the title of the books, the price, and the amount of the monthly installments inserted in pencil. The contract in its present form obligates the plaintiff to deliver a set of their \u201cNorroena\u201d for $97, payable in 20 monthly installments of $5 each. The contract also requires the plaintiff to deliver to the defendant \u201c1 Flatey book *- * * free.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-17\">The defendant testified that, when he signed the paper upon which the plaintiff sues, it merely required the plaintiff to deliver <em>\u201c1 </em>Flatey book * * * free,\u201d and that all the lead pencil writing which now appears upon the paper was inserted after he signed it. The present appearance of the paper, and the fact that the plaintiff waited five years before making any claim upon it, and that the plaintiff\u2019s agent, who induced the defendant to sign the paper, failed to contradict the defendant\u2019s testimony, are significant features of the case, which tend to corroborate the defendant\u2019s testimony. Moreover, the proof of the delivery of the books to the defendant was very unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-19\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
