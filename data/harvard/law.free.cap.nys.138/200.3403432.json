The appellant did not see the trunks at all upon delivery, nor until the morning following, some 12 hours thereafter, and with no explanation of her maid\u2019s movements in the interim, it was rightly within the province of the learned trial judge to find as a matter of fact that the plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie case of nondelivery, which is absolutely essential before the defendant need offer any rebutting testimony by way of explanation. As the case stood, the court was warranted in assuming that the loss may have occurred after the delivery of the trunks at the plaintiff\u2019s home. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
