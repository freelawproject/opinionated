Plaintiff paid this $150 in advance, the remaining $100 to be payable after the plaintiff had received the lessons and was able to fly.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Plaintiff was first sent to the shop to see the construction of the machine and learn how to assemble the parts, where he worked from June 7th to June 15th. On June 15th plaintiff was told there was no work for him there, and plaintiff went home to- wait for lessons in the field. After that plaintiff went to defendant\u2019s place at Belmont Park and saw defendant\u2019s mechanic, but got no instruction. Plaintiff reported daily until June 30th, without receiving any lesson. The machine was then taken apart, to be moved to Nassau Boulevard, where plaintiff went early in July. But no opportunity was given him to use the machine, which was not even put together. After making demands, the Legal Aid Society was appealed to, who wrote the defendant on plaintiff\u2019s behalf. On August 4th the defendant replied :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cIf Mr. Jansen will call at my school at Nassau Boulevard, he will receive his lessons at once.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Plaintiff, however, did call, but received only one practical lesson in the biplane on August 16th, when in about a minute a screw dropped out, so that the machine had to be stopped. Other demands were repeated and disregarded, until on August 23d plaintiff notified the defendant that, as he was not getting instruction, he would not come again, followed by this suit for the return of his payment of $150.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The trial court gave the plaintiff judgment for $75 and costs, from which both sides have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> The evidence indicates such indifference and neglect by defendant (especially after his written promise on August 4th that plaintiff should receive his lessons \u201cat once\u201d), that the court was justified in finding that defendant had broken his contract. The work in the shop was a preliminary; but the defendant\u2019s contract was entire, and cannot be separated -and apportioned. Starr v. Liftchild, 40 Barb. 541; Kabus v. Seftner, 34 Misc.
