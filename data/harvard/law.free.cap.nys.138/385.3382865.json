As such he could be removed only \u201cfor incompetency or misconduct shown after a hearing upon due notice, upon stated charges.\u201d Civil Service Law, \u00a7 22. The record shows that the statute was substantially complied with in scarcely any particular, and demonstrates that the commissioner either misconceived his duty in the premises, or was in such haste to discharge the relator that he disregarded the mandate of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">It is said that relator, by not asserting his right to due notice, the production of. legal evidence, and the service of charges in such manner that he could be prepared to defend himself, waived all these rights,, and cannot now insist that they were invalid. The circumstances attending the alleged trial and the manner in which it was conducted fully explain and account for relator\u2019s failure to protest at the time, and forbid the conclusion that he intended to waive his right to legal and orderly proceeding. Although, for these reasons, the order of the commissioner must be annulled, and the relator reinstated, the \u2022 commissioner may still, if he sees fit, institute new proceedings for the relator\u2019s discharge upon the same charge, keeping within the mandate of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The writ must be sustained, the determination of the commissioner annulled, and the relator reinstated, with $50 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
