After 2% days\u2019 service, she was discharged for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>having surreptiously made sketches of models, whereupon she brought this action to recover $50, the wages she was to receive for a week\u2019s service.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The evidence justified the court in finding that her discharge was justifiable. Had she been employed by the week, she could not have recovered a pro rata proportion of the week\u2019s salary for the period she actually <em>served; </em>but the defendants\u2019 general manager, by whom she was employed, testified that she was not employed for any particular period, and that her compensation was to be at the rate of $50 per week, and that, \u201cif she worked two days, she gets two-sixths of $50.\u201d Under these circumstances, plaintiff was entitled to recover for the period she actually served.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
