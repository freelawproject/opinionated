Y. Supp. 697. The point was not raised that a trustee in bankruptcy could not maintain an action to enforce the obligation of stockholders to creditors, imposed by section 56 of the Stock Corporation Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 59), and it was assumed that section 47 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by Act June 25, 1910, c. 412, \u00a7 8, 36 Stat. 840 (U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1911, p. 1500), applied. The point is now raised, and our attention is called to the error in assuming that the amendment of 1910 applied to the case. That amendment by its terms (section 14) was not to apply to bankruptcy cases pending when it took effect, and the proceeding in which the plaintiff was appointed trustee was pending at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendant is sued, not as a subscriber, to recover an unpaid subscription, but as a stockholder, to enforce a statutory liability given to creditors. It is quite plain that that liability is not an asset of the corporation. Even though the defendant had been a subscriber, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the subscription agreement would have limited his liability to the corporation. Southworth v. Morgan, 205 N. Y. 293, 98 N. E. 490. As a mere stockholder, he is liable only per force of the statute, and the statute in terms provides that that liability is <em>to creditors. </em>The bankruptcy law nowhere provides th'at a trustee may enforce the statutory liability of stockholders to creditors, and the amendment of 1910, to which we referred in our former opinion, quite plainly refers to the assets of the corporation. We have recently had occasion to observe, with respect to the statutory liability of stockholders, that it is not to the corporation, or to all creditors, but only to those within prescribed conditions. Hosier Safe Co. v. Guardian Trust Co. et al., 138 N. Y. Supp. 298, decided November 15, 1912, et vide cases cited. It follows that, in the absence of an express provision of statute authorizing the trustee in bankruptcy to maintain the action, he has no standing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayc\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, with costs, and a judgment entered dismissing the complaint, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and McLAUGHLIN and DOWLING, JJ., concur. LAUGHLIN, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
