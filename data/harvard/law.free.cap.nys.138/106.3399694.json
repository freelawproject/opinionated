He does not say that he was thrown by the starting of the car. Indeed, his testimony is consistent with the testimony of the conductor, his assistant, and the two outside witnesses, that plaintiff, standing on the step while the car was in motion, fell to the ground. Plaintiff says on his direct examination, \u201cthe car made a start and I tumbled out on my two knees,\u201d and on cross-examination, \u201cI put my right foot down, and I tumbled; that is the last I knew.\u201d He is the only witness to the accident called in his behalf, and he is contradicted by all the other witnesses, employ\u00e9s and outsiders. The judgment should be reversed, and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
