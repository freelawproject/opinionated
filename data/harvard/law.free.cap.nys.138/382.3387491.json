That he might obtain it from some other witness is not an answer to his application to examine the defendant. In our opinion the original order was right, and should not have been modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-21\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
