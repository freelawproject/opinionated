By virtue of the provisions of that act, as amended, the grade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>of Fordham Road in front of the premises of the relator was elevated above the established grade from four to nine feet. The board of assessors entertained the claim and gave hearings thereon, and witnesses were called and testified in behalf of the relators and in behalf of the city. Thereafter the board took up for consideration the relators\u2019 claim for damages, and by a majority vote dismissed the claim; but'one of the assessors dissented, and voted for an award of $10,-000 to the relators. This court on the hearing on the return to the writ of certiorari expressed the opinion that the authority of the court to review the proceeding was limited to questions \u201cof discretion, or of the regularity of the proceedings,\u201d and since the record did not present such questions the writ was dismissed; and- it was specifically stated in the order that the dismissal was \u201cfor lack of power, and not as a matter of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\">The opinion of this court was based, in part, upon the then recent decision of the Appellate Division, Second Department, in People ex rel. Hallock v. Hennessy et al., 146 App. Div. 440, 131 N. Y. Supp. 327, which was subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeals. 205 N. Y. 301, 98 N. E. 516. The Court of Appeals, in the case, construing a statute containing provisions similar to those herein quoted from the statute under which the relators\u2019 claim was filed, but which expressly provided that the board of assessors was authorized and empowered in \u201cits discretion\u201d to establish and determine the damages., decided that the <em>discretionary </em>power was with respect to <em>entertaining </em>the claim, and that, having entertained and heard the claim, the action of the board was judicial, and subject to review with respect to jurisdiction, to the regularity of the proceedings, and to the amount of the award. On the review of the former decision of this court herein, the Court of Appeals wrote an opinion stating, among other things, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">\u201cThe action of the board of assessors in ascertaining and awarding such damages is judicial in nature, and therefore subject to review by the courts\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\u2014and cited its decision in People ex rel. Hallock v. Hennessy et al., supra, as authority for that proposition, and remitted the case to this court \u201cto hear and determine.\u201d People ex rel. Olin et al. v. Hennessy et al., 206 N. Y. 33, 99 N. E. 87. If the board of assessors were authorized on the evidence before them to decline to award any damages to the relators, then the action of the board in dismissing the claim should not be annulled, although it is evident, I think, that the claim was not dismissed upon that ground. In view of the evidence, it is fairly to be inferred that the majority of the board were of opinion that they were vested with discretion toi award or to decline to award damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The relators presented evidence tending to show that their premises had been damaged to the extent of $70,000. One of the city\u2019s experts estimated the damages at $24,125, and another at $14,-000. It is claimed in behalf of the city that, inasmuch as the relators\u2019 premises were to be used for the purposes of storing gas in a tank which was being erected thereon at the time, no damages would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>suffered by the change of grade. There is no evidence to support this contention; and, moreover, the owners have the right to use their premises for any lawful purpose, and they are not limited to the damages sustained thereto by the particular use, which may be temporary, made of the premises at the time of the assessment of damages. The facts show without further argument that the relators have sustained substantial damages, and that the board of assessors erred in dismissing their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">It follows that the determination of the board of assessors in dismissing the claim of the relators should be annulled, with $50 costs and disbursements to the relators, and the board of assessors should be required to proceed and ascertain and award the damages sustained by the relators in accordance with the provisions of the act of the Legislature. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
