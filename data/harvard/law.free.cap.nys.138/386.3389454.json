The machine which the plaintiff agreed to construct from a model had been recently patented, and it was not known whether it would be a practical success or not. The building of it was in effect a joint venture of the plaintiff and the defendants. If it was a success, all parties expected to make a large amount of money. If it was not a success, the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiff $200, which turned out to be about 25 per cent, of the cost. It was a failure, and in its building and attempted operation the defendants made suggestions and acquiesced to a greater or less extent respecting the manner of its construction. The principal deviation from the model claimed is that the rollers were of equal, instead of unequal, diameter. This was a very minor affair, and could have been easily corrected, if any one had suggested that that was the reason why the machine did not operate as expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The judgment should be reversed upon the facts, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, the particular questions of fact of which the court disapproves being those numbered XX and XXI. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
