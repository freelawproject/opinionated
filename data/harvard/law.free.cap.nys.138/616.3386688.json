The fact that the purchaser and her male companion were such inspectors, of itself, raised no presumption against the credibility of their testimony, and there is no evidence showing interest or bias on the part of either of them. The proofs are convincing, and clearly preponderate as to the sale by short weight of the butter; and defendant\u2019s violation of the ordinance in the short-weight sale of the butter, especially, was seemingly so well established that the conclusion of the trial justice to the contrary was unreasonable and against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
