The note was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>dated March 15, 1910, and payable 20 days after date, at the Union Bank of Brooklyn, Seventeenth Ward Branch., The note was entered_ in the plaintiffs\u2019 passbook as for collection. On the due date the defendant presented the note for payment at the Union Bank, which was thereupon stamped \u201cAccepted,\u201d returned to the State Bank, and sent with exchanges the next day through the clearing house. In the meantime the Union Bank had failed, and the note was returned to the State Bank unpaid. There were sufficient funds of the Acme Column Company on deposit in the Union Bank on the 4th day of April to have paid the note; but the reason cash was not given at the time of presentment was stated to be a custom among banks to stamp notes as accepted and send them through the clearing house for payment like other exchanges. When this note was returned to the State Bank, stamped \u201cAccepted,\u201d and before it had been put through the clearing house, the State Bank had entered in the plaintiffs\u2019 deposit book the amount thereof as a credit, and informed them through its agent that the note had been paid. As the defendant has refused to recognize this credit, the plaintiffs have brought this action to recover the amount of the note which the defendant attempted to collect in their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is undoubtedly the general rule that a bank, undertaking to collect a note for a depositor, must accept in payment legal currency or bills which pass as money, and has no right to accept certification of a check, instead of payment. Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, \u00a7 335; Ward v. Smith, 74 U. S. (7 Wall.) 447, 19 L. Ed. 207. But this general rule must give way to a custom to the contrary, well established among bankers, and not unreasonable. Thus, a general and universal custom among bankers to accept checks in payment of claims which they hold for collection is binding upon their customers, and has been considered a careful discharge of the duties of collecting agents. Farmers\u2019 Bank &amp; Trust Company of Stanford v. Newland, 97 Ky. 464, 31 S. W. 38, 17 Ky. Law Rep. 329; Kershaw v. Ladd, 34 Or. 375, 56 Pac. 402, 44 L. R. A. 236; Jefferson County Savings Bank v. Commercial National Bank, 98 Tenn. 337, 39 S. W. 338; Kirkham v. Bank of America, 165 N. Y. 132, 58 N. E. 753, 80 Am. St. Rep. 714. In this state, however, such a custom or usage among banks must either be known to the depositor, or be so general and common as to raise the presumption that he had it in mind at the time of the deposit for collection. Walls v. Bailey, 49 N. Y. 464, 10 Am. Rep. 407; Botany Worsted Works v. Wendt, 22 Misc. Rep. 156, 48 N. Y. Supp. 1024; Rickerson v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 149 N. Y. 307, 43 N. E. 856; Robertson v. National Steamship Company, Ltd., 139 N. Y. 416, 34 N. E. 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It was for the defendant, therefore, to establish in this case a custom to accept in payment of notes the acceptance thereof and the collection through the clearing house, and to prove, further, that it was of such age and character that the plaintiffs must be presumed to have acquiesced in it when they gave their note to the\" defendant for collection. The only witness called to prove this custom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>was an officer of the bank with whom one of the plaintiffs had had a serious dispute, and who was necessarily an interested witness. His testimony as to the usage did not state for how long a time such practice had been common. As the plaintiffs denied all knowledge of any such custom, a question was raised for the jury to determine as to the validity of this defense, and, having found for the plaintiffs, their verdict should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> But the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, in our opinion, upon another ground, and that is the entry in their deposit book of this note as a credit and the statement to one of them by the defendant\u2019s representative that it had been paid.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201cThe general rule is that credit given in a passbook binds the bank, and in the absence of some clerical mistake with respect to the entry, when the credit entry has been made, the bank has then charged itself, with a debt absolutely due to its customer.\u201d Kirkham v. Bank of America, supra.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The statement by Judge Gray in his opinion in that case is applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\u201cThe defendant must be deemed to have intended to treat the draft as paid, and that that intention was conclusively expressed when it entered the item as a credit to the plaintiff.\u201d &gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">See, also, Moore v. Riverside Bank, 25 Misc. Rep. 720, 55 N. Y. Supp. 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Even if the admission of the testimony of the witness Bedell as to the books of the Union Bank were error, it was harmless, as it sufficiently appears by the acceptance of the Union Bank that the Acme Column Company had sufficient funds on deposit to meet the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">ASPINALL and PUTNAM, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
