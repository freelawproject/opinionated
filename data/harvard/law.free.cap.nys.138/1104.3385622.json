Mallary v. Allen, <em>7 </em>Civ. Proc. R. 287. But here no such proof is given. The affidavit is fatally defective, and neither the fact that the court may think that plaintiff meant to say \u201cplaintiff,\u201d and not \u201cdefendant,\u201d nor the fact that Waite\u2019s Practice, 1912 edition, in giving the form of the affidavit, makes the same mistake, can supply the want of the allegation required by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-18\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
