The defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-21\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The accident occurred at about 4:15 a. m., before the sun was up, but at a time when objects were discernible for some little distance. It appears from the evidence that the street on which the plaintiff was driving was rough and difficult \u2022 to travel, and that he was making use of the defendant\u2019s tracks. Plaintiff testifies that he looked on coming upon the track where Sixtieth street crosses Fifth avenue; that he looked again at Sixty-Second street, and yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>again when he was between Sixty-Third and Sixty-Fourth streets; and that his wagon was struck just as he had nearly cleared the track near Sixty-Fifth street. He testifies that he had no warning of the approach of the car, and we are of the opinion that the case presented a question for the jury on the point of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> A witness called for the plaintiff testified that he was sitting near the front of the colliding car, the door being open, and that he saw, in an indistinct way, the plaintiff\u2019s wagon when it was 25 or 30 feet away, and that at some point between that time and the collision the defendant\u2019s motorman made use of all of the appliances to stop the car, but just when this was done he is unable to state; but there was evidence in the case to the effect that objects could be seen, without artificial light, at a distance of a block, and we think it was proper that the jury should determine whether the motorman had exercised the degree of care which the circumstances demanded. The plaintiff was near a street intersection, where the defendant owed the duty of having its car in reasonable control; and the situation was such as to make it peculiarly a matter to be determined by 12 men rather than the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> A witness, who was engaged in loading a baker\u2019s wagon at Sixty-Ninth street at the time of the accident, was asked how far he could see. This was objected to as incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, on the ground that it was not at the scene of the accident, and that the conditions were not shown to be the same, and the exceptions taken are now urged against the judgment. We are unable to discover prejudicial error. The witness was testifying as to the atmospheric conditions within four blocks of the accident, and this was certainly as competent and as relevant as the testimony of the weather bureau as to the conditions prevailing at 100 Broadway, Manhattan, where the observations were taken, and which were offered in behalf of the defendant. The rules of evidence must not be refined to a point where they cease to be practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> On the question of damages we are of the opinion that the evidence does not justify the verdict of $3,500. The plaintiff had his collar bone broken, not a serious injury, and sustained various lacerations and contusions about his head and body, which confined him to the hospital-from August 17th to September 12th, and which interfered with the performance of his work until October 24th, and at the time of the trial in April, 1912, he still complained of some slight difficulties which he attributed to his injuries, but there was no evidence of any permanent injury. He showed a loss of earning power of $16 or $17 per week for about 8 weeks, and if there were any other pecuniary losses they do not \"appear in the record, so far as we can discover. We are of opinion that $2,000 would be a liberal compensation for the damages proved in this case, and there is no justification for taking from the defendant more than the damages which the plaintiff has established.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>new trial granted, costs to abide the event, unless the plaintiff is willing to stipulate for a reduction of the verdict to $2,000, in which event the judgment, as modified, and the order, should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
