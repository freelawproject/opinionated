The motion is made upon the ground that at the time of the commencement of the action neither party resided in the county of New York, but both resided in the county of Kings. Defendant therefore asks that the change of venue be granted as a matter of strict right, not as a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It appears that the parties lived together as husband and wife in the county of Kings until September, 1912, when they separated. Thereafter this action was begun. Defendant swears that upon the separation plaintiff went to live with an aunt in the county of Kings, where \u201cas he is informed and believes\u201d she continues to reside. He does not give the information upo\u00f1 which his belief is founded. On the other hand, plaintiff swears positively that at the time of the commencement of the action she resided and ever since has resided at a given address in the county of New York. Of the two affidavits, the latter, being made positively, carries greater probative force than the former, made on information and belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Apart from this consideration, we are of opinion that defendant is not now in a position to demand a change of venue as matter of right. It appears that defendant did not, before making his motion, serve upon plaintiff or her attorney a written demand, as provided for in section 986, Code of Civil Procedure. The service of such a demand is, we think, a necessary prerequisite to a motion of this character, differing in this respect from motions under sections 982 and 983, wherein the place of trial of certain specified actions is fixed by law, and section 987, wherein the court is authorized, in its discretion,' to change the place of trial. The present motion is made under sections 984, 985, and 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">Section 984 provides that an action, not specified in sections 982 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>or 983, must be tried in a county in which one of- the parties resided at the commencement thereof. Section 985 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-3\">\u201cIf the county designated in the complaint as the place of trial is not the proper county, -the action may notwithstanding be tried therein; unless the place of trial is changed to the proper county upon demand of. the defendant, followed by the consent of the plaintiff or the order of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">How such a change can be compelled by a defendant is provided in section 986, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201cWhen the defendant demands that the action be tried in the proper county, his attorney must serve upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney with the answer or before service of the answer a written demand accordingly. The demand must specify the county where the defendant requires the action to be tried. If the plaintiff\u2019s attorney does not serve his written consent to the change as proposed by the defendant, within five days after the service of the demand, the defendant\u2019s attorney may within ten-days thereafter serve notice of a motion to change the place of trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">It would seem difficult to frame language which would more clearly constitute a demand and refusal a necessary prerequisite to a motion to change the place of trial, and in our opinion the language should be given its plain intent. We are aware that a different opinion was expressed in McConihe v. Palmer, <em>76 </em>Hun, 116, <em>27 </em>N. Y. Supp. 832, but the force of the opinion as a precedent is much weakened by the fact that the motion for a change of venue was also made and granted for the convenience of witnesses. That case has not been generally followed upon the question now under discussion, and has lately been criticised and questioned by the Appellate Division in the Second Department. Phillips v. Tietjen, 108 App. Div. 9, 95 N. Y. Supp. 469. We think that a written demand must precede a motion to change the place of trial as a matter of strict right under section 986, Code Civil Procedure, and that if a defendant fails to give such notice he must be deemed to have waived his right in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
