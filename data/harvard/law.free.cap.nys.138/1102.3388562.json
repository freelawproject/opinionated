Upon the trial of this action, plaintiff testified that on the 17th. day of August, 1908, he gave to Lorenzo Cianchetta, the sum of $400 to be deposited in Cianchetta\u2019s bank; that he gave this money to Cianchetta at plaintiff\u2019s house at Twenty-Third and Buttonwood streets, Philadelphia, Pa., and Cianchetta promised to send him a bank book; that towards the end of March, 1909, the plaintiff, who during that time had been living in Philadelphia, having been informed that Cianchetta\u2019s bank had closed, went to New York, where he found out that the bank had really closed, and plaintiff had never received any part of the $400. The defendant offered no evidence, but asked to go to the jury on all the issues in the case. This motion was denied, and an exception taken. The court then directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-15\">Plaintiff testified that one Cantelmi, who was in court, had been present when he deposited the money with the defendant\u2019s principal, Rapone; but plaintiff failed to call Cantelmi as a witness. Plaintiff also testified that, subsequent to making the deposit with Rapone, he had received a letter from him acknowledging the deposit, which letter he said was now with the Italian consul; but plaintiff failed to prodtuce said letter later during the trial, and did not account for his failure to do so. Where the uncorroborated testimony of an interested party is of such a character that inferences may be drawn, or circumstances exist, which may discredit his testimony, the issues of fact should be submitted to the jury. See Hull v. Littauer, 162 N. Y. 573, 57 N. E. 102; Kelly v. Burroughs, 102 N. Y. 93, 6 N E. 109. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>The learned trial court, therefore, erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to submit all the issues to the jury, and in directing a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
