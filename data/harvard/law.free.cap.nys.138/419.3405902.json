The fixtures had been purchased from Ringelheim, subject to a mortgage held by the plaintiffs, on which there was due $54.84. Subsequent to the purchase of the fixtures the defendant borrowed $100 from plaintiffs, $54.84 was applied in satisfaction of Ringelheim\u2019s mortgage, and the balance paid to defendant. As this was not \u201ca chattel mortgage made to secure the purchase price of chattels,\u201d section 139 of the Municipal Court Act did not apply. The learned justice below based his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>decision soley upon the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction of the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The mortgage was payable on demand. No demand for payment, which put defendant in default, was shown, although it might be inferred from some of the testimony that such a demand had been made. The plaintiffs, without foreclosure, took the chattels into their possession, and evidently disposed of them at private sale to a second-hand dealer for $30. This sum they credited upon the debt. Defendant was credited, also, with $10.50 for- merchandise sold to plaintiffs. They bring this action, not to recover the deficiency, because, there having been no foreclosure, the deficiency had not been ascertained. Where, however, the mortgagee, instead of foreclosing the mortgage, takes possession of the chattels pledged, the debt is thereby satisfied, providing the chattels be of sufficient value for the purpose. Case v. Boughton, 11 Wend. 106; Stoddard v. Denison, 38 How. Prac. 303; M. Groh\u2019s Sons v. Feldman, 40 Misc. Rep. 303, 304, 81 N. Y. Supp. 970. It will become necessary to ascertain the true value of the chattels. If it equals or exceeds the debt, the complaint will be dismissed. If it is less than the debt, the plaintiffs should have judgment for the balance. The evidence on this point being contradictory, there will have to be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
