The item of $52.37, amount of sales of April 22d, was properly excluded, as not being due at the time of the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Upon the trial the plaintiffs proved the sale and delivery of the articles comprising the account, and that an itemized statement thereof, showing the balance to be $186.44, had been shown to the defendant, who stated that .the account was correct, which statement was then offered and received in evidence, and at the close of the evidence the plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint to conform to the proof, to which defendant consented. The said statement of account was then again offered in evidence, received, and marked as an exhibit, without objection that it had not been pleaded. The defendant offered no evidence whatever. The referee awarded judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $47.61, the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, excluding the three items above referred to, and awarded costs to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">We think the referee erred in excluding the items of $10.50 and $77.50, and that upon the undisputed facts he should have included such two items in his award, and should have awarded judgment to the plaintiffs against the defendant for the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, less $52.37\u2014that is, for the sum of $134.07\u2014with interest from June 19, 1911, with costs, and that the judgment appealed from should be so modified, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs of appeal to plaintiffs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
