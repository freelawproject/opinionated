It was the necessity for obtaining the evidence from the plaintiff to establish said affirmative defense which authorized the making of the order for his examination before trial, affirmed in the opinion herein handed down this day. 138 N. Y. Supp.'878. To require defendant to furnish a bill of particulars in advance of obtaining the evidence necessary to make it seems incongruous. The two orders were made upon the same date, and should not be outstanding at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">This order is reversed, with leave to renew after the examination before trial of the plaintiff is completed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
