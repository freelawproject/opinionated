The vendee was to pay all taxes thereafter becoming a lien upon the property. The contract provided, among other things, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">\u201cFourth. That in case said party of the second part shall die while this agreement is in force, and before said premises are conveyed to him, said party of the first part shall, at its option, either return all- sums which have already been paid on account of this agreement, together with interest1 thereon, at the rate of six per cent, per annum, or convey the said premises without further consideration to Emma L. Grennell, wife, or to such1 other person as the party of the second part may from time to time appoint, with the written consent of the party of the first part, and if the person named and appointed as aforesaid be not alive, then to the heirs or devisees or to the personal representatives of the said party of the second part, provided, however:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">\u201cFirst. That said party of the second part has purchased direct from said party of the first part and not through assignment from any previous purchaser, is not over sixty years of age, is in good health at the time of purchase, and shall have furnished said party of the first part a certificate to that effect, signed by a physician approved by the party of the first part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">\u201cSecond. That the payments of said lot shall not at any time have been thirty days in arrears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">\u201cThird. That satisfactory proof of death of said party of the second part shall be furnished within thirty days thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-16\">\u201cFourth. That said party of the second part shall not have come to his death by his own hands, sane or insane. Any assignment of this agreement, failure to pay any payment hereinbefore provided to be paid within 30 days after the same becomes due and payable, or failure to provide the physician\u2019s certificate called for in paragraph \u2018First\u2019 of this clause, shall render this \u2018Fourth\u2019 clause null and void, and shall operate as though said clause had not been inserted in this agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-17\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The vendee performed all of the obligations upon his part to the time of his death on April 26, 1911, except that he did not furnish to the defendant the physician\u2019s certificate called for in the first par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>agraph of the fourth clause in the contract. He had paid when he died $1,192.86 of the purchase price of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The plaintiff, after filing proofs of death, demanded that the defendant pay the moneys her husband had paid, together with the interest thereon, to her, or convey the property to her without further payments. Upon defendant\u2019s failure to comply with either of these demands, this action was brought for the specific performance of the contract. This appeal is from a judgment in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">I think that the contract was divisible, and that the provision upon which the plaintiff relies never became operative because of the failure of the vendee to comply with its plain requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Two alternative features are presented: One, that the price of the land to the vendee, if living when entitled to the conveyance, was $2,-380; the other, that if he died before full performance, having complied with its requirements, including the furnishing of the certificate of an approved physician, the price was to be such sum as had been paid at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The right to the lesser price, or a return of the money paid, did not outlive nonperformance, and never became operative. The limitation of the payments to the life of the vendee was in abrogation of further performance by his widow, and the money to be gained could not be earned in any manner other than by complying with the conditions imposed by the contract. The contract was not one insuring payment to the respondent, but one providing a method which would enable her to own the land upon her husband\u2019s death, without further payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The payments of the monthly installments did not operate as a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 of subdivision 4, which did not become operative, and were not, by the express terms of the instrument, a part of the contract. There is no proof that the realty is not worth the contract price, and the defendant is ready and willing to convey to plaintiff upon receipt of the balance of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial granted. Costs, to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
