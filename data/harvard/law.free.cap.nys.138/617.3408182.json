Lefkowitz, 62 Misc. Rep. 490, 115 N. Y. Supp. 64, and the defendant acquiesces in this proposition. But the case of Maune v. Unity Press, 139 App. Div. 740, 124 N. Y. Supp. 504, settled the law that the court has power to direct such judgment. It is therefore necessary to decide whether the judgment was properly directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The complaint, which was verified, in the third paragraph alleges that the plaintiff, at the request of defendant, sold and delivered to defendant certain merchandise, of the reasonable value and at the agreed price of $271. \u2022 The verified answer denies knowledge or inforr mation sufficient to form a belief as to these allegations. The question is whether such an answer raises an issue. It has been held that, when a complaint alleges personal transactions with a defendant or matters of public record, such a denial is not permissible. City of New York v. Matthews, 180 N. Y. 41, 72 N. E. 629; Dahlstrom v. Gemunder, 198 N. Y. 449, 92 N. E. 106, 19 Ann. Cas. 771; Rochkind v. Perlman, 123 App. Div. 808, 108 N. Y. Supp. 224, 1151; Preston v. Cuneo, 140 App. Div. 144, 124 N. Y. Supp. 1031; Stone v. Auerbach, 133 App. Div. 75, 117 N. Y. Supp. 734; Borough Construction Company v. New York, 131 App. Div. 278, 115 N. Y. Supp. 697.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">\u201cAn allegation that the party has hot sufficient knowledge or information to form a belief with respect to a matter must, for the same purpose\u201d\u2014i. e., for all purposes, including a criminal prosecution\u2014\u201cbe regarded as an allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>tion that the person verifying the pleading has not such knowledge or information.\u201d Section 163, Municipal Court Act (Consol. Laws 1902, c. 580).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cWhere the party is a domestic corporation, the verification must be made by an officer thereof.\u201d Section 164, Municipal Court Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">It follows, therefore, that, whenever an officer of a corporation may deny knowledge or information, a corporation may so plead. The defendant here is a domestic corporation, and the answer was verified by its treasurer. The matters alleged in the complaint are not matters of public <em>record; </em>neither does it appear that they were personal transactions with the treasurer. For.all that appears, the treasurer may therefore truthfully verify such a pleading; and, if so, the defendant may so plead. The answer is therefore good.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and the order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
