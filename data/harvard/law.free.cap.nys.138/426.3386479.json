The plaintiff claims that it was entitled to this property under a chattel mortgage made to it by the judgment debtors. The chattel mortgage was on a printed form, and covered\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201call the bars, tables, chairs, glasses, glassware, and other goods and chattels mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed, and now in the premises known as No. 688 Melrose avenue, as well as any and all other goods, chattels, and fixtures which the parties of the first part may at any time hereafter purchase or acquire or become the owner of and place in the premises aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Annexed to the chattel mortgage is a schedule, denominated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">\u201cSchedule of property covered by the within mortgage and referred to therein, now on the premises known as No. 688 Melrose' avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">This schedule contains a list of bars, tables, chairs, fixtures, etc. The articles seized by the defendant consisted largely of glassware, which had been bought and was in the premises at the time the mortgage was made; but the schedule in no manner referred to this glassware. The trial justice, nevertheless, held that it was included in the chattel mortgage under the term \u201cglassware\u201d printed in the body of the instrument, and that the limitation of the words \u201cmentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed\u201d referred only to the words \"goods and chattels,\u201d immediately preceding the limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">This interpretation of the contract does not seem reasonable. See Broadhead v. Smith, 55 Hun, 499, 8 N. Y. Supp. 760. The contract and schedules, read together, clearly show that the general printed words in the contract were intended t\u00f3 be limited by the description in the schedule, and the goods seized, not being described in the schedule, did not pass under the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">Judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
