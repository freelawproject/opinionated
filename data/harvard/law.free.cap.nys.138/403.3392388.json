We are agreed that the judgment for $175 damages is correct, and should be affirmed; but we find no authority for the inclusion of $15 costs. The Municipal Court Act provides for the allowance of costs to the prevailing party \u201cif he shall have appeared by an attorney at law <em>who 'files a verified pleading or a zvritten notice of appearance.\u201d </em>While, in this case, the plaintiff appeared by attorney, the pleadings were oral, and the record shows no written appearance. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney claims in his brief that he submitted to the trial court a memorandum, upon which his name and office and post office address were indorsed, and that this constituted a written notice of appearance under rule 2, subd. \u201cd,\u201d of the rules of the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Aside from the fact that the parties are bound by the record on appeal, and the record contains no such papers, and no such papers can, therefore, be relied upon to show the court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant costs, I think his contention is without merit. The rule, providing merely that \u201cthe indorsement of the name and address of the attorney on the summons, pleading or any other paper in an action or proceeding shall be deemed an appearance within the meaning of section 332 of the Municipal Court Act,\u201d is merely an amplification or interpretation of that section, in so far as it describes what is required to constitute a \u201cwritten notice of appearance.\u201d It does not pretend, however, to go beyond this, and to increase the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court by dispensing with the \u201cfiling\u201d of such a notice as a prerequisite to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A memorandum handed to a judge, and not becoming part of the record of the case, cannot be said to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Judgment should therefore be modified, by striking out the allowance of $15 costs, and, as modified, affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
