The defendant appeals from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>interlocutory judgment that overrules its demurrer that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action^</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> I am of opinion that the demurrer was well pleaded. A libel is an injury to the person (section 3343, Code of Civil Procedure), and specifically to reputation. Blackstone, in his Commentaries (book 3, c. 8, subd. 5) writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201cSlander and Libel.\u2014Lastly injuries affecting a man\u2019s reputation or good name are first by malicious, scandalous, and slanderous words tending to his damage or derogation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Kent, in his Commentaries on the Rights of Persons (14th Ed., vol. 2, p. 16), writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cAs a part of the right of personal security, the preservation of every person's good name from the vile arts of detraction is justly included.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In Eyle v. Clason, 1 Caines, 581, 583, it is said per curiam (doubtless by Kent, J.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">\u201cThe basis of the action is damages for the injury to character in the \u25a0opinion of others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Lord Halsbury, in The Laws of England (vol. 18, p. 605), writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">\u201cThe actions of libel and slander are private legal remedies, the object of which is to repair the plaintiff for the private injury done to his right of reputation by the wrongful publication of defamatory statements concerning him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Odgers on Libel and Slander (3d Ed.) writes that in each case the \u25a0question will be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-14\">\u201cHave the defendant\u2019s words appreciably injured the plaintiff\u2019s reputation?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">In Moore v. Francis, 121 N. Y. 199, 23 N. E. 1127, 8 L. R. A. 214, 18 Am. St. Rep. 810, the court, per Andrews, J., say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-16\">\u201cThe first and larger class of actions are those brought for vindication of reputation, in its strict sense, against damaging and calumnious aspersions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">Mr. Odgers, in his Lectures delivered in Middle Temple Hall in 1896, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-18\">\u201cNext the words which are so written or printed or otherwise permanently recorded must be defamatory; that is, they must have injured the reputation \u2022of some one, must have made people think worse of him. I do not know that I can give you a better definition of a libel than that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-19\">See, too, Street\u2019s Foundations of Legal Liability, vol. 1, Torts, 274; Kent\u2019s Comm. (14th Ed.) pp. 16, 17 et seq.; Cooley on Torts (3d Ed.) p. 366; Merrill on Newspaper Libel, 148; Folkard\u2019s Starkie on Slander and Libel, p. 1; Broderick v. James, 3 Daly, 482, and \u25a0authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It follows that the words, to be actionable, must injure the reputation. Reputation is the general opinion of the community (Anderson\u2019s Law Dictionary); the common knowledge of the community (Gray, J., in Chellis v. Chapman, 125 N. Y. 214, 26 N. E. 308, 11 L. R. A. 784). In Words and Phrases Judicially Defined is is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-21\">\u201cReputation is a sort of right to enjoy the good opinion of others, and is as capable of growth, and has as real an existence, as an arm or leg. It is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>personal right, and an injury to reputation (as by a libel) is a personal injury, within the meaning of statutes providing that injuries to a person shall not abate. Johnson v. Bradstreet Co., 13 S. E. 250, 251, 87 Ga. 79.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Gray, J., writing for the court in Crashley v. Press Publishing Co., 179 N. Y. 27, 33, 71 N. E. 258, 259 (1 Ann. Cas. 196), says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cIf the article had imputed to the plaintiff the commission of that which is an heinous offense against organized society, and commonly lcnoWn to be recognized as such by civilized nations, if it charged him with some conduct, which reflected upon his character, in such wise as to expose him to contempt, ridicule, or disgrace, it would be libelous per se.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Mr. Odgers, in his work on Libel and Slander, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cAnd so, too, are all words which hold the plaintiff up to contempt, hatred, scorn, or ridicule, and which, by thus engendering an evil opinion of him in the minds of right-thinking men, tend to deprive him of friendly intercourse and society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">And further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">\u201cThe injury to the plaintiff\u2019s reputation is the gist of the action. He has to show that his character has suffered through the defendant\u2019s false assertions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Mr. Newell, in his Slander and Libel (43), says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">\u201cAnd so, too, are all words which hold the plaintiff up to contempt, hatred, scorn, or ridicule, and which, by thus engendering an evil opinion of him in the minds of right-thinking men, tend to deprive him of friendly intercourse and society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">In the Laws of England, by Lord Halsbury (vol. 18, p. 619), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\">\u201cA statement is defamatory, within the foregoing definitions, as being calculated to expose a person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule, if it tends to lower him in the opinion of men whose standard of opinion the court can properly recognize, or to induce them to entertain an ill opinion of him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">Mr. Townshend, in his Slander and Libel (4th Ed.), has an instructive and learned note upon the difficulties of definition of libel. Section 21, note 2. See, too, 25 Cyc. p. 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> A definition very generally approved, and also adopted by Kent in his Commentaries (14th Ed., vol. 2, p. 17), is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-17\">\u201cA malicious publication, expressed either in printing or writing, or by signs or pictures, tending either to injure the memory of one dead, or the reputation of one alive, and expose him to public hatred, contempt,, or ridicule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">He refers, among other cases, to Clark v. Binney, 2 Pick. (Mass.) 113, where the court said that a definition in these exact words, made by Parsons, C. J., in Commonwealth v. Clap, 4 Mass. 168, 3 Am. Dec. 212, \u201cis most clear and precise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-19\">But it is to be noted that this definition does not convey the idea that words of scorn or hatred or ridicule are libelous, for the primary idea is injury to reputation. The definition would hav\u00e9 stated the essentials if it had stopped with the words, \u201cinjure the * * * reputation of one alive,\u201d for the subsequent words, \u201cand expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule,\u201d are rather expressive as to the manner in which the reputation is injured than definitive of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>gist of the wrong. There are many instances of definitions which support this conclusion. Of these some are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-3\">\u201cFalse defamatory words, if written and published, constitute a libel.\u201d Odgers, page 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">\u201cLibel is a wrong occasioned by writing or effigy.\u201d Townshend, \u00a7 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cA defamatory publication, written and printed.\u201d State v. .Barnes, 32 Me. at page 533.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cThe malicious defamation of a-person, made public by any printing, writing, effigy, or pictorial representation.\u201d Quinn v. Prudential Ins. Co., 116 Iowa, 522, 90 N. W. 349.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">To the same effect, see Rice v. Simmons, 2 Har. (Del.) 309; Williams v. Karnes, 4 Humph. (Tenn.) <em>9; </em>O\u2019Brien v. Clement, 15 M. &amp; W. 435-437. Also adopted by Bouvier as a definition, q. v. Thus it seems to me that whether the words hold a person up to ridicule, or to scorn, or to contempt, yet such words must have injured the reputation before they are actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> I can find no argument to the contrary in the word \u201cridicule\u201d itself. As authoritatively defined, it conveys the idea of contempt and disparagement. See Century Dictionary, Webster\u2019s' Dictionary, and Worcester\u2019s Dictionary. And there can be no question that ridicule may affect injuriously a reputation. It is a rhetorical weapon'that has been employed with that effect in countless instances as divers as Elijah\u2019s treatment of the priests of Baal and the writings of Sydney Smith. The article in Triggs v. Sun Printing &amp; Pub. Ass\u2019n, 179 N. Y. 153, 71 N. E. 742, 66 L. R. A. 612, 103 Am. St. Rep. 841, 1 Ann. Cas. 326, is purely ridicule, yet the court, per Martin, J., say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">\u201cIt seems impossible for any fair-minded person to read the articles alleged in the complaint without reaching' the' conclusion that they were not only intended, but necessarily calculated, to injure the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and to expose him to public contempt, ridicule, or shame.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-10\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The question, then, whether this publication could be a libel per se, involves the inquiry whether it could have injured the reputation of the plaintiff. Here is a bare item of news m a newspaper. The item states that an event has come to pass which is looked for in the history of every man, is regarded as beyond his control, and therefore does not permit the inference that the man has done any act or suffered any act which he could not have done or which he need not have suffered. Prematurity is the sole peculiarity. How can the publication of such an event, merely as a matter of news, hold up the subject to scorn, to hatred, to contempt, or to ridicule, so that his reputation is impaired? Such publication may be unpleasant; it may annoy or irk the subject thereof; it may subject him to joke or to jest or to banter from those who knew him or knew of him, even to the extent of affecting his feelings; but this in itself is not enough. Samuels v. Evening Mail Association, 6 Hun, 5; Lombard v. Lennox, 155 Mass. 70, 28 N. E. 1125, 31 Am. St. Rep. 528; Duvivier v. French, 104 Fed. 278, 43 C. C. A. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> The question is, as we have seen, whether the publication\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">\u201ctends to lower him in the opinion of men whose standard of opinion the court can properly' recognize or to induce them to entertain am ill opinion of him.\u201d Lord Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, supra; Mawe v. Pigott, Ir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u00a1Rep. 4 C. L. 54, cited both by Lord Halsbury and in Folkard\u2019s Starkie on Slander and Libel, p. 234.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Newell on Slander and Libel, \u00a7 36, quotes Lord Wensleydale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cMental pain or anxiety the law cannot value, and does not pretend to redress, when the unlawful act complained of causes that alone; though where a material damage occurs, and is connected with it, it is impossible a jury, in estimating it, should altogether overlook the feelings of the party interested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">With more than formal respect for the learned court at Special Term, due to the learning, and ability of the justice who presided there, I think that this case is not analogous to the cited cases of the reduced gentlewoman in Moffatt v. Cauldwell, 3 Hun, 26, of the over-educated scholar (Martin v. Press Publishing Co., 93 App. Div. 531, 87 N. Y. Supp. 859), of the deserted woman (Kirman v. Sun Printing &amp; Pub. Ass\u2019n, 99 App. Div. 367, 91 N. Y. Supp. 193), of the man dubbed Jack Ketch (Cook v. Ward, 4 M. &amp; P. 99), or of the alleged suicide (Cady v. Brooklyn Union Publishing Co., 23 Misc. Rep. 409, 51 N. Y. Supp. 198); for in each of them there was not publication of a mere matter of news, but the incident was used, not alone to point a moral, but to adorn a tale, narrated in a sensational vein, and there was presented the feature well described by Barrett, J., in Moffatt v. Cauldwell, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">\u201cIt comes to this: That the question whether or no the matter is libelous, so as to be actionable, depends upon the style, scope, spirit, and motive of every such publication, taken in its entirety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">I do not read any of these judgments as announcing the proposition that' they can be a libel, without affecting injuriously the reputation of the subject of the words. The learned Special Term cites the language of Gray, J., in Morrison v. Smith, 177 N. Y. 366, 69 N. E. 725, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">\u201cThe principle upon which the rule of legal liability for damages rests is that no man possesses the right to lessen the comforts, or the enjoyment, of another^ and that, when he does so deliberately, wantonly, and maliciously, it is, prima facie, evidence of malice, and he is bound to make compensation for the mischief occasioned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">But the learned judge theretofore said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">\u201cAt common law, that which implied reproach, scandal, or ridicule to any \u2022 person, and reflected disgracefully upon his character, whether written or .printed, was a libel, and was actionable without proof of special damage. The language used is to be understood by judge and jury in the same manner as others understand it, and words are to be taken in that sense which would be naturally conveyed to persons of ordinary understanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">And thereafter said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-14\">\u201cTherefore, if by printing, or writing, bad actions, or vicious principles, are imputed to a man, and his respectability is diminished, his comfort and his enjoyment are lessened, by the attendant disgrace, contempt, or ridicule, and damage will be presumed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">And Gray, J., then concluded that the publication in question exposed the plaintiff \u201cto contempt and to ridicule,\u201d with these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-16\">\u201cNone of her friends and acquaintances could fail to understand that, in the plaintiff\u2019s life, there had been passages of such a. nature that only a wo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>man of unbalanced character and of foolish recknessness could have experienced, which made interesting reading, and which the advertiser could not print, but was publishing in typewritten form. This' was an outrage upon the reputation of a respectable woman.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In McBride v. Ellis, 9 Rich. (S. C.) 313, there was the publication in a newspaper of the obituary notice of a woman. The action was not against the newspaper, but against the individual who was charged with sending the notice to the newspaper, apparently signed by a citizen, and, moreover, in the communication the age of the woman (95) was \u201cgreatly exaggerated.\u201d The learned court <em>concluded </em>that such a notice was well calculated, under such circumstances, to subject one to ridicule, was intended and calculated to impair this lady in the enjoyment of society, and to throw a contempt on her which might affect her general comfort; and it also seemed to take into consideration that there was malice in fact shown. The learned court in the course of its opinion cites Villers v. Monsly, 2 Wils. 403, which related to the publication that the plaintiff was affected with the itch, which \u201ccut him off from society;\u201d Cook v. Ward, supra; Steele v. Southwick, 9 Johns. 214, when the court held that, if the words did not import perjury in a legal sense, they held him (i. e., the plaintiff) \u201cup to contempt and ridicule, as being so thoughtless, or so immoral, as to be regardless of the obligations becoming a witness\u201d; South-wick v. Stevens, 10 Johns. 443, when the plaintiff was held up as having become a lunatic, and subject to treatment as a maniac, although the statement was ironical; Lake v. King, 1 Saun. 120-131, which has no bearing save as a treatise; Bradley v. Methwyn, 2 Sel. N. P. \u201c1062, note 2,\u201d and Cropp v. Tilney, 3 Salk. 225, which dealt with \u201cRiding Skimmington.\u201d I am not inclined to regard the decision as a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">My conclusion is that the words are not libelous per se, and that, therefore, the interlocutory judgment must be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to plead over with,in 20 days. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
