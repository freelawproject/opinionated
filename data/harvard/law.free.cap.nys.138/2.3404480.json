The complaint sets up the usual action in partition, with alleged ownership of the fee in the plaintiff and the several defendants. The defendant Annie T. Pearsall denies ownership in the plaintiff and her codefendants, and alleges ownership in herself, and denies, that any party to the action, other than herself, has any interest therein. On the trial of the action upon these pleadings, without allegation of fraud, the plaintiff introduced in evidence a copy of a deed of the premises to the defendant, with nothing to indicate that the title thus vested in the defendant had ever been divested. Of course, with the absolute title in the defendant, the plaintiff has no standing in an action for partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-18\">One Charles Brown was originally the owner of a certain farm near Salt Point, in Dutchess county. He died, leaving a last will and testament, by the terms of which he conveyed this farm to Jane Ann Pearsall \u201cduring her natural life and no longer,\u201d and upon her death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the land was to \u201cgo to and be equally divided among all her .children, to them, their heirs and assigns, forever.\u201d It was provided that if any child died prior to the death of the mother, leaving lawful issue, such issue was to take the deceased parent\u2019s share. Jane Ann Pearsall and her husband took possession of this farm, and the husband purchased an adjoining tract of land. In 1872 Jane Ann Pearsall, with her husband, Gilbert T. Pearsall, and three of her children, then of age, conveyed the Salt Point farm and the husband\u2019s separate tract of land to one John Doty, in exchange for the premises sought to be partitioned and another tract of land at or near Clinton Corners. Subsequently the minor children of Jane Ann Pearsall, on becoming of age, confirmed the transfer of these properties to Doty. At the time of the transfer of the Salt Point properties, Doty deeded the store property (the premises sought to be partitioned) to Jane Ann Pearsall, while the second piece of property, consisting of 35 acres near the store, was conveyed to Mr. Pearsall, her husband; and the theory of the plaintiff, who was one of the minor children of Jane Ann Pearsall, who subsequently joined in granting the Salt Point land to Doty, is that the premises in suit were intended to take the place of the lands conveyed to Doty, and which, under the will, were to belong to the children of Jane Ann Pearsall upon her death. But the plaintiff in this action, along with all the others having any interest in the Salt Point property, have conveyed the premises to Doty, and Doty, for a good consideration, has conveyed the premises involved in this action to the defendant\u2019s mother,, Jane Ann Pearsall, who, in turn, deeded the same to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">There is no suggestion of fraud. There is some loose testimony which suggests that at the time of the transfer of the Salt Point property, or subsequently, it was understood that the store property was to take the place of the Salt Point property; but there is nothing in the deeds to indicate any such intention, and there was no effort upon the trial to amend the pleadings to conform to this proof, and the case as it is here presented shows all interest in the Salt Point premises out of the plaintiff, and all interest in the store property vested in the defendant, and there was nothing for the court to do but to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
