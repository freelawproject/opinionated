J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG7\">The- question presented is whether the defendants are entitled! to invoke section 483 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-9\">\u201cWhere the complaint sets forth two or more causes of action, the statement of the facts constituting each cause of action must be separate and numbered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-10\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The contention is that the pleader has set forth two causes of action, in the first seven paragraphs of his amended complaint. In Payne v. N. Y., S. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 201 N. Y. 436, 95 N. E. 19, the court, after comment that the Code does not define a single or separate cause of action, says that there is no more technical and scientific definition than that of Pomeroy in his Code Remedies, and quotes the language of that author as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-11\">\u201cIf the facts alleged show one primary right of the plaintiff, and one wrong done by the defendant which involves that right, -the plaintiff has stated but a single cause of action. * * * On the other hand, if the facts alleged in the pleading show that the plaintiff is possessed of two or more distinct and separate primary rights, each of which has been invaded, or that the defendant has committed two or more distinct and separate wrongs, it follows inevitably, from the foregoing principle, that the plaintiff has united two or more causes of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">Pomeroy further writes, in section 456:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-14\">\u201cIf the single primary right should be invaded by ,two distinct and separate legal wrongs, * * * two causes of action would result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">Application of these, criteria convinces me that the appellants\u2019 contention is right. The plaintiff complains of injury to his realty in that, in the construction of additional stairways, exits, and entrances to the railway system known familiarly as the subway, the defendants from May 1, 1910, until March 15, 1911, \u201ccaused to be erected, maintained, and operated\u201d upon the surface of the streets and on the sidewalk in front of and adjacent to plaintiff\u2019s premises structures, engines, steam boilers, toolsheds, workshops, derricks, fences, and buildings, and thereby and in the prosecution of construction worked injury to his property rights. And plaintiff complains that the defendants by the permanent erection and maintenance of such stairways, exits, and entrances have injured his premises and his rights appurtenant thereto. Thus I think there is pleaded two distinct and separate legal wrongs\u2014 one temporary and incident to the work of building the stairways, exits, and entrances, and the other permanent, in that the existence and maintenance of the stairways, exits, and entrances-is an injury to his property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>The respondent contends that all of the defendants are answerable for both torts, and that both torts arose out of one transaction\u2014i. e., the building and maintenance of these stairways\u2014but even so it does not follow that he has pleaded but one cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> There can be no objection to the joinder of such causes of action. Section 484, Code of Civil Procedure; 14 Encyclopedia of Pleading and Practice, 1115, citing Hodges v. Hodges, 5 Metc. (Mass.) 205; Aldrich v. Wetmore, 56 Minn. 20, 57 N. W. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion must be granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
