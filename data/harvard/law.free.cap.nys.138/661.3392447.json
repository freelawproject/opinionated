It was erroneous, however, to enter a judgment for costs in favor of the defendant Weil. The record shows that as to him the action was discontinued by consent on the trial. That eliminated him from the action, and thereafter no judgment could run either for or against him. If he desired costs against the plaintiff, to which he probably was entitled, he should have entered an order of discontinuance containing a provision for such costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">The judgment must be modified, by striking out so much thereof as awards costs to the defendant Weil against the plaintiff, and, as modified, affirmed, with costs to the respondents Cornell and Willets. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
