In lowering a piece of beef with the pole, the wheel is alleged to have fallen off the pole upon plaintiff, inflicting an injury. \u25a0 Even if the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the defendant\u2019s liability were maintainable in law, the de: cisi\u00f3n of the trial justice was against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> We are of the opinion, however, that the action cannot be sustained, either at common law or under the Employer\u2019s Liability Act (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 200-204). The alleged cause of the injury was this pole, which was dearly a simple appliance. The character and condition of the pole were known to the plaintiff, and the accident was obviously attributable solely to the angle at which the plaintiff held the appliance. The condition of the pole and the circumstances of its use would not have availed the plaintiff under a common-law form of action, nor was this pole either \u201cways, works, machinery, or plant,\u201d within the meaning of the Employer\u2019s Liability Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
