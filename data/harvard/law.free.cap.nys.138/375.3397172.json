A formal lease was prepared by the former owners and given to him unsigned. The next day he paid a deposit and received a receipt' reciting a five-year lease. The plaintiff purchased the property and received a deed reciting a five-year lease to the defendant, but now claims there can be -no such lease, as it is not in writing, signed by the party to be bound thereby. The plaintiff took title subject to all equities, as the tenant was in possession and the deed recited the supposed lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> That a court of equity would afford the defendant relief, and compel specific performance by requiring the plaintiff or his grantors to execute a lease, is quite certain. The defendant entered into possession and spent considerable money in permanent improvements. While sections 242 and 259 of the Real Property Law (Consol. Laws, c. 50) require leases and contracts for leases to be in writing, section 270 preserves to equity the power to require specific performance of agreements in case of part performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Municipal Courts have no equity jurisdiction, except in this one instance\u2014equitable defenses to dispossess proceedings.
