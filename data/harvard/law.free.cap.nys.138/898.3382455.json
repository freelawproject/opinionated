If the printed copy of the record so certified is not filed within the time hereinbefore specified the district attorney may move to dismiss the appeal upon four days\u2019 notice to the adverse party and such appeal shall be dismissed unless the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court shall for good cause shown by order extend the time for filing the printed papers so certified as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The time within which to file the papers upon which the appeal was to be heard expired on the 15th of December. The appellant has failed to file the printed record within the time fixed by the section of the Code above referred to, and no reasonable excuse is presented for failing to comply with the express requirement of the Code. The defendant obtained a certificate of reasonable doubt, and if for any reason he had been unable to have his case printed and filed within the time allowed he should have obtained an order extending his time. This court has repeatedly held that in a case in which a certificate of reasonable doubt is issued the provision of this section of the Code will be strictly enforced. Nothing in the affidavit submitted excuses the default. No facts are presented which would indicate that the papers could not have been printed in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The motion will therefore be granted, and the appeal dismissed, unless the defendant stipulates to vacate the certificate of reasonable doubt within 10 days from the entry of the order, and has the record printed and filed in this court, with the appellant\u2019s points, on or before the 21st day of January, 1913.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
