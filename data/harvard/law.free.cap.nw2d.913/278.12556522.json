We direct the Clerk to schedule oral argument on whether to grant the application or take other action. MCR 7.305(H)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The appellant shall file a supplemental brief within 42 days of the date of this order addressing whether the trial court abused its discretion by declining to grant a new trial on grounds of newly discovered evidence, and in particular, whether the trial court erred in concluding that the newly discovered evidence would not make a different result probable on retrial. In addition to the brief, the appellant shall electronically file an appendix conforming to MCR 7.312(D)(2). In the brief, citations to the record must provide the appendix page numbers as required by MCR 7.312(B)(1). The appellee shall file a supplemental brief within 21 days of being served with the appellant's brief. The appellee shall also electronically file an appendix, or in the alternative, stipulate to the use of the appendix filed by the appellant. A reply, if any, must be filed by the appellant within 14 days of being served with the appellee's brief. The parties\n   should not submit mere restatements of their application papers.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
