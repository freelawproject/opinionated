Lopez-Ramos also challenges\n   the admission of his translated statements on hearsay grounds. Because the district court did not err in its determination that the interpreter in this case acted as a \"language conduit\" and was not a declarant, and therefore no Confrontation Clause or hearsay issues exist, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2016, the state charged Lopez-Ramos with one count of first-degree CSC alleging that he engaged in sexual penetration with a minor under 13 years of age in April 2016. Lopez-Ramos is from Guatemala and he immigrated to the United States in 2016. His first language is Mam, Spanish is his second language, and he does not speak English fluently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2016, Nobles County child protection received a report expressing concern about a 12-year-old child due to \"hickeys\" on her neck. Child protection contacted police and Worthington Police Officer Daniel Brouillet began investigating. Brouillet spoke to the child's parents, who said that they suspected Lopez-Ramos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 10, Officer Brouillet located Lopez-Ramos, who agreed to give a statement to police. Police brought Lopez-Ramos to an interview room, and they recorded the entire interrogation on video. At the beginning of the interrogation, Brouillet telephoned a foreign-language interpretation service for a Spanish interpreter. The interpreter was placed on speaker phone, and he translated the officer's questions from English to Spanish and then translated Lopez-Ramos's statements back to the officer from Spanish to English.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the interrogation Lopez-Ramos admitted that he had sexual intercourse with the child in this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   OFFICER BROUILLET (OB): So a couple months ago, maybe a month ago, there was some talk between [the child's] dad ... and you about something that happened between you and [the child].

This is your time to explain your side of the story. LR/I: I got home from work. She got home from school. She started playing jokes, or you could say she started kidding me. Um, then I told her to stop making jokes or kidding me and then she ... told me to get into a little room and, um, after that well, I said I did not want to disturb anyone. After that I don't remember well what happened. I don't remember how things happened after that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   OB: Okay. Well, what happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   LR/I: We had intercourse with her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   OB: Okay. And how long ago was this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   LR/I: Just now about a month ago.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   OB: Okay. And how many times did you have intercourse with [the child]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   LR/I: Just that one time. Nothing else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   OB: Okay. Did you use a condom?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   LR/I: No. Why should I lie?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   OB: Okay. Did you, uh, did you ejaculate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Interpretation, then pause].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   OB: Did you come? Did semen come out of you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   LR/I: Yes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lopez-Ramos was arrested and charged. He pleaded not guilty and took his case to a jury trial. Before trial, Lopez-Ramos objected to the recording of his translated statement to police being played to the jury on Confrontation Clause and hearsay grounds because the interpreter was not present to testify. The prosecutor stated that the interpreter was probably at a call center and not in Nobles County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court ruled that Officer Brouillet's testimony regarding the translated statements and the video recording of Lopez-Ramos's interrogation were both admissible and did not present Confrontation Clause or hearsay issues. Relying on a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nazemian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1859537\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/948/522/#p527\">\n    948 F.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (9th Cir. 1991), the district court examined a set of factors to determine whether the interpreter's statements \"fairly should be considered the statement of the speaker.\" The district court concluded that the interpreter was a \"language conduit\" or an agent of Lopez-Ramos, and it treated the translated statements in English as Lopez-Ramos's own statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The video recording of Lopez-Ramos's interrogation was played for the jury and Officer Brouillet testified at trial that Lopez-Ramos told him that he (Lopez-Ramos) had \"intercourse\" with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The child testified at trial that Lopez-Ramos pulled down her pants and underwear and placed his penis inside of her vagina. She stated that she felt pain when his penis was inside her vagina. On several occasions when asked difficult questions about what had occurred, the child had no response and the prosecutor reframed or repeated the question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Lopez-Ramos testified and denied having any sexual contact with the child. He stated that he did not understand \"why [Officer Brouillet] was asking questions\" about the child. Lopez-Ramos said that he did not remember talking to Brouillet about an \"incident\" with the child or telling Brouillet that he had intercourse with the child because during the interrogation he was still intoxicated from a party the night before. He claimed that when he spoke to Brouillet he was \"not within [his] five senses\" and was \"being asked question[s] that [he] was not understanding.\" Lopez-Ramos also claimed that he did not fully understand the interpreter because his native language is Mam. He testified, \"In that video I had said that I had done things that I hadn't done.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On cross-examination, Lopez-Ramos admitted that he understood Brouillet's questions translated into Spanish regarding his date of birth, where he had lived, and his family and work history. When pressed on why he could successfully communicate on some topics but not on the topic of sexual contact with the child, Lopez-Ramos stated: \"I didn't know exactly what [Officer Brouillet] was talking about.... I had no idea why he was asking me those questions. He didn't explain it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In its closing argument, the state stressed that Lopez-Ramos's own words in his statement to police were the strongest evidence that sexual penetration occurred. On December 15, 2016, the jury found Lopez-Ramos guilty of first-degree CSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The district court sentenced Lopez-Ramos to 144 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Lopez-Ramos now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I. Was Lopez-Ramos's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him violated when the district court admitted into evidence his translated statements in a video recording of his interrogation and by way of Officer Brouillet's testimony, and when the interpreter was not available for cross-examination?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II. Did the district court abuse its discretion by admitting into evidence Lopez-Ramos's translated statements over his hearsay objection?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Lopez-Ramos argues that the district court deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him when it allowed his translated statements into evidence through a video recording and Officer Brouillet's testimony and the interpreter was not available for cross-examination. He also argues the interpreter's statements constitute inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Generally, appellate courts review a district court's evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Miles v.

But if the court determines that a statement may be fairly attributed directly to the original speaker, then the court would engage in the\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   analysis only with respect to that original speaker.

Likewise, here, the district court properly used the\n   <em>\n    Nazemian\n   </em>\n   factors to make a preliminary finding as to the identity of the declarant in order to determine whether the Confrontation Clause was implicated and whether the statements were Lopez-Ramos's admissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We are not persuaded that the nuanced nature of concept-to-concept language interpretation automatically turns an interpreter into a declarant. Criminal defendants frequently waive important rights and plead guilty via interpreters. In doing so, we presume that the interpreter's\n   words in English are those of the defendant, and we do not treat such statements as coming from an independent declarant or as questionable hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, an interpreter and their words do not fit into our normal definitions of \"declarant\" and \"statement.\" A \"declarant\" is simply a person \"who has made a statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   467 (9th ed. 2009); Minn. R. Evid. 801(b). A \"statement\" is a \"verbal assertion\" or \"nonverbal conduct intended as an assertion.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's 1539\n   </em>\n   ; Minn. R. Evid. 801(a). Interpreters, like the one here, speak in the first person. But, we do not treat the interpreter's words literally, as if they made a verbal assertion about themselves. Normally, on hearing the interpreter's English words, we assume the foreign-language speaker made the verbal assertion, not the interpreter. Additionally, when an interpreter is speaking in the first person, the truth of the matter asserted flows back to the original foreign-language speaker. The\n   <em>\n    Nazemian\n   </em>\n   factors allow a district court to examine on a case-by-case basis as to whether these assumptions prove true, and in some cases a district court may rightly find that an interpreter became a declarant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Therefore, when the state seeks to admit into evidence a criminal defendant's admissions made through an interpreter, upon a Confrontation Clause or hearsay objection a district court must determine as a preliminary matter whether the interpreter's translation can fairly be attributable to the defendant, or whether the interpreter is a separate declarant. The preponderance of the evidence standard applies and the state, as the proponent of the evidence, has the burden to establish the preliminary fact.\n   <em>\n    In re Source Code Evidentiary Hearings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068993\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/816/525/#p538\">\n    816 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   538 ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Broun ed., 7th ed. 2016) (\"As a general proposition, the proponent of the evidence has the burden of establishing the preliminary facts.\"). In making this determination, the district court should consider on a case-by-case basis: (1) which party supplied the interpreter, (2) whether the interpreter had any motive to mislead or distort, (3) the interpreter's qualifications and language skill, and (4) whether actions taken subsequent to the conversation were consistent with the statements as translated. This is not an exhaustive list and other factors may be relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Confrontation Clause is not applicable because Lopez-Ramos was the declarant of the translated statements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On application of the\n   <em>\n    Nazemian\n   </em>\n   factors to the record in this case, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in its preliminary finding of fact that the interpreter's translation should be viewed as Lopez-Ramos's statement, and therefore Lopez-Ramos was the sole declarant. Under the first factor, police supplied the interpreter through calling an interpreter service over the telephone. Police were able to choose the language but not the specific interpreter. Other courts applying this factor have ruled that the fact that the government supplied the interpreter is not dispositive, and this factor has a greater weight when the interpreter acts both as a translator and a law-enforcement officer.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Da Silva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1924935\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/725/828/#p831\">\n    725 F.2d at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (government employee could still act as interpreter and agent of defendant)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, while the police supplied the interpreter, there is no evidence here that the interpreter had any motive to mislead or distort. To the contrary, as an employee for the interpreter service, the interpreter had every motive to render an accurate translation for both the police and Lopez-Ramos so that police would continue to contract with his company. Third, the state did not provide evidence of the interpreter's qualifications, but the videotaped interrogation and the behavior of Lopez-Ramos during the interrogation is evidence that the interpreter was skilled. Lopez-Ramos successfully communicated with Officer Brouillet on topics concerning his date of birth, current and past residences, family and work history. During the interrogation Lopez-Ramos gave no indication that he had difficulty understanding the interpreter. While Lopez-Ramos testified at trial that he did not fully understand the interpreter, the recording contradicts this assertion. On the fourth factor, Lopez Ramos's statements that he did not use a condom and had ejaculated were consistent with his earlier statement, as translated, that he had \"intercourse\" with the child. Had there been a mistranslation of the word \"intercourse,\" Lopez-Ramos likely would have been confused by Brouillet's follow-up questions. Additionally, while Lopez-Ramos's first language is Mam, the video recording and trial transcript show that he had a sufficient mastery of Spanish to effectively communicate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Da Silva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1924935\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/725/828/#p831\">\n    725 F.2d at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that while defendant's first language was Portuguese, evidence showed defendant's mastery of Spanish, the interpretation language).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On balance, the district court did not clearly err in its finding that the interpreter's words in English can fairly be attributed to Lopez-Ramos. Because Lopez-Ramos is the declarant and his statements were entered into evidence as his own admissions, no Confrontation Clause violation exists, as a criminal defendant does not have the right to confront himself.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Lopez-Ramos's translated statements into evidence after the defense's objection on Confrontation Clause grounds because the Clause was not implicated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Because the admission of Lopez-Ramos's translated statements does not implicate the Confrontation Clause, we do not address whether the interpreter's statements were testimonial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Minn. R. Evid. 801(c).

Minn. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   We have already determined under the\n   <em>\n    Nazemian\n   </em>\n   factors that Lopez-Ramos was the declarant of the translated statements. The translated statements, admitted through the video recording of the interrogation and Officer Brouillet's testimony, were Lopez-Ramos's own statements and were offered into evidence as proof of the matter asserted-that Lopez-\n   Ramos had intercourse with the child. The state offered the statements against Lopez-Ramos as a party opponent. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statements into evidence because they were admissible under Minn. R.
