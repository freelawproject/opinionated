II, \u00a7 3.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In my judgment, this Court's remand to the Court of Appeals for plenary consideration is unwarranted because, if plaintiff does not possess standing, the proper course of action for this Court would be to remand to the trial court for entry of an order dismissing the action.\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

We accordingly ... remand these actions to the respective circuit courts for entry of orders dismissing plaintiffs' actions on the basis of lack of standing.\"). Indeed, as recently as last week, the United States Supreme Court observed, \"[i]n cases where a plaintiff fails to demonstrate Article III standing, [it] usually direct[s] the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Gill v.

I would address the issue of standing at this time without remanding to a lower court for further proceedings, particularly where upon remand that court will be bound by\n   <em>\n    LSEA\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Put simply, there is no more critical matter than a proper conception of standing for a judicial body determined to operate within its constitutional purview and in the responsible exercise of the Constitution's \"judicial power.\" US Const., art. III, \u00a7 2; Const. 1963, art. 6, \u00a7 1. Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal to address this issue.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
