At the conclusion of the divorce proceedings, the circuit court accepted Amy's valuation of the parties' residence at $574,340, which differed from Daniel's valuation of $611,000 due to a 6% discount that accounted for realtor fees. The circuit court also included Amy's student loans in the marital corpus. The student loans were incurred while Amy attended medical school before the parties were married. Further, the circuit court ordered Amy to make a cash-equalization payment to Daniel, but it allowed Amy to make the payment over time with an interest rate of 4%. Daniel was also awarded alimony upon the condition that he annually release his medical and counseling records to Amy. Finally, the circuit court denied Daniel's request for attorney fees. Daniel appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b6 2.] Daniel and Amy met while Amy was attending medical school in Iowa City, Iowa. Before that time, Daniel was working in Minneapolis after completing his Associate's Degree in Photographic Arts and Graphic Design. Daniel eventually moved in with Amy but had a hard time finding work in Iowa City. Daniel eventually found work in a restaurant. Daniel and Amy were married on June 5, 2004, after Amy's last year of medical school. Within a few weeks of being married, Daniel and Amy moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where they would stay for the next four years as Amy completed her residency program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 3.] During Amy's residency program, Daniel worked as a cook and a grocery-store stocker as he had a hard time finding a job in his field of study. Amy gave birth to twin boys during the third year of her residency program. After the birth of the twins, Daniel became a stay-at-home dad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 4.] In 2011, Amy accepted a job at Sanford in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, as an ob-gyn specialist. The family moved to Sioux Falls from Des Moines, Iowa, where Amy was previously working after completing her residency program. While in Sioux Falls, Amy gave birth to their third son on August 16, 2012. Daniel continued staying at home and caring for the children at the couple's new home in Sioux Falls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 5.] On January 26, 2015, Amy petitioned the circuit court for a temporary protection order after Daniel exhibited threatening behavior. The circuit court granted the temporary protection order. Daniel filed for divorce two days later, and Amy filed a counterclaim seeking the same. The court ordered Daniel to undergo a psychological evaluation, which resulted in a recommendation for psychotherapy and a dismissal of the temporary restraining order. However, Amy was granted a second temporary restraining order on October 20, 2015, after Daniel exhibited more threatening behavior. The circuit court concluded that Daniel's mental-health issues contributed to the failing marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 6.] Subsequently, Daniel and Amy's divorce trial was held November 8-9, 2016. At the conclusion of the trial, the circuit court made partial rulings from the bench. The circuit court issued a decree of divorce for Daniel and Amy based on irreconcilable differences. The court also divided property, awarded Daniel alimony, and set child support. On November 28, 2016, the circuit court issued a letter decision that\n   supplemented its bench ruling. On December 30, 2016, the circuit court entered its final judgment and decree of divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 7.] Under its rulings relevant to this appeal, the circuit court accepted Amy's valuation of the parties' home at $574,340. This valuation was determined by taking a 6% discount for realtor fees from Daniel's proposed valuation of $611,000. The circuit court also included Amy's student-loan debt into the marital corpus that she had incurred during medical school. After division of the property, the circuit court ordered Amy to pay a cash-equalization payment of $45,364 to Daniel. However, the circuit court allowed Amy the option to make the equalization payment over 48 months with 4% interest. The circuit court also awarded Daniel alimony on the condition that Daniel provide an annual release of his medical and counseling records to Amy. Daniel will receive decreasing alimony payments starting at $3,000 a month and ending at $1,000 a month over 14 years. Finally, the circuit court denied Daniel's request for attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    [\u00b6 8.] Daniel appeals, raising the following issues of alleged error:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    1.

Both parties' positions were presented to the court via \"court's joint exhibit 1.\" It is apparent from the record that the circuit court accepted the appraised value Daniel seeks, but deducted the 6% requested by Amy. The court in essence accepted the net value of the residence, rather than the market value Daniel proposed.

SDCL 19-19-503(d). Also, if a person's physical or mental health is at issue during a civil proceeding, a waiver of the privilege during trial or discovery must be \"narrow in scope, closely tailored to the time period or subject matter of the claim[,]\" and provide for an in-camera review by the court if proper objection is made. SDCL 19-2-3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    [\u00b6 30.] The waiver provisions above are limited to a waiver of the privilege during trial or discovery proceedings.

Thus, absent stipulation between the parties, the waiver provided by statute is no longer available once the case has concluded. Because the exceptions to a claim of privilege are inapplicable to this case, the circuit court was without authority to order\n    Daniel to sign a waiver at the conclusion of the proceedings, and the court abused its discretion in requiring Daniel to waive the privileges as a condition of receiving the alimony award. Should a motion for contempt or modification of the alimony award be filed in the future, the circuit court could then consider whether a waiver of the physician- or psychotherapist-patient privileges may be appropriate under the statute at that time.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vandyke v.

The circuit court based its valuation on taking a 6% discount for realtor fees from the market value of $611,000 that Daniel requested. Because Daniel waived the issue to challenge the reasonableness of the 6% discount, we affirm the circuit court's valuation. Additionally, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in including Amy's premarital-student loans in the marital estate because Daniel benefited in the property division by deferring payment on the loan to increase the value of other accounts and Amy was apportioned the student-loan debt in the final\n    property division. The circuit court abused its discretion in requiring Daniel to release his medical and counseling records as a condition of receiving alimony because the court lacked statutory authority to order Daniel to waive his physician- and psychotherapist-patient privileges at the conclusion of the case.

Amy produced no evidence of the standard rate for real-estate commissions in the area, yet the circuit court reduced the value of the home by nearly $36,000. While the court could freely \"accept[ ] the net value of the residence, rather than the market value Daniel proposed,\" Majority \u00b6 14, to do so without reference to any evidence constitutes clear error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    [\u00b6 40.] Although the majority contends that Daniel waived the issue on appeal for failure to object to the 6% deduction at trial, this mischaracterizes the proceedings. Daniel adamantly opposed any value less than $611,000. The dispute over the 6% deduction arose after Daniel attempted to introduce Exhibit 39, which indicated an appraised value of $644,000. Daniel argued that Exhibit 39 demonstrated that the home's value ranged between $611,000 and $644,000, contending that \"it wouldn't be just to reduce this to 574\" as a result. At the court's urging, Daniel agreed to instead offer Exhibit 1, which prompted the court to ask Amy whether she objected. Amy, apparently referencing the $611,000 figure, objected only \"to using the value without applying the\n    <em>\n     Abrams\n    </em>\n    ' case.\" From the colloquy, it is apparent that Daniel not only disagreed with the application of a deduction, but he also disagreed that reducing the value of the home by 6% from $611,000 would be reasonable. Thus, it cannot\n    be said that \"Daniel did not object to the value of the 6% deduction[.]\" Majority \u00b6 15. Although Daniel's counsel remarked that \"if they want to play these games about reducing it, then how about we use their own numbers at 644,\" the comment cannot sensibly be construed as an admission that the 6% deduction was reasonable. Even taken at face value, the statement only suggests that if the court did apply a 6% deduction, Daniel wanted the court to use the higher $644,000 figure-one for which he did not ask.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    [\u00b6 41.] Moreover, the majority does not make clear when Daniel should have objected and to what. The foregoing exchange occurred during\n    <em>\n     Daniel's\n    </em>\n    motion to introduce Exhibit 39. Amy did not move the court to apply a 6% deduction, and the court did not grant such a motion. How then could Daniel waive the issue on appeal? Further, even if Daniel did not object to the\n    <em>\n     application of Abrams\n    </em>\n    -which Amy ultimately requested with respect to Exhibit 1-our decision in\n    <em>\n     Abrams\n    </em>\n    conformed with the requirement that a valuation\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    be supported by evidence\n    <em>\n     presented to the court\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10594167\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/516/348/#p351\">\n     516 N.W.2d at 350\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, Amy offered none. The majority's suggestion that a 6% deduction is per se reasonable and thus does not need to be supported by the evidence, Majority \u00b6 15 n.3, contradicts this well-established rule, and the cases cited by the majority do not support the majority's position.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    [\u00b6 42.] Other courts have taken issue with the kind of routine deduction applied here to a home's value.

Indeed, neither Amy nor the circuit court offered any basis for applying a 6% deduction, and to hold as the majority does could subject property to an automatic discount even where doing so would be arbitrary.

Daniel even suggested during trial that the 6% sales commission should be taken from $644,000 rather than the $611,000 he proposed.
