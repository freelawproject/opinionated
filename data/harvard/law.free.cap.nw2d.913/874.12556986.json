Kitto violated the rules of professional conduct in connection with her representation of W.C. and C.C. The referee recommended that this court impose a 60-day suspension of Attorney Kitto's law license. We adopt the referee's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation regarding discipline. We impose the full costs in this matter, which total $1,310.32 as of April 17, 2018. We do not impose restitution, as the Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) has confirmed that Attorney Kitto has made full restitution to W.C. and C.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 2 Attorney Kitto was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 1972. She has no disciplinary history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 3 On September 27, 2017, the OLR filed a complaint against Attorney Kitto alleging five counts of professional misconduct arising out of her representation of W.C. and C.C. Attorney Kitto filed an answer by which she admitted all but one of the OLR's factual\n   allegations, affirmatively alleged certain additional facts, and admitted all five counts of misconduct. This court appointed William Eich to serve as the referee in the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 4 Attorney Kitto later entered into a stipulation by which she agreed that the referee could use the allegations of the complaint as a factual basis for the referee's determination of misconduct. The parties agreed to brief the issue of the appropriate level of discipline to be imposed for Attorney Kitto's misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 5 After receiving briefing on the issue of discipline, the referee filed a report recommending a 60-day suspension of Attorney Kitto's law license. In noting that the parties had stipulated that the OLR complaint provided an adequate factual basis for a misconduct determination, the referee implicitly incorporated by reference the undisputed allegations in the OLR's complaint and deemed them established. The facts before us are, then, as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 6 Starting in July 2013, Attorney Kitto represented W.C. and C.C. with regard to collection work on a land contract. The other party to the land contract made the land contract payments to W.C. and C.C. through Attorney Kitto's office. W.C. and C.C. agreed that Attorney Kitto would collect ten percent of the land contract payments for her fees, and would apply the remainder of the payments to real estate taxes, the mortgage on the property, and property insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 7 Attorney Kitto erred in her caretaking of W.C. and C.C.'s funds. She failed to hold in trust the land contract payments that she received on W.C. and C.C.'s behalf. She also converted approximately $10,000 of these payments to her personal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 8 Attorney Kitto made other trust fund-related violations. She deposited personal funds into\n   her client trust account, ostensibly for later use in paying her own personal debts. Attorney Kitto also disbursed funds from her trust account when there were insufficient funds in the account to cover the disbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 9 Based on the stipulated facts set forth above, Attorney Kitto conceded the following five counts of misconduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Count 1: By failing to promptly deliver funds, which she collected in connection with her representation of W.C. and C.C., to W.C. and C.C. or\n   to third parties for W.C. and C.C.'s benefit, Attorney Kitto violated former SCR 20:1.15(d)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and current SCR 20:1.15(e)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Count 2: By failing to hold in trust W.C. and C.C.'s funds that she collected in connection with\n   her representation of W.C. and C.C., Attorney Kitto violated SCR 20:1.15(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Count 3: By converting funds belonging to W.C. and C.C. for her own personal use, Attorney Kitto violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Count 4: By depositing and retaining funds belonging to her in her client trust account, Attorney Kitto violated former SCR 20:1.15(b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Count 5: By disbursing funds from her trust account without the funds being available for disbursement, Attorney Kitto violated SCR 20:1.15(f)(4)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 In its brief on sanctions to the referee, the OLR argued that a 60-day suspension is called for by certain of our prior cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Sarbacker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279780\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/377/484/\">\n    2017 WI 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279780\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/377/484/\">\n    377 Wis. 2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20N.W.2d%20373\">\n    901 N.W.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (lawyer with two previous private reprimands suspended for 60 days based on six counts of misconduct, including failing to hold garnishment funds belonging to clients in a trust account and misappropriating approximately $2,000 of those funds);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Lunde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279024\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/372/1/\">\n    2016 WI 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279024\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/372/1/\">\n    372 Wis. 2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279024\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/372/1/\">\n    886 N.W.2d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (lawyer with previous public reprimand suspended for 60 days based on five counts of misconduct, including failing to hold funds due to a beneficiary of a life insurance policy in a trust account, and maintaining a trust account balance that fell below the amount of funds received and to be held on behalf of the beneficiary);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Bartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258094\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/362/752/\">\n    2015 WI 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258094\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/362/752/\">\n    362 Wis. 2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258094\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/362/752/\">\n    864 N.W.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (lawyer with previous private reprimand suspended for 60 days based on five counts of misconduct, including failing to disburse settlement funds and failing to cooperate with an OLR investigation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 In her brief to the referee, Attorney Kitto requested a public reprimand. She emphasized that she had experienced health difficulties during the time period in question, and that she had relied on her former assistant to ensure that client funds were being properly handled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The referee recommended a 60-day suspension of Attorney Kitto's license in his report. The referee wrote that other cases involving analogous misconduct \"have had little trouble imposing a 60-day suspension, often ... noting that harsh sanctions should be expected to follow as a warning to other lawyers that this type of conduct cannot be tolerated.\" The referee characterized Attorney Kitto's misconduct as serious indeed: W.C. and C.C. were individual clients, and Attorney Kitto converted a significant sum\n   of their funds-over $10,000. The referee dismissed as factually unsupported Attorney Kitto's attempt to assign blame for her trust account-related problems to her former assistant. The referee also noted that, according to the OLR's brief on sanctions, it had taken Attorney Kitto's medical issues into account in formulating its recommendation for a 60-day suspension; thus, the referee did not assign additional weight to that factor. As mitigating factors, the referee noted that Attorney Kitto has not been previously disciplined; she has fully reimbursed W.C. and C.C.; and she cooperated with the OLR's investigation of the charges. Given these facts and the applicable precedent, the referee concluded that a 60-day suspension would be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Neither party appealed the referee's report, so this matter is submitted to the court for review pursuant to SCR 22.17(2). We review a referee's findings of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    2004 WI 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    269 Wis. 2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    675 N.W.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We find our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Sarbacker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279780\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/377/484/\">\n    377 Wis. 2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20N.W.2d%20373\">\n    901 N.W.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to be particularly instructive. Attorney Sarbacker's clients hired him to collect on a money judgment they had obtained against a tenant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. After Attorney Sarbacker arranged for the debtor's wages to be garnished, he\n   began receiving weekly garnishment checks on behalf of his clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. He deposited some of the checks, totaling $892.23, into his trust account, but then disbursed almost all of those funds to himself or his law office rather than to his clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. He deposited other checks, totaling $1,273.49, directly into his operating account rather than disbursing the funds to his clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Attorney Sarbacker committed other misdeeds: he represented the clients pursuant to an unwritten contingent fee agreement; he failed to timely cooperate with the OLR; and he faced one count of misconduct based on his plea of no contest to unrelated misdemeanor charges filed against him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. Focusing heavily on the conversion allegations, we imposed a 60-day suspension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15\n   <em>\n    Sarbacker\n   </em>\n   and this case are alike in important ways. Both Attorney Kitto and Attorney Sarbacker regularly received\n   funds on behalf of their clients, and they regularly mishandled the funds in similar fashion, failing to faithfully hold them in trust and misappropriating some portion of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 To be sure, the two cases are not exactly alike. Attorney Sarbacker had a disciplinary history (two private reprimands), whereas Attorney Kitto does not. Attorney Kitto converted a significantly larger amount of funds than did Attorney Sarbacker. Attorney Sarbacker committed certain forms of misconduct that Attorney Kitto did not, and vice versa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 In the end, however, we find the misconduct here to be sufficiently analogous to that in\n   <em>\n    Sarbacker\n   </em>\n   to justify the same suspension length: 60 days. This suspension length is also generally supported by other cases cited by the OLR to the referee.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proccedings Against Lunde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279024\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/372/1/\">\n    372 Wis. 2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279024\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/372/1/\">\n    886 N.W.2d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Bartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258094\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/362/752/\">\n    362 Wis. 2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258094\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/362/752/\">\n    864 N.W.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 We also deem it appropriate, as is our usual custom, to impose the full costs of this disciplinary proceeding on Attorney Kitto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 Finally, because Attorney Kitto has made full restitution to W.C. and C.C., the OLR does not seek restitution, and we do not impose it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20 IT IS ORDERED that Suzanne E.
