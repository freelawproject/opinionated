Because\n   the Battle Creek Code of Ordinances, \u00a7 842.06(c), does not provide plaintiff a private cause of action to enforce rental ordinances against defendant, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Between August 2011 and October 2014, plaintiff rented residential property in Battle Creek from defendant at a rate of $595 per month for a total of 39 months. During that time, defendant did not have a valid rental permit for the property as required by the Battle Creek Code of Ordinances. On October 23, 2014, plaintiff received an order to vacate the premises because there was no current, valid rental permit. Plaintiff vacated the property on October 31,\n   2014, and subsequently filed suit against defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Relevant to the present appeal, in the district court, plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to the return of all rent paid to defendant during his tenancy because, under \u00a7 842.06(c), defendant could not accept, retain, or recover rent without a current, valid rental permit. According to plaintiff, \u00a7 842.06(c) created a private cause of action allowing plaintiff to recoup rental payments made to defendant. The parties stipulated to the facts involved, and the district court ruled in defendant's favor with regard to plaintiff's claim to recoup rent under \u00a7 842.06(c), concluding that the ordinance did not grant a private cause of action to tenants to recover rent. Plaintiff appealed the district court's ruling in the circuit court, and the circuit court affirmed. Plaintiff now appeals by leave granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, the issue before us is whether \u00a7 842.06(c) creates a private cause of action that allows a tenant to demand the return of rent that was paid to a landlord during a period in which the landlord did not have a valid rental permit. Plaintiff emphasizes that, under \u00a7 842.06(c), defendant cannot accept, retain, or recover rent without a valid rental permit. To enforce this\n   prohibition, plaintiff contends that it must be inferred that there is a private right of action allowing plaintiff to demand the return of rent.

The stated purpose of regulating, permitting, and inspecting rental property as set forth in Chapter 842 is to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (a) Protect the health, safety, and welfare of persons affected by or subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (b) Ensure that rental unit owners, legal agents, and tenants are informed of and adhere to all applicable code provisions governing the use and maintenance of rental units.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (c) Establish standards for obtaining rental permits, inspection of rental units, and the issuance of certificates of compliance for rental units. [Section 842.02.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Notably, under \u00a7 842.04(a), \"no dwelling shall be rented by any person unless there is first issued a rental permit ....\" The burden is on the owner of the property to \"obtain a current, valid, rental permit.\" Section 842.04(b). Rental of a property without a permit results in several consequences for landlords and tenants. Specifically, \u00a7 842.06 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to all other remedies provided for in this chapter or by any other local ordinance, state statute, or federal law, the following shall apply when there is no rental permit as required:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (a) Order to vacate. Failure to have a current, valid, rental permit subjects the rental dwelling to being ordered vacated as provided in Section 842.12, until a valid rental permit is issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (b) Failure to vacate. In addition to any other remedy available to the City under law, including City ordinances, an owner, tenant, or other occupant who fails to vacate a\n   dwelling after having been given notice of an order to vacate under this chapter is subject to the penalties set forth at Section 842.99.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (c) Abatement of rent. Where there is no current, valid, rental permit for a dwelling, no rent shall be accepted, retained or recoverable by the owner or lessor of the premises for the period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff now claims that he has a private cause of action for the recoupment of rent because \u00a7 842.06(c) precludes an owner from accepting, retaining, or recovering rent in the absence of a current, valid rental permit. However, this section gives no express indication that a private cause of action exists for a tenant. Indeed, the word \"tenant\" does not appear at all in \u00a7 842.06(c). Instead, the provision only provides for a limitation on the rights and conduct of an \"owner or lessor.\" \"Given that the ordinance purports only to limit the rights of owners and lessors, doubt is immediately cast on plaintiff's contention that the ordinance creates a cause of action in [his] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Ballman v.

First, considering Chapter 842 as a whole, the rental permit requirements impose a public duty on landlords, not an obligation owed by a landlord to a tenant. See\n   <em>\n    Levendoski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1897993\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/375/225/#p228\">\n    375 Mich. at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20N.W.2d%20228\">\n    134 N.W.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Szkodzinski v.

More specifically, under \u00a7 842.04(b), it is certainly the owner's or lessor's obligation to obtain a rental permit. However, this permit requirement provides a public benefit that facilitates the inspection and policing of rental properties,\n   not only for the welfare of occupants of the properties, but also to confirm that the properties are not a nuisance, \u00a7 842.08(c)(2), and to ensure that there are no conditions on the properties posing a hazard to the general public, \u00a7 842.12. In short, the permit requirement benefits the public as a whole. And because the permit requirement is a public duty, it does not give rise to a private cause of action for a tenant. See\n   <em>\n    Levendoski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1897993\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/375/225/#p228\">\n    375 Mich. at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20N.W.2d%20228\">\n    134 N.W.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the rental permit requirement is not a common-law obligation; and, read as a whole, Chapter 842 provides for the administration and enforcement of this obligation by the city, meaning that a private cause of action cannot be inferred. See\n   <em>\n    Claire-Ann Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1559468\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/223/25/#p31\">\n    223 Mich.

As noted, under \u00a7 842.04(b), it is certainly the owner's or lessor's obligation to obtain a rental permit, and Chapter 842 provides for various penalties and sanctions if a landlord fails to obtain the necessary permit. However, Chapter 842 makes plain that it is not only the landlord who faces prohibitions and repercussions as a result of rental property regulations. Rather, one of the stated purposes of Chapter 842 is to \"[e]nsure that rental unit owners, legal agents,\n   <em>\n    and tenants\n   </em>\n   are informed of and adhere to all applicable code provisions governing the use and maintenance of rental units.\" Section 842.02(b) (emphasis added). As a corollary to a landlord's obligation to obtain a rental permit, a tenant is prohibited from renting an unpermitted rental dwelling. See \u00a7 842.04(a) (\"[N]o dwelling shall be rented by any person unless there is first issued a rental permit\n   ....\"). Further, both the landlord and the tenant are subject to repercussions under \u00a7 842.06, including orders to vacate the property as well as a possible civil infraction or misdemeanor conviction for failing to vacate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See \u00a7 842.06(a) and (b); \u00a7 842.99. In other words, Chapter 842 plainly contemplates action against the landlord as well as the tenant, and such enforcement action is clearly entrusted to the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Given that a tenant is subject to action by the city for the enforcement of Chapter 842, we find unpersuasive plaintiff's assertion that-without any express indication-it should be assumed that a tenant has a private cause of action under \u00a7 842.06(c). That is, read as a whole, Chapter 842 makes plain that tenants are not the enforcers of Chapter 842; rather, they are subject to Chapter 842, which is enforced by the city.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, recognizing\n   that a tenant is prohibited from renting property that lacks a rental permit, it would be absurd to conclude that \u00a7 842.06(c) was intended to\n   create a private cause of action that would allow a tenant to recoup rent paid for a period in which the tenant lived in the property in violation of \u00a7 842.04(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, reading Chapter 842 as a whole, we conclude that \u00a7 842.06(c) is subject to enforcement by the city.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, in the absence of an express indication that a tenant has a private cause of action against a landlord, we will not infer such a cause of action from \u00a7 842.06(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In sum, while a landlord is required to obtain a permit, this is a public duty, and any authority to seek redress for a landlord's failure to obtain a permit rests with the city.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, plaintiff does not have a\n   private cause of action against defendant, and the trial court properly granted summary disposition under MCR 2.116(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Markey, P.J., and Hoekstra and Royanye Krause, JJ., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     McMillan v.

We agree that Chapter 842, and \u00a7 842.06(c) in particular, is not a model of clarity. For example, it is unclear what the city should do with the funds recouped (i.e., whether the city may keep the funds or must return them to a tenant), whether \u00a7 842.06(c) applies to the entire period for which a permit is lacking or only \"the period\" after a notice to vacate is given under \u00a7 842.06, and whether the recouped rent is part of, or in addition to, the hefty fines applicable under \u00a7 842.99(e) for failing to obtain a permit. However, these issues are not before us, and we offer no opinions on the procedures available to the city under \u00a7 842.06(c). On appeal, plaintiff also asks us to determine whether the city has the authority to enact a private right of action for tenants against landlords for the recoupment of rent when the landlord failed to obtain a rental permit. Having determined that the city did not attempt to create such an ordinance, we need not determine whether the city had the authority to do so. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Bivens v.
