Further, we conclude that the governor is not a necessary party to this action. Accordingly, we grant Evers' and the Department of Public Instruction's motion to deny substitution of counsel and to disqualify the attorney general from appearing on behalf of respondents and deny the Department of Justice's cross-motion to strike the appearance by attorneys Ryan Nilsestuen and Benjamin R. Jones. We further decline to order that the governor be joined as a necessary party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 3 In this original action, petitioners seek a declaratory judgment that Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers (Evers) and the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) must comply with the REINS Act, 2017 Wis. Act 57. Generally, the REINS Act requires an agency proposing an administrative rule to submit the proposed rule to the \"department of administration, which shall make a determination as to whether the agency has the explicit authority to promulgate the rule as proposed in the statement of scope and shall report the statement of scope and its determination to the governor who, in his or her discretion, may approve or reject the statement of scope.\" 2017 Wis.

Stat. \u00a7 227.135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 4 The record reflects that, upon the filing of the original action petition, a dispute arose between DPI and the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding which entity would provide representation for Evers and DPI in this case. On the same day the original action petition was filed, DPI's in-house counsel initiated correspondence with DOJ regarding representation. DOJ indicated that it was of the position that the REINS Act applies to Evers and DPI. This position is contrary to that taken by Evers and DPI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 5 DPI in-house attorneys filed a notice of appearance with the court, and notified DOJ that they would not be referring this matter to DOJ for representation. DOJ responded by filing its own notice of appearance and substitution of counsel. Further, DOJ informed DPI attorneys that the governor had requested that DOJ take over representation of Evers and DPI. By letter, Evers notified the attorney general that he was terminating DOJ's representation.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-11\">\n    \u00b6 6 Evers and DPI filed a motion to deny substitution of counsel and to disqualify the attorney general from appearing on their behalf. In response, DOJ filed a cross-motion to strike the appearance by DPI's in-house counsel, Ryan Nilsestuen and Benjamin R. Jones. We address both of these motions in this order. Additionally, the court sua sponte raised the issue of whether the governor is a necessary party to this action and we also address that issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-12\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    \u00b6 7 We address first who will represent Evers and DPI in this action. Specifically, we examine whether Evers and DPI should be represented by counsel of their choice or by DOJ. Evers and DPI assert that they are entitled to be represented by their own counsel. Conversely, DOJ argues that it is to take over the representation of Evers and DPI and to determine Evers and DPI's litigation position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    \u00b6 8 This court is vested with authority by the Wisconsin Constitution.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Specifically, this court has \"superintending and administrative authority over all courts.\" Wis.

However, the \"necessities of justice\" require us to exercise our superintending authority here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Arneson v. Jezwinski\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11992213\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/206/217/#p225\">\n     206 Wis. 2d 217\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 225,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11992213\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/206/217/#p225\">\n     556 N.W.2d 721\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1996). We determine that our superintending authority over the courts and over the practice of law gives this court the power to resolve disputes regarding representation. Accordingly, on the facts of this case, we exercise our superintending authority to determine that Evers and DPI are entitled to counsel of their choice and are not required to be represented by DOJ.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    \u00b6 13 We reach this conclusion because we are concerned about the implications of DOJ's argument. First, accepting DOJ's argument would foist upon Evers and DPI an attorney they do not want (and have discharged), taking a position with which they do not agree. This could have ethical implications for DOJ attorneys.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Second, accepting DOJ's argument would give the attorney general breathtaking power. It would potentially make the attorney general a gatekeeper for legal positions taken by constitutional officers, such as the governor or justices of this court sued in their official capacity.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    DOJ's position would not allow a constitutional officer to take a litigation position contrary to the position of the attorney general. We decline to adopt this view.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    \u00b6 14 This case serves as a good example as to why DOJ's position cannot be accepted. On its merits, this suit is about the constitutional scope of the superintendent's power. The superintendent cannot protect such power without a lawyer to argue his position. DOJ has indicated that it will not argue the superintendent's position, but its own. Accepting DOJ's position would leave no way to determine the scope of the powers vested in a constitutional officer and would essentially leave the attorney general, and not this court, to decide the scope of the superintendent's constitutional authority.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    \u00b6 15 Thus, we grant Evers and DPI's motion to deny substitution of counsel and to disqualify the attorney general from appearing on behalf of respondents and deny DOJ's cross-motion to strike the appearance by attorneys Ryan Nilsestuen and Benjamin R. Jones.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00b6 16 We address next whether the governor must be joined as a necessary party to this action. The parties direct us to two possible statutory bases for our consideration. We examine each in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \u00b6 17 DOJ directs us to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20803.03\">\n     Wis. Stat. \u00a7 803.03\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1), which provides that a party\n    shall be joined if any of three criteria apply: (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties; (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest; or (3) the disposition of the action would leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his or her claimed interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \u00b6 18 None of the criteria set forth in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20808.03\">\n     Wis. Stat. \u00a7 808.03\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1) is fulfilled. First, complete relief can be afforded even in the governor's absence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 803.03(1)(a). In examining this prong of the statute, we look to the requested relief for guidance. This is a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that Evers and DPI must comply with the REINS Act. Although the governor does have a role to play in the promulgation of rules pursuant to the REINS Act, a declaration would have the same effect on him whether he participates as a party or not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b6 19 The REINS Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20227.135\">\n     Wis. Stat. \u00a7 227.135\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2), sets forth a task for both the Department of Administration and the governor. Pursuant to \u00a7 227.135(2), an agency seeking to promulgate a rule \"shall present the statement [of scope] to the department of administration, which shall make a determination as to whether the agency has the explicit authority to promulgate the rule as proposed in the statement of scope and shall report the statement of scope and its determination to the governor who, in his or her discretion, may approve or reject the statement of scope.\" Similarly, \u00a7 227.185 provides a responsibility for the governor: \"After a proposed rule is in final draft form, the agency shall submit the proposed rule to the governor for approval. The governor, in his or her discretion, may approve or reject the proposed rule.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    \u00b6 20 This case raises the question of whether DPI must submit a scope statement to the governor in the first instance. It does not raise the question of what the governor does with a scope statement if submitted. A declaration in this case will not affect the governor's responsibilities under the REINS Act. The governor will still review a scope statement if he receives one whatever the outcome of this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    \u00b6 21 Second, not participating as a named party in this case will not as a practical matter impair or impede the governor's ability to protect his interest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20803.03\">\n     Wis.

On one issue before us, the court correctly applies statutory law and concludes that the Governor is not a necessary party; I therefore concur in that part of the court's order. On the second issue, the majority ignores governing statutory law and instead invokes its ever-evolving \"superintending authority\" to substitute the majority's preference for that of the legislature. The majority's conclusion that the Superintendent of Public Instruction, Tony Evers, may select his own lawyer to represent him in an action in which he has been sued in his official capacity is grounded not in the rule of law but in a judicial policy predilection. The Wisconsin Constitution and the applicable statutes unmistakably require the Department of Justice to represent Evers.

The petitioners ask this court to declare 2017 Wis.

Subsequent communications between DPI's attorneys and DOJ revealed a deep rift between them on the underlying issue. Evers and DPI contended the petition was frivolous and Act 57 was unconstitutional based on this court's recent decision in\n    <em>\n     Coyne v.

The DOJ and the Attorney General, on the other hand, maintained that they would advocate for the \"State's\" position in support of Act 57's constitutionality. Further communications showcased that because of this fundamental difference of opinion as to Act 57's constitutionality, DPI and DOJ were at odds as to who actually represented the DPI and Evers in his official capacity as Superintendent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    \u00b6 30 On November 22, Attorney Nilsestuen hand-delivered a letter to this court, informing it that he and Attorney Benjamin R.

The DOJ replied to that email, attaching a copy of a notice of appearance and substitution of counsel, which stated that the Attorney General, by Solicitor General Misha Tseytlin and Chief Deputy Solicitor General Ryan Walsh, was replacing Attorney Nilsestuen as counsel for Evers in his official capacity as superintendent and the Attorney General, by Assistant Attorney General Maura F.J. Whelan, was also replacing him as counsel for DPI.

Superintending authority, as the majority acknowledges, means supervisory power. The text of the constitution limits this court's superintending authority to \"the courts.\" Superintending authority has no place in this original action, in which the court illogically exercises its authority to ostensibly supervise itself.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    \u00b6 43 The majority creates a dangerous precedent. It brandishes its superintending authority like a veto over laws it does not wish to apply. In doing so, it thwarts the will of the people. \"To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.\" The Federalist No. 78,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b61, at 469 (Alexander Hamilton). Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 165.25 could not be clearer in mandating DOJ representation of DPI and Evers in this case, yet the court does not apply it. The majority's decision promotes the interests of an elected public official and the department he heads over those of the people of Wisconsin, whose interests are supposed to be represented in this litigation by the attorneys charged with advancing them-the Attorney General and DOJ. Long ago, the people of Wisconsin gave the Attorney General the duty-and the exclusive authority-to appear for the people in order to \"protect and guard the interests and rights of the people\" in litigation involving state actors.\n    <em>\n     Orton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8709279\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis/12/509/#p567\">\n     12 Wis. at 569\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The majority claims that if DOJ represents these parties, the court would have \"no way to determine the scope of the powers vested in a constitutional officer\" and somehow, the court fears, \"the attorney general, and not this court\" would \"decide the scope of the superintendent's constitutional authority.\" Nonsense. The Attorney General's power is of course restricted to advocacy; it is this court's duty to say what the law is, and the court alone possesses the power to decide. \"No aspect of the judicial power is more fundamental than the judiciary's exclusive responsibility to exercise judgment in cases and controversies arising under the law.\"\n    <em>\n     Gabler v.

This is true regardless of who represents a party. If the majority's concern is ensuring a full adversarial presentation of the issues, it should exercise a power it actually does possess and appoint counsel selected by Evers and DPI as amicus to advance arguments that Act 57 is unconstitutional while DOJ defends the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    \u00b6 45 Rather than take this lawful course, the majority inexplicably invokes its inherent power to appoint counsel for a party that lacks one. But this power is utterly misplaced in this case. The Superintendent and DPI do not lack counsel-their hand-picked attorneys made an appearance and continue as counsel of record-and the majority does not actually appoint counsel at all. Instead, the majority strikes the appearance of the Attorney General on behalf of these state parties, which the law\n    requires be represented by DOJ, and then disqualifies the Attorney General from representing the Superintendent or DPI. The majority characterizes this as an \"exceptional case.\" Indeed, it is exceptional for the majority's shocking exercise of raw power to arrogate unto itself the authority to decide who shall represent a party when the legislature has already spoken. The people of Wisconsin decided that the Attorney General shall represent their interests in litigation involving state parties but the majority instead foists upon the people lawyers they do not want-lawyers who will not represent their interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \u00b6 46 The majority identifies perceived ethical conflicts if the Attorney General represents Evers, but its concerns are unwarranted. No ethical conflicts exist. As the nominal party without any constitutional or statutory litigation authority, Evers lacks power to advocate independently for what he wants the law to be. His sole interest with respect to Act 57 or any other law is a determination of what the law says so that he can fulfill his responsibility to follow it. The people of Wisconsin did not assign the Superintendent the task of deciding what the law is. The constitution ascribes that duty to the judicial branch.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tetra Tech EC, Inc. v.

The problem with Evers' complaint is that the legislature has already decided that Evers' individual standpoint when sued in his official capacity is irrelevant. Evers has not been sued personally; he was named only in his official capacity as the head of DPI.

Why would a department head who does not ask for DOJ representation be able to control the Attorney General's litigation position but a department head who does seek DOJ representation cannot? A consistent reading of these statutes suggests the express grant of settlement authority is unnecessary in sub. (1m) because the legislature or Governor requested the representation on behalf of the official or department. In contrast, under sub. (6)(a), the department head requests DOJ representation; therefore, it is important to emphasize that despite the department head's initiation of the representation, the Attorney General must nevertheless act in \"the best interest of the state\" rather than take litigation instructions from the department head.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    \u00b6 50 When an agency and an official acting in his official capacity are sued, and the Governor asks DOJ to provide representation, DOJ is in charge of litigation strategy because the\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    is the real party in interest, not the nominal figurehead. The Attorney General represents the interests of the State-which, it bears emphasizing, means the interests of the people. The Attorney General is not Evers' private, personal lawyer as in a typical lawyer-client relationship. Wisconsin's Rules of Professional Conduct recognize the difference: \"[T]he responsibilities of government lawyers may include authority concerning legal matters that ordinarily reposes in the client in private client-lawyer relationships.\" SCR 20 Preamble: A Lawyer's Responsibilities, n.18.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    Rather, the representation relationship here is based on a provision of statutory law, namely\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20165.25\">\n     Wis.

The majority permits Evers to exercise unbridled, independent litigation authority in his own interests rather than the interests of the people of Wisconsin.

This order does not address the constitutional authority of superintendent of public instruction.\" Unfortunately, the majority's order ignores not only the constitution, but also the statutes requiring DOJ to represent the Superintendent and DPI in this matter, instead subordinating Wisconsin law to its whim. The point of examining the constitution is to determine whether it confers independent litigation authority on the Superintendent. It does not. The constitution provides that the legislature prescribes the Superintendent's powers. The legislature has not included appointment of counsel among the Superintendent's powers. What the legislature has done, which the majority defies, is enact a law mandating that DOJ represent the Superintendent and DPI in this suit. While I consult the law in determining whether the Superintendent and DPI may choose their own lawyer, the majority aggressively extends its superintending authority to override controlling law and approve counsel to advance the interests of the Superintendent instead of the interests of the people of Wisconsin.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-91\">\n     The Attorney General is also a constitutional officer, recognized in Article VI, Section 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution : \"The powers, duties and compensation of the ... attorney general shall be prescribed by law.\" Under the constitution, \"the attorney general's powers are prescribed only by statutory law.\"\n     <em>\n      State v.
