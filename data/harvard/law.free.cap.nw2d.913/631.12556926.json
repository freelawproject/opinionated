(dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I respectfully dissent from this Court's order denying leave to appeal. The decision by the Court of Claims to issue this preliminary injunction is a matter of considerable significance for the constitutional architecture of this state. As explained further below, preliminary injunctions constitute an extraordinary remedy that must be granted only with extreme circumspection, and the effect of this preliminary injunction is that a single judge of the Court of Claims has summarily halted the implementation of a duly adopted legislative enactment of the two representative branches of Michigan's government. These circumstances warrant close consideration; a preliminary injunction should only be granted when the party seeking the injunction satisfies the high burden of establishing the necessary requirements to obtain this relief. In my judgment, plaintiffs did not do so here and the Court of Claims abused its discretion in holding otherwise. Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Court of Claims issuing this preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit in the Court of Claims challenging the constitutionality of MCL 388.1752b (\u00a7 152b), which allocates funds to provide reimbursement for \"actual costs incurred by nonpublic schools in complying with a health, safety, or welfare requirement mandated by a law or administrative rule of this state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argued that the disbursement of funds under \u00a7 152b would violate Const. 1963, art. 8, \u00a7 2, which prohibits public funds from being appropriated or paid \"directly or indirectly to aid or maintain\" a nonpublic\n   school. Plaintiffs further argued that \u00a7 152b constituted an appropriation of public money for private purposes without a two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature, in violation of Const. 1963, art. 4, \u00a7 30. During the suit, plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the disbursement of funds under \u00a7 152b, and the Court of Claims granted this request. Defendants then filed an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, which denied the application for leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This Court reviews a trial court's grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Detroit Fire Fighters Ass'n, IAFF Local 344 v.

However, on appeal, plaintiffs fail altogether to recognize the amendment of \u00a7 152b that provides that the unexpended funds from 2016-2017 are carried forward into 2017-2018, which dissipates the need for a preliminary injunction on plaintiffs' \"lost claims\" grounds. Moreover, even assuming an alleged unconstitutional disbursement of funds in the event of a theoretical loss of their cause of action, plaintiffs again have failed to demonstrate how\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   specifically would be harmed.

After acknowledging that providing the state grant monies to a church-affiliated preschool would not offend the Establishment Clause,\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   held that under the Free Exercise Clause a state could not deny an otherwise available public benefit on the basis of religious status.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 2019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This holding mirrors the conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Traverse City Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   that the Establishment Clause did not prohibit the state from providing general health and safety measures to nonpublic schools and that the Free Exercise Clause required the Court to reject the interpretation of Proposal C that prohibited the state from providing auxiliary services to private school students. See\n   <em>\n    Traverse City Sch.

As reflected in both of these cases, the Establishment Clause is not the only relevant constitutional provision; rather, the Free Exercise Clause is also highly relevant. In the words of\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   , \"there is 'play in the joints' between what the Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause compels.\"\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 2019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). When confronted with arguments that \"auxiliary\" aid was unconstitutional, both this Court and the United States Supreme Court held not only that such aid did not run afoul of the Establishment Clause but also that the Free Exercise Clause was implicated by an application that would deny aid on the basis of religious status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   effectively reinforces the insights and conclusions of\n   <em>\n    Traverse City Sch.

A lower court does not have the authority to strike down or disregard \"precedent from this Court that has not been clearly overruled by the Court or superseded by subsequent legislation or constitutional amendment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Associated Builders &amp; Contractors v.

Simply put, the Court of Claims was bound to follow\n   <em>\n    Traverse City Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of Const. 1963, art. 8, \u00a7 2, and, in my judgment, did not do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Fifth\n   </em>\n   , the above problems are compounded in considering the effect of the decision by the Court of Claims, which inappropriately exercises the judicial power at the expense of the legislative and executive powers. Given that a preliminary injunction requires a likelihood of success on the merits, issuing the instant injunction\n   <em>\n    presumes\n   </em>\n   the unconstitutionality of a law and temporarily nullifies that law-one enacted in concord by the legislative and executive branches-by postponing its implementation until after it has passed judicial muster. That is not the way our constitutional system operates. Once again, it typically is a matter of considerable constitutional consequence when a single judge delays the implementation of a legislative measure approved by 148 legislators and one governor, each acting on behalf of \"we the people.\" That is not to say that a preliminary injunction may never delay the implementation of a law, but only that such relief may only be granted after careful consideration of the necessary requirements for a preliminary injunction, the presumption of constitutionality afforded to our statutes, and this Court's precedents. Ultimately, plaintiffs in these circumstances have a high burden to which they must be held in order to avoid trivializing the extraordinary nature of injunctive relief and our separation of powers. Const. 1963, art. 3, \u00a7 2. Plaintiffs here utterly failed to meet these high burdens, yet defendants have now been enjoined, at least temporarily, from having \u00a7 152b take effect.

In doing so, the Court of Claims failed to give deference to the presumption of constitutionality afforded to \u00a7 152b and this Court's precedents and it improperly enhanced the role of the judiciary within our constitutional process at the expense of the roles of legislative and executive authorities. For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Clement, J., did not participate due to her prior involvement as chief legal counsel for the Governor.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    MCL 388.1752b(1).

That is, they have failed to make\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    showing of harm, much less a \"particularized showing of irreparable harm\" to the interests of any\n    <em>\n     party before the court\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    This already unconvincing argument is diminished even further when taking into account that, as explained below, this is a cause of action in which plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits; therefore, under this basis, their alleged \"irreparable harm\" is the loss of a cause of action for which they failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    MCL 388.1752b(1).
