Stat. \u00a7 624.713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1(2) (Supp. 2015), with count 1 alleging possession in furtherance of gang activity, with reference to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.229\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 3(a) (2014). Both charges related to conduct alleged to have occurred on or between March 7, 2016, and May 4, 2016. On February 15, 2017, appellant pleaded guilty to both counts in a \"straight plea\" to the district court. The presumptive disposition was a commitment for 72 months, of which 60 months was the statutory-minimum sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.11\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 5(b) (Supp. 2015), for the underlying firearm-possession conviction, with an additional 12 months added for possession in furtherance of gang-related activity under Minn. Sent. Guidelines 2.G.10 (Supp. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.229\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 4(a) (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During his plea hearing, appellant admitted that he possessed a pistol in Hennepin County on or about March 7, 2016, so that he could benefit or further the efforts of a criminal gang, and that he understood at the time that he was prohibited from possessing firearms. The district court accepted appellant's plea and found him guilty on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At sentencing, appellant's attorney argued for a downward dispositional departure to probation because appellant accepted responsibility by pleading guilty and because appellant's letter to the district court demonstrated maturity, understanding, regret, and a hope to better himself in the future. Appellant's attorney also characterized these offenses as less serious than a typical gun-possession offense and noted that appellant has had a difficult past, but has supportive family members and friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The state argued for an executed 72-month sentence, arguing that there were not substantial and compelling reasons to depart and that appellant is not amenable to probation. To support its position, the state emphasized appellant's lengthy criminal history, past failure on probation, continued association with known gang members, and self-appointment as a leader of gang rivalry. The state noted its expectation that count 2 would \"merge\" and that appellant would only be sentenced on count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court noted that it reviewed the presentence investigation, which recommended the 72-month executed sentence; a series of letters from appellant's friends and family members; and appellant's letter. The district court also heard statements from appellant, his mother, and his sister. The district court said that it could not find that appellant was particularly amenable to probation because he had not been successful on probation in the past. The district court concluded that there were not substantial and compelling circumstances to place appellant on probation, thereby denying appellant's request for a downward dispositional departure. The district court sentenced appellant to 72 months on count 1 and stated that \"[c]ount 2 will merge with count 1.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The warrant of commitment filed by the district court reflected convictions on both counts, indicated the 72-month sentence for count 1, and indicated that the sentence for count 2 was \"combined with count 1.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Appellant argues that this court must remand to the district court to vacate his conviction on count 2. The state argues that, although the conviction on count 2 must be vacated, the district court's finding of guilt based on appellant's guilty plea must remain intact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In response, appellant asserts that he pleaded guilty only to count 1, and not to count 2, so there is no underlying finding of guilt to preserve. This claim is not supported by the record. As a \"straight plea,\" appellant's guilty plea was to both counts, and the record shows that he pleaded \"guilty\" to both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Appellant is entitled to have his conviction on count 2, illegal possession of a firearm, vacated; but he is not entitled to\n   have the underlying finding of guilt vacated. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to vacate the formal adjudication on count 2, but not the finding of guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The district court considered evidence of factors that could have supported a departure if they had been substantial or compelling, but concluded that a departure was not warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
