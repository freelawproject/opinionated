Leunguen-Koundjo argues the district court erred by ordering the eviction because there was insufficient evidence to find he violated material terms of the lease and RAD Development-Main Street, LLC did not follow the proper eviction procedure. The district court did not clearly err in finding Leunguen-Koundjo violated material terms of the lease and ordering the eviction. We summarily affirm the judgment under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Gerald W. VandeWalle, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Jon J.
