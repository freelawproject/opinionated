We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bandemer, a Minnesota resident, sustained a brain injury in Minnesota while riding in the front passenger seat of a 1994 Ford Crown Victoria (the Crown Victoria) in January 2015. The Crown Victoria was registered in Minnesota. Co-defendant Eric Hanson, who was driving the Crown Victoria at the time of the accident, rear-ended a snow plow. The Crown Victoria went into a ditch, and the front passenger airbag failed to deploy. Bandemer's injury was treated in Minnesota. Bandemer sued Ford in Todd County, claiming the Crown Victoria was defectively designed, manufactured, and marketed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ford moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Bandemer alleges that Ford's defectively designed, manufactured, and marketed car caused his injury. In Minnesota, marketing that specifically targets Minnesota residents and is related to the cause of action can satisfy the third factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rilley v.

The Minnesota Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating that \"[a]lthough at this early stage of the litigation there is no evidence that the Google Ads actually\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   any of the claims, the Google Ads are sufficiently\n   <em>\n    related\n   </em>\n   to the claims of respondents to survive a motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6783935\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/884/321/#p337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6783935\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/884/321/#p337\">\n    at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ford's marketing activities were designed to promote sales of Ford's vehicles to Minnesota consumers. The Crown Victoria is one of Ford's vehicles and was one of many products that Ford tried to promote through its marketing campaign in Minnesota. Bandemer's injury was caused by a Crown Victoria sold to a Minnesota resident. Moreover, Bandemer alleged that Ford's marketing included safety assurances and that Ford collected vehicle data from Minnesota drivers in its Minnesota service centers, which housed its design-development process. As in\n   <em>\n    Rilley\n   </em>\n   , Bandemer has made a prima facie showing that Ford's marketing activities are sufficiently related to the cause of action to survive Ford's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, Ford argues that, under the United States Supreme Court's recent decisions in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.

Because Bandemer's allegations and supporting evidence are taken as true during the pretrial stage, he has successfully made a prima facie showing that the district court had personal jurisdiction over Ford. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Ford's motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court did not err in denying Ford's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Bandemer is a Minnesota resident who sustained an injury in Minnesota while riding in the passenger seat of a Minnesota-registered Ford vehicle and who subsequently received medical treatment for his injury in Minnesota. Ford purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of Minnesota law because it initiated contacts with Minnesota and actively sought out business through marketing in the state. As such, it should\n   have reasonably anticipated being haled into court in Minnesota, and we therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The parties stipulated that Minnesota did not have general personal jurisdiction over Ford.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Ford also sponsors many athletic, racing, and educational teams and events in Minnesota. For example, Ford licensed its 1966 Ford Mustang to be built as a model car for the Minnesota Vikings. And Ford sponsored events such as the 2016 \"Ford Experience Tour\" and the \"Ford Driving Skills for Life Free National Teen Driver Training Camp\" in Minnesota.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Because we affirm on the ground of specific personal jurisdiction, we need not decide whether Minnesota has consent-based jurisdiction over Ford.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
