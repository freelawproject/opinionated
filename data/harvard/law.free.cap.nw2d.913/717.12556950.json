We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 4, 2016, a Hastings police officer arrested appellant Jeremy Clarin for an offense unrelated to this appeal. Prior to putting appellant in the back seat of his squad car, the officer pat-frisked appellant and thoroughly searched the squad car. The officer then put appellant in the back seat of his squad car and transported him to the Dakota County jail. After the officer removed appellant from his squad car upon arrival, he noticed a small clear plastic bag containing a white powdery substance on the floor of the back seat near\n   where appellant's feet had been. The officer suspected that it was a controlled substance, and field testing confirmed that the substance contained methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 6, 2016, respondent State of Minnesota charged appellant with second-degree controlled-substance crime in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.022\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2(a)(1). During appellant's jury trial, the state presented testimonial evidence from the arresting officer and an employee of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) Science Laboratory. The BCA employee testified that the substance contained methamphetamine and weighed 23.084 grams. The state also presented photographs that the arresting officer took of the baggie of methamphetamine on the floor in the back seat of the squad car. The defense did not present any evidence or call any witnesses. The jury found appellant guilty, and the district court sentenced appellant to 98 months in prison. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Must the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant unlawfully possessed methamphetamine?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Did the state produce sufficient evidence that appellant unlawfully possessed methamphetamine?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant argues that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his possession of methamphetamine was unlawful and, as a result, that we must reverse his conviction of second-degree controlled-substance crime because the state failed to produce sufficient evidence to meet its burden. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant's possession of methamphetamine was unlawful.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant first argues that the state is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant's possession of methamphetamine was unlawful. The state contends that, as a matter of law, possession of methamphetamine is always unlawful and is implicit in the crime itself. We agree with appellant's assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim involves the question of whether the defendant's conduct meets the statutory definition of an offense, we are presented with a question of statutory interpretation that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the evidence presented requires an inferential step to determine the legality of appellant's possession, we evaluate the sufficiency of the state's circumstantial evidence using a two-step analysis.\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, the arresting officer thoroughly searched his squad car prior to placing appellant in the back seat. Second,\n   upon arrival at the jail, the officer opened the back seat door of his squad car and observed a clear plastic baggie of a white powdery substance near appellant's feet, which had not previously been there. Third, the state corroborated the officer's testimony with a photograph of the drugs on the floor of the squad car's back seat that the officer took upon discovering the drugs. And fourth, the arresting officer pat-frisked appellant prior to putting him in the back of the squad car. And during the search, he did not feel the baggie of methamphetamine on appellant's person. These circumstances support the jury's finding of guilt because it is a rational inference that appellant hid the methamphetamine on his person in a secure location to avoid detection during the pat-search and then attempted to ditch the methamphetamine in the back of the squad car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although possession of methamphetamine is legal with a valid prescription,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.11\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1(e) (2014), requires pharmacists to \"distinctly label the container in which [the] controlled substance is dispensed with the directions contained in the prescription for the use of that controlled substance.\" A jury could rationally conclude that appellant's possession was unlawful based on the inference that, had the methamphetamine been lawfully prescribed, it would have been in a labeled container with appellant's name on it, and in capsule or tablet form, rather than a white powder in an unlabeled clear plastic baggie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellant does not offer any alternative inferences for this court to analyze. Therefore, that ends our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Given that we \"defer to the fact-finder's rejection of evidence in the record that conflicts with the evidence proved by the state[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856821\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/868/206/#p223\">\n    868 N.W.2d at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and construe any conflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n   <em>\n    Silvernail\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7061634\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/831/594/#p599\">\n    831 N.W.2d at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the state presented sufficient evidence to support appellant's conviction.
