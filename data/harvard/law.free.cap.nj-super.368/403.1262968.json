Wahoos is a not-for-profit corporation organized to train swimmers at various competitive levels. Plaintiff, a member of Wahoos, and his wife Iris filed a complaint for damages<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and defendant, in its answer, asserted immunity under the Charitable Immunity Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 to -11. Following discovery, defendant moved for summary judgment. The motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>judge denied the application, concluding that defendant was not organized exclusively for educational purposes and received little revenue from contributions, gifts, grants or donations. We granted leave to appeal and now reverse. We conclude that defendant is entitled to immunity and remand to the Law Division for entry of an order dismissing plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">These are the facts presented to the motion judge. Wahoos is incorporated in New Jersey under the New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>15A:1-1 to 16.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wahoos\u2019 certificate of incorporation states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">SECOND: The purpose for which this corporation is formed is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">To provide, construct, develop, acquire, lease, own, operate, and maintain a club and facilities and equipment for the promotion of amateur swimming and diving and any and all kinds of water sports, for the benefit of the members and of their guests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">To promote, arrange and hold any and all kinds of amateur athletic contests, exhibitions and competitions, and to contribute towards and provide for the awarding of prizes and trophies therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">To raise funds by membership subscription or otherwise for the encouragement of amateur athletic sports, and to grant commensurate rights and privileges to members and subscribers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">To acquire, own, buy, sell, lease, mortgage or otherwise manage and deal in and with real property suitable for the above stated purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">Notwithstanding any other provisions of these articles the corporation is organized exclusively for one or more of the following purposes: religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or international amateur sports competition (but only if no part of its activities involve the provision of athletic facilities or equipment), or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, as specified in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not carry on any activities not permitted to be carried on by a corporation exempt for Federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Wahoos claims tax exemption under 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, which exempts \u201c[c]ivic leagues or organi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>zations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare ... and the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes.\u201d 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>501(c)(4)(A). Although Wahoos identified (c)(4) as the section under which it was applying for recognition of exemption, it then completed Schedule D, for organizations claiming exemption under section (c)(7), which exempts \u201c[c]lubs organized for pleasure, recreation, and other nonprofitable purposes, substantially all of the activities of which are for such purposes.\u201d 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>501(c)(7). However, Wahoos has consistently identified section (c)(4) as its organization type for purposes of income tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Since its inception, Wahoos \u201cha[s] attempted to provide a comprehensive program of training for all levels of competition.\u201d According to Wahoos\u2019 brochure, Wahoos was formed to \u201ckeep a competitive swimming program in the area.\u201d Wahoos\u2019 \u201cprimary exempt purpose\u201d is to \u201cpromote and teach swimming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Wahoos maintains two types of membership \u2014 general and swim team. In 2000, Wahoos had 100 general members and 300 swim team family members. Wahoos is also \u201ca member of United States Swimming ... [and] Middle Atlantic Swimming which encompasses Delaware, Southern New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania,\u201d and is one of approximately 200 similar clubs that maintain competitive swimming programs including the Burlington YMCA, a team at Fort Dix and a team at the Gloucester County Institute of Technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The facility itself consists of a twenty-five yard indoor swimming pool, a second pool for lessons, a Universal weight room, office areas, a lobby and locker rooms. Although plaintiff suggested that the facility was similar to a near-by swim club or commercial gym,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at oral argument, defendant represented that the facility is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>as described and does not contain any of the facilities usually found in a swim club such as lounge chairs or other amenities.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">On defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge found that \u201cunder the facts of this case, at best, Jersey Wahoos is a nonprofit organization organized partially ... for educational purposes and partially as ... a limited gym where people can go and lift weights and swim and do whatever else is available there for them to do.\u201d The judge noted that Wahoos\u2019 total income<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> exceeded a million dollars in 1999, and that Wahoos is a 501(c)(4) corporation with member fees set, but \u201creceives very, very little, if any, money from contributions, gifts, grants, donations.\u201d The judge found that the facts presented do not invoke \u201c[t]he dominant theme of the [Charitable Immunity] Act,\u201d which the judge explained is \u201cto protect funds that are contributed through the generosity of the contributors or donators of money, to protect those funds.\u201d The judge then denied defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, finding that \u201cthe Act does not apply and that [plaintiff] is not a beneficiary of that charitable aspect of this organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Following the judge\u2019s denial, the Supreme Court decided <em>Ryan v. Holy Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>333, 815 A.2d 419 (2003), in which the Court distinguished between entities with an educational or religious purpose, and those with a charitable purpose. Based on <em>Ryan, </em>defendant unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration. We then granted defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>We commence our analysis with a review of the statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7(a) of the Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">No nonprofit corporation, society or association organized exclusively for religious, charitable or educational purposes ... shall, except as is hereinafter set forth, be liable to respond in damages to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of any agent or servant of such corporation, society or association, where such person is a beneficiary, to whatever degree, of the works of such nonprofit corporation, society or association; provided, however, that such immunity shall not extend to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of such corporation, society, or association or of its agents or servants where such person is one unconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefactions of such corporation, society or association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7(a) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u201cCharitable immunity is an affirmative defense, as to which, like all affirmative defenses, defendants bear the burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>Abdallah v. Occupational Ctr. of Hudson County, Inc., </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 288, 798 A.2d 131 (App.Div.2002). \u201c[A]n entity qualifies for charitable immunity when it \u2018(1) was formed for non-profit purposes; (2) is organized exclusively for religious, charitable or educational purposes; and (3) was promoting such objectives and purposes at the time of the injury to plaintiff who was then a beneficiary of the charitable works.\u2019\u201d <em>Bieker v. Community House of Moorestown, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>167, 175, 777 A.2d 37 (2001) (citing <em>Hamel v. State, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 72, 728 A.2d 264 (App.Div.1999)). Defendant is undisputedly a non-profit organization and contends that it also met the second and third prongs to qualify for charitable immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Where no material issue of fact exists as to \u201cwhether defendant had been organized for exclusively educational purposes and whether plaintiff was a beneficiary of defendant\u2019s works,\u201d the questions become \u201cpurely a matter of law to be decided by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Pomeroy v. Little League Baseball, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 473, 362 A.2d 39 (App.Div.1976). The judge\u2019s legal conclusions are not accorded any special deference. <em>Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Tp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Recently, the Supreme Court distinguished entities organized exclusively for an educational or religious purpose, described as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201csubject matter\u201d specific, and those organized exclusively for a charitable purpose, described as \u201ca generic catchall term.\u201d <em>Ryan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 343, 815 A.2d 419. The Court explained: \u201c[ejntities that can prove they are organized exclusively for educational or religious purposes automatically satisfy the second prong of the charitable immunity standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 815 A.2d 419. That is, \u201cno further financial analysis is required to satisfy the second prong of the Act.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Here, the judge focused on the lack of funding \u201cfrom contributions, gifts, grants, [and] donations.\u201d Such consideration is irrelevant under <em>Ryan. </em>When defendant raised this argument, the judge posited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">So, anybody \u2014 any corporation can set itself up in \u2014 in its certificate it says, we are organized exclusively for education. Then they go about and do whatever they feel like doing. But as long as they say that, and a member is hurt, the member can\u2019t sue because the member is a beneficiary of that \u2014 of that charitable purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The judge\u2019s hypothetical assumes that a certificate of incorporation, by itself, will establish the purpose of an organization. To the contrary, the <em>Ryan </em>Court, in finding that the organization in question \u201cfitf] the profile of an entity organized exclusively to provide educational opportunities,\u201d looked to the organization\u2019s declared purpose in its bylaws and \u201cits operation, which includes lectures, discussions, and the general exchange of information.\u201d <em>Ryan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 347, 815 A.2d 419. The focus on funding sources while perhaps relevant to charitable purposes is of less relevance to organizations such as Wahoos that are organized for educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">When determining whether Wahoos established that it was organized exclusively for educational purposes, we have recognized that non-profit organizations are granted \u201csubstantial latitude in determining the appropriate avenues for achieving their objectives.\u201d <em>Bloom v. Seton Hall Univ., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 491, 704 A.2d 1334 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>405, 709 A.2d 798 <em>(1998). </em>\u201c[T]he term \u2018educational ... [is] not limited to purely scholastic activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 704 A.2d 1334. While an entity claiming immunity cannot assert merely \u201cthat \u2018life\u2019 is [the] edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>cational experience,\u201d <em>Kirby v. Columbian Institute, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 210, 243 A.2d 853 (Cty.Ct.1968), \u201ceducational\u201d has been broadly defined to include birth and childrearing instruction to interested and prospective parents, <em>Ryan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 349, 815 A.2d 419; \u201cthe education of young people in the ideals of good sportsmanship, honesty, loyalty, courage and reverence ... through the teaching and supervision of baseball skills,\u201d <em>Pomeroy, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 474, 362 A.2d 39; an aquarium, <em>Morales v. New Jersey Acad. of Aquatic Sciences, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50, 54, 694 A.2d 600 (App.Div.1997); a chamber symphony, <em>Lax v. Princeton Univ., </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>568, 571, 779 A.2d 449 (App.Div.2001); and a religious camp offering daily craft and game activities, <em>Rupp v. Brookdale Baptist Church, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 465, 577 A.2d 188 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Additionally, \u201ca non-profit corporation may be organized for \u2018exclusively educational purposes\u2019 even though it provides an educational experience which is \u2018recreational\u2019 in nature.\u201d <em>Morales, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54, 694 A.2d 600 (citing <em>Pomeroy, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 474, 362 A.2d 39). <em>See also Stoolman v. Camden County Council Boy Scouts of Am., </em>77 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 135, 185 A.2d 436 (Law Div.1962) (finding \u201ceducational\u201d to be a generic term that could include and overlap with \u201crecreational\u201d). Such a liberal reading is consistent with the statute. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-10 (mandating that the \u201cact ... be liberally construed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">That defendant\u2019s organization aims to teach its members swimming and aquatic skills does not preclude a finding that defendant\u2019s exclusive organizational purpose is educational. Wahoos\u2019 Team Handbook states: \u201cIt is the goal of Jersey Wahoos to continue to promote competitive swimming in South Jersey at all levels of competition.\u201d Wahoos\u2019 sole purpose since its inception is averred as providing \u201ca competitive swimming program for as many young athletes as possible.\u201d In fact, plaintiff admitted that Wahoos\u2019 \u201cnet earnings are devoted to educational purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Plaintiff unfairly identifies Wahoos as being simply a \u201cswim club.\u201d In this respect, physical education and athletics, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>school teams, are an identified part of a school\u2019s curriculum. <em>E.g. Stack v. Boonton Bd. of Educ., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 126, 488 A.2d 1032 (App.Div.1985) (recognizing that the Department of Education \u201cpolicy considers scholastics and athletics as integrated parts of the school curriculum\u201d); <em>National Org. for Women v. Little League Baseball, Inc., </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 531, 318 A.2d 33 (App.Div.1974) (noting \u201cthe educational nature of competitive athletics\u201d and citing <em>Brenden v. Independent School Dist. 742, </em>477 F.2d 1292, 1298 (8th Cir.1973)), <em>aff'd, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>320, 338 A.2d 198 (1974); <em>Thompson v. Board of Educ., </em>12 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 96, 79 A.2d 100 (Cty.Ct.1951) (finding that \u201c[t]he organization of school athletic teams at public schools generally has been considered to be an integral part of physical education\u201d). We have interpreted the term \u201ceducational\u201d purpose broadly and do so here. Wahoos has not deviated from its stated purpose and does advance the teaching of swimming and aquatic skills. The judge incorrectly concluded that Wahoos was not organized exclusively for educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Defendant argues that plaintiff was a beneficiary of Wahoos\u2019 work as his injury occurred while Wahoos was pursuing its educational purposes. Plaintiff counters that plaintiff, a general member of Wahoos, \u201cwas the beneficiary of defendant\u2019s \u2018largess\u2019 but not of its works.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">To be \u201ca beneficiary of defendant\u2019s works,\u201d defendant need only show \u201cthat at the time plaintiff was injured defendant was engaged in the performance of the charitable objectives it was organized to advance.\u201d <em>Pomeroy, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 475, 362 A.2d 39 (citations omitted). Such a finding will be made where the particular activity \u201cbear[s] a \u2018substantial and direct relationship\u2019 to the [entity]\u2019s \u2018general purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Loder v. St. Thomas Greek Orthodox Church, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>297, 303, 685 A.2d 20 (App.Div.1996). <em>See Rupp, supra, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 464-65, 577 A.2d 188 (finding that the camp constituted \u201can educational and charitable pursuit\u201d of the church as the camp\u2019s daily \u201ccrafts and games ... fosterfed] sportsmanship, honesty and creativity\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>Kasten v. Y.M.C.A., </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 7, 412 A.2d 1346 (App.Div.1980) (finding the Act inapplicable to a non-member who pays a fee and engages in a \u201ccommercial activity] geared to generate profit for the organization\u2019s charitable purposes\u201d); <em>Kirby, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 211, 243 A.2d 853 (finding the for-profit operation of a public bar and bowling alley to be \u201ca commercial activity bearing no substantial and direct relation to the mental and moral improvement of men, women and children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Here, plaintiff was injured after he left the pool and was descending the stairs to the men\u2019s locker room. At the time of plaintiffs injury, Wahoos was maintaining its swimming operation. While Wahoos may not have been actually teaching at the time of the incident, the water activity and swimming pool operation \u201cgenerally contributed to [its core] purposes and d[id] not change \u2018the essence of the entity itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Bieker, supra, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>at 171-72, 777 A.2d 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">To be deemed a beneficiary, plaintiff need not have personally received a benefit, <em>Loder, supra, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 303, 685 A.2d 20 (citing <em>Anasiewicz v. Sacred Heart Church, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 536, 181 A.2d 787 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>305, 184 A.2d 419 (1962)), or have intended or understood the entity\u2019s goals, <em>Rupp, supra, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 465, 577 A.2d 188.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>controlling relationship is that between the plaintiff as an individual and the defendant entity. <em>Kasten, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 8, 412 A.2d 1346. <em>See Loder, supra, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 302-303, 685 A.2d 20 (finding that a guest who paid to attend a Greek festival and dinner held by a Greek Orthodox Church was \u201ca recipient of the church\u2019s benefactions).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">For the purposes of the Act, plaintiff, a member of Wahoos who was utilizing the swimming pool at Wahoos at the time of his injury, was a beneficiary of Wahoos\u2019 works. <em>Cf.

Second Baptist Church, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>173, 176, 766 A.2d 816 (App.Div. 2001) (explaining that \u201ca church\u2019s entitlement to immunity from a personal injury action brought by one of its members ... turns on the reason for the member\u2019s presence on the property\u201d); <em>Graber, supra, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 484, 713 A.2d 503 (finding that \u201ca student engaging in educational pursuits is per se a beneficiary of a college or a university\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Finally, since we have concluded that Wahoos was entitled to immunity under the Act, we need not address the issue of whether plaintiff is collaterally estopped from asserting that Wahoos is not immune as a result of our earlier unreported opinion in <em>Harms v. Jersey Wahoos Swim Club, Inc., </em>No. A-6003-01T2 (App.Div. Aug. 1, 2003), where we reached the same decision that we have reached here.
