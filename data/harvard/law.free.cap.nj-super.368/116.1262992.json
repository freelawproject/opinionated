The work involved the reconstruction of a rehabilitated house, which had been totally gutted to a shell by a general contractor working with various subcontractors. This case implicates concerns about the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to 8-106(CFA), its policies, and basic fairness. We find the CFA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>inapplicable in the circumstances to the plaintiff subcontractor and reverse the judgment of the trial judge in the owner\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On August 15, 2001 Messeka Sheet Metal Co., Inc. (Messeka), the air conditioning subcontractor, filed a complaint alleging Hodder was responsible for a balance of $3000 plus interest on a contract for the installation of two air conditioning units. Messeka attached to the complaint a copy of an invoice it had presented to Hodder in May 2001. The invoice stated Messeka\u2019s demand for payment from Hodder for the sale and installation of a two-zone (first and second floor) air conditioning system. The total price was $11,000. The invoice shows that Hodder had made a $5,000 payment in November 2000 and a $3,000 payment in March 2001, leaving a balance of $3,000 \u2014 the subject of this suit. The invoice was identical in substance to the written quotation Messeka had furnished in August 2000 to John Rupp, the general contractor, at Rupp\u2019s request. Rupp accepted the $11,000 quotation and directed Messeka to proceed with the work. Hodder denied Messeka\u2019s allegations, and asserted, as an affirmative defense and counterclaim, that Messeka had violated the CFA, specifically certain implementing regulations. These regulations, at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2, are set out in pertinent part in Appendix A to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Hodder claimed Messeka violated the CFA and regulations because it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">a. failed to obtain a building permit <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(10.i.) and 13:45A-16.2(10.ii.)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">b. failed to obtain the required municipal inspections <em>[N.JAC. </em>13:45A-16.2(10.i.) and 13:45-16.2(10.ii.)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">c. failed to obtain and deliver to defendants final compliance certification from the local government prior to demanding and suing for payment <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(10.1) and 13:45A-16.2(10.ii.)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">d. failed to furnish the buyers with a written copy of all guarantees and/or warranties <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(11.i.)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">e. failed to provide defendants with copies of all guarantees and/or warranties prior to commencing work <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(11.i.)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>f. failed to obtain a signed, written contract, legibly, clearly, and, accurately setting forth all terms and conditions of the contract, including plaintiffs legal name, business address, and, the name and business address of the specific person negotiating the contract <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(12)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">g. failed to provide a written description of the work with the products and materials <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(12)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">h. failed to provide in writing the total price to be paid <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(12)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">i. failed to provide in writing the start and finish date of the work or project <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(12)]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">j. did, in fact, make a claim for payment and claim a contract existed where no final, written agreement, in fact, existed <em>[N.J.AC. </em>13:45A-16.2(12)];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">k. did misrepresent to the defendants that the initial down-payment was the full amount that defendants would be obligated to pay <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(6.vii.)]; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">l. did misrepresent that the machinery and materials plaintiff was installing were of sufficient size, capacity, character, and, nature to perform the job expected <em>[N.J.AC </em>13:45A 16.2(2.vii.)j.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Messeka answered the counterclaim, denying that it had any legal obligation under the CFA, and it asserted various affirmative defenses, including estoppel, waiver, and laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The case proceeded to a nonjury trial on June 17, 2002. After the completion of Messeka\u2019s case, Hodder moved for a directed verdict, which the judge denied. However, the judge found that the CFA applied to Messeka, and, as a consequence, ruled Messeka could only recover in quantum meruit, not for the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The trial ended after a second day. The judge issued a written opinion on July 22, 2002 and entered a final judgment. The judge said in his written opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-15\">First, it is clear from the plaintiffs own testimony that there have been violations of the [CFA] and of the Administrative Rules set forth in <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2, paragraphs 11.i. and 12.i, ii, iv]. Because of these violations, plaintiff cannot recover on the book account, and will be limited to its claim for quantum meruit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-16\">There is uncontroverted testimony on the part of George Messeka that the labor and equipment for the job in question cost the plaintiff $8,225.51, and that plaintiffs profit, if it were to be paid the full amount it seeks, would be $1,800. The only testimony before the court as to the value of the work performed and the goods provided was that of plaintiff, who, not surprisingly, testified that the value was $11,000.00, the amount on the original \u201cquotation\u201d (P-1 in evidence). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>would mean that all of plaintiffs costs totaled $9,200.00, though they have not accounted for the difference of $944.49.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">I find that because of plaintiffs statutory violations, they are entitled to recover only the cost to them of the labor and equipment, namely, $8,255,51. However, they have already been paid $8,000.00; therefore, judgment will be entered on the complaint in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $255.51. With regard to plaintiffs claim of $150.00 for \u201cextra work\u201d on the stove vent, this would not have violated the CFA, because the price did not exceed $200.00. However, there was no testimony whatsoever that plaintiff ever made a demand for this sum; therefore, plaintiffs claim for this amount fails.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\"><em>With regard to the counterclaim, there has been no proof of any damages incurred by the counterclaimants as a result of plaintiffs violation of the statute. </em>There wasn\u2019t even testimony as to what they paid to have the system started up. Therefore, <em>there will be no damages awarded on the counterclaim. </em>Counterclaim-ants are, however, entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees. <em>[See N.J.S.A. </em>58:8-19.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Messeka filed a motion for reconsideration which the judge ruled upon in an oral opinion. In this opinion, the judge again stated that the CFA applied to Messeka. He also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">With regard to the opinion from the Court of July 22nd, I have revisited my thinking and I have decided to adjust the judgment up to $1200, adding back to the 255.51 the 944.49 referred to on the second page of the opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">With regard to the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, I find that contrary to [Messeka\u2019s counsel] Mr. Bulman\u2019s very capable arguments, this is the classic case. Had there been no fee shifting provision to the Consumer Fraud Act these people could probably not have found an attorney to represent them on a relatively small matter. They would not have prevailed. They might not have even answered, that I don\u2019t really know. The plaintiff would\u2019ve just steamrolled them into a $3,000 judgment. I find that the homeowner\u2019s counsel was quite successful in this matter and is entitled to the fee sought and granted in the original application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The judge then awarded Messeka $1200, an increase from the initial August 2002 judgment which directed Messeka receive only $255.51. The judge also required Messeka to pay Hodder $4,188 in counsel fees under the CFA. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19. Messeka lost out on the profit, the remaining $1800 of the $3000 which the complaint demanded less the $1200 which the judge awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">The subcontractor Messeka urges on this appeal that the judge erred in applying the CFA to this transaction, an air conditioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>installation on a totally gutted and rehabilitated house where the job was undertaken by a general contractor hired by the owner and where the owner was also represented by a hired architect. Messeka asserts that its project was beyond the scope and statutory purpose of the CFA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Department of Law and Public Safety has adopted administrative regulations to ensure compliance with the CFA. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-1.1 to -28.8. These regulations concern various commercial enterprises, including, for example, the retail sale of meat, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-3.1 to -3.15, the delivery of household furniture and furnishings, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-5.1 to -5.4, the servicing and repairing of home appliances, <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:45A-10.1 to - 10.5, and automotive sales practices, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26B.l to - 26B.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">One section of these regulations, quoted in pertinent part in Appendix A, is devoted to \u201cHome Improvement Practices.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1 to -16.2. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1 defines \u201chome improvement\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">the remodeling, altering, painting, repairing, or modernizing of residential or noncommercial property or the making of additions thereto, and includes, but is not limited to, the construction, installation, replacement, improvement, or repair of driveways, sidewalks, swimming pools, terraces, patios, landscaping, fences, porches, windows, doors, cabinets, kitchens, bathrooms, garages, basements and basement waterproofing, fire protection devices, security protection devices, central heating and air conditioning equipment, water softeners, heaters, and purifiers, solar healing or water systems, insulation installation, aluminum siding, wall-to-wall carpeting or attached or inlaid floor coverings, and other changes, repairs, or improvements made in or on, attached to or forming a part of the residential or noncommercial property, <em>but does not include the construction of a new residence. </em>The term extends to the conversion of existing commercial structures into residential or noncommercial property and includes any of the above activities performed under emergency conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The trial judge interpreted this language of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1 to apply to this transaction, the installation of two air conditioning units by Messeka, the subcontractor, per his quotation to John Rupp, the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Messeka argues that the CFA does not apply because the installation was part of \u201cthe construction of a new residence.\u201d The judge correctly observed that there were no cases specifically \u201cinterpreting whether the exclusion applies to a house previously built and sold, but which has been taken down to the outside walls.\u201d To determine the CFA\u2019s applicability in these circumstances, we find it necessary to consider the testimony in greater detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The installation of air conditioning at the Hodders\u2019 home was one part of a major renovation of the house. The operation included: (1) an architectural firm, Quackenbush Architects, representing the owner; (2) the general contractor hired by the owner; and (3) several other subcontractors. George Messeka, a principal of the Messeka company, explained this on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">Q. Okay. What were the circumstances that led up to the defendants hiring your company to do that air conditioning work at their home in or about August of 2000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azi\">A. Well, we started [when] John Rupp gave us a set of plans to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">Q. Excuse me. Who is John Rupp?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">A. John Rupp is a general contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">Q. Was he the defendant\u2019s general contractor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">A. Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">Q. I\u2019m sorry. Continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">A. He gave us a set of plans to figure for heating and air conditioning. We did and later on during that summer of 2000 we were told that he\u2019s going to put hot water system in, that just figure for the air conditioning which we re-figured the job and gave him the quotation and that was about July \u2014 I think July or August, I\u2019m not sure of the date. And we gave that to John and we started the job shortly after.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">Q. Okay. Now, was the work that the plaintiff was hired to perform at the defendant\u2019s home, was that part of a larger project that the defendants had ongoing at their home at 24 Roma Street in Sayreville?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-14\">A. \u2022 Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">Q. Can you please describe for the Court the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-16\">A. Well, it\u2019s basically new construction. Everything was done from scratch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-17\">Q. Now, when you say it was new construction, are you referring to their entire house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-18\">A. The entire house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Q. And at what stage of the work \u2014 on the defendant\u2019s project \u2014 what stage of that work had been reached at the time the plaintiff started its work on the project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7b\">A. Well, the house was basically \u2014 just the walls were standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">THE COURT: You said basically \u2014 what did you just say? I\u2019m sorry. The house was basically\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">THE WITNESS: Just the walls were standing there. There was nothing inside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4V\">Messeka later agreed on cross-examination it was his belief that \u201cthis house was taken down to the exterior masonry walls and then gutted and rebuilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">John Rupp, the general contractor, testified and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">Q. Okay. And could you describe for the Court please the nature and extent of Mr. and Mrs. Hodden\u2019s project, the project where your company served as a general contractor on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">A. Pretty much a total redo. Took everything completely apart, and renovated everything, changed everything around and put it all back together. It was a total redo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">Q. Okay. Now, in your experience as a contractor, have you been involved in projects that have been, you know, what I call home repair or home improvement projects?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">Q. Now, was the Hodder\u2019s project a home improvement or home repair project or was it more than that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">A. It was much more than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">Q. Okay. Would you say that it amounted to a total reconstruction of their house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APY\">A. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">Q. And did either \u2014 well, did your company have a written contract with the defendants as general contractor for the project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-18\">A. No, it was time [and] material basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">Rupp said Messeka came to install the air conditioning system at Rupp\u2019s direction when \u201c[t]he house was gutted and all the framing was reframed and reconfigured and that\u2019s when they started at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-20\">Greg Messeka, who worked with his father and was a helper on the Hodder project, said \u201c[t]he house was a total renovation. There were [beam] replacements, main supports were moved. The whole house was gutted. Everything in it was new as though it were a brand new house.\u201d Sheetrock was removed, as was insulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>This testimony certainly gives the impression that the Hodder project was a major overhaul, as shown by the hiring of an architect and general contractor, the stripping of the house down to its masonry shell and foundation, and the relocation of structural supports. The evidence strongly suggests that the builders and the Hodders approached the project as if they were building a practically new house, with the exterior walls and foundation already in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Concluding that the CFA applied, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">.... [T]here are no cases specifically on point, in interpreting whether the exclusion applies to a house previously built and sold, but which has been taken down to the outside walls. I find that this case does not fall within the [new residence] exception [of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The judge quite correctly saw the case as one of first impression. He found unhelpful <em>Licciardi v. Pascarella, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>381, 476 A.2d 1273 (Law Div.1983); he found certain federal regulations inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The trial judge reasoned that since the exterior shell of the Hodder house still remained, the CFA applied. While we realize that the CFA is extremely important to the protection of consumers against fraudulent practices of home improvement contractors, we conclude that basic fairness, efficiency, and practical realities of residential construction and rehabilitation require us to take an alternative view in this contractual context.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Messeka relies upon <em>Licciardi </em>and <em>Foti v. Heller, </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57, 137 A.2d 10 (App.Div.1957), to support his claim that the CFA should not apply to the Hodder project. <em>Licciardi </em>is inapposite; it concerned the duties and warranties of a house reseller to a homebuyer. Neither is <em>Foti </em>helpful; it concerned the definition of \u201cnew rental space\u201d for purposes of rent control laws. But there are other reasons we think this project falls outside the CFA and the purpose of the \u201chome improvement\u201d regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">In this situation the owner engaged the services of an architect to prepare plans and a general contractor, who hired Messeka, the HVAC subcontractor. In this situation the plaintiff Messeka was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>not, in our view, a traditional \u201cseller\u201d within the customary understanding of the CFA\u2019s regulations. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regulations are designed to protect homeowners who deal directly with contractors. Here, the owner, Hodder, dealt with a general contractor, Rupp, and hired an architect, Quaekenbush. Messeka was engaged by Rupp to install the two-level air conditioning unit. Initially, Messeka dealt only with the general contractor. Later, upon Rupp\u2019s suggestion and with Hodder\u2019s agreement, Messeka dealt directly with Hodder in an effort to collect the $3000 balance on his $11,000 invoice, the subject of this suit. The first $8000 was paid in the regular course without any quibble. As noted, this situation was very similar to the construction of a new home \u2014 the existing house was gutted down to the masonary shell and the foundation and a new second-level was added.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">But rather than rest our decision on the \u201cnew residence\u201d exception to the \u201chome improvement\u201d definition, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1, we are persuaded that this case falls beyond the purpose of the regulations because the owner hired his own general contractor and architect to run the job. This is not the typical \u201chome improvement\u201d situation, where the owner deals with the contractor directly. To apply all of the regulatory requirements to each individual subcontractor in this type of situation would be inefficient and duplicative. Every contractor would need to have a contract in writing directly with the owner and secure municipal licenses and approvals for the job. The owner would have to deal directly with everyone on the job, not a common-sense approach. In this case Rupp, the general contractor, secured all municipal permits and approvals and obtained the certificate of occupancy. Interestingly, he had no written agreement with Hodder, whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Rupp knew personally; Hodder had worked for Rupp for a few months in the past. If anybody violated the \u201chome improvement\u201d regulations, it was Rupp, the general contractor. Messeka also had filled out pertinent forms and assisted the Hodders in obtaining the $1100 energy rebate on the air conditioning units. And, as the judge found, \u201cthere was no proof of any damages incurred by the [Hodders] as a result of plaintiffs violation of the statute,\u201d and no proof of faulty work or defective equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Our position here comports both factually and legally with a similar case, from a sister jurisdiction on the question of whether a state\u2019s home improvement contract law applies to subcontractors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Meadows v. Higgins, </em>249 <em>Conn. </em>155, 733 A.2d 172 (1999), the Connecticut Supreme Court held that the State\u2019s Home Improvement Act, <em>C.G.S.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 20-418 to 20-432, which resembles New Jersey\u2019s regulatory scheme administratively, does not apply to subcontractors. <em>Meadows </em>has striking similarities to the present situation. A homeowner contracted with a construction consultant to perform renovations on an existing house. The consultant retained a painter-wallpaperer to perform work on the house. After the painter-wallpaperer had completed 90-95% of the work, the owner ordered him to leave the premises. The painter sued for services rendered. The owner argued the painter had violated the Home Improvement Act because there was no written contract. The owners sought compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys fees, and interest under the statute. 733 A.2d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed the principle stated in <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Rindfleisch, </em>13 <em>Conn.App. </em>194, 535 A.2d 824, <em>cert. denied, </em>207 <em>Conn. </em>805, 540 A.2d 373 (1988), that subcontractors were not subject to the Home Improvement Act. 733 A.2d at 177. <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>concerned whether a roofer retained by a contractor was subject to the Home Improvement Act. Even though the construction in that case was on an existing house and only upon the roof, the court found, after extensive statutory analysis, that the Home Improvement Act did not apply to subcontractors. The Home Improvement Act\u2019s aim \u201cwas targeted only at contractors who deal directly with property owners.\u201d 535 A.2d at 828. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">The contract between the contractor and the subcontractor is not within the purview of the Act, and need not be under its purpose and premise, for by its terms the contractor is responsible to the consumer and the commissioner of consumer protection for whatever the subcontractor may do. The level of the Act\u2019s protection does not reach the contractor in his relationship with a subcontractor. In such a business relationship, the contractor is not a consumer. It is clear from the legislative record that the registered contractor was intended to be the person liable for the actions of persons he hires, employs or engages as a subcontractor to work on a homeowner\u2019s improvement project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\"><em>[O\u2019Donnell, </em>535 A.2d at 828]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The Connecticut Supreme Court agreed \u201cwith the trial court that requiring subcontractors to register as home improvement contractors would be unreasonable and unduly burdensome in an industry where most, if not all, construction work is often subcontracted for its completion by a general contractor who oversees the entire project and is responsible for the final result.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The case before us presents a situation somewhat similar to <em>D\u2019Egidio Landscaping v. Apicella, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 766 A.2d 1164 (App.Div.2001). There, the defendant, a homeowner, hired the plaintiff, a landscaping company, to pave a driveway and remove a manhole on the defendant\u2019s property. Because the homeowner, Apicella, was related by marriage to the landscaping company\u2019s principal, D\u2019Egidio, and because D\u2019Egidio and Apicella, a painter, had done work for each other through the years, Apicella refused to sign the contract which D\u2019Egidio had prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>for the project. Apicella was \u201cinsulted\u201d at the idea. 337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 255-56, 766 A.2d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In the end, Apieella was unhappy with the work, the landscaping company sued for payment, and Apieella counterclaimed for damages. The issue arose as to the CFA\u2019s applicability. The trial judge attempted to carve out a \u201cfamily exception\u201d to the CFA\u2019s applicability, which we rejected conceptually. 337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 256-57, 766 A.2d 1164. Nevertheless, in upholding the result, Judge Wefing stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">We are satisfied, nonetheless, that defendant is not entitled to the protections offered by the [CFA] and the regulation because it was his own conduct which caused the violation. Were we to conclude that defendant is entitled to invoke <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(12), the result would be to permit defendant to retain, at no cost, the fruits of D\u2019Egidio\u2019s labor when he was the one who insisted a written contract was unnecessary in light of their [long-standing] relationship. It would also reward defendant with the remedial provisions of the consumer fraud statute. We consider such a result unacceptable; one who induces the alleged wrongdoing should not benefit as a result of it. <em>See, Sears Mtge. Corp. v. Rose, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>326, 346, 634 A.2d 74 (1993)[,] where the Court, in holding the buyer\u2019s title insurance company liable for acts of the buyer\u2019s attorney who absconded with the closing proceeds, noted that it \u201cwas in a position either to prevent or protect against the loss....\u201d Not only did Apieella not \u201cprevent or protect against the loss,\u201d he occasioned it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">[337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 257, 766 A.2d 1164.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">We also concluded the ease was appropriate for application of equitable estoppel. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">Equitable estoppel has been defined as \u201cthe effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed ... as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse ...\u201d The doctrine is \u201cdesigned to prevent a party\u2019s disavowal of previous conduct if such repudiation \u2018would not be responsive to the demands of justice and good conscience\u2019 \u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\"><em>[D\u2019Edigio Landscaping, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 258, 766 A.2d 1164 (quoting <em>Heuer v. Heuer, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>226, 237, 704 A.2d 913 (1998) (citations omitted))]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">We found no reported authority applying equitable estoppel to the CFA, but were \u201cunable to perceive any reason in logic or policy which would lead to a conclusion that equitable estoppel is inapplicable.\u201d <em>D\u2019Edigio Landscaping, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 258, 766 A.2d 1164. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>We recognize New Jersey\u2019s long-standing commitment to the protection of the consumer. We are fully cognizant of the fact that the consumer fraud statute is remedial legislation and should be liberally construed to accomplish its dual objectives of deterrence and protection. <em>Lettenmaier v. Lube Connection, Inc., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>134, 139, 741 A.2d 591 (1999); <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>[138 <em>N.J. </em>2], 15, 647 A.2d 454.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">We are satisfied, however, that in the unique circumstances presented here, we are not retreating from that commitment or weakening the scope of the statute\u2019s protective reach when we apply the doctrine of estoppel. Defendant is, as the trial court noted, in the home improvement business himself as a painter and as chargeable for knowing the applicable regulations as plaintiff. \u201cThe consumer fraud statute is aimed at promoting truth and fair dealing in the market place.\u201d <em>Feinberg v. Red Bank Volvo, Inc., </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 512, 752 A.2d 720 (App.Div. 2000). Permitting this defendant in the context of this case to invoke the statutory remedies afforded by the Consumer Fraud Act would not further those laudable legislative objectives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 258-59, 766 A.2d 1164.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">We think that these principles point to a similar result here. Most pertinent to our inquiry is that Hodder sought out a general contractor and architect. He did not have a direct contract with the HVAC subcontractor, Messeka. (The record is unclear but Hodder may have dealt directly with a plumber and a masonry subcontractor.) By proceeding in this fashion, Hodder left it to the general contractor to make the choices as to who would perform this portion of the project. It would not likely occur to a subcontractor that it had any direct obligation to Hodder, since its engagement was -with Rupp. If anyone would be responsible as a home improvement contractor under the CFA to the owner, we presume his own general contractor would be. Messeka dealt directly with Hodder for payment only, at Rupp\u2019s request, when a price dispute arose, after the work had been completed and $8000 of $11,000 had been paid, as we understand this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\"><em>Branigan v. Level on the Level, Inc., </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>24, 740 A.2d 643 (App.Div.1999), also presents a thoughtful case against applying the CFA\u2019s strictures too mechanistically and technically to Messeka. <em>Branigan </em>involved a project larger than in <em>D\u2019Egidio Landscaping </em>and closer to the scale of Hodder\u2019s. Judge Ciancia described the renovations this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">Plaintiffs had contracted with defendant Level on the Level, Inc., through its president, David Marlinski, for an extensive home improvement project designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>renovate portions of plaintiffs\u2019 existing Victorian home and add significant additional living space. Plaintiff John Branigan, a graphic designer by profession, spent three years developing the design plans and specifications for the project. When the project went out to bid, the specifications encompassed twenty-four pages of detailed requirements. Marlinski\u2019s company was the successful bidder, and the contract entered between the parties specifically incorporated the drawings and specifications prepared by Branigan as well as the bid proposal submitted by Level on the Level, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\"><em>[Branigan, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 27, 740 <em>A.2d </em>643].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">After construction, Branigan sued \u201cLevel on the Level\u201d because of problems with the heating system and water in the basement under certain conditions. Branigan\u2019s claims were based on breach of contract, negligence, breach of warranty, and violations of the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">After the close of plaintiffs case, defendants moved successfully for an involuntary dismissal. The trial judge attributed Branigan\u2019s problems mainly to his attempt to \u201ccover all the bases and retain control over primary decisions.\u201d 326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 740 A.2d 643. Branigan did not want a separate furnace for the new addition, which led to the heating problems, and because there had been no prior water problems, he did not want the installation of water removal devices. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We were \u201cthoroughly convinced, as was [the trial judge], that viewing the proofs most favorably to plaintiffs, there was no evidence to permit a jury to find defendants had done or failed to do anything that could be considered negligent, a breach of contract, a breach of warranty, or a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act.\u201d 326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 740 A.2d 643. Still, we recognized \u201cthere is more to the [CFA] than acts of commission or knowing acts of omission,\u201d 326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 740 A.2d 643, because a contractor could violate the CFA by violating the regulations. <em>Ibid. See Alloway v. Bradlees, Inc., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>221, 236, 723 A.2d 960 (1999) (OSHA violations a basis for a common-law negligence action).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">We addressed Branigan\u2019s contention that his contract with \u201cLevel on the Level\u201d violated the CFA\u2019s regulations. Branigan said, for instance, that the contract contained a \u201cfailure to provide warranties; a failure to set forth contracts with subcontractors; a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>failure to adequately describe the products and materials to be used on the job; and the failure to set forth starting and completion dates of the work.\u201d <em>Branigan, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29, 740 A.2d 643. We concluded, \u201c[a]s we read the pertinent regulations <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2), there is no requirement the \u201cseller\u201d set forth its contracts with subcontractors.\u201d 826 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29, 740 A.2d 643. If, per <em>Branigan, </em>a general contractor need not disclose to the owner contracts with subcontractors, it would not make sense to say the CFA applies to subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We find that the CFA does not apply in this situation. We reverse the attorney fee award and allow recovery on Messeka\u2019s claim for the balance of the contract still due, $3000.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">(a) Without limiting any other practices which may be unlawful under the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 et seq., utilization by a seller of the following acts and practices involving the sale, attempted sale, advertisement or performance of home improvements shall be unlawful hereunder:</p>\n<p id=\"Ait\">***</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">[2.] Product and material representations: Misrepresent directly or by implication that products or materials to be used in the home improvement:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">[2.vii.3 Are of sufficient size, capacity, character or nature to do the job expected or represented;</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\"><em>* </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">[6.vii.] Mislead the prospective buyer into believing that the down payment or any other sum constitutes the full amount the buyer will be obligated to pay;</p>\n<p id=\"As-\">***</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>[10.i.] No seller contracting for the making of home improvements shall commence work until he is sure that all applicable state or local building and construction permits have been issued as required under state laws or local ordinances; or</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">[10.ii.] Where midpoint or final inspections are required under state laws or local ordinances, copies of inspection certificates shall be furnished to the buyer by the seller when construction is completed and before final payment is due or the signing of a completion slip is requested of the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">[11.i.] The seller shall furnish the buyer a written copy of all guarantees made with respect to labor services, products or materials furnished in connection with home improvements.
