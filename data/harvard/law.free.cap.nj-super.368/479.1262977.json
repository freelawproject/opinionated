The jury awarded $90,911.00 for lost past wages, $118,404.00 for lost future wages, $20,000.00 for emotional distress, and $225,000 for punitive damages. The trial judge further awarded $815,547.45 in counsel fees, $33,953.34 in costs, and $13,000 in prejudgment interest. We affirm the judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Defendants argue that the judgment must be reversed because \u201c(a) the trial court erroneously allowed plaintiff to make legally impossible, factually contradictory claims, (b) the record cannot support a finding of unlawful retaliatory intent, and (c) the trial court improperly admitted irrelevant and prejudicial evidence excludable under [N.J.R.E.] 404(b).\u201d Defendants further contend that the judgment must also be reversed because \u201cthe record is incapable of supporting punitive damages and does not include evidence as to other or intervening causes of emotional distress and future financial status.\u201d Finally, defendants attack the award of counsel fees based on the lodestar and its enhancement because \u201cplaintiff did not prevail,\u201d under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq., </em>on his \u201ccentral claims of sexual harassment or any of his claims against most of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The trial involved plaintiffs claims of \u201csame-sex sexual harassment\u201d by co-workers and Tropicana\u2019s failure to stop it. At the trial, plaintiff also asserted that he was fired in retaliation for taking legal action. The defendants included Tropieana and its employees who were superiors, supervisors and co-workers of plaintiff. Defendant Freda was Tropicana\u2019s Director of Northeast Operations, and defendant Montalto was its area Human Resources Director at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In its verdict sheet, the jury found that plaintiff proved, \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants engaged in behavior directed at [plaintiff] because of his sex,\u201d but not \u201cthat [their] behavior was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of his employment and create a sexually hostile work environment at Tropieana.\u201d However, the jury also found, in interrogatory number five, that plaintiff proved \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that Tropieana terminated him on September 1, 1999, in retaliation for his engaging in the protected activity of filing complaints in the Division on Civil Rights and in [the Superior Court in this case].\u201d The jury also found, in response to interrogatory number seven, that plaintiff proved, \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>clear and convincing evidence,\u201d that defendants Montalto and Freda, but not the thirteen other named defendants, acted \u201cmaliciously and with wanton disregard to plaintiffs rights.\u201d In response to interrogatory number eight, the jury also found that plaintiff proved \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that defendant Tropieana\u2019s conduct (i.e. the harassment and the termination) was either (a) malicious or (b) in wanton and reckless disregard of plaintiffs rights.\u201d In response to question number nine, the jury concluded that plaintiff proved, by the same standard, \u201cthat Tropicana\u2019s upper level management actually participated in\u201d and \u201cwillfully acquiesced in the harassment and/or termination of plaintiff.\u201d At a separate proceeding, the same jury awarded $225,000 in punitive damages against Tropicana, Freda and Montalto.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Defendants contend that the answers on the verdict sheet are not clear or specific enough to justify the awards. However, irrespective of who prepared the interrogatories,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there was no objection to the form of the questions asked, or any request for additional questions to be placed on the form, and hindsight cannot be a basis for concluding that the form was inadequate. <em>See Wade v. Kessler Institute, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>327, 341, 798 A.2d 1251 (2002) (court will not reverse where jury\u2019s interrogatories or verdict sheet are adequate as a whole); <em>Mogull v. CB Commercial Real Estate, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>449, 467-68, 744 A.2d 1186 (2000) (reviewing jury interrogatories under \u201cplain error\u201d standard in LAD case); <em>Hutchinson v. Atlantic City Med., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>468, 486, 715 A.2d 348 (App.Div.1998) (no objection to verdict sheet barred challenge on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>While question five did not expressly ask whether Montalto or Freda were involved in the retaliatory discharge, by virtue of the other answers, and the jury\u2019s finding with respect to the conduct of \u201cupper management,\u201d the jury had to have found that their conduct related to the termination, not to the harassment. Moreover, as they were the only individual defendants found liable for the disregard of plaintiffs rights and they were shown to be \u201cupper management,\u201d and because the trial judge instructed that Tropicana could be liable for punitive damages only if one or more of the individual defendants were part of \u201cupper management,\u201d Freda and Montalto had to be the \u201cupper management\u201d whose conduct rendered defendant Tropicana liable. Because the evidence supports those findings, and there is no legal error warranting reversal, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In reaching our conclusion, we address only those issues which warrant discussion and recite only the facts necessary for their resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Plaintiff came to the United States from Poland in 1984 when he was about thirty-five years old. In 1995, he was hired by Tropicana as a \u201cwarehouseman,\u201d and commenced work on the loading dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Plaintiffs wife Elizabeth filled out the employment application, but plaintiff signed it. The signature line was just below a certification, which provided in part: \u201cI understand and agree that misrepresentation or omission of the facts called for herein will be sufficient cause for cancellation of consideration for employment or dismissal from the Company\u2019s service if I have been employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Plaintiff stated on the application that he had received a certificate in \u201cmechanical operations\u201d from a \u201ctechnical school\u201d in Poland, as well as a certificate from a truck driving school in Connecticut. Plaintiff also stated that he had worked for Champion Sports from October 1986 through August 1994 when he left because he \u201chad a better offer,\u201d and that from September 1994 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>through June 1995, he worked for U.S.A. Coating Protection in Hillside. He further said that he left U.S.A. Coating Protection due to \u201clack of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Commencing in October 1997, plaintiff and his daughter complained about the ridicule plaintiff suffered at the hands of coworkers who simulated homosexual acts and called plaintiff homosexual names. Freda, then Tropieana\u2019s Director of Northeastern Operations, and Montalto, its regional Human Resources Manager, conducted meetings designed to prevent the disharmony, and met with members of plaintiffs family. Ultimately, plaintiff was reassigned from the rail dock to the \u201corder pick\u201d department filling orders for various juices. No one was ever disciplined for their misconduct or sexual harassment of plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, at a meeting with plaintiffs daughter, Montalto, without objection from Freda, said that if plaintiff retained counsel, \u201cit will not be good for the company and it would not be good for [him],\u201d and that \u201c[i]t would get very ugly. It would get ugly for the company and it would get ugly for [her] father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In August 1998, plaintiff fell on some spilled juice in the \u201cpick order\u201d department. Plaintiff said that he did not see the juice on the floor because he was nervous and upset after having just been the subject of harassment. The next day, plaintiff returned to work with a note from his doctor stating that plaintiff could not lift heavy objects. In response, plaintiff was transferred to the computer room of the \u201cpick order\u201d department. However, he believed that the mistreatment continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>On August 21, 1998, plaintiff filed a complaint with the Division on Civil Rights. He asserted that he was \u201cbeing subjected to hostile environment sexual harassment\u201d by \u201csexual gestures and comments by co-workers.\u201d Nevertheless, plaintiff believed the harassment did not end. He then filed this complaint on December 18, 1998. In addition to alleging that he was being sexually harassed and subjected to words and gestures suggesting he was \u201ca homosexual,\u201d he also alleged that his supervisors and the company did nothing to stop it, and he was being penalized in terms of assignments and overtime pay. Among other things, he asserted he had been \u201cforced to endure sexual harassment as a condition of his employment\u201d and that he had been subjected to an \u201cintimidating, hostile, offensive and abusive working environment because of [his] gender.\u201d Co-employees were charged with specific violations of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq. </em>Defendants Freda and Montalto, among others, were alleged to have \u201cthe authority to control the work environment,\u201d and \u201ccreated and maintained a sexually hostile work environment.\u201d In summary, count one of the multi-count complaint asserted that defendants \u201ccreated and maintained a sexually hostile work environment on the basis of gender\u201d in violation of the LAD. There was also a count alleging that defendants\u2019 conduct constituted retaliation within the meaning of the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Plaintiff was granted a disability leave in April 1999 because he was no longer able to work by virtue of the emotional distress. Dr. Edward Suezewski reported that plaintiff was suffering a disability as the result of anxiety from \u201cthe hostile environment he describes as a source of his condition.\u201d The doctor gave periodic reports during the leave. The last note, which was written after the doctor saw plaintiff on June 17, 1999, stated that his return to work was \u201cundetermined,\u201d and that plaintiffs work environment was the cause of his anxiety and chest pain. He reported that \u201c[t]he environment of [plaintiffs] place of work does not allow for his fulfillment of safe and productive duties.\u201d During the two months that plaintiff was initially out of work, no one from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Tropicana called him to find out about his condition or return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">On June 30,1999, after submitting another form stating that he still could not work and that he did not know when he would be able to return, plaintiff started working for the Seasons Contracting demolition company. Plaintiff says he took the job because he needed the income, not because he wanted to stop working at Tropicana. He never told Tropicana that he was working for Seasons Contracting. After three to four weeks, Seasons Contracting told plaintiff that the company had \u201cno more work\u201d for him. However, plaintiff did not return to Tropicana because nobody from the company ever \u201ccontacted [him]\u201d about going back to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In September 1999, plaintiff went to work in Connecticut. According to Elizabeth, she left her own job and took plaintiff to Connecticut because he could not find work in the Bayonne area where they lived, and he was depressed. She made the decision after she had come home from work one day and found plaintiff in the basement with a rope around his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Plaintiff left the Connecticut job because it was physically too demanding. He worked as a handyman for a company called Rosedale Estates for a few months beginning in December 1999. In 2000, plaintiff worked as a mechanic for a company called Gel Spice until his shift was eliminated. At the time of trial, he was working as a maintenance man for a company called Mail Well. Plaintiff testified that he was still employed by Mail Well and that he had not been \u201csuspended\u201d from work there as a result of \u201cleaving work without permission\u201d and without punching out. He also denied having been terminated by Mail Well.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">When plaintiff was deposed before trial, he denied that he actually received a certificate from the truck driving school, as stated in the job application. At trial, plaintiff explained his answer by stating that, at the time of his deposition, he was not certain whether he had received the certificate, and because he did not want to lie, he denied it. Plaintiff further testified at trial that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>he did, in fact, receive the certificate, as he had \u201cfound\u201d it following the deposition. Defendants also developed that plaintiffs deposition testimony was inconsistent with the application\u2019s statements concerning attendance at a technical school in Poland.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Plaintiffs representation on the application that he left Champion in August 1994 for a \u201cbetter job\u201d also was untrue. Plaintiff actually collected unemployment compensation after his employment with Champion. Moreover, plaintiff testified that the \u201cbetter job\u201d never materialized and he only did some part-time work for U.S.A. Coating Protection. When asked point blank \u201c[s]o you never actually were employed by USA Coating Protection during this period,\u201d plaintiff answered \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Plaintiff was deposed on June 15, 1999, and after it was determined that plaintiff had made misrepresentations on the employment application with respect to his education and employment, Tropieana\u2019s Human Resources Counsel, Robert Chiaravalloti, who attended the deposition and testified at the punitive damages hearing, called Montalto and asked him whether any other employee had been terminated in the past for falsifying his or her employment application. After Montalto looked into the matter and reported back to Chiaravalloti that two people previously had been fired for lying on their applications, Chiaravalloti \u201crecommended\u201d that plaintiff be fired and drafted a letter for Montalto\u2019s signature informing plaintiff that he was being terminated based on the false application. Plaintiff, however, developed through Montalto\u2019s testimony, that Montalto \u201cconstructed\u201d the letter \u201cwith input from counsel\u201d and \u201ccrafted it to use [his] own style,\u201d and that he \u201cfired\u201d plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>On September 1, 1999, Montalto signed and sent the letter to plaintiff stating that plaintiff had refused Montalto\u2019s request to meet with him in the presence of a union representative to discuss plaintiffs employment and informing plaintiff that, under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, he was being summarily discharged based upon the \u201cmaterial misstatements\u201d that he made on his employment application, effective September 3, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In September 1999, plaintiff amended the complaint to include a claim based on the wrongful retaliatory discharge. He subsequently filed a second amended complaint which included a claim for \u201cconstructive discharge\u201d as a result of defendants\u2019 \u201cknowingly permitting employment conditions of sexual harassment that were so intolerable that any reasonable person would have resigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Defendants insist that the discovery of a false employment application incident to the litigation warrants the discharge. There was, however, no challenge to the lack of specific instructions addressed to the right to terminate because of a misrepresentation in the application, and the issue of pretext was charged at length. Accordingly, we find no basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s determination which rejected the contention that plaintiff was discharged for lying on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The issue we must address, however, is whether plaintiff can prevail on his retaliatory discharge claim when the termination occurred during the course of litigation which also included a claim for constructive discharge. We conclude that summary judgment was properly denied, the evidence presented a jury issue, and there is no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>In order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of constructive discharge in New Jersey, a plaintiff must establish that \u201cthe employer knowingly permitted conditions of discrimination in employment so intolerable that a reasonable person subject to them would resign.\u201d <em>Shepherd v. Hunterdon Center, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>1, 27-28, 803 A.2d 611 (2002), quoting <em>Muench v. Township of Haddon, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 301-02, 605 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1992). As the Supreme Court also put it in <em>Shepherd v. Hunterdon Center, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 803 A.2d 611:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">[C]onstructive discharge requires not merely \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d conduct, but conduct that is so intolerable that a reasonable person would be forced to resign rather than continue to endure it. <em>Jones v. Aluminum Shapes, Inc., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 428, 772 A.2d 34 (App.Div.2001). More precisely, the standard envisions a \u201csense of outrageous, coercive and unconscionable requirements.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Simply put, a constructive discharge claim requires more egregious conduct than that sufficient for a hostile work environment claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">On the other hand, a retaliatory discharge in violation of the LAD can occur even if there was no underlying unlawful harassment. <em>Romano v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co., </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 548, 665 A.2d 1139 (App.Div.1995). The <em>Romano </em>court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">To establish a prima fade case of retaliation under LAD [plaintiff I had to show that 1) he was engaged in a protected activity known to the defendant; 2) he was thereafter subjected to an adverse employment decision by the defendant; and 3) there was a causal link between the two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 548-49, 665 A.2d 1139.]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">If plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, \u201cthe defendant must articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 665 A.2d 1139. \u201cThereafter the plaintiff must come forward with evidence of a discriminatory motive of the employer, and demonstrate that the legitimate reason was merely a pretext for the underlying discriminatory motive.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Plaintiff never formally resigned or quit his employment. Rather, he obtained a disability leave which would have permitted his return. The denial of summary judgment was appropriate because the proffer justified alternative theories of liability based on either a constructive or retaliatory discharge for presentation to a jury. <em>Farina v. Compuware Corp., </em>256 F.Supp.2d 1033, 1051-52 (D.Ariz.2003) (summary judgment denied on retaliation claim where plaintiff was terminated after letter considering herself constructively discharged; plaintiff made a <em>prima facie </em>case that she was terminated due to retaliation for her EEOC complaint and to avoid a constructive discharge claim). <em>See also Delashmutt v. Wis-Pak Plastics, Inc., </em>990 <em>F.Supp. </em>689, 696, 703 (N.D.Ia.1998)(holding that plaintiffs claims of both constructive discharge and retaliation survived summary judgment because there were genuine material issues of fact as to retaliation for complaint of sexual harassment and claim that changed working conditions after fifing of harassment complaint would result in resignation).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We conclude that there was at least a jury question as to whether plaintiff had resigned or quit before he received the letter of termination, as well as whether he was in fact terminated because he lied on the job application. In its opening, defendants contended that plaintiff \u201cwas terminated September 1st of 1999 for lying on his employment application,\u201d and stated in summation that he was not \u201cfired until September 1st of 1999,\u201d long after the administrative and Superior Court complaints were filed, but shortly after the false application was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We agree with defendants that plaintiff could not prevail on both his constructive discharge and wrongful termination theories because they must rely on inconsistent findings. <em>See Wade v. Kessler Institute, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 342-46, 798 A.2d 1251 (involving <em>Woolley </em>claim and alleged breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing). However, plaintiff pursued only the harassment and retaliation claims at trial, no issue relating to constructive discharge was presented to the jury and, in any event, he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>prevail on inconsistent theories, of both constructive and retaliatory discharge. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 798 A.2d 1251 (\u201calternative claims\u201d can be asserted \u201cin an appropriate case\u201d \u201c[w]hen supported by the facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">So long as the jury did not return inconsistent verdicts, we find no basis for disturbing the judgment. In short, the issue of retaliation was a factual issue, and the jury\u2019s verdict finding an unlawful retaliatory discharge \u201cis entitled to great deference.\u201d <em>Estate of Roach v. TRW, Inc., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>598, 612, 754 A.2d 544 (2000) (CEPA retaliation case, citing <em>Romano, supra). </em>There was more than sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that these defendants retaliated against plaintiff for bringing an action challenging their conduct and that plaintiff was treated differently than others who lied on their application or committed serious violations of company policy, thereby demonstrating that the termination was a mere pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We also reject the defendants\u2019 contention that punitive damages can never be awarded when the discharge is premised on the advice of counsel. Here, they assert the termination was based on the advice of counsel, and that the false application warranted the termination. Their contention does not warrant reversal, however, because the advice of counsel is only one factor, not a per se basis, for assessing or deciding whether the termination was in good faith, <em>cf. Sandler v. Lawn A Mal Chem. and Equip. Corp., </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 452, 358 A.2d 805 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>503, 366 A.2d 658 (1976), and there was a factual question as to whether the defendants\u2019 action was premised on the advice of counsel or an independent decision to retaliate against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">In order to award punitive damages in a discrimination suit under the LAD, a plaintiff must prove: \u201c(1) \u2018actual participation in or willful indifference to the wrongful conduct on the part of upper management\u2019 and (2) \u2018proof that the offending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>conduct [is] especially egregious\u2019.\u201d <em>Cavuoti v. New Jersey Transit Corp., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>107, 113, 735 A.2d 548 (1999), quoting <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 313, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995). Further, members of upper management are not limited to the chief executive officer, chief operating officer or a member of the board. The issue is \u201cfact sensitive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122, 127-29, 661 A.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In <em>Sheetz, Inc. v. Bowles Rice McDavid Graff &amp; Love, PLLC, </em>209 <em>W.Va. </em>318, 547 S.E.2d 256 (2001), a legal malpractice action, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia recently held, in responding to a question certified by a federal court, \u201cthat in an employment law civil action, the fact that an employer acted in reliance upon the advice of counsel is not an absolute defense to a claim that the employer acted unlawfully or negligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. The court stated that \u201c[r]elevant evidence regarding the advice of counsel may be admissible in the trial of an employment law civil action as part of the calculus of evidence that the fact-finder considers in reaching its verdict-including on the issue of punitive damages, where that issue is presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265-66.

Nevertheless, he did prevail on a wrongful termination claim premised on retaliation for his exercising his rights to pursue a claim based on the alleged harassment and hostile environment.

The absence of sufficient evidence of harassment, or of Tropicana\u2019s upper management\u2019s failure to enforce the anti-harassment policy, does not affect the issue of whether plaintiff was wrongfully terminated because of his suit over his perception of harassment and the company\u2019s failure to take appropriate action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\"> During the charge conference, the trial judge indicated that because Montalto's role was \"at best administerial in the sense that 1he testimony was that he did not prepare the letter terminating Mr. Kluczyk, he was not involved in the decision terminating Mr. Kluczyk\u201d and that \"there was no rational basis for the juiy to find liability other than as an aider and abettor,\u201d which was a theory of one count of the complaint and presented to the jury with respect to the sexually hostile work environment claim, the judge ultimately charged that if the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>found \"plaintiff's termination was retaliatory then you must consider whether Mr. Montalto is individually liable on this claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\"> The jury was told there were four elements to the retaliatory discharge and that the first three were satisfied.
