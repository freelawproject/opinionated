Medicare had originally been billed for these services in the amount of $5,659.72. Medicare refused to pay the Hospital\u2019s bill because defendant\u2019s Medicare life-time-care coverage had expired. <em>See Vencor, Inc. v. Standard Life and Accident Ins. Co., </em>317 F.3d 629 (6th Cir.2003) (explaining limits of Medicare Part A coverage, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1395; 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 413). The Hospital then sought payment of more than triple the Medicare rate from the decedent-patient\u2019s estate. The Law Division judge granted the Hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the amount of $18,472.76. We conclude that the judge erred and that the Hospital was only entitled to recover the Medicare rate from the estate, the sum of $5,659.72, in these particular circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">The decedent, Mrs. Malone, was admitted as a Medicare patient \u201con numerous occasions prior to her receiving treatment that relates to this final bill.\u201d As noted, Medicare refused to pay the bill after Mrs. Malone died. The bill then was revised and she was sent a new statement for $18,472.76 \u201calmost a year after her death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Lynn Riley, the Hospital\u2019s credit supervisor, testified in discovery that if the $5,659.72 amount had been paid by Medicare, the bill would have been satisfied in full. William Zauner, Vice President of Finance, certified that the $18,472.76 charges finally billed to Mrs. Malone and the estate were \u201cthe usual and customary charges for the services involved\u201d and \u201cwere fair and reasonable.\u201d The Hospital rejected the estate\u2019s offer to pay the Medicare bill as \u201cfull and final settlement\u201d of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">At argument on rehearing, counsel for the estate urged his position this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">MB. MCCANN: I\u2019m not sure if it was dear from the original argument presented that this lady was accepted on this particular occasion into the hospital as a Medicare/Medicaid patient. She\u2019s been in the hospital a number of times. That was the condition on which she was accepted into the hospital. They accepted her under the current [sic] conditions and expected to render a bill for whatever their usual and customary charges were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">After some period of time, they determined \u2014 well, Medicare determined that she didn\u2019t have any more money that they would pay out, so the hospital tripled the bill. This is \u2014 there\u2019s no statutory scheme that gives them the right to do that. They don\u2019t have \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to Mrs. Malone and say, oh, Mrs. Malone, your Medicaid ran out. You have an option of moving out of the hospital now, but if you don\u2019t, I want you to know that the room is going from two hundred dollars a day to six hundred dollars a day, or something to that effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">This woman was in the hospital for a number of days. They thought they were billing fifty-six hundred dollars. They billed fifty-six hundred dollars. They didn\u2019t get it. They must be thrilled to death that she ran out of payments \u2014 that she ran out of money through Medicaid. There is no conscionable way they can just take and triple the bill and say that\u2019s our usual customary fee. That\u2019s like someone coming into my office for a pro bono case and you say, oh, I now discover you got money, I\u2019m going to charge you whatever I please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">There\u2019s no \u2014 nothing submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that says they have any right to do that. So my position is the usual and customary fee is what they anticipated they would be able to bill, not what they choose to bill after they find out that some provider is not paying. And I don\u2019t believe that was particularly and completely articulated in a prior argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">In this particular circumstance, we agree with the estate\u2019s position. There is no evidence that the hospital alerted the decedent or her next-of-kin, her son John Malone, of any new billing practice or expectations if Mrs. Malone\u2019s Medicare benefits ran out before she died. The son\u2019s certification stated, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\">1. Iam the son of the deceased Mary Malone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>2. My mother received medical treatment at Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital at various times up and through December 5,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">8. Her bills were all sent to medicaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">4. No bills were ever sent to me or my mother and they were all handled in that fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">5. The last bill sent to medicaid requested payment in the amount of $5,659.72 as full and final payment for all services rendered to Mary Malone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">6. When medicaid denied said payment and advised that Mary Malone\u2019s medical benefits were exhausted, the hospital then billed the Estate and me individually the sum of $18,472.76 for the same services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">7. Through my attorney, I offered to pay the initial bill as full and final settlement of all claims Burdette Tomlin may have against the Estate of Mary Malone or myself. That request has been denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">We are inclined to adopt the view of the federal courts in a similar case, <em>Vencor, Inc. v. Standard Life and Accident Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>F.Supp.2d 573 </em>(W.D.Ky.1999), <em>aff'd, </em>317 F.3d 629 (6th Cir.2003). In <em>Vencor, </em>the \u201cMedigap\u201d carrier, Standard Life, successfully made a similar argument to the contention advanced here by the estate, based on its contract language. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court judge\u2019s ruling that Standard Life had to pay the unreimbursed amount only at \u201cper diem rates allowed by Medicare, even after Medicare coverage ha[d] been exhausted,\u201d 317 F.3d at 631, not at the hospital\u2019s so-called \u201creasonable and customary rate\u201d or \u201cstandard rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">Judge Heyburn\u2019s language in his District Court opinion points to the problem precisely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">Allowing health care providers to charge any amount would create an apparent inconsistency. Such a ruling would expose many elderly or their estates to liability for the amount that the provider\u2019s rate exceeded the Medicare rate. Such a result runs counter to the whole purpose of supplemental Medicare insurance regulations. The goal of Medigap policies is to prevent the elderly from facing uncertain and possibly cost prohibitive medical expenses. If providers can charge any amount after the elderly exhaust Medicare benefits and supplemental insurers are not liable, this goal is thwarted and the implicit promise of Medigap policy is made illusory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">Legislation requiring Medigap insurers to write policies covering any amount charged by providers for eligible care could solve this problem. However, neither Congress nor the Tennessee state legislature has chosen to mandate this. One reason may be that to do so would cause the cost of supplemental insurance policies to increase dramatically, likely pricing many elderly out of the supplemental insurance market altogether. This result also appears at odds with the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and goals of the current Medicare structure, to ensure that the elderly have access to necessary health care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">The Court is confronted with a complex legislative scheme involving many delicate policy choices. Though complex, the legislative scheme may not resolve every important question. For the time being, the Court finds it unnecessary to inquire whether there is sufficiently strong evidence of legislative intent to fairly resolve these problems. To do so might require the Court to adopt its own policy and write its own amendments. No doubt a legislature pronouncement would provide the most appropriate resolution of how much providers may charge after the elderly exhaust Medicare benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">Whether Vencor can charge its customary rates is not an issue requiring resolution in the breach of contract claim. It seems unlikely to be relevant in the context of Vencor\u2019s promissory estoppel claim either. If the only representation made by Standard Life was submission of the insurance policy, then Vencor will lose on the promissory estoppel claim. If Standard Life made some other representation to Vencor, it is conceivable that Vencor may have a viable claim, but Vencor must establish that an injustice would result from receiving its Medicare rate. <em>See Amacher v. Brown-Forman Corporation </em>826 S.W.2d 480 (Tenn.App.1991) (promissory estoppel is only appropriate when necessary to avoid injustice).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">[65 <em>F.Supp. </em>2d at 579-80.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">We perceive no injustice in limiting the Hospital to recovery of the Medicare rate in this situation where benefits ran out during decedent\u2019s terminal illness hospitalization and no new arrangements had been made with decedent or her next-of-kin as to increases in billings thereafter. We think the equities require the invocation of the doctrine of \u201cquasi-estoppel\u201d described by our Supreme Court in <em>Heuer v. Heuer, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>226, 704 A.2d 913 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">There are two basic forms of estoppel. \u201cTrue estoppel\u201d is used to define the situation in which \u201c \u2018one party induces another to rely on his [or her] damage upon certain representations.\u2019\u201d <em>Kazin, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 94, 405 A.2d 360 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 74, cmt. b (1971)). \u201cQuasi-estoppel\u201d describes a situation in which \u201can individual is not permitted to \u2018blow both hot and cold,\u2019 taking a position inconsistent with prior conduct, if this would injure another, regardless of whether that person has actually relied thereon.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>274 Cal.App.2d 178, 82 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>238, <em>244-45 </em>(1969)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\"><em>[Heuer, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 237, 704 A.2d 913.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The doctrine \u201cis discretionary on the part of a court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 704 A.2d 913. \u201cIt is a doctrine designed to prevent a party\u2019s disavowal of previous conduct if such repudiation \u201cwould not be responsive to the demands of justice and good conscience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carlsen v. Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots Pension Plan Trust, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>334, 339, 403 A.2d 880 (1979) (quoting <em>West Jersey Title &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Indus. Trust Co., </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>144, 153, 141 A.2d 782 (1958)). <em>West Jersey Title </em>described the doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">Estoppel <em>in pais </em>is a preclusion by law against speaking contrary to one\u2019s own act or deed; one may not take a position inconsistent with that previously assumed and intended to influence the conduct of another, if such repudiation \u201cwould not be responsive to the demands of justice and good conscience,\u201d in that it would work prejudice and injury to the other. <em>New Jersey Suburban Water Co. v. Harrison, supra </em>[, 122 <em>N.J.L. </em>189, 3 A.2d 623 (E. &amp; A.1939)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">[27 <em>N.J. </em>at 153, 141 A.2d 782.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that the Hospital is entitled to no more than the Medicare reimbursement rate from the estate. We affirm but modify the judgment in favor of the plaintiff Hospital to the sum of $5,659.72 without prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Affirmed, as modified, and remanded for entry of appropriate judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
