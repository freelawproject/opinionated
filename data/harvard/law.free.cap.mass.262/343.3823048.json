G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 1. A citation to the heirs at law was issued February 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>1927, and William J. Phillips entered an appearance by his attorney in fact on February 14, 1927, claiming that, being the son of John C. Phillips, a deceased brother of the intestate, he was entitled to be heard on the question whether the petitioner should be appointed. The court on the motion of the petitioner and after hearing adjudged on April 13, 1927, that William J. Phillips was not the son of John C. Phillips, and that his appearance should be stricken out. It is contended by William J. Phillips, who appealed, that the order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The rights of the appellant depended on his kinship to the intestate. It was a question of fact, whether he was the son of John C. Phillips, and, this question having been settled adversely to his claim in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>230 Mass. 14, where it was directly raised and which decision was followed in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>241 Mass. 47, the entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
