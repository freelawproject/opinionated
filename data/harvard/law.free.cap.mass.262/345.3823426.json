There was evidence tending to show that the contract was between the defendant Sadd and Reardon and that Sadd never had any business dealings with the plaintiff. On the last named date Miss Steuer called at the office of counsel for Sadd and informed him that she owned the business at No. 18 Olive Place, to which counsel replied, \u201cThen you are the one we want to get.\u201d The record states that she did not allow counsel to make any explanation to her, nor did she tell him that Reardon was working on Sadd\u2019s shoes on his own account but that he was using her machinery. There was evidence to show that up to September 1,1920, when he left, Reardon had been in charge of her business; that on that date she engaged one Durgin \u201cto run the business for her\u201d; that the business at 20 Olive Place was not discontinued, but that Reardon, having no machinery of his own, used the machinery at 18 Olive Place, when necessary, paying therefor at the rate of twenty-five cents per hour; that after Miss Steuer\u2019s conference with defendant\u2019s counsel the action against Reardon was discontinued and another brought by Sadd against Etta R. Steuer (now Mrs. Reardon) for the conversion of thirty-nine pair of shoes on the ground that Reardon was her agent. On the writ, the constable attached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the machinery at 18 Olive Place and it was removed and placed in storage by him. The action against Miss Steuer resulted in her favor, as shown by the decision in <em>Saad </em>v. <em>Steuer, </em>241 Mass. 31, which was introduced in evidence and made a part of the record in this case. The jury also could find that Reardon informed the defendant that he did not own the machinery, that he was not acting in any way for Miss Steuer who had no interest in his business, but that he paid for the use of her machinery when necessary; that when the writ against her was issued counsel for Sadd assumed that Reardon acted for her as an undisclosed principal. It was decided in <em>Saad </em>v. <em>Steuer, supra, </em>that the plaintiff had no cause of action, and the jury in the case at bar could find that the attachment and removal of her property was intentionally and wilfully done to enforce a claim which the defendant knew was groundless and was an abuse of legal process. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>144 Mass. 365. <em>White </em>v. <em>Apsley Rubber Co. </em>181 Mass. 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The case at bar is not an action for malicious prosecution and to maintain it the plaintiff need not show a termination of the action in which the process was issued, nor want of probable cause. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was denied rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
