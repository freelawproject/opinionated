There was a verdict for the plaintiff, and the. case is in this court on a report of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">John Glynn, the defendant\u2019s son, eighteen years of age, lived with his father and was licensed to operate automobiles. Shortly before eight o\u2019clock on the night of the accident, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>went to the garage which was situated in the rear of the defendant\u2019s house and drove away. As he was leaving the yard, he invited his four-year old brother, who was playing there, to accompany him. The defendant was at this time sitting on the back porch. John, called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified that he said nothing to his father about taking the automobile, and \u201chis father was not in a position to see him when he drove away\u201d; that his father could see his brother \u201cif he looked around that way\u201d; that \u201cThere had been no talk about taking the child out, and he picked him up to take him 'out for a ride\u2019 'any place I felt like going,\u2019 without asking his father\u2019s permission or telling him that he was taking the child.\u201d The defendant, who was also called by the plaintiff, testified that he did not see John \u201ctake the car\u201d and \u201cwas unaware that he had done so\u201d; that \u201cThe four-year old boy was playing around in the yard, and the father was exercising general supervision over him\u201d; that \u201cJohn had his permission to take the car\u201d but \u201cdid not have permission to take the four-year old boy out\u201d; that he \u201cdid not notice John going to the garage, and did not see him coming out with the car. He could not tell where the boy was when John took the car out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The defendant was not liable merely because he owned the automobile and permitted his son to operate it. To establish liability there must be evidence that the driver was the defendant\u2019s agent and at the time engaged in his business. <em>Trombley </em>v. <em>Stevens-Duryea Co. </em>206 Mass. 516. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Albiani, </em>245 Mass. 233. <em>Kwedares </em>v. <em>Knoel, </em>261 Mass. 91, and cases cited. The burden was on the plaintiff to show that John was the defendant\u2019s agent. He was not the defendant\u2019s servant merely because his younger brother was riding with him. There was no evidence that he invited his brother at the defendant\u2019s request, or that his father directed him to do this. All that appears, taking the evidence in its most favorable aspect for the plaintiff, is that the father might have seen the child in the automobile. This is insufficient to prove that John was acting for the father, engaged in his business, or carrying out his directions. <em>Kwedares </em>v. <em>Knoel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The plaintiff relies on <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>209 Mass. 155, 173. In that case there was evidence that the operator was representing the defendant in running the automobile and was the regularly employed chauffeur. It is to be distinguished from the case at bar on this ground. In <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>219 Mass. 160, there was evidence that the driver of the automobile was acting at the time of the accident as the defendant\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">As there was no evidence that John was at the time of the accident acting as the defendant\u2019s agent, judgment is to be entered for the defendant. .</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
