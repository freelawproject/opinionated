The declaration in each case consisted of three counts upon a separate trade acceptance, and, the plaintiff having waived the first count in one of the actions, the trial proceeded upon the remaining eleven counts. The answers were a general denial with averments of payment, and that the indorsements were <em>ultra vires </em>as to the defendant corporation, as well as the want of authority of its treasurer to make the indorsements. A copy of one of the acceptances as shown by the record, which is typical of all of them, is in these words.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201ctrade acceptance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANP\">Boston, Mass., Mar. 24, 1922 $525.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxI\">Sixty Days after date Pay to the Order of Ourselves</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">Five hundred twenty-five................00/100 Dollars</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">As per invoice of Your Account With Exchange</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">and interest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">The obligations of the acceptor hereof arises out of the purchase of goods from the drawer and such goods remain the property of said drawer, until this acceptance is paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">Value received and charge the same to the account of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">Commonwealth Pipe &amp; Supply Co.

The indorsements were in the following order: \u201cCommonwealth Pipe &amp; Supply Company by Earle L. Wheeler, Asst. Treas. Daniel Russell Boiler Works, By: Daniel Russell, Treas. Mant\u00f3n A. Wood.\u201d We shall hereinafter refer to the <em>\u201c </em>Commonwealth Pipe <em>&amp; </em>Supply Company\u201d as the drawer, and to the defendant, the Daniel Russell Boiler Works, Incorporated, as the indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\">While the \u201ctrade acceptances\u201d are to be considered as bills of exchange under G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 149, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Revere Preserving Co. </em>247 Mass. 225, 227, the question of liability between the indorser and the plaintiff is governed by the same rules as if the acceptances or bills of exchange were promissory notes. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>12 Gray, 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">It is provided in each acceptance that \u201cThe obligations of the acceptor hereof arises out of the purchase of goods from the drawer and such goods remain the property of said drawer, until this acceptance is paid\u201d; and each instrument shows upon its face that the acceptances were given in payment for goods bought under a contract of sale wherein the drawer was the conditional vendor and the acceptor, the Economy Plumbing <em>&amp; </em>Heating Co., was the conditional vendee. It is settled by <em>Sloan </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>134 Mass. 245, that at common law the acceptances were \u201csomething more than a promise to pay money, and the promise to pay money is not a promise to pay it absolutely and at all events.\u201d The words of the acceptances as quoted incorporated the contingency that .title to' the goods was to remain in the drawer until the acceptances were paid. The time fixed for payment consequently might be shortened or prolonged beyond sixty days from the date of the acceptance, when it matured and became payable. The time of payment was indefinite and uncertain. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>16 Gray, 592. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>127 Mass. 293. <em>Sloan </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra. Moore </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>167 Mass. 74. <em>Cherry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>v. <em>Sprague,, </em>187 Mass. 113, 116. <em>National Bank of Newbury </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>218 Mass. 30, 32. <em>Goodfellow </em>v. <em>Farnham, </em>236 Mass. 453, 454. <em>Nunez </em>v. <em>Dautel, </em>19 Wall. 560. The acceptances' accordingly were not negotiable instruments at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">The plaintiff, however, presses the argument that \u201cG. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 25^46 inclusive,\u201d has changed the common law, and this defence has been abrogated. But a full review of these sections and their application in connection with the present record is unnecessary. In <em>Central National Bank </em>v. <em>Hubbel, </em>258 Mass. 124, the note in suit contained a statement, that it was \u201cone of a series . . . given ... as per contract for certain apparatus, it is hereby agreed that the ownership and title of said apparatus remain in . . . [\u00a1payee] until this note is fully paid . . . .\u201d It was held that, \u201cThe negotiable instrument law affords no ground for reaching any different conclusion from that reached before it was enacted.\u201d And the cases in other jurisdictions in accordance with this result are there collected. If in that case the note was nonnegotiable under the act, because G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 23, among other provisions requires, that to be negotiable, a note or bill \u201cMust be payable on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time,\u201d the acceptances in the cases at bar also come within the rule. The plaintiff therefore took them subject to all the equities, <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Lambert, supra, </em>page 593, <em>Stults </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>119 Mass. 137, 139, and, the acceptances having been delivered to the plaintiff by the drawer with the defendant\u2019s indorsement below that of the drawer and payee, the plaintiff had notice that the defendant indorsed only for accommodation. <em>J. G. Brill Co. </em>v. <em>Norton &amp; Taunton Street Railway, </em>189 Mass. 431, 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The case of <em>State Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Pistorino, </em>245 Mass. 402, where the trial court found as a fact that the indorsement of the defendant was for the accommodation of the maker and not for the accommodation of the payee, is distinguishable. In the present cases, the trial judge states, \u201cI do not find that the plaintiff did or did not have knowledge . . . , that the defendant\u2019s indorsements were for accommodation,\u201d and it is settled that the drawer could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>not have maintained an action against the defendant. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Gaull, </em>244 Mass. 528, 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">The defendant furthermore is a trading corporation, and the judge found that the indorsements of the defendant were without consideration, and \u201cwere for the accommodation and at the.request of the Commonwealth Pipe &amp; Supply Company, and that defendant\u2019s treasurer had no express authority to indorse accommodation paper for the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">It also was uncontroverted that the negotiations which resulted in the procurement and delivery of the acceptances in the form in which they appear with the indorsements, were conducted by counsel acting in the plaintiff\u2019s behalf in a suit brought by it against the drawer. It appears in his evidence, that when he received the instruments in settlement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, he knew \u201cthat it is <em>ultra vires </em>for a corporation to indorse negotiable paper for accommodation, that when he received the instruments, he did not believe that the Daniel Russell Boiler Works had implied authority to indorse for accommodation; that the matter of accommodation did not enter his mind.\u201d It was decided in <em>Asher </em>v. <em>Raymond Skate Corp. </em>163 Mass. 1, that the treasurer of a trading or manufacturing corporation in the absence of actual authorization, had no authority to indorse accommodation paper in behalf of the corporation, and \u201cA corporation is not hable on an accommodation indorsement in the hands of one who takes with knowledge of that fact.\u201d The \u201ccorporation would not be hable on it even if it had been authorized by all the directors and the majority of the stockholders.\u201d <em>J. G. Brill Co. </em>v. <em>Norton &amp; Taunton Street Railway, supra, </em>page 437. The decision in <em>Merchants\u2019 National Bank </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Gas Light Co. </em>159 Mass. 505, rehed on by the plaintiff did not determine that accommodation paper binding on the corporation could be issued by the treasurer under his general powers as there defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The plaintiff under the order of the indorsements, as we have said, took with notice of the character of the defendant\u2019s indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The plaintiff proffered twenty-nine requests for ruhngs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>which in so far as given were sufficiently favorable to its contentions. But, for reasons already stated, the twenty-fifth request \u201cThat upon all the evidence the plaintiff is entitled to a finding,\u201d was rightly denied, and the general finding for the defendant on all the counts in each declaration must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The defendant filed in the trial court after the plaintiff had appealed to this court, a motion to dismiss the appeal because it was not seasonably prosecuted, and, the motion having been denied, the defendant appealed. This appeal, however, has not been argued, and we treat it as waived. It follows in each case that the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report is</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
