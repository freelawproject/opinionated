The judge filed a full report of material facts. The record as first printed contained no report of the evidence. Subsequently there was filed in this court what is termed \u201caddition to record\u201d which contained a part of the evidence given in the Probate Court. The testimony of one material witness, however, was not reported. It is manifest that this record is not an appeal with full report of the evidence under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 12; c. 214, \u00a7 24, 25. <em>Romanausky </em>v. <em>Skutulas, </em>258 Mass. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">If it be assumed, but without so deciding, that the \u201caddition to record\u201d is properly before us, there is nothing in it which affords any ground for modifying the report of the material facts found by the judge made under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">These material facts are that the original decree from which the appeal was taken was entered February 24, 1927; the appeal was filed on March 9, 1927. The appellant made no request to the register of probate to prepare the record of the case for entry in the Supreme Judicial Court or to obtain an estimate of the cost thereof until April 1,1927, when her counsel first spoke to him about preparing the record. On April 2,1927, the stenographer was instructed by counsel for the appellant to prepare transcript of all the evidence, which was completed on May 20, 1927. Shortly thereafter this transcript was delivered to the register of probate. On June 6, 1927, the register was prepared to give estimate of cost of printing. On June 7,1927, no deposit had been made with the register to defray the expense of printing the record. On that date decree was entered dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The judge found and ruled in substance that there had been no compliance with the statute which requires that the appeal be entered forthwith. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 135,144; c. 215, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u00a7 10. The ruling was right. There is no occasion to discuss further the pertinent questions of law since they have been fully dealt with in recent decisions. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>222 Mass. 218. <em>Silverstein </em>v. <em>Daniel Russell Boiler Works, Inc. </em>254 Mass. 137. <em>Mazzuchelli </em>v. <em>Seretto, </em>254 Mass. 159. <em>West </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>254 Mass. 161. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Roloson, </em>254 Mass. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>Decree of June 7, 1927, dismissing appeal affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
