Without narrating the evidence in further detail, plainly it might have been found that the driver of the defendant\u2019s truck did not allow a sufficient factor of safety in attempting to pass the truck in front of him under conditions where three motor vehicles, travelling at considerable speed, might have been side by side on a highway barely wide enough for such passing under the most favorable conditions. In behalf of the defendant it has been earnestly argued with careful analysis of evidence that the collision was caused by the driver of the truck in front of the defendant\u2019s truck turning somewhat toward the center of the road as the servant of the defendant attempted to pass it. The judge, however, would have been entirely justified in finding that the attempt to pass under the circumstances disclosed was in itself an act of negligence on the part of the servant of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
