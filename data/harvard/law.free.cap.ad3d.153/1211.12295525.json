David A. Arpi\u00f1o filed written objections and specifications of objections to the designating petition with the Board. At a meeting on August 4, 2017, the Board determined that, after reviewing Arpino\u2019s written objections and specifications of objections, the designating petition was invalid because it did not contain the requisite number of valid signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Krauss (hereinafter the petitioner) commenced this hybrid proceeding pursuant to Election Law article 16, and action, inter alia, pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 107 for a judgment declaring that the Board\u2019s determination to invalidate the designating petition was void based upon alleged violations of the Open Meetings Law (Public Officers Law \u00a7 100 <em>et seq.). </em>The Supreme Court, inter alia, determined that the petitioner was not entitled to the the declaratory relief requested. The petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">The objective of the Open Meetings Law is to foster public accountability by allowing citizens \u201cto observe the performance of public officials and attend and listen to the deliberations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>decisions that go into the making of public policy\u201d (Public Officers Law \u00a7 100; <em>see Matter of Perez v City Univ. of N.Y., </em>5 NY3d 522, 528 [2005]; <em>Matter of New York Univ. v Whalen, </em>46 NY2d 734, 735 [1978]). In furtherance of this objective, courts are empowered, in their discretion and upon \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d to declare void any action taken by a public body in violation of the Open Meetings Law (Public Officers Law \u00a7 107 [1]). \u201cInclusion by the Legislature of this language vesting in the courts the discretion to grant remedial relief makes it abundantly clear that not every breach of the \u2018Open Meetings Law\u2019 automatically triggers its enforcement sanctions\u201d <em>(Matter of New York Univ. v Whalen, </em>46 NY2d at 735). Here, even if the Board\u2019s meeting to review objections to the petitioner\u2019s designating petition, which did not involve deliberation on a matter of public policy, could be deemed subject to the Open Meetings Law, the petitioner failed to show good cause why, as a sanction for any technical violations of the Open Meetings Law, the Supreme Court should have exercised its discretion to invalidate the Board\u2019s determination <em>(see Matter of Edwards v Incorporated Vil. of Hempstead, </em>122 AD3d 627, 629 [2014]; <em>Matter of Imburgia v Procopio, </em>98 AD3d 617, 619 [2012]; <em>see also Matter of Max v Ward, </em>107 AD3d 1597, 1600 [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-3\">The remaining contention of the Board and Arpi\u00f1o is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">Since this is, in part, a declaratory judgment action, the matter must be remitted to the Supreme Court, Suffolk County, for the entry of a final order/judgment, inter alia, declaring that the Board\u2019s determination invalidating the designating petition was not void for failure to comply with the Open Meetings Law <em>(see Lanza v Wagner, </em>11 NY2d 317 [1962]).</p>\n<judges id=\"AP8f\">Dillon, J.P., Chambers, Cohen and Brathwaite Nelson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
