On the facts of this case, summary judgment was appropriate. We affirm. <em>Gay v. Ocean Transport &amp; Trading LTD, </em>and <em>Guerra </em>v. <em>Bulk Transport Corp., </em>5 Cir. 1977, 546 F.2d 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">The plaintiff, an employee of the Pate Stevedoring Company, was injured while cleaning a cargo hold on board the M/V Nichibu Maru. The cleaning procedure utilized a forklift and a portable rack or platform attached to the blades of the forklift, both supplied by and belonging to the stevedore. Longshoremen with brooms standing in the rack or cage would be raised by the forklift to a position where they could sweep the sides of the hold. Brown was the operator of the forklift.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">Several hours before his accident, Brown reported to his stevedore supervisor-header that the rack in use during the cleaning operation was too large for the forklift he was using and requested permission to use a smaller rack, which was available ashore. The stevedore header, in turn, relayed this information to the stevedore foreman. Despite their knowledge that an oversized rack was being used in the cleaning operation, the stevedore supervisory personnel decided not to utilize the smaller rack, apparently because the smaller rack was ineffective in cleaning the higher parts of the hold and because the larger rack had been used once before without incident. After this decision, Brown resumed work without complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">When it eventually became necessary to move the lift and rack to another position in the hold, Brown, realizing the unsteadiness of the equipment and fearing that the rack would fall, told the longshoremen to get off the rack. They did. While he was moving the lift and rack to the second position, the rack began to rock back and forth, and it then fell backward striking Brown on the head, and causing the injuries he complains of in this case. At the time of the accident, the forklift was not equipped with a protective overhead guard, as is required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1918.73(b). Brown was not wearing a protective hat prescribed by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1918.105(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">Brown asserts two bases for his negligence action against the shipowner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>First, he contends that the defendant shipowner had actual or constructive knowledge of the danger and had a duty to alleviate it, either because some members of the ship\u2019s crew were involved in a supervisory capacity in the cleaning operation or because some of the crew members were present in the cargo hold and aware of the danger of using the larger rack. Second, he argues that the shipowner was negligent in not enforcing the applicable longshoring health and safety regulations that were violated. Because this second contention is more readily disposed of, we deal with it first.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">As 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1918.2(b) states,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as we emphasized in <em>Gay v. Ocean Transport &amp; Trading Co., </em>5 Cir. 1977, 546 F.2d 1233 (No. 75-2729), the Longshoring Safety and Health Regulations apply only to employers; they do not automatically impose a duty \u201con owners, operators, agents or masters of vessels unless such persons are acting as employers\u201d. <em>Gay v. Ocean Transport &amp; Trading Co., </em>5 Cir. 1977, at 1239 n.9. Brown does not suggest that he was an employee of the M/V Nichibu Maru or that he was employed by anyone other than the Pate Stevedoring Company. It was thus Pate\u2019s responsibility, not that of the defendant shipowner, to comply with the regulations requiring that forklifts be equipped with protective overhead guards and mandating that employees wear protective hats. Brown\u2019s attempt to foist the duty of complying with these health and safety regulations upon the shipowner is simply an attempt to employ \u201cexactly the type of liability without fault concept from which Congress sought to free vessels by the passage of the 1972 Amendments [to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d. <em>Gay v. Ocean Transport &amp; Trading Co., </em>at 1239. Such an effort must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">Brown\u2019s second basis for negligence liability \u2014 the shipowner\u2019s knowledge of the dangerous condition presented by the oversized rack \u2014 presents a more difficult question for summary judgment disposition. Because Brown asserts that, given the chance at trial, he could prove that the defendant shipowner knew of the hazardous hold-cleaning operation, we can affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment for the defendant only if that proof would still not avail Brown a cause of action against the vessel. In <em>Gay, </em>this Court held that in suits under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act against vessels for negligence, the land-based negligence principles found in the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) \u00a7\u00a7 342, 343, and 343 A are to be applied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>impose a duty on a possessor of property to inform invitees (including employees asked to work on the property) of any dangerous conditions present on the property that he knows or should reasonable know about; relieve the possessor of this duty if invitees should reasonably be expected to discover or realize the danger on their own; but reimpose a duty on the possessor to alleviate the danger if he should reasonably anticipate that invitees might be harmed despite their awareness of the danger. In Gay\u2019s companion case, <em>Guerra v. Bulk Transport Corp., </em>5 Cir. 1977, 546 F.2d 1233, we affirmed a judgment for the defendant vessel where the accident-causing danger \u201cwas open and obvious and as well known to the shipowner as it was to the stevedore\u201d. <em>Guerra </em>differs from the instant case, however, in that there was a finding by the district court in <em>Guerra </em>that \u201cthe stevedore\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of Guerra\u2019s injury\u201d. At 1242. Although there was no such finding by the district court in this case, the same considerations that caused us to affirm the judgment in <em>Guerra </em>lead us to approve the summary judgment granted the defendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">First, the hazard that ultimately caused Brown\u2019s injuries was completely the creation of the stevedore\u2019s employees; the unstable rack was not present on the ship before Pate\u2019s crew started to clean the hold nor after they finished the job. Second, the stevedore\u2019s employees were in a far better position to abate the danger than any of the members of the ship\u2019s crew. Indeed, two of the stevedore\u2019s supervisory personnel were informed of the dangerous misfit between rack and lift by the employee eventually injured because of it and they deliberately decided to do nothing to remedy the precarious situation. It would be unreasonable to expect members of the ship\u2019s crew, who are bound to have less knowledge about steve-doring operations than the stevedore\u2019s own employees, to recognize and remedy a non-obvious, technically dangerous situation where the stevedore\u2019s own supervisory personnel would not. Finally, not only was the plaintiff here acutely aware of the hazardous condition, but he was the person best able to appreciate the potential consequences of the danger and he was also in a position of personal control over it. Brown\u2019s knowledge and appreciation of and control over the dangerous condition in this case constitute an interplay with the hazardous situation that is far different in degree and nature than the awareness of a danger that could be construed as contributory negligence or assumption of the risk\u2014 two defenses that are not available to defendants in negligence suits brought under \u00a7 905 of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a). Like the misplaced stack of pallets in <em>Guerra, </em>the unstable rack here \u201cwas not the type of danger that must be faced notwithstanding knowledge\u201d. <em>Guerra v. Bulk Transport Corp., 5 </em>Cir. 1977, at 1242. Although even the high degree of knowledge, appreciation, and control possessed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Brown would not automatically preclude a plaintiff\u2019s recovery in a Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act negligence suit, when coupled with the pri- or two considerations \u2014 namely (1) the hazard was solely the product of the stevedore\u2019s work on the ship and (2) the ship\u2019s personnel were far less capable of correcting the situation than the stevedore\u2019s own employees, who knew about the danger and refused to rectify it \u2014 there could be no duty owed by the ship to Brown as a matter of law, even if the ship\u2019s crew was aware of the danger posed by the unstable rack. The district court\u2019s summary judgment for the defendant is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"A2T\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\">. Brown does not appeal the dismissal of his unseaworthiness action against the shipowner. The dismissal of this action was appropriate under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b), which, in part, provides that \u201c[t]he liability of the vessel under this subsection shall not be based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>warranty of seaworthiness or a breach thereof at the time the injury occurred\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1918.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">(a) The responsibility for compliance with the regulations of this part [the Safety and Health Regulations for Longshoring] is placed upon \u201cemployers\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1918.3(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">(b) It is not the intent of the regulations of this part to place additional responsibilities or duties on owners, operators, agents or masters of vessels unless such persons are acting as employers, nor is it the intent of these regulations to relieve such owners, operators, agents or masters or vessels from responsibilities or duties now placed upon them by law, regulation or custom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1918.3(c) defines \u201cemployer\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">The term \u201cemployer\u201d means an employer any of whose employees are employed, in whole or in part, in longshoring operations or related employments, as defined herein within the Federal maritime jurisdiction on the navigable waters of the United States.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-15\">.
