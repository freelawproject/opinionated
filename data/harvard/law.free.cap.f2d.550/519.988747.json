At his initial parole hearing these were applied and he was found ineligible for parole. His case was continued for 36 months, the maximum period permitted under the regulations at the time. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.14(d) (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Andrino filed a motion for modification of sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in November 1975. He contended that the district court would not have imposed the same sentence had it known the parole guidelines would be applied to postpone his parole. The district court, after a hearing, relied upon <em>Kortness v. United States, </em>514 F.2d 167 (8th Cir. 1975), and modified the sentence so that all sentences would be served concurrently. The Government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In <em>Kortness v. United States, supra, </em>the Eighth Circuit held that a sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2) without knowledge of the parole policy guidelines followed by the Board of Parole, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.1 <em>et seq., </em>was a sentence \u201cotherwise subject to collateral attack\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and that the sentencing court therefore had authority to modify the sentence. <em>Accord, United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>538 F.2d 1005 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>contra, Thompson v. United States, </em>536 F.2d 459 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>cf. United States </em>v. <em>Slutsky, </em>514 F.2d 1222 (2d Cir. 1975) [unawareness of Board\u2019s guidelines mandated district court\u2019s reconsideration of sentence on prisoner\u2019s motion under Fed.R. Crim.P. 35].</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Our Circuit has not adopted the <em>Kortness </em>rationale, with or without the limitation of <em>United States v. White, </em>540 F.2d 409 (8th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline to do so in this case. Rather, we adhere to the view that we expressed in <em>Tedder v. United States Board of Parole, </em>527 F.2d 593, 594, n.1 (9th Cir. 1975), that a petition for habeas corpus, rather than a Section 2255 motion, is the proper vehicle for obtaining judicial review of parole board decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Cf. Ridenour v. United States, </em>446 F.2d 57 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">The district court could not treat the Section 2255 motion as a misbranded habeas petition, because the writ can only be sought from a district court with jurisdiction over the prisoner or his custodian. <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court, </em>4-10 U.S. 484, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973). That condition was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">Vacated and remanded to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">. The five-year sentences were imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2). The two-year sentences were imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a). Both statutes provide for parole \u201cas the Board of Parole shall determine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\">. The current regulations provide for meaningful consideration of parole not later than the one-third point of the sentence. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.14(d), (e) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-16\">. The <em>Kortness </em>court may have been influenced by the Eighth Circuit\u2019s rule that decisions to grant or deny parole are not subject to judicial review. <em>Brest v. Ciccone, </em>371 F.2d 981 (8th Cir. 1967). In contrast, our Circuit permits limited judicial review. <em>E. g., Grattan v. Sigler, </em>525 F.2d 329 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
