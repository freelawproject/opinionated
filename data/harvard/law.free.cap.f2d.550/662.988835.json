We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-18\">The pertinent statutory provisions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-19\">PART 6. \u2014 TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY1\">ft#####</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aid\">Subpart B. \u2014 Motor Vehicles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH30\">Tractors (except tractors in item 692.40 and except automobile truck tractors), whether or not equipped with power take-offs, winches, or pulleys, and parts of such tractors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS6\">692.30 Tractors suitable for agricultural use, and parts thereof............. Free</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYXH\">692.35 Other................ 5.5% ad val. (as modified byT.D. 68-9)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-27\">The merchandise consists of tractors, denominated \u201c \u2018Tree Farmer\u2019 Skidder Machines\u201d in appellee\u2019s protest and \u201cTree Farmer\u201d by the manufacturer. They are predominantly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> used to \u201cskid\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> logs from the site where trees are felled. Their design and construction make them particularly suitable for this use: four large rubber-tired wheels, four-wheel drive, articulated (hinged in the middle) steering, logging arch and winch, and high ground clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-28\">The Customs Court held that the involved tractors are suitable for agricultural use for purposes of item 692.30, TSUS, on the basis that the harvesting of a timber crop is an agricultural pursuit and skidding of logs is a part of that harvesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-29\">Appellant\u2019s position is that this holding was erroneous, because: (1) even assuming that harvesting a timber crop is a part of forestry and that logging is a part of that harvesting, neither logging nor forestry comes within the common or commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>meaning <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the tariff term \u201cagricultural\u201d; (2) even if forestry is an agricultural pursuit, logging does not fall within the practice of forestry; and (3) Congress did not intend that logging tractors be included within the tariff provision for tractors suitable for agricultural use.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">This court, in interpreting the words \u201csuitable for use,\u201d has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aiq-dedup-0\">suitability does not require that the merchandise be chiefly used for the stated purpose . . but it does require more than \u201c * * * evidence of a casual, incidental, exceptional, or possible use. * * * \u201d . . .

Thus, in determining whether the involved tractors are \u201csuitable\u201d for agricultural use, it is not necessary to consider their use in skidding logs in national forests (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 471 et seq.) or in state forests (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 567a et seq.). It would be sufficient if there is a substantial use in skidding logs on farms, including tree farms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two major lexicons that were contemporaneous to the enactment of the TSUS define \u201cfarm\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1961)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\"><em>farm . . </em>. any tract of land (whether consisting of one or more parcels) devoted to agricultural purposes <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary </em>(1963)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-16\"><em>farm 1. </em>a tract of land ... devoted to agriculture .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">In <em>Border Brokerage Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>65 Cust.Ct. 277, 289, C.D. 4089, 343 F.Supp. 1396, 1404 (1970),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it was noted that \u201cin 1941 a major timber company began the practice of tree farming which has become widespread.\u201d The opinion concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-18\">The cultivation of trees in a nursery or tree farm is clearly embraced within the meaning of agriculture as described in dictionaries and technical sources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGu9\">Appellee\u2019s witness, Harry Fisher, president of a logging company in Minnesota, defined a \u201ctree farm\u201d as \u201ca plantation where trees have been planted for the production of timber.\u201d He testified that he had seen timber being harvested on a tree farm by Tree Farmer log skidders. Appellee\u2019s witness, Walter Furgat, president of a tractor equipment dealership in Vermont (its territory was Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut), which had sold some 75 new and 200 used Tree Farmer log skidders to \u201cfarmers and woodsmen,\u201d testified that over a ten-year period he had seen farmers use the skidders to bring out full-length trees from the woods on their own land (including dairy farms). Appellee\u2019s witness, Horace Johnson, an equipment dealer in South Carolina, who had sold around 150 Tree Farmer log skidders over a five-year period, testified that he had observed the skidders being, used \u201cevery day\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>and that their use included harvesting (skidding) the crop 10 or 15 years after planting. On cross-examination he stated: \u201cWe had a natural growth of timber years ago. Now, we have the farming of timber.\u201d None of appellant\u2019s witnesses contradicted the above-described uses, and its witness, Samuel Hudson, a County Forester for two counties under the Department of Forest and Parks of the State of Vermont, testified that he had seen a log skidder being used on a wood lot connected with a farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">As noted by the Customs Court, <em>The Book of the States </em>(Council of State Governments, Lexington, Ky.) Vol. XX (1974-75) 488, shows that 60 percent of the Nation\u2019s commercial forest land \u201cis in farms and other nonindustrial holdings involving over 4 million landowners.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The significance of farm forest land is shown by the report of the House Committee on Agriculture (H.R.Rep. No. 536, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 10 (1949) U.S.Code Cong.Serv.1949, p. 2231), accompanying H.R. 2296, which was enacted October 26, 1949 (Pub.L. No. 392, 63 Stat. 909).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">Out of the 461,000,000 acres of commercial forest area in the United States, 344,973,000 acres are under private ownership. . . . [0]nly 50,672,000 acres of this privately owned land are in large forest tracts. . . . 261,385,000 acres are in small tracts of less than 5,000 acres each. These small tracts of forest land are owned by 4,225,000 different private owners, and the average size of the individual holdings is only 62 acres.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">The Forest Service estimates that approximately 85 percent of the privately owned forest land in the United States is in tracts of less than 100 acres each. Part of these tracts are in contiguous forest areas, but many others are in farm wood lots and small forest areas scattered throughout the farming regions of the United States. U.S.Code Cong.Serv.1949, p. 2238.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">Two sections of the Act of October 26, 1949, which are pertinent to our analysis were codified as a part of Chapter 3 \u2014 FORESTS; FOREST SERVICE; REFORESTATION; MANAGEMENT, under Title 16. \u2014CONSERVATION. They provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-15\">\u00a7 567. Cooperation by Secretary of Agriculture with States in procuring, and so forth, forest-tree seeds and plants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-16\">The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed to cooperate with the various States in the procurement, production, and distribution of forest-tree seeds and plants, for the purpose of establishing forests, windbreaks, shelter belts, and farm wood lots upon denuded or nonforested lands within such cooperating States ... to the end that forest-tree seeds or plants so procured, produced, or distributed shall be used effectively for planting denuded or nonfor-ested lands in the cooperating States and growing timber thereon. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-17\">\u00a7 568. Cooperation by Secretary of Agriculture with States in establishing, and so forth, wood lots, shelter belts, windbreaks .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-18\">The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed, in cooperation with the land grant colleges and universities of the various States or, in his discretion, with other suitable State agencies, to aid farmers through advice, education, demonstrations, and other similar means in establishing, renewing, protecting, and managing wood lots, shelter belts, windbreaks, and other valuable forest growth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>and in harvesting, utilizing, and marketing the products thereof. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Also to be noted is 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 562a, enacted July 3,1926, as Pub.L. No. 488, 44 Stat. 838 (\u201cAn Act To authorize the establishment and maintenance of a forest experiment station in the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys\u201d), which authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cto determine the best methods for the growing, management, and protection of timber crops on forest lands and farm wood lots.\u201d The Senate Committee Report (S.Rep. No. 891, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1926)), quoted a letter of approval of the bill (S. 3405) from the Acting Secretary of Agriculture, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">Standing timber in the United States has been one of the most stable commodities in value, much more so in fact than of any other product of the land. Timber crops raised on farm woodlots should therefore be of great importance as a phase of diversified farming in making possible returns to the farmer during times of agricultural depression. I regard the establishment of an Ohio-Mississippi Valley station as of particular significance and importance for this reason. It offers the possibility in my judgment of constructive aid to agriculture of great importance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The House Committee in its report (H.R. Rep. No. 1430, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. (1926)), quoted a similar letter from the Acting Secretary and said (p. 2): \u201cThe reason for setting this region [Ohio-Mississippi Valleys] off from the territories assigned to other stations is the occurrence of its forests almost exclusively in farm wood lots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">In view of the foregoing, we are satisfied that there is a substantial use of Tree Farmer log skidders in skidding logs on farms, including tree farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The key issue is whether such use is \u201cagricultural\u201d for purposes of item 692.30, TSUS. The two previously-cited major lexicons contain the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATZ\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1961)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\"><em>agriculture </em>\u2014 a: the science or art of cultivating the soil, harvesting crops, and raising livestock: tillage, husbandry, farming <em>b </em>: the science or art of the production of plants and animals useful to man and in varying degrees the preparation of these products for man\u2019s use and their disposal (as by marketing).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\"><em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary </em>(1963)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\"><em>agriculture </em>... 1. The cultivation of the soil for food-products or any other useful or valuable growth of the field or garden; tillage; husbandry; also, by extension, farming, including any industry practiced by a cultivator of the soil in connection with such cultivation, as forestry, fruit-raising, breeding and rearing of stock, dairying, market-gardening, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">It is to be noted that Webster\u2019s definition includes \u201charvesting crops\u201d and \u201cthe production of plants,\u201d which includes trees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Taken in context, \u201ccrops\u201d obviously relates to \u201cplants.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls\u2019 </em>definition includes forestry. The tariff term \u201cagricultural\u201d is old, going back at least to its use in the phrase \u201cAgricultural implements,\u201d which appeared under the Free List in paragraph 391 of the Tariff Act of 1913, Pub.L. No. 16, 38 Stat. 114,152. Contemporaneous editions of the above-cited major lexicons defined \u201cagriculture\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axq-dedup-0\"><em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary </em>(1913)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-17\"><em>agriculture </em>. . . Art or science of cultivating the ground, including harvesting of crops and rearing and man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>agement of live stock; tillage; husbandry; farming; in a broader sense, the science and art of the production of plants and animals useful to man, including to a variable extent the preparation of these products for man\u2019s use. In this broad use it includes farming, horticulture, and forestry</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ6\"><em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary </em>(1913)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\"><em>agriculture </em>[definition identical to that in 1963 edition of <em>New Standard Dictionary]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Although the word \u201cforestry\u201d was subsequently dropped from the <em>Webster\u2019s </em>definition, while <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls </em>continued to include it, \u201charvesting crops\u201d and \u201cthe production of plants\u201d remained in the definition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\"> That Congress has long intended \u201cagriculture\u201d to be most broadly defined is shown by the Act of May 15,1862, ch. 72,12 Stat. 387, establishing the Department of Agriculture, which provided, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al4\">That there is hereby established at the seat of Government of the United States a Department of Agriculture, the general designs and duties of which shall be to acquire and to diffuse among the people of the United States useful information on subjects connected with agriculture in the most general and comprehensive sense of that word .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Similar language appears in the law today (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201). The intent that \u201cagriculture\u201d be most broadly defined is further shown by 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 427, enacted August 14, 1946, as Pub.L. No. 733, 60 Stat. 1082 (\u201cAn Act to Provide for further research into basic laws and principles relating to agriculture . . . \u201d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress to promote the efficient production and utilization of products of the soil as essential to the health and welfare of our people and to promote a sound and prosperous agriculture and rural life as indispensable to the maintenance of maximum employment and national prosperity. It is also the intent of Congress to assure agriculture a position in research equal to that of industry which will aid in maintaining an equitable balance between agriculture and other sections of our economy. For the attainment of these objectives, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed to conduct and to stimulate research into the laws and principles underlying the basic problems of agriculture in its broadest aspects, including . research relating to the conservation, development, and use of land, forest, and water resources for agricultural purposes</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Such Congressional intent is similarly shown by 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 361b, enacted August 11, 1955, as Pub.L. No. 352, 69 Stat. 671 (\u201cAn Act . . . relating to the appropriation of Federal funds for the support of agricultural experiment stations . .\u201d), which provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-15\">It shall be the object and duty of the State agricultural experiment stations through the expenditure of the appropriations hereinafter authorized to conduct original and other researches, investigations, and experiments bearing directly on and contributing to the establishment and maintenance of a permanent and effective agricultural industry in the United States, including researches basic to the problems of agriculture in its broadest aspects .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">See <em>United States v. S. S. Perry, </em>25 CCPA 282, 286, T.D. 49395 (1938). Further evidencing this intent and, in our view, deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>sive of the key issue<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in this case is the following statement in the previously-cited 1949 House Committee on Agriculture Report, <em>supra </em>at 10-11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\">The time has come, however, when we must depend for much of our future timber supplies on these <em>small forests and woodlands where trees are planted and harvested just as any other crop. </em>To assure ourselves an adequate supply of timber products, <em>the farmers who own these small areas of woodland </em>must be convinced that trees can be produced as a profitable crop to them, and assisted] in establishing this type of forest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">The general lack of productive management of small forest properties is the core of this Nation\u2019s forest problem. Three fourths of our commercial forest land is privately owned; 76 percent of this is in more than 4,000,000 small properties averaging only 62 acres each; <em>about one-half of these small-area forest lands are on farms .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">Under the authority of this section, extension foresters working through the State agricultural colleges and in co-operation with the county agents, will carry on a forestry educational program. <em>Working with farmers and farm groups, </em>they will perform the important function of interesting farmers in forestry and sound forest management, showing them how <em>timber can be made a profitable crop for them </em>and how it fits into their soil conservation and <em>general farm program, </em>and persuading farmers to handle their timber crop with the same businesslike methods they apply to other crops. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">In light of the long-standing intent of Congress that \u201cagriculture\u201d be most broadly defined and of the legislative history of current laws showing that Congress has, since well before enactment of the TSUS, regarded the harvesting of a timber crop on a farm to be like any other crop in a general farm program, we hold that the use of Tree Farm log skidders in skidding logs on farms, including tree farms, is part of the process of harvesting timber crops and that such use is \u201cagricultural\u201d for purposes of item 692.30, TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">In urging that \u201cCongress did not intend logging tractors to be included within the tariff provision for tractors suitable for agricultural use,\u201d appellant relies on the <em>Standard Industrial Classification Manual </em>(1957) (\u201cSICM\u201d) showing that logging activities are categorized separately (under Major Group 24, Lumber and wood products) from agricultural activities (under Major Group 01); also that logging equipment is an exemplar under Group No. 353 for Construction, Mining, and Materials Handling Machinery and Equipment, whereas Farm Machinery and Equipment is covered separately under Group No. 352. In this connection, we note the following statement in the <em>Tariff Classification Study, Submitting Report </em>8 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">The \u201cBrussels Nomenclature\u201d and the \u201cStandard Industrial Classification Manual\u201d exerted the greatest influence [from among the number of tariff, commodity, and industrial .classification systems studied] on the arrangement of the proposed revised schedules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">However, we agree with the Customs Court\u2019s statement in <em>M. Hohner Inc. v. United States, </em>63 Cust.Ct. 496, 500-01, C.D. 3942 (1969), regarding the usefulness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Brussels Nomenclature (which is equally applicable to the SICM):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">It is true that the <em>Brussels Nomenclature </em>is a useful and helpful source of legislative history with respect to the tariff schedules when a nexus can be found between it and the tariff schedule provisions by the use of identical or similar phraseology. ... On the other hand where the order, language and phraseology of <em>Brussels </em>differ from the provisions of the tariff schedules, <em>Brussels </em>does not serve as a guide to the intention of Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-6\"><em>Cf. F. L. Smidth &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>C.A.D. 958, 409 F.2d 1369, 1375, 56 CCPA 77, 83-84 (1969). We find no \u201cnexus\u201d (and appellant has not shown any) between the cited groupings in the SICM and the TSUS. Indeed, the TSUS items in issue (692.30 and 692.35) both appear under Subpart B. \u2014 Motor Vehicles, in Part 6, Transportation Equipment, of Schedule 6, Metals and Metal Products. Although logs and timber (item 200.35) are classified in the TSUS under Schedule 2, Wood and Paper, and not under Schedule 1, Animal and Vegetable Products, this does not evidence an intention that logs should be considered other than an agricultural product \u2014 any more than the classification of wool, cotton, and other vegetable fibers under Schedule 3, Textile Fibers and Products, indicates that these products should be so considered. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s reliance on the SICM is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The Tree Farmer log skidders are \u201csuitable for agricultural use\u201d for purposes of item 692.30, TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">The judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-14\">.

Appellant argues that the tariff term \u201cagricultural\u201d relates to farm equipment utilized by a farmer on a farm, for manipulating farm crops. However, we agree with the Customs Court that \u201cit matters not who uses the Tree Farmer, that is, whether the trees are harvested by commercial loggers, farmers, or itinerant laborers.\u201d Appellant cites the quotation from <em>Staalkat of America, Inc. v.

However, the cited lexicons draw no distinction on the basis of length of time for a crop to mature; moreover, as pointed out in Wackerman, Hagenstein &amp; Michell, <em>Harvesting Timber Crops </em>7 (1966), \u201cmost forests are managed for an even harvest flow year-by-year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\">. Appellant points out that, of the fourteen witnesses who testified, four were employed as loggers and \u201cwere in agreement that, as loggers, they did not work on farms and did not consider themselves to be farmers.\u201d From this, appellant argues that \u201cthe people engaged in logging as a commercial endeavor do not consider their work to be agricultural in nature.\u201d However, such testimony on a question of law can hardly be considered binding on this court. <em>United States v. O. Brager-Larsen, </em>36 CCPA 1, 3, C.A.D. 388 (1948). The same is to be said for the testimony of one of appellant\u2019s witnesses, a union official, that unionized skid-der operators are members of the International Woodworkers of America, v/hich does not represent agricultural or farm workers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\">. The record clearly supports a conclusion that the skidding of logs is a part of the process of harvesting a timber crop. Although appellant argues that log skidding is \u201clogging\u201d and that \u201clogging\u201d is a function of the lumbering industry, this would not make the function any less \u201cagricultural.\u201d Nor does the fact that harvesting a timber crop on a farm is a forestry practice make such harvesting any the less \u201cagriculture.\u201d Long ago this court observed that \u201c \u2018agriculture\u2019 in its broad application may extend into and include elements of <em>allied </em>industries and pursuits . . . <em>United States v. Boker &amp; Co., </em>6 Ct.Cust.Appls. 243, 244, T.D. 35472 (1915). In <em>Border Brokerage, supra, </em>65 Cust.Ct. at 286, 343 F.Supp. at 1402, it was stated that lumber is \u201cadmittedly an agricultural product.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
