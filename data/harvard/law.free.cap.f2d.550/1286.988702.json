We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-21\">Appellant argues that the administrative law judge did not give sufficient weight to his subjective complaints of pain. For the reasons recited in the lower court\u2019s opinion, we hold that there was substantial evidence for discrediting this testimony. Additionally, there was no error in the Secretary\u2019s determination that there were positions appellant could hold in his region, even with his reduced vision, back and leg pains, and hemorrhoidal discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-22\">The only issue that is raised before us that was not addressed by the district court is whether the Secretary\u2019s determination must be rejected because the administrative law judge did not explicitly state that she was discrediting the claimant\u2019s subjective testimony of the extent of his pain. The factual context in which this argument arises is a pair of hypothetical questions which the administrative law judge posed to the vocational expert. In the first, she presented the appellant\u2019s vision problems, as described by the ophthalmologist, and the limitations on his physical activity as found by the doctor most supportive of the claimant, his treating physician, Dr. Jorge E. Sanchez Rosado. She also gave some credence to appellant\u2019s claim of \u201cdiscomfort caused by hemorrhoids.\u201d Dr. Puig, the vocational expert, said that he had worked \u201cwith persons with impairments similar to those of the claimant\u201d and concluded that appellant could perform specific jobs which were available in the region. In the second hypothetical, the additional factor of continuous pain requiring constant use of a cane was added, and Dr. Puig then held that the appellant could not hold the jobs he had previously named. Prior to asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>these questions, the administrative law judge stated that she was \u201cnot going to ask [the vocational expert] to evaluate the medical evidence since that\u2019s my responsibility. What I will ask him will be based on certain presumptions I will give him and I expect him to give us his opinion regarding those jobs, if any, which he believes the claimant may be able to perform.\u201d Thereafter, in her findings, she held that \u201cconsidering-the claimant\u2019s residual physical capacity and his vocational background\u201d he was able to perform those jobs about which the vocational expert had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\">Thus, in this case, there was a clear, though implicit, discrediting of appellant\u2019s subjective testimony as to the extent of his pain. Appellant would have us hold that this finding must be explicit for the denial to be upheld. The cases cited by appellant do not go this far, nor do we. <em>Baerga v. Richardson, </em>500 F.2d 309, 313 (3d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">\n<em>The order of the District Court is hereby affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
