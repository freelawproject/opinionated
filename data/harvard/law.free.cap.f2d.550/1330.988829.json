On April 26, 1976, an evidentiary hearing was held before Judge Carter of the Southern District of New York, to resolve various motions to suppress made by several of the defendants. Judge Carter denied all of the motions. On April 27. appellant Evangelista and three of the other defendants pleaded guilty to the substantive count of the indictment. Evangelista reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-22\">The trial before Judge Carter and a jury commenced on that same day. At the close of the Government\u2019s case, Judge Carter dismissed the conspiracy count on the ground that there was a variance between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>Government\u2019s theory and its proof: the Government\u2019s evidence made out a case of multiple conspiracies, rather than the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment. The defendants had also moved to dismiss the substantive count, and they now asserted that this dismissal was required by Judge Carter\u2019s dismissal of the conspiracy count. Judge Carter denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">None of the defendants offered any evidence. The substantive count went to the jury. On May 6 the jury returned guilty verdicts as to appellants Variano, Bueci, Russillo, DeMichaels, and Monaco, and one of the other defendants. Judge Carter entered judgments of conviction as to Evan-gelista on June 8, and as to the other five appellants on July 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">Each of the appellants raises several issues on appeal \u2014 the \u201cspillover\u201d of evidence from the dismissed conspiracy count to the remaining substantive count, a variance in the proof as to the substantive count, insufficiency of the evidence as to certain of the appellants, prejudice resulting from a Government witness\u2019 invocation of the Fifth Amendment and his citation for contempt in front of the jury, an illegal search and seizure, improprieties in wiretap procedure, and prejudicial remarks by a Government witness and by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">We have considered each of the issues raised very carefully and discuss several of them below. We find all of the issues to be without merit and we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">The Government\u2019s evidence established the existence of numbers, sports and horse gambling operations in the Bronx and Westchester beginning in 1968 and continuing until 1975. The cast of characters varied, but the pyramidal set-up remained essentially the same: Customers placed their bets with \u201crunners\u201d in the local candy store, soda shop, or bar. \u201cPick up\u201d men collected the wagers for the runners and brought them into the \u201cbank\u201d \u2014 the nerve center of the operation. The wagers were in envelopes bearing the runner\u2019s code on the outside. Each runner was referred to as an \u201caccount\u201d. At the bank, the wagers were tallied and when the results of the numbers, sports or horse events in question came in, the \u201chits\u201d were also tallied. A \u201ctape\u201d was then made recording each account\u2019s total tally of wagers and hits. The bank determined how much money each account owed its customers, and placed this amount in an envelope. The envelopes were delivered to the individual runners who then paid off their winning customers, after deducting their own commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">Michael Yannicelli<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was the \u201cbank\u201d of the operation here in question from 1968 until 1972. Michael Calise<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified that he worked as a \u201crunner\u201d and as a \u201cpick-up man\u201d for the operation during this period. He stated that appellant DeMichaels was one of Yannicelli\u2019s accounts. DeMichaels was what was known as a \u201chalf-sheet dealer.\u201d Rather than taking bets from customers himself, he had several runners working for him. In each week that he came out ahead \u2014 i. e., the wagers placed with his runners were greater than his customers\u2019 hits \u2014 he split his profits with Yannicelli. Conversely, when hits exceeded wagers, Yannicelli paid the customers and recovered the amount paid from DeMichaels the next time he came out ahead. Calise stated that Francis J. Millow<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was one* of DeMichaels\u2019 runners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-14\">The evidence showed that DeMichaels and Millow continued collecting wagers af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>ter 1972, but that in this later period, their accounts were with appellant Variano, rather than with Yannicelli. Variano\u2019s operation was broader than Yannicelli\u2019s \u2014 it encompassed gambling on football games, as well as on numbers and horses. Variano\u2019s one-time girlfriend, Angelina David, testified that, at Variano\u2019s request, she did the bookkeeping for the football end of the operation. David stated that she accompanied Variano to various motels where he met his pick-up men and collected their wagers and money. Each Saturday Vari-ano gave David bags containing the money and wagers. David tallied the wagers and delivered her computations to Variano. Variano received the results of the football games on Sunday night and he and appellant Bucci then determined which bettors, if any, had made \u201chits\u201d. They made a master tape of each account\u2019s wagers and hits and delivered envelopes to each account containing the money it owed its bettors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">There was evidence that Millow, and appellants Bucci, Russillo and DeMichaels all had accounts with Variano. The \u201cpick-up\u201d network appears to have been slightly more complicated than the one during the earlier \u201cYannicelli\u201d period. Bucci, Russillo and DeMichaels apparently delivered some of their wagers to Millow, who in turn phoned them to appellant Evangelista.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Evangelis-ta placed the wagers on coded slips of paper and gave them to several people, including appellant Monaco. The Government\u2019s evidence establishing this network included gambling records and paraphernalia seized from various of the appellants, physical surveillance of their comings and goings, and electronic surveillance of their telephone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-11\">At the close of the Government\u2019s case, Judge Carter determined that at least two, and possibly three, distinct time frames had been set forth. He concluded that the Government had made out a case of multiple conspiracies, rather than the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment. On the ground of this variance between the Government\u2019s theory and its proof, Judge Carter dismissed the conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-12\">DISMISSAL OP THE CONSPIRACY COUNT</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-13\">After Judge Carter dismissed the conspiracy count, appellants moved that he also dismiss the substantive count on two grounds: (1) the Government was collaterally estopped from proving the substantive count once the similar conspiracy count had been dismissed; and (2) there was a prejudicial \u201cspillover\u201d of evidence admitted solely because of the conspiracy count. Judge Carter refused to dismiss the substantive count. With this refusal we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-14\">Little need be said regarding the first prong of appellants\u2019 argument \u2014 collateral estoppel. Variano and DeMichaels contend that since the substantive statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires the participation of \u201cfive or more persons\u201d, it requires conspiratorial conduct, and thus once Judge Carter had determined that there was no single conspiracy, the Government was collaterally estopped from proving a violation of the substantive statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-15\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to the facts of this case. Judge Carter did not find that there was no conspiracy; he found that there was no <em>single </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>conspiracy. He found one conspiracy in existence during the period from 1968 to 1972, and at least one other, distinct conspiracy in the period from 1973 to 1974. In this later period Judge Carter named two groups of five persons the evidence linked to one another: Variano, Colletti, Bucci, Russillo and Millow; and Picciano, Ostran-der, Monaco, Evangelista and Murty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to the earlier period, Judge Carter named only Centore and DeMichaels, but stated that it was his recollection that \u201ca larger number of people\u201d were involved. We would add to Judge Carter\u2019s recollection the names Calise, Yannicelli, and Millow. Thus, when Judge Carter\u2019s dismissal of the conspiracy count is analyzed, it becomes clear that it had no collateral estoppel effect whatsoever on the remaining substantive count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">The second prong of appellants\u2019 argument for dismissal of the substantive count is that the dismissal of the conspiracy count removed the only reason for the prejudicial joinder of the defendants. Moreover, evidence which had been admitted solely on the ground of the conspiracy count had a \u201cspillover effect\u201d on the remaining substantive count. The law in this Circuit is clear. Appellants can only succeed in this argument if they show bad faith on the part of the Government in bringing the conspiracy charge, or if they show prejudice. <em>United States v. Aiken, </em>373 F.2d 294 (2d Cir. 1967). <em>See also, United States </em>v. <em>Bentvena, </em>319 F.2d 916 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 940, 84 S.Ct. 345, 11 L.Ed.2d 271 (1963); <em>United States v. Branker, </em>395 F.2d 881 (2d Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1029, 89 S.Ct. 639, 21 L.Ed.2d 573 (1969); <em>United States v. Miley, </em>513 F.2d 1191 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 842, 96 S.Ct. 74, 46 L.Ed.2d 62 (1975); and <em>United States v. Ong, </em>541 F.2d 331 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">Only one appellant, Bucci, alleges bad faith on the part of the Government. He states conclusorily that the Government\u2019s sole purpose in bringing the conspiracy charge was to \u201cinundate the jury with the weight of governmental activities, state and federal; spiced with violence and corruption in a mass trial.\u201d (Bucci Brief at 14.) What Bucci ignores is that the Government had good reason to believe that its conspiracy charge would be supported by its evidence at trial. The Government was counting on Millow\u2019s testimony to tie together the two time frames found by Judge Carter. Millow had been granted immunity, and thus the Government was genuinely surprised when he refused to testify. The Government\u2019s good faith in this case is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-7\">Appellants\u2019 allegations of prejudice cause us more hesitation. This Court, in the past, has looked at several factors, including the number of substantive counts, the number of defendants, the length of the trial, the extent of the permissible evidence against each defendant, and the extent of the judge\u2019s cautioning instructions to the jury. Thus in <em>United States v. Branker, supra, </em>the Court found prejudice as to three of the eight defendants, who were charged in only a few of the 80 counts, and whose names appeared in only a very small part of the transcript of the five-week trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-8\">Here, on the other hand, the trial lasted only eight days and involved only one substantive count. The only testimony which was admissible solely on account of the conspiracy was a portion of Calise\u2019s testimony on the first day of trial. Judge Carter continually instructed the jury against use of this testimony, and the jury\u2019s questions and its split verdict evidenced an understanding of these instructions. In sum, we find no prejudice resulting to defendants from their joinder at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-9\">MILLOW\u2019S INVOCATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">We also find no prejudice resulting to any of the defendants from Millow\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>citation for contempt by Judge Carter in front of the jury. Millow had been granted immunity, and the Government had no reason to suspect that he would refuse to testify when he took the stand \u2014 the Government could not conduct a dress rehearsal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">Judge Carter handled the unfortunate situation reasonably. Immediately after Millow asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege, Judge Carter excused the jury and explained to Millow that he was required to testify under his grant of immunity. Judge Carter then recalled the jury and directed the Government to ask Millow the same question he had previously refused to answer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When Millow said that he needed the assistance of his attorney because he was afraid of perjuring himself, Judge Carter cited him in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">Appellants\u2019 allegation of prejudice from this incident \u2014 that the jury was left with the impression that Millow\u2019s silence was caused by his fear of appellants \u2014 is highly speculative. Moreover, it appears to be an afterthought as none of the appellants requested a curative instruction at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">SEARCH OF MONACO\u2019S CAR</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-8\">Monaco moved to suppress the introduction of gambling records seized from his car under the following circumstances: On September 3, 1974, Officer James Trotta of the Yonkers Police Department observed Monaco driving in a car with a cracked windshield. Knowing, in addition, from a prior incident, that Monaco did not have a valid driver\u2019s license, Trotta caused Monaco to stop. After confirming that Monaco had no license, Trotta informed him that he would be issued a summons and that his car would be impounded. Trotta then entered Monaco\u2019s car to drive it to police headquarters for impoundment. As he pulled away from the curb, the gambling .records in question fell from the sun visor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">Monaco has not contested this version of the facts as testified to by Officer Trotta, and on these facts, the seizure was clearly legal. Once Trotta learned that Monaco did not have a license, it was not \u201cunwarranted either in terms of state law or sound police procedure\u201d, <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 447, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 2530-2531, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), for him to move the car off the street himself. Moreover, Trotta\u2019s entry into the car was a proper incident to Monaco\u2019s impending arrest. The lawfulness of his seizure of the gambling records which thereupon came into plain view is beyond question. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968); <em>United States ex rel. LaBelle v. LaVallee, </em>517 F.2d 750, 755 (2d Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1062, 96 S.Ct. 803, 46 L.Ed.2d 655 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-13\">THE WIRETAP EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-14\">Evangelista moved to suppress tapes of telephone conversations to which he was a party on the ground that he received no post-termination notice, in violation of N.Y. Crim.Proc.L. \u00a7 700.50(3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-15\">On November 8,1976, Westchester County Judge Richard Daronco issued a wiretap order on the phone of Anthony J. Millow. Among the conversations subsequently intercepted on this phone were several between Francis Millow and appellant Evan-gelista. Fourteen days after the termination of a renewal order for the wiretap on Millow\u2019s phone, Judge Daronco directed the issuance of notice to sixteen persons. Evangelista was not one of the sixteen. The Government\u2019s explanation is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>Evangelista\u2019s voice was not identified on the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">Since Evangelista was not named in the wiretap warrant, his right to receive post-termination notice was in the discretion of Judge Daronco. If, in fact, Evangelista\u2019s voice was not identified after reasonable efforts, then the failure to give him notice was clearly not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">Moreover, even if, as Evangelista contends, the Government should have recognized his voice on the tapes in question,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the failure to give him notice does not require suppression of the tapes. We held in <em>United States v. Principie, </em>531 F.2d 1132 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 97 S.Ct. 1173, 51 L.Ed.2d 581 (1977), that the defendant must show prejudice before a motion to suppress will be granted on the ground of a failure to give post-termination notice, in violation of N.Y.Crim.Proc.L. \u00a7 700.50(3) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d). This point, which was in dispute among the circuits, was resolved by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. </em>Donovan,-U.S.-, 97 S.Ct. 658, 50 L.Ed.2d 652 (1977). Reversing a Sixth Circuit holding that the failure to give notice, even absent a showing of prejudice, mandated suppression, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-10\">\u201cNothing in the structure of the Act [Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520] or this legislative history suggests that incriminating conversations are \u2018unlawfully intercepted\u2019 [and thus required to be suppressed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10)(a)] whenever parties to those conversations do not receive discretionary inventory notice as a result of the Government\u2019s failure to inform the District Court of their identities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-14\">The fact that discretionary notice reached 39 rather than 41 identifiable persons does not in itself mean that the conversations were unlawfully intercepted.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-19\">\u2022- U.S. at -, 97 S.Ct. at 673-674.</p>\n<p id=\"AFzb\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-21\">Evangelista, similarly, was not prejudiced by the failure to provide him with notice. Six weeks before the trial, the Government provided Evangelista with all of the orders, applications and other papers relating to the wiretaps in question, and in addition, made duplicate tape recordings available for his inspection. Thus under these circumstances, in the absence of any showing of prejudice, Judge Carter\u2019s denial of Evan-gelista\u2019s motion to suppress was correct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-22\">Convictions affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">.

Evangelista notes that he was under physical surveillance during the period of the wiretap and that at the moment of his arrest on December 31, 1974, he was on the phone and being recorded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1400-12\">. Evangelista argues that the New York wiretap statute involved here, N.Y.Crim.Proc.L. \u00a7 700.50(3), is more restrictive than the federal statute involved in <em>Donovan, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(d), and that the New York statute mandates suppression, even absent a showing of prejudice. We rejected this interpretation of the New York statute in <em>Principie, </em>531 F.2d at 1142, n. 12 and reject it again here. <em>People v. Brenes, </em>23 A.D.2d 78, 385 N.Y.S.2d 530 (1st Dept., 1976), cited by Evangelista, holds merely that suppression is mandated in the case of a \u201cblatant violation\u201d by the police of the minimization requirements of the New York statute. In that case, the police had used an automatic device which \u201ctapped and taped every single telephone conversation in full, including those concededly non-pertinent.\u201d 385 N.Y.S.2d at 532. Such a violation is a far greater interference with the \u201ccongressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures\u201d, <em>United States v.
