(hereafter the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Plaintiffs are former coal miners who submitted applications for black lung benefits to the Social Security Administration prior to July 1, 1973.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each, however, continued to work in the mines subsequent to July 1st.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue is whether plaintiffs \u201cfiled\u201d their claims within the meaning of the Act prior to July 1,1973, as is required to invoke the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (hereafter the Secretary), and consequently to take advantage of more liberal adjudicatory standards established by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">The Secretary administers only those black lung claims over which the federal government assumes sole responsibility for the payment of benefits. The following statutory sections, read in conjunction, define such claims in terms of when they must be filed:</p>\n<p id=\"b977-18\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1): \u201cNo claim for benefits under this part [Sub ch. IV, part B] on account of total disability of a miner shall be considered unless it is <em>filed </em>on or before December 31, 1973 . . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-20\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(b): \u201cNo benefits shall be paid under this part [Sub ch. IV, part B] after December 31,1973, if the claim therefor was <em>filed </em>after June 30,1973.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-21\">Thus, as will be discussed in more detail below, the federal government, under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of HEW, pays black lung benefits to claimants who file their claims on or before June 30, 1973. But as crucial to the statutory scheme as the word <em>file </em>is, nowhere in the Act is it defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-22\">Plaintiffs contend that to file is simply to submit appropriate forms in connection with a claim for benefits; the Secretary\u2019s position, sustained by the district court, is that under 20 CFR \u00a7 440.226(b) one does not \u201ceffectively file [. . .]\u201d a claim until the first month in which all requirements for entitlement to benefits are met. For reasons set forth in this opinion, we conclude that the Secretary\u2019s position is in accord with neither the language of the statute nor the intent of Congress, and we \u2022vacate the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b977-25\">The provisions of Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>as amended by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, reveal the significance of the issue under consideration in this case. The Act provided a means of assuring federal benefits to the considerable number of coal miners totally disabled by chronic lung disease as a result of their employment, but who were inadequately compensated under State law. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901; <em>see generally </em>Statement of House Managers, Conf.Rep. No. 91-761, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), 1969 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News, p. 2578 at 2603. It essentially required a claimant for disability benefits to establish (1) that he was totally disabled within the meaning of HEW regulations to be promulgated; (2) that his disability was due to pneumoconiosis (black lung disease); and (3) that such disability arose out of employment in the nation\u2019s coal mines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A series of statutory presumptions was enacted to facilitate proof of the above eligibility criteria.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">Jurisdiction for administering claims for benefits was divided between the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and such dual administration continues under the amended Act. Generally, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare administers claims under Part B of Title IV, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921-925, those filed on or before December 31, 1973; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>and the Secretary of Labor administers claims under Part C, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 931, 941, those filed after December 31,1973. See 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the Act as amended in 1972, however, jurisdiction is conferred on the Secretary of Labor over a class of interim Part B claims filed between July 1, 1973 and December 31, 1973. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(a)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The Senate Report indicates Congress was dissatisfied with the results obtained under the statute as originally enacted. See S.Rep. No. 92-743, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), 1972 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin. News, p. 2307 et seq. It was felt that many miners and survivors of miners for whose benefit the Act had been passed were failing to qualify for benefits under applicable standards. In response to this situation, Congress amended the Act in 1972 in order to facilitate the ability of claimants to qualify for black lung benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">While the 1972 amendments left intact the basic thrust of the Act, some significant changes were made. First, the amendments extended the period of federal responsibility for the payment of black lung benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under Part C of the amended Act, encompassing claims filed after December 31,1973, benefits are considered the responsibility of the coal industry. They are paid under applicable State workmen\u2019s compensation laws, provided that such laws are deemed to offer adequate coverage for black lung disability, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or, if not, through self-insurance programs. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The federal government assumes responsibility for the payment of benefits arising out of certain Part B claims, filed on or before June 30, 1973. Federal coverage extends only to the end of 1973 for claims filed in the interim period between June 30th and December 31st of that year. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1), (b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>sponsibility is upon the coal industry for the payment of benefits with respect to such claims after December 31, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">In addition to altering the transition dates from federal to private responsibility for the payment of benefits, the 1972 amendments added an additional statutory presumption of total disability due to pneu-moconiosis to aid in the qualification process. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the same time, Congress indicated its expectation that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare adopt by regulation \u201csuch interim evidentiary rules and disability evaluation criteria as will permit prompt and vigorous processing of the large backlog of claims consistent with the language and intent of these amendments.\u201d S.Rep. No. 92-743, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), 1972 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News at 2322.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">In response to this directive, the Secretary promulgated regulations entitled \u201cInterim adjudicatory rules for certain Part B claims filed by a miner before July 1, 1973, or by a survivor where the miner died before January 1, 1974.\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7 410.490.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These interim adjudicatory rules establish standards for determining total disability due to pneumoconiosis that are more lenient than the criteria applicable to claimants who filed on or after July 1, 1973.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Compare 20 CFR 410.490(b) with 20 CFR \u00a7 410.-426 so far as ventilatory studies are concerned, as well as with 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">Each of the plaintiffs has been diagnosed as suffering from \u201csimple\u201d pneumoconiosis, see <em>Usery, </em>428 U.S. at 3-7, 96 S.Ct. at 2887-2888, and is presumptively considered totally disabled due to that disease under the interim adjudicatory standards of 20 CFR \u00a7 410.490(b), if those regulations apply to him. Since the plaintiffs wish to avail themselves of the eligibility standards set forth in \u00a7 410.490(b), the importance to them of having their claims deemed filed prior to July 1, 1973 is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">In asserting his lack of jurisdiction over these cases, the Secretary relies upon the following regulation, 20 CFR \u00a7 410.226(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-15\"><em>\u201cProspective life of claims. </em>A claim which is filed before the claimant meets all the requirements for entitlement to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>benefits will be deemed a valid claim if the claimant meets such requirements for entitlement (1) before the Administration makes a final decision on such claim. . If the claimant first meets the requirements for entitlement to benefits in a month after the month of actual filing but before a final administrative or judicial decision is rendered on his claim, his claim will be deemed to have been <em>effectively filed </em>in such first month of entitlement.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">It is from this regulation that the doctrine of effective filing has been adopted. Since the presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis found in the interim regulations, 20 CFR \u00a7 410.490(b) is made rebuttable if \u201c[tjhere is evidence that the individual is, in fact, doing his usual coal mine work or comparable and gainful work,\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7 410.490(c), the Secretary argues that plaintiffs could not qualify for benefits under those regulations until they stopped working. This, of course, did not occur until \u201ca month after the month of actual filing\u201d as described in 20 CFR \u00a7 410.-226(b). The Secretary\u2019s position is, therefore, that the claims were not \u201ceffectively filed\u201d until after June 30, 1973, when all requirements for entitlement to benefits were first met.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">The Secretary has issued a formal ruling interpreting \u00a7 410.226(b) to reflect the position outlined above, which is Social Security Ruling SSR 74-32 (November, 1974) and which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-8\">\u201cWhere a coal miner files an application prior to July 1, 1973 for Black Lung Benefits pursuant to Part B of Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, as amended; . . . the Social Security Administration under authority delegated by the Secretary of HEW, has jurisdiction for paying Part B benefits provided all requirements for entitlement to these benefits are met prior to July 1,1973, and . that where a miner filed an application prior to July 1, 1973, but all requirements are not met before that date the Social Security Administration does not have jurisdiction for paying Part B benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">The Secretary, as before stated, construes his own Social Security Ruling and Regulations so that \u201crequirements for entitlement\u201d may not be met so long as a miner is working as above described, and therefore concludes that he has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">Contrary to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the Act, Regulations, and Ruling 74-32, we hold that the Secretary does have jurisdiction over the administration of the claims here, which were submitted on or before June 30, 1973. Claimants who met this filing deadline are entitled to have their claims adjudicated under the interim standards established by HEW regulations, 20 CFR \u00a7 410.490(b). We read \u201cfile\u201d as meaning no more than the submission of claim papers to the Social Security Administration, and note that this interpretation is supported by the language of similar HEW regulations. See 20 CFR \u00a7 410.227, for example.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">We are of opinion, however, that, apart from the questions of administrative jurisdiction and applicable adjudicatory standards, claimants must still prove that they were totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis as of June 30,1973 in order to qualify for lifetime federal benefits. Those who submitted claims prior to the onset of their disability in order to qualify for the more lenient standards may not measure against those standards the state of their health at some undetermined point in the future.<footnotemark>14a</footnotemark> Such a result would cut against Congressional intent in directing promulgation of the interim adjudicatory standards, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>was to facilitate processing of the then existing backlog of black lung claims,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> within the framework of a statutory scheme that envisioned a federal role of limited duration.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accord <em>Begley </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>544 F.2d 1345 at 1352, No. 75-2472 (6th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The fact that plaintiffs in these cases continued to work in the mines beyond June 30, 1973 certainly bears relevance to whether they were totally disabled on that date, and the Secretary is entitled to consider this with all the other evidence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While an administrative determination that the presumption of 20 CFR \u00a7 410.490(b) was effectively rebutted by a claimant\u2019s continued employment would be permissible under the Act and regulations, the assumption made by the Secretary in these cases, that continued employment must, as a matter of course, rebut the interim presumption of disability is erroneous.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such an approach is contrary to the Secretary\u2019s own regulation, as demonstrated below, and bears little relevance to economic realities faced by disabled miners. '</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">20 CFR \u00a7 410.490(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-11\">\u201c(c) <em>Rebuttal of presumption. </em>The presumption in paragraph (b) of this section <em>may </em>be rebutted if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-12\">(1) There is evidence that the individual is, in fact, doing his usual coal mine work or comparable and gainful work.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">It is clear from its plain wording that the regulation is permissive, rather than mandatory, as, indeed, common experience dictates that it should be. There can be little doubt that, faced with the dictates of economic necessity, some coal miners who suffer from black lung disease have the physical capacity, through ultimate exertion, of continuing to work during the pendency of their claims.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There is no inconsistency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>between the Act\u2019s definitions of total disability and the minimum state of health required to go back to the mines one more time to insure survival during the pendency of a claim. It is at once apparent that prompt administrative processing of black lung claim papers lodged with the Secretary on or before June 30, 1973 is an effective way of detecting and eliminating the spurious claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">In construing the provisions of a statute, we acknowledge our obligation to accord great deference to the interpretation adopted by the agency charged with its daily administration, <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965), and to uphold the regulation if it is reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation, <em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973). This principle is especially true when it is not a statute but an administrative regulation that is the subject of judicial inquiry. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>supra; <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-14, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945). An agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is of \u201ccontrolling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Bowles, </em>325 U.S. at 413-114, 65 S.Ct. at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Against this background, our rejection of Ruling 74-32 as applied by the Secretary is not undertaken lightly. Nevertheless, it is mandated in our opinion because the Secretary\u2019s application of \u00a7 410.226(b) and Ruling 74-32, in view of the plain language of the Act, is unduly restrictive of his own jurisdiction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Court has made clear the prerogative of the executive agencies to issue regulations \u201creasonably related\u201d to the purposes of the legislation they are charged with enforcing, <em>Mourning, </em>411 U.S. p. 369, 93 S.Ct. 1652, and to adopt reasonable interpretations of those regulations, <em>Udall, </em>380 U.S. pp. 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, without interference from the courts. But the role of the agencies remains basically to execute legislative policy; they are no more authorized than are the courts to rewrite acts of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">Congress has conferred jurisdiction on the Secretary of HEW over all claims <em>filed </em>on or before June 30, 1973. We find nothing in the language of the Act, nor in its legislative history, suggesting that Congress, when it said \u201cfiled,\u201d really meant the quite different proposition advanced by the Secretary. As the Supreme Court has said, in only a slightly different context, \u201cIn the absence of some contrary indication, we must assume that the framers of these statutory provisions intended to convey the ordinary meaning which is attached to the language they used.\u201d <em>Jones v. Liberty Glass Co., </em>332 U.S. 524, 531, 68 S.Ct. 229, 233, 92 L.Ed. 142 (1947); see <em>Crooks v. Harrelson, </em>282 U.S. 55, 60, 51 S.Ct. 49, 75 L.Ed. 156 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">We think the effective filing doctrine, insofar as it is applied to limit the jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>tion of the Secretary of HEW under the Black Lung Benefits Act, conflicts with the intent of Congress. Although Congress did not address the question in its initial enactments of the statutory scheme, which occurred well before the notion of effective filing was ever applied to limit jurisdiction, it has done so since. In its Report on the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1976 (unpassed at the time of this writing), S.Rep. No. 94-1254, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976), the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare repudiated the Secretary\u2019s position in unequivocal terms: \u201cto deny a claim which was filed by June 30, 1973 but not \u2018effectively filed\u2019 until sometime after that date and before the final administrative determination of eligibility is a perverse interpretation of the law which is cruel and unjust,\u201d and \u201c[w]hen a claim has been submitted to the Social Security Administration under Part B, it is filed for the purposes of section 414(b), even though additional evidence has been submitted before a final administrative determination of eligibility.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-1254 at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">These statements, coming from the same committee that reported the Black Lung Benefits Act to the Senate but four years ago, are persuasive indications of Congressional intent at the time of passage of the Act\u2019s amendments. In somewhat similar circumstances, the Supreme Court has considered subsequent committee declarations of congressional intent \u201cvirtually conclusive.\u201d <em>Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, </em>316 U.S. 317, 329-330, 62 S.Ct. 1095, 86 L.Ed. 1501 (1942). While it is not necessary for us to decide whether or not S.Rep. No. 94-1254 is virtually conclusive on the matter of congressional intent in this case, cf. <em>Levindale Lead and Zinc Mining Co. v. Coleman, </em>241 U.S. 432, 439, 36 S.Ct. 644, 60 L.Ed. 1080 (1916); <em>Koshkonong v. Burton, </em>104 U.S. 668, 678, 26 L.Ed. 886 (1881), we do think it is entitled to our studied consideration and find it a rather persuasive authority, although it may not bind us.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">In conclusion, because we find the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the filing requirement for jurisdictional purposes in conflict with both the language and intent of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, as amended, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case to the district court for further remand to the Secretary for action not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-13\">.

The court held that such evidence could be admitted to establish the existence of disability <em>prior </em>to June 30th.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">We likewise hold that evidence <em>of </em>continued employment after June 30, 1973 is relevant evidence of whether a claimant was totally disabled as of that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b982-16\">. In the case of Otis Taylor, for example, the hearing examiner apparently considered Taylor\u2019s employment beyond June 30, 1973 as conclusively establishing that Taylor was not totally disabled within the meaning of the Act at that date. The examiner stated, \u201cClaimant would in all probability have met the interim criteria except for the fact that he continued to work in the mines until he reached the age of 62 in December, 1973.\u201d Hearing Decision in case of Otis R.
