There was enough conflict in the testimony and enough basis for differing credibility judgments for the decision to have gone either way. And we are somewhat concerned that, while the ALJ cited this circuit\u2019s decision in <em>NLRB v. Fibers Int\u2019l Corp., </em>439 F.2d 1311, 1312 (1st Cir. 1971), in which we held that there had to be a finding of dominant motive, he found that the discharge was motivated \u201cin substantial part\u201d by union animus. Only because it is so clear from the decision as a whole that the ALJ in fact found that Loppi would not have been fired but for his union activities do we accept the Board\u2019s findings. <em>See Mt. Healthy City School District Bd. of Education v. </em>Doyle,-U.S.-,---, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). We regret that in a case as close as this the Board did not articulate the right rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-19\">We have long held this to be the rule. <em>See, e. g., NLRB v. Lowell Sun Pub. Co., </em>320 F.2d 835, 842 (1st Cir. 1963), and cases cited, and the Board has just as persistently failed to recognize it. <em>See, e. g., NLRB v. Gotham Indus., Inc., </em>406 F.2d 1306, 1309 (1st Cir. 1969). Now that the Supreme Court in <em>Doyle, </em>in the analogous first amendment area, has held that an improper consideration is not \u201csubstantial\u201d if the discharge would have occurred in any event, marrying <em>Doyle </em>to our previous cases, there can be little reason for us to rescue the Board hereafter if it does not both articulate and apply our rule. Where there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>both proper and allegedly improper grounds for discharge, its burden is to find affirmatively that the discharge would not have occurred but for the improper reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">In this case our decision, given our limited review, must be for the Board. The testimony provides sufficient support for the ALJ\u2019s and Board\u2019s conclusion that the threat to discharge and the discharge concerned protected activities, and we see no error sufficient to overcome the deference which we must give to the Board\u2019s findings where, as here, there is clearly substantial evidence to support them. <em>Cf. Goldstein v. Middendorf, </em>535 F.2d 1339,1344-45 (1st Cir. 1975). This ruling, however, should not be taken as a signal that \u201ca union organizer can do as he pleases\u201d. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Billen Shoe Co., </em>397 F.2d 801, 803 (1st Cir. 1968). The present case seems to us to have arisen out of an employee\u2019s walking close to the line. The employer\u2019s response, confined to this difficult situation, does not in our view amount to a course of conduct sufficient to support a broad order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">\n<em>Paragraph 2 of the order of the Board will be enforced.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
