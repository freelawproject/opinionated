Petition for rehearing en banc was granted. <em>Meadows v. Evans, </em>529 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1976). After additional briefing and oral argument, the en banc court has decided to adhere to the majority opinion of the panel, so that opinion now states the position of the en banc court on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-17\">Accordingly, the en banc court reverses and remands this case to the district court <em>first, </em>for consideration of any damage claims made for asserted deprivations during confinement, which can be made without exhaustion, and <em>second, </em>for consideration of whether claims going to the involuntariness of the confession, which claims cannot proceed prior to exhaustion of state Remedies, should be held in abeyance rather than dismissed in light of the statute of limitations problem inherent in dismissal.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b409-20\">GOLDBERG, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AP9\">with whom TUTTLE and GODBOLD, Circuit Judges, join, concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-21\">Judge Tjoflat has explained pointedly and persuasively why collateral estoppel provides the proper conceptual framework for dealing with the problem before the court and why the majority\u2019s approach is wholly misguided. I am pleased to join his thoughtful opinion with two brief reservations.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">First, I would emphasize that the rigors that are conditions precedent to application of collateral estoppel generally must be scrupulously observed in this context of state prisoner \u00a7 1983 claims. Judgments resting on a plea of guilty raise the most serious concerns. Because very little is \u201clitigated\u201d at the acceptance of a guilty plea, the doctrine must here be most sparingly enforced. <em>See </em>IB Moore\u2019s Federal Practice K 0.418[1], pp. 2707-08 (1974). The appellant\u2019s claim, however, is directed at the voluntariness of the plea itself. Because the state judge was constitutionally obligated to determine on the record that the plea was in fact voluntary and because the record here demonstrates that appellant was interrogated and affirmed the volun-tariness of the plea, giving the judgment collateral estoppel effect on the specific issue of the plea\u2019s voluntariness is not unwarranted. Absent either of these conditions, I see no justification for according collateral estoppel effect to a judgment resting on a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">Second, I would note that previous cases applying the doctrine elaborated by Judge Tjoflat have justified enforcement of a collateral estoppel bar in part on the availability of the federal habeas forum for redeter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>mination of the prisoner\u2019s constitutional claim. <em>See Brazzell v. Adams, </em>493 F.2d 489, 490 (5 Cir. 1974). Under the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067, however, alleged violations of the fourth amendment may not be redetermined in federal habeas proceedings once fully and fairly litigated in the state courts. Application of the doctrine developed by Judge Tjoflat to such claims would accordingly preclude any federal forum from inquiring into a fourth amendment claim litigated in state criminal proceedings. I simply note that application of collateral estop-pel to claims covered by <em>Stone </em>would raise an additional, troublesome question not involved in the case at bar.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b410-4\">AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ArZ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">I concur in the remand of this case for trial on the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s conditions of confinement in the Tarrant County Jail. However, I dissent from the en banc holding which reverses the district court and remands to permit exhaustion of state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">As to the latter portion of plaintiff\u2019s suit, it is based upon allegations of coercion and bribery of an unnamed witness and seeks damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Sheriff of Tarrant County, Texas, and \u201claw enforcement agents who acted within the Tarrant County Jail.\u201d I agree with Judge Tjoflat\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion in this regard and with the rationale there expressed that Meadows is collaterally es-topped from litigating this issue since it has been decided adversely to him twice by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals both on direct appeal of the conviction and on collateral habeas corpus. The question is, therefore, res <em>judicata </em>and Meadows is collaterally estopped from continuing to litigate it. There is no valid reason, therefore, to remand the case for further proceedings in this context when the issue has already been fully litigated and decided in the Texas courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Though I would remand the case for a hearing on the question of plaintiff\u2019s allegation as to conditions of confinement in the jail, I would otherwise affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. Under the circumstances I do not reach the question of whether this section 1983 suit may be pursued before state remedies are exhausted. <em>See also </em>my dissenting opinion in <em>Coving-ton </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 528 F.2d 1365, 1373. <em>See also Smart v. Jones, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 530 F.2d 64, and <em>Bruce v.

The majority has chosen to solve the problem by engrafting onto 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1970) the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1970) and directing the inmate to launch a collateral attack on his conviction in state court first. In my opinion this novel solution is foreclosed by the plain language of the Supreme Court in <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), and <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Moreover, in reaching its disposition the majority has elected to ignore and, thus, appears to overrule <em>sub silentio </em>previous decisions of this court which clearly suggest a reasonable solution to the problem. The shortcomings of the approach the court now adopts are best understood after reviewing the procedural history disclosed by the record before us and examining the substance of the appellant\u2019s section 1983 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">The record before the panel in this case was limited to the proceedings in the district court on appellant\u2019s section 1983 civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>rights claim. That record consisted of the appellant\u2019s pro se complaint, the report of the magistrate and the order of the district court, which adopted the findings and conclusions of the magistrate. During oral argument on rehearing en banc this court directed that the record on appeal be supplemented with the records of appellant\u2019s state and federal habeas corpus proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to these instructions an addendum to the record was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">The augmented record on appeal discloses that appellant was indicted for first degree murder in the 70th Judicial District Court of Ector County, Texas, on February 29, 1972. On April 20, 1972, that indictment was transferred to Criminal District Court No. 3 of Tarrant County, Texas, where all subsequent Texas trial court proceedings involving appellant took place. On October 4,1972, appellant pled guilty to first degree murder and received a life sentence. On September 25, 1973, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Appellant then commenced in the United States District Court the civil rights suit now receiving en banc consideration. His pro se complaint, filed June 13, 1974, was not served on the defendants,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and no answer was filed. On June 21,1974, the magistrate on his own initiative recommended dismissal of the complaint on the ground that it sought habeas corpus relief. (Appellant had not yet pursued state habeas remedies.) The district court on June 21, 1974, entered an order adopting the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusions and dismissing the case without prejudice to appellant\u2019s right to seek habeas corpus relief. The appeal from that order was lodged in this court on July 5, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">While this appeal was awaiting oral argument, appellant on September 26, 1974, commenced habeas corpus proceedings in Criminal Court No. 3 of Tarrant County, Texas. On January 27, 1975, that court entered a memorandum order recommending denial of the petition on the merits, and on February 19, 1975, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted that recommendation and denied the petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">On April 18, 1975, appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court. An answer to the petition was served on May 13, 1975. As far as can be determined from the augmented record before us, no further action occurred in that case prior to the argument of this appeal before the original panel on October 7, 1975, or the en banc court on September 9, 1976, and none has taken place since.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Appellant\u2019s complaint in the district court presented a variety of civil rights claims. Some dealt with the conditions of his confinement in the Tarrant County jail, and as to those I fully agree that they should be remanded for trial as the panel and the en banc court have decreed. It is the disposition of appellant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was coerced that in my opinion cannot be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent and the common sense approach found in our prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">Unfortunately, appellant\u2019s claim was not placed in its complete context until the record was supplemented following the en banc argument. Although the disposition fashioned by the panel and adopted today <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>might seem responsive to the record as it was presented to the district court, it clearly does not respond to the augmented record now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">A. <em>The Record Before The District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In his complaint, appellant alleged that his guilty plea was involuntary because of the treatment he received in the Tarrant County jail during his pretrial detention. He recited that he was interrogated under torture until he confessed to the murder and pled guilty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The complaint made it clear that appellant was not seeking release from custody; rather, he sought a declaration that his constitutional rights were violated and resulting damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The allegations for relief were sufficiently broad to encompass the allegedly unconstitutional guilty plea. It appeared from the complaint that appellant was serving the sentence imposed pursuant to his conviction. Nothing in the allegations indicated that the conviction had been set aside. In truth, the conviction had been affirmed on appeal in a reported decision,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> though that fact was not made known to the district court. That decision expressly held that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was valid. Thus, appellant\u2019s procedural posture in the district court was that of a convicted felon seeking damages for an allegedly invalid guilty plea which remained undisturbed and which the law treated as valid and binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">B. <em>The Record Before The En Banc Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">We now have the benefit of the augmented record, including the memorandum order of the Tarrant County Court that recites the reasons why appellant\u2019s state habeas corpus petition was denied. The order indicates that before appellant\u2019s guilty plea was accepted he was sworn as a witness and, after being advised of his right to remain silent, identified his written confession, stated that it was voluntary and confessed his guilt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court found the confession and plea to be voluntary<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and recommended the denial of the habeas petition by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. As has been pointed out <em>supra, </em>the recommendation was adopted and the petition was denied. Thus, the very issue the majority would have appellant litigate in state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>under the exhaustion doctrine has been explicitly decided by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals not only once but twice, on direct appeal and on collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">It is unclear to me from a reading of the majority opinions in this case and <em>Fulford v. </em>Klein,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> its companion, whether the district court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a claim which draws in issue a matter necessarily litigated in a yet undisturbed state court criminal proceeding or whether the district .court possesses jurisdiction but cannot exercise it unless and until the state remedies paralleling the habeas statute<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> have been exhausted. The suggestion that the district court, when faced with a claim about to be barred by the statute of limitations, ought to consider holding the civil rights claim in abeyance<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> implies that an inmate may invoke the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction without exhausting his state remedies. Whichever construction is given these majority opinions, however, the result is the same: the inmate is precluded from prosecuting a section 1983 damages claim without first commencing and concluding state court litigation. This result was expressly rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Preiser. </em>It unambiguously explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">[T]he respondents here sought no damages, but only equitable relief \u2014 restoration of their good-time credits \u2014 and our holding today is limited to that situation. If a state prisoner is seeking damages, he is attacking something other than the fact or length of his confinement, and he is seeking something other than immediate or more speedy release \u2014 the traditional purpose of habeas corpus. In the case of a damages claim, habeas corpus is <em>not </em>an appropriate or available federal remedy. Accordingly, as [the State itself] concede[s], a <em>damages action by a state prisoner could be brought under the Civil Rights Act in federal court without any requirement of prior exhaustion of state remedies. </em>411 U.S. at 494, 93 S.Ct. at 1838. (emphasis added in part) (cite omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">The Court reiterated this stand in <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), and, thus, the notion that the exhaustion doctrine applies in section 1983 prisoner damage suits ought to have been laid to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">In <em>Wolff </em>the Supreme Court hinted at the result that might obtain when a party seeks to litigate in a section 1983 proceeding an issue previously resolved in state court. The Court observed, \u201c[o]ne would anticipate that normal principles of <em>res ju-dicata </em>would apply\u201d where (as in <em>Wolff) </em>an issue may be subject to simultaneous litigation in a section 1983 case and state habeas proceedings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It would seem logically to follow that res judicata principles would apply where the issue presented in the section 1983 context has already received dis-positive treatment in state criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">The Court has long recognized that res judicata principles may operate to estop one convicted in a criminal proceeding from re-litigating in a subsequent civil case \u201cquestions \u2018distinctly put in issue and directly determined\u2019 in the criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Emich Motors v. General Motors, </em>340 U.S. 558, 569, 71 S.Ct. 408, 414, 95 L.Ed. 534 (1951). <em>See also Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1187, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). While for some time the concept of mutuality limited the estoppel effect to situations where the parties to the subsequent suit were identical to, or in privity with, those in the prior criminal proceeding,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in recent years this restriction has gradually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>given way,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and now it is generally accepted that a criminal conviction may be used by a party to a subsequent civil proceeding to estop the former defendant from reliti-gating issues which were necessarily resolved against him in the prior criminal case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">There are some who would argue that, despite this general rule, a state criminal conviction should not be given collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent section 1983 action \u2014 or not at least where the application of the rule would foreclose consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Most courts have not hesitated, however, to apply collateral estoppel in section 1983 actions regardless of whether the prior proceeding was civil<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or criminal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">In this circuit, for example, in <em>Shank v. Spruill, </em>406 F.2d 756 (5th Cir. 1969), and <em>Jones v. Bales, </em>58 F.R.D. 453 (N.D.Ga.1972), <em>aff\u2019d on basis of district court opinion, </em>480 F.2d 805 (5th Cir. 1973), we held that a section 1983 action which is based on an allegedly unlawful arrest or search must be dismissed if the legality of the arrest or search was previously litigated in the context of a criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> While we-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>did not specifically use the term \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d in either of these cases, both opinions have subsequently been cited as authority for the notion that a criminal judgment may have collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent civil suit raising a fourth amendment claim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Neither <em>Shank </em>nor <em>Jones </em>relied on the novel notions of exhaustion advanced by the court today; nor did our subsequent decision in <em>Brazzell v. Adams, </em>493 F.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1974). The plaintiff there was a state prisoner who was incarcerated on a sentence imposed after he had pled guilty to selling heroin. The thrust of the complaint was that the prosecutor and state agents who participated in plaintiff\u2019s arrest had entrapped him, for he had participated in the transaction in the belief that he was assisting the agents\u2019 investigation of his supplier. We held that the plaintiff\u2019s guilty plea necessarily amounted to an admission of all facts necessary to establish his guilt, and, thus, the judgment based on that plea estopped him from now arguing that he did not have the requisite criminal intent at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">We have also applied collateral estoppel in the context of a <em>Bivens </em>-type action<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> against F.B.I. agents who had allegedly coerced plaintiff into confessing to a robbery, for which he was then tried and convicted. <em>Willard v. United States, </em>422 F.2d 810 (5th Cir. 1970). Prior to commencing the civil suit, the plaintiff had filed a new trial motion attacking the voluntary nature of the confession, but the motion was denied after a full evidentiary hearing. In the civil suit the disposition of the new trial motion was held to estop the plaintiff from relitigating the coercion issue. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">\u25a0 Although we need not put it categorically in such terms, the factual background from the prior proceeding gained added significance through notions akin to <em>collateral estoppel. </em>The issues were in practical effect identical. Once determined between essentially the same parties, reexamination is not permitted. Of course, it is beyond question that a prior criminal proceeding can have a <em>collateral estoppel effect in the subsequent civil action. . . . </em>This general rule is not changed by the fact that the action is brought by the person convicted in the prior criminal action instead of the usual case where the government brings civil action to recover damages subsequent to a criminal conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 811-812 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The only possible exception to the approach we have taken in these cases is found in <em>Alexander v. Emerson, </em>489 F.2d 285 (5th Cir. 1973), which affirmed the dismissal of a section 1983 damages action by a prisoner who had not exhausted state remedies. The court observed, \u201c[I]t would be improvident for a federal court to entertain a suit for damages inquiring into possible constitutional violations committed during the trial, while the petitioner is imprisoned on that conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This was simply an acknowledgement of the fundamental policy consideration which undergirds the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel: the law does not countenance the relitigation of an issue by a party who has already had his day in court. That policy consideration alone was sufficient to justify dismissal of the prisoner\u2019s claim. That re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>course to state court habeas proceedings was still available did not affect the efficacy of that policy at all and was, in my opinion, irrelevant to the disposition. The important point was that the prisoner was estopped from relitigating an issue previously settled in state court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In sum, this circuit (as well as others) has not heretofore read the exhaustion requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) (1970) into a section 1983 damages action where the principal issue involves the legality of the plaintiff\u2019s prior state criminal conviction. On the contrary, we have permitted such suits to go forward until it has become apparent that the prior criminal judgment estops the plaintiff in the civil suit.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In most instances the existence of the prior judgment and the issues it resolved, expressly or by operation of law, would be shown by defendant\u2019s answer to the prisoner complaint; or it might be that the estoppel issue does not fully surface until later in the pretrial proceedings. When the issue is developed will likely vary from one district court to another, depending upon the local procedures devised for the handling of section 1983 pro se prisoner complaints. Still another possibility is that the complaint itself will indicate the applicability of collateral estoppel. In my judgment this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">A party can only be foreclosed on an issue in a collateral proceeding if that issue was necessarily determined in a prior proceeding.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Here the appellant\u2019s complaint states that he pled guilty at his Tarrant County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>trial and a judgment of conviction was entered on that plea. Texas law requires that a trial judge determine that a plea is voluntary before accepting it. Tex.Code Crim. Proc.Ann. art. 26.13 (Vernon).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See Coleman v. State, </em>35 Tex.Cr. 404, 33 S.W. 1083 (1896); <em>Ex parte Chavez, </em>482 S.W .2d 175 (Tex.Cr.App.1972). Thus the judgment of conviction not only reflects a judicial determination that the appellant was guilty of the substantive offense,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but indicates a judicial determination that appellant\u2019s plea was voluntary. Until such time as the Tar-rant County criminal conviction is vacated, the appellant is precluded in this section 1983 proceeding from maintaining that the plea was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In <em>Brazzell </em>we utilized the same reasoning. There we said that a plea of guilty necessarily implied the admission of the elements of the charged crime and that the plaintiff was bound by this presumed admission so long as the conviction stood. If <em>Brazzell </em>still has vitality, we should hold in a case such as this that the plaintiff is bound by a presumptively valid guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In summary, we have a case in which the record before the district court requires dismissal of the guilty plea claim on estoppel grounds. If it can be said that that record leaves room for doubt as to whether the estoppel issue was fully developed in the district court, we cannot ignore the aug-merited record which demonstrates the resolution of the guilty plea issue against the appellant on both direct appeal and collateral attack in state court. To me the proper analysis is plain, and I cannot subscribe to the majority opinion, which chooses to ignore this approach and substitute an artificial solution to this recurring problem.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">.

Petitioner freely and voluntarily confessed in open court that he committed the offense at the time and in the manner alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-17\">3. No plea bargaining agreement was called to the attention of the Court beyond the recommendation made in open court with all parties present that the punishment be fixed at life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-18\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW # # $ * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3a\">2. Petitioner has waived all non-jurisdictional rights arising prior to his plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-20\">3. Petitioner was not denied any constitutional rights at or after his trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-21\">4. Since one confession introduced at Petitioner\u2019s trial was his personal judicial confession and the other confession was admitted when Petitioner stated under oath that he had voluntarily given such statement and signed it, the conviction is not infirm as being based upon a coerced confession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-22\">5. Since Petitioner testified under oath that he was pleading guilty freely and voluntarily despite contrary cautioning by counsel, he has not been unconstitutionally convicted by reason of coercion.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">. 529 F.2d 377 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>aff'd on basis of panel opinion, </em>550 F.2d 345 (5th Cir. 1977) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b413-17\">. 529 F.2d at 386.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b413-15\">. 418 U.S. at 554 n. 12, 94 S.Ct. at 2974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b413-16\">. <em>See </em>IB J.

The <em>Shank </em>opinion is quite cryptic and merely indicates that, as long as the plaintiffs conviction stands, the arrest underlying that conviction \u201cmust be viewed as proper.\u201d 406 F.2d at 757. This analysis leaves uncertain the question of whether the legality of the arrest was litigated in the prior criminal proceeding. Ordinarily the legality of an arrest is only at issue in a criminal case if the defense attempts to suppress the fruits of a search incident to that arrest. This distinction was highlighted in <em>Jones v. Bales </em>where there were two searches. Applying <em>Shank, </em>the court found that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tiff was estopped as to one of the searches, which had been fully litigated in the prior criminal proceeding, but held that the plaintiff was not estopped as to the second search, which had \u201cno bearing on the validity of plaintiffs convictions.\u201d 58 F.R.D. at 460. <em>See also Cov-ington v.

It could be countered that the <em>Alexander </em>panel made no mention of our prior decisions in <em>Shank v. Spruill </em>and <em>Jones v. Bales, </em>and that there was no explicit reference to the doctrine of collateral estoppel. But even if <em>Alexander </em>established by implication an exhaustion requirement for these cases, that approach has been rejected by the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Preiser </em>decision. We recognized this when we next faced the issue in <em>Brazzell, </em>where we noted that \u201c[tjhe district court dismissed on the ground that appellant\u2019s remedy was by way of habeas corpus. <em>Cf. Alexander v. Emerson, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 489 F.2d 285. <em>But see Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>1973, 411 U.S. 475, 494, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1838, 36 L.Ed.2d 439, 453, with respect to prisoner actions for damages only.\u201d 493 F.2d at 489 n. 1. We then affirmed the district court by applying .the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. At the same time we granted rehearing en banc in <em>Meadows </em>and <em>Fulford </em>we voted against rehearing en banc <em>Covington v. Cole, </em>528 F.2d 1365 (5th Cir. 1976). <em>See </em>533 F.2d 1135 (5th Cir. 1976). While the allegations of the complaint in <em>Covington </em>were ambiguous, the plaintiff in that case may well have been basing his section 1983 claim on a search which in a prior criminal case was determined to have been lawful. Referring to this possibility, the <em>Cov-ington </em>court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">We allude to the doctrine whereby an arrest is to be viewed as proper as long as a conviction flowing from that arrest stands. <em>See Shank v. Spruill, </em>5 Cir. 1969,' 406 F.2d 756, 757. The doctrine is in the nature of collateral estoppel, and would apply to any alleged deprivation of right which might be challenged in a direct appeal from a conviction or through a <em>habeas corpus </em>attack on the conviction. Our inability to apply this doctrine in this appeal is simply explained \u2014 nothing iri the meager record before us informs us of the charge or charges upon which Covington was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 1370-1371 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">Thus, the court plainly indicated that, if the issue framed by a section 1983 claim has been litigated in a prior criminal proceeding, the proper approach is to entertain the action and apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel. It is not to dismiss for failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">It should be noted that a judgment dismissing the section 1983 claim on grounds of collateral estoppel would not bar the plaintiff from reviving his civil rights claim in the event the previous resolution of the issue is overturned, <em>e. g., </em>by direct appeal or collateral post-conviction proceedings, including habeas corpus. The claim could be revived <em>at any time </em>pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . (5) . . .a <em>prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated . . . . </em>The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b416-18\">. <em>See, e. g., Jones v.

At the time of appellant\u2019s trial, article 26.13 provided the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">If the defendant pleads guilty, or enters a plea of nolo contendere he shall be admonished by the court of the consequences; and neither of such pleas shall be received unless it plainly appears that he is sane, and is uninfluenced by any consideration of fear, or by any persuasion, or delusive hope of pardon, prompting him to confess his guilt.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">. <em>See Brazzell v. Adams, </em>493 F.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\">. I have one final observation which underscores the futility of the majority\u2019s analysis of this case. It seems to me that the majority opinion, requiring as it does an exhaustion of state remedies, implicitly recognizes that the principles of collateral estoppel apply in the context of a section 1983 damages claim. As I view it, the majority would not adopt an exhaustion requirement if exhaustion would in no way contribute toward a final resolution of the section 1983 claim. Any policy considerations which dictate holding a federal claim in abeyance pending a resolution of that claim in another forum must at the same time dictate that the other forum\u2019s resolution will in some way bear upon the outcome of the case in the federal court. A rule to the contrary would make the majority\u2019s exhaustion requirement, for all practical purposes, meaningless. Thus I view the majority opinion as a tacit agreement that collateral estoppel can be validly applied to section 1983 cases. If not, there is no utility whatever in delaying the prosecution of the section 1983 claim while state remedies are pursued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
