WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The essence of appellees\u2019 claim below was that Secretary of Agriculture Butz improperly included rent subsidies paid by the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] as \u201cincome\u201d for food stamp purposes. Appellees are heads of households qualified for food stamp coupons under the Federal Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1976))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and are members of a certified nationwide class which includes all low income tenants of housing subsidized under the provisions of the Housing Act of 1937,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as amended, or Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as amended, who are, have been or will be required to have included in their household \u201cincome\u201d for purposes of the food stamp program, the Housing and Urban Development subsidies paid to their landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Secretary appeals from the court\u2019s order declaring his implementing instruction unenforceable and ordering that appellees be refunded any sums they were overcharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">\n<em>THE INSTRUCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">On August 5, 1974, the Secretary revised Section 2262.10 Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), Food Stamp (FS) Instruction 732-1 to require that certain housing subsidies paid by the Department of Housing and Urban Development be treated as income for food stamp purposes. The instruction provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">Payments in money, except those for medical costs, made on behalf of the household by a person other than a member of the household. Such payments may be made by private or government sources, for instance, housing allowances from Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would be an example of a government vendor payment. To qualify as a vendor payment, there must be an identifiable payment on the household\u2019s behalf, the major benefit from which accrues to the household rather than the payer. If there is no identifiable payment or if the major benefit from such payment accrues to the payer and not the household, such benefit shall be considered income in kind and not income to the household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-19\">FNS(FS) Instruction 732-1, Section 2262.10 \u201cVendor Payments\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">Notice of proposed rule-making inviting comment was not given in the Federal Register, nor was the instruction published in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the Federal Register although the instruction was printed and available for public inspection and copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The Food Stamp Certification Handbook in which the instruction was published is an administrative staff manual containing instructions to state agencies administering the Food Stamp Act. The Handbook was, according to the Secretary, based on 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.3(c) which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF-\">(c) <em>Income and resource eligibility standards of other households.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">(l) <em>Definition of income, </em>(i) Monthly income means all income which is received or anticipated to be received during the month. To compute maximum monthly income for purposes of determining eligibility, income shall mean any of the following but is not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">(f) Payments received from federal aided public assisted programs, general assistance programs, or other assistance programs based on need;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\"><em>(h) </em>Payments, except those for medical costs, made on behalf of the household by a person other than a member of the household;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">sj: sfc <em>% </em>\u00a1\u00a1e sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">(m) The actual value of housing received from an employer by members of a household as income in kind, in lieu of or supplemental to household income, not to exceed $25 per month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-16\">(ii) The following shall not be considered income to the household (this list is inclusive and no other exclusions from income shall.be allowed):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-17\"><em>* * </em>\u00a1}c <em>Ht % </em>sf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-18\">(c) Any gain or benefit which is not in money (except as provided in paragraph (c)(l)(i)(m) of this section);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-20\">\n<em>THE ARGUMENTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-21\">At oral argument the government contended that the promulgation of the instruction was authorized by the controlling regulations and that the instruction itself was merely a reasonable interpretation of the vendor payment provision of 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.3(c)(l)(i)(h ).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-22\">Because HUD subsidies are clearly in-cludable in income as vendor payments, the government argued, the Secretary\u2019s instruction was an interpretive rule excluded from the notice and comment requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1970). Although it did not address the issue in oral argument, the government further asserted in its brief that it had complied with the applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), specifically 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(B) and (C) (Supp.1976),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>ing the instruction available for public inspection and copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In response, appellees argued that in 1973 Congress had narrowed the Secretary\u2019s authority under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014(b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by passing the Ichord Amendment,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pub.L. 93-86 \u00a7 3(g), Aug. 10, 1973, 87 Stat. 246. The legislative history of the amendment and the amendment itself indicated that housing payments were to be included as income only if supplied by an employer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In a procedural attack; appellees argued that the newly announced instruction represented a significant change in policy and was required to be published in the Federal Register under APA \u00a7 553<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and under FOIA \u00a7 552(a)(1)(D).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Although many issues were clearly presented to us, we choose to dispose of this case on the sole ground that the instruction is void for the Secretary\u2019s failure to comply with the publication requirement of the FOIA. <em>Hotch v. United States, </em>212 F.2d 280 (9th Cir. 1954). In so holding we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the instruction is an interpretive rule. We do not, however, decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">\n<em>THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">As Professor Kenneth C. Davis, writing in <em>Administrative Law of the Seventies, </em>\u00a7 3A.7 (June 1976) has recognized, there is still difficulty in determining when publication in the Federal Register is required by the FOIA. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\">\u201cThe troublesome problem is to find the meaning of the two terms, \u2018statements of general policy\u2019 and \u2018interpretations of general applicability.\u2019 \u201d The Act in \u00a7 522(a)(1)(D) requires publication in the Federal Register of \u201csubstantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency.\u201d But in \u00a7 552(a)(2) availability for public inspection, not publication, is required for \u201cthose statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register,\u201d and for \u201cadministrative staff manuals and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>structions to staff that affect a member of the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">Even after the Act has been effective for eight years, no authoritative answer can be given to the simple question whether interpretative rules (a) must be published, (b) need not be, or (c) some must be and some need not be. The answer depends in part on the difference between \u201cinterpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency\u201d and \u201cinterpretations which have been adopted by the agency\u201d; the first must be published, but not the second. The answer surely cannot be extracted from the statutory words. The legislative history is completely unhelpful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">No court has written a reliable analysis of the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The district court in <em>Tax Analysts &amp; Advocates v. IRS, </em>362 F.Supp. 1298, 1303-04 (D.D.C.1973), modified on other grounds, 164 U.S.App.D.C. 243, 505 F.2d 350 (1974), in dealing with the question of whether \u00a7 552 requires publication *of interpretive rules stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">Readpng \u00a7 552(a)(1)(D) and \u00a7 552(a)(2)(B)] together these provisions can only mean that interpretations of general applicability are to be published in the Federal Register while all other interpretations adopted by an agency, i. e. those <em>not </em>of general applicability, are to be made available to the public, albeit they need not be published.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The question, then, is to determine what is meant by interpretations of \u201cgeneral applicability.\u201d The court in <em>Lewis v. Wein-berger, </em>415 F.Supp. 652, 659 (D.N.M.1976), recently addressed this question. It stated: \u201c[A]n administrative interpretation [is not] deemed to be \u2018of general applicability\u2019 if: (1) only a clarification or explanation of existing laws or regulations is expressed; and (2) no significant impact upon any segment of the public results.\u201d The court further stated: \u201cAlso within the availability requirement of 552(a)(2)(B) are statements affecting only an agency\u2019s internal or housekeeping operations . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">This court must inquire into the substance and effect of the policy pronouncement. The label attached is not controlling. <em>Piercy v. Tarr, </em>343 F.Supp. 1120,1128 (N.D.Cal.1972). Having done so, we conclude that the instruction affects more than the internal operations of the food stamp program and has a significant impact on food stamp recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">The instruction was a change from the existing practice of not including federal housing subsidies in calculating income. As a mandatory directive for determining food stamp eligibility, binding on political subdivisions participating in the food stamp program [7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2019(e)(2) (Supp.1976); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.8(c)(1) (1976)], its effect will be widespread and immediate. The substantive rights of food stamp recipients were directly affected because the cost of their allocated food stamps increased.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Our holding cannot be circumvented by alleging that appellees had actual and timely notice of the unpublished instruction. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1) (Supp.1976). Such notification occurred when the instruction took effect. This is not the timely notice contemplated by Congress when it enacted that exemption to the standard FOIA procedures. <em>See Northern California Power Agency v. Morton, </em>396 F.Supp. 1187, 1191 (D.D.C.1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>176 U.S.App.D.C. 241, 539 F.2d 243 (1976). <em>Cf. Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 232-36, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-10\">. Under the federal food stamp program, eligible low income households are allowed to buy an established value in coupons which may be exchanged for food at retail food stores. <em>See Knebel v. Hein, </em>- U.S. -, -, n.9, 97 S.Ct. 549, 552, 50 L.Ed.2d 485 (1977). An eligible household purchasing food stamps does not pay the face value of the coupons; instead, cost is determined by \u201chousehold income.\" The difference between the cost to the household and the face value of the coupons is the \u201cbonus value.\u201d Because the cost of food stamps increases with income, the impact of the \"instruction\u201d requiring certain housing allowances or subsidies paid by the Housing and Urban Development Administration to be included as income has the direct result of increasing the cost of food stamp coupons to the appellees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-22\">.

Tennessee Dept. of Public Welfare, </em>532 F.2d 561 (6th Cir. 1976), has decided that rent supplement payments constitute a proper example of vendor payments and that Instruction 732-1 was in interpretation of 7 C.F.R. 271.3(c)(l)(i)(h). After noting the passage of the Ichord Amendment (see text infra), it reasoned that a close reading of the amendment evinced a Congressional intent to embrace only in kind benefits and not vendor payments. It concluded: \u201cThus the effect of the amendment is not a limitation but rather an exception to the prior policy that <em>no </em>in kind benefits were includable in income. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.3(c)(l)(ii)(c).\u201d 532 F.2d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">The <em>Compton </em>court, however, did not reach the procedural arguments presented to us because they were not raised in the district court. 532 F.2d at 563 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b525-24\">.

In 1973 the Ichord Amendment added to the foregoing provision the following;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\"><em>Provided, </em>That such standards shall take into account payments in kind received from an employer by members of a household if such payments are in lieu of or supplemental to household income: <em>Provided further, </em>That such payments in kind shall be limited only to housing provided by such employer to such employee and shall be the actual value of such housing but in no event shall such value be considered to be in excess of the sum of $25.00 per month.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b526-10\">. To support their contention that the Ichord Amendment specifically and intentionally limited the in kind housing payments which may be considered income for food stamp purposes, appellees cite Congressman Ichord\u2019s statement made when offering the amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">As I stated previously, I submitted this amendment to [Rep.
