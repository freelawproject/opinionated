Fed. R.Civ.P. 65(a). At the same time we heard the appeal, we considered a Rule 8 motion and granted a temporary injunction pending our decision on the appeal. Fed.R. App.P. 8. Blackwelder\u2019s complaint seeks treble damages and injunctive relief under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15 &amp; 16, on the theory that a decision by Seilig Manufacturing Company, Inc., to terminate Blackwelder as an authorized dealer violated the federal antitrust statutes. For reasons to be stated, we think the district court applied incorrect principles in undertaking to exercise its discretion to grant or deny a preliminary injunction and further that the application of correct principles requires that a preliminary injunction issue, restoring Blackwelder to its status as a Seilig dealer pending trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Blackwelder contends that Seilig has violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by combining to fix prices, rig retail territories, and oust a discounter from the competitive market. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. From affidavits and certain agreed facts, it seems fair to say Blackwelder will be able to offer competent evidence at trial tending to show the following:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Blackwelder was a successful distributor of Seilig furniture for over a decade; its purchases of Seilig furniture accounted for about 35% of its total purchases of \u201ccontemporary upholstered furniture\u201d; Seilig was one of its top three lines of contemporary upholstered furniture; from January to June 1976, it ordered more than $52,000 worth of furniture from Seilig. Part of Blackwelder\u2019s sales were to mail-order customers in the Washington, D. C. area, who took advantage of Blackwelder\u2019s discount prices, ranging up to 30% below Seilig\u2019s suggested retail prices. Such potential customers often visit the showrooms of a local D. C. retailer, select a piece of furniture, and then place their order with Blackwelder \u2014 to the great displeasure of the local retailer. Blackwelder alleges that as a result Seymour Woodnick of W. J. Sloane\u2019s, a large D. C. retailer of Seilig furniture, threatened to see to it that Blackwelder lose its Seilig line unless it quit the D. C. market. While Woodnick denies the threat, he admits his sales personnel were greatly aggravated over time wasted on Blackwelder customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">In April of 1974 Seilig\u2019s regional sales director, Jim Robinson, on the authority of Jerrold Wexler, Executive Vice President of Seilig, warned Blackwelder that because of pressure from D. C. dealers like Sloane\u2019s it would be forced to terminate Blackwelder\u2019s dealership unless it stopped sales in the D. C. area. Robinson denies the threat, but he admitted to having asked Blackwelder to reduce the customary number of its salesmen at the Seilig space at the upcoming High Point Furniture market lest they \u201cirritate\u201d Seilig salesmen from D. C. The threats are said to have been repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">On May 4,1976, Seilig wrote Blackwelder that it would be terminated on June 1 because \u201cit occasionally becomes necessary to make certain changes in a company\u2019s distribution policy in order to better develop a particular area.\u201d No other or more concrete reason was given. Despite Seilig\u2019s contention that it acted unilaterally and that some 300 other dealers were terminated at the same time, the names of those dealers and a comparison of their respective sales records with Blackwelder\u2019s were not furnished the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The district court, in denying Blackwelder\u2019s motion for interlocutory relief, relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>on the fourfold equitable rule of thumb set forth in <em>Airport Comm. of Forsyth Co., N.C. v. CAB, </em>296 F.2d 95 (4th Cir. 1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">1) Has the petitioner made a <em>strong showing </em>that it is likely to prevail upon the merits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">2) Has the petitioner shown that without such relief it will suffer irreparable injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">3) Would the issuance of the injunction substantially harm other interested parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">4) Wherein lies the public interest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">296 F.2d at 96 (emphasis added). <em>Accord, First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Camp, </em>432 F.2d 481, 483 (4th Cir. 1970). It reasoned that a single adverse determination on any of the four questions would be fatal to the movant. The court found first that \u201cneither side\u201d had made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that Seilig\u2019s actions were either collaborative or unilateral for purposes of the Section 1 requirement of a contract, combination or conspiracy. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. For this reason alone the court reasoned that relief should be denied; nonetheless, it also found that denial of interlocutory relief would occasion no irreparable harm to Blackwelder \u2014 since its damages, if any, would be readily calculable and collectible. The court felt unable to decide the remaining two factors, <em>viz., </em>the public interest and the potential harm to the defendant, but did note that \u201cit is hard to conceive\u201d how Seilig could be economically damaged by continuing its business relationship with Black-welder.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">When the grant or denial of interim injunctive relief is reviewed, it is simplistic to say or imply, as we sometimes do, that it will be set aside only if an abuse of discretion can be shown. <em>Singleton v. Anson Co. Bd. of Education, </em>387 F.2d 349, 351 (4th Cir. 1967); <em>Meiselman </em>v. <em>Paramount Film Distributing Corp., </em>180 F.2d 94, 97 (4th Cir. 1950). For there is, of course, the possibility that the court below has either failed to exercise its discretion in some respect, <em>compare Paine v. St. Paul Union Stockyards Co., </em>35 F.2d 624 (8th Cir. 1929), <em>with Mattox v. United States, </em>146 U.S. 140, 13 S.Ct. 50, 36 L.Ed. 917 (1892), or else exercised it counter to established equitable principles. <em>Prendergast v. N.Y. Tel. Co., </em>262 U.S. 43, 50-51, 43 S.Ct. 466, 67 L.Ed. 853 (1923); <em>Security Metal Products Co. v. Kawneer Co., </em>14 F.2d 569, 572-573 (8th Cir. 1926). A judge\u2019s discretion is not boundless and must be exercised within the applicable rules of law or equity. <em>Petersen v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>116 F.2d 148, 151 (8th Cir. 1971). And our review of the lower court\u2019s application of the law is not limited by the same \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule which restricts our review of its findings of fact under Rule 52(a). Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Ry. Co. v. United Transp. Union, </em>146 U.S. App.D.C. 142, 450 F.2d 603, 620 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">We reverse the district court because it failed to apply the settled principles which govern consideration of a Rule 65(a) motion in this circuit, as set forth in <em>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Midland Oil Co., </em>55 F.2d 42 (4th Cir. 1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-15\">It is sufficient [to grant the motion] if the court is satisfied that there is a probable right and a probable danger, and that the right may be defeated, unless the injunction is issued, <em>and considerable weight is given to the need of protection to the plaintiff as contrasted with the probable injury to the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">55 F.2d at 45 (emphasis added). <em>Accord, West Virginia Conservancy v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>441 F.2d 232, 235 (4th Cir. 1971). The district court\u2019s reliance on the different standards of <em>Airport Comm\u2019n of Forsyth Co. </em>and <em>Camp, see </em>p. 192 <em>supra, </em>was misplaced \u2014 though understandably so. Even the treatise writers have mistakenly equated the stringent standards of those cases with the more flexible rule of <em>Sinclair Refining, supra. See, e. g., </em>7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, K 65.04[1] at 65-39 n.7 (1975). But there is a difference. The cases relied upon by the district court deal with the question of the issuance <em>vel non </em>of an <em>appellate </em>stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>pending review of an administrative order or a trial court decision that dealt with the merits of a controversy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence they propound an <em>appellate </em>standard \u2014 and not one for use in the trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In cases like <em>Airport </em>and <em>Camp </em>a judicial or quasi-judicial body has already passed upon the merits of a question and typically has also denied a discretionary stay of its decision; only then is the motion made for an appellate stay. For a stay to issue under such circumstances, we adopted in <em>Airport Comm\u2019n of Forsyth, supra, </em>296 F.2d at 96, the requirement of <em>Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass\u2019n v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>104 U.S.App.D.C. 106, 259 F.2d 921 (1958), that a <em>\u201cstrong </em>showing\u201d of probable success on appeal be made, for otherwise there is \u201cno justification for the [appellate] court\u2019s intrusion into the ordinary processes of administrative and judicial review.\u201d 259 F.2d at 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Likewise, <em>Long v. Robinson, </em>432 F.2d 977 (4 Cir. 1970), another \u201cstrong showing\u201d case from this circuit, involved a stay-pending-appeal situation, in which the district court had <em>fully considered the merits of the controversy, </em>rendered its final decree, and refused the request for an interim stay. Judge Winter explained in <em>Long </em>that the petitioner\u2019s burden in seeking injunctive relief is substantially greater on appeal. 432 F.2d at 979. <em>See, e. g., Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. United States, 82 </em>S.Ct. 466, 7 L.Ed.2d 432, 434 (1962) (Harlan, J.) (a \u201cstrong showing . . . must be made to justify reversal of the District Court\u2019s discretionary action\u201d); <em>Breswick &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>75 S.Ct. 912, 100 L.Ed. 1510, 1513.&amp; n.1 (1955); <em>Magnum Import Co. v. Coty, </em>262 U.S. 159, 164, 43 S.Ct. 531, 67 L.Ed. 922 (1923). And this is especially so where the lower court has adversely determined the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Therefore, the district court erred in guiding itself by an appellate standard inappropriate at the trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">The correct trial court standard in this circuit, as declared in <em>Sinclair Refining, supra, </em>was doubtless derived from <em>Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, </em>279 U.S. 813, 49 S.Ct. 256, 73 L.Ed. 972 (1929), where the Supreme Court laid down the rule \u201cgenerally to be applied\u201d by trial courts in the exercise of their discretion in Rule 65(a) situations. <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>United States, </em>279 U.S. 229, 231, 49 S.Ct. 266, 73 L.Ed. 675 (1929). That rule is the balance-of-hardship test as it was then formulated by the Eighth Circuit, <em>see, e. g., Love v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., </em>185 F. 321, 331-332 (1911):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-14\">Where the questions presented by an application for an interlocutory injunction are grave, and the injury to the moving party will be certain and irreparable, if the application be denied and the final decree be in his favor, while if the injunction be granted the injury to the opposing party, even if the final decree be in his favor, will be inconsiderable, or may be adequately indemnified by a bond, <em>the injunction usually will be granted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-15\"><em>Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, supra, </em>279 U.S. at 815, 49 S.Ct. at 257 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">Like the present case, <em>Conway </em>was an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction. And there, too, the original application was submitted upon <em>ex parte </em>affidavits which, by creating \u201ca real dispute over material questions of fact,\u201d rendered impossible any accurate determination by the trial court of the merits of the controversy. 279 U.S. at 814, 49 S.Ct. at 256. Nonetheless, because a \u201cgrave\u201d question was raised \u2014 and the balance of hardship decisively favored the movant \u2014 the Court concluded that the petition for interlocutory order should have been granted and reversed the lower court. -. <em>\u00a1 \u25a0 . \u25a0\u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-17\">The balance-of-hardship test correctly emphasizes that, where <em>serious </em>issues are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>before the court, it is a sound idea to maintain the <em>status quo ante litem, </em>provided that it can be done without imposing too excessive an interim burden upon the defendant, Munoz v. <em>Porto Rico Light &amp; Power Co., </em>83 F.2d 262, 269 (1st Cir. 1936); <em>Benson Hotel Corp. v. Woods, </em>168 F.2d 694, 696 (8th Cir. 1948); <em>Pratt v. Stout, </em>85 F.2d 172, 177 (8th Cir. 1936); <em>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Midland Oil Co., supra, </em>55 F.2d at 45 <em>(citing Blount v. Societe Anonyme Du Fil-tre, </em>53 F. 98, 101 (6th Cir. 1892)), for otherwise effective relief may become impossible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">The controlling reason for the existence of the judicial power to issue a temporary injunction is that the court may thereby prevent such a change in the relations and conditions of persons and property as may result in irremediable injury to some of the parties before their claims can be investigated and adjudicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><em>Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., </em>206 F.2d 738, 743 n.10 (2d Cir. 1953) <em>(quoting Love v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., supra, </em>185 F. at 332).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The district court below erred in holding that plaintiff must first show \u201clikelihood of success\u201d in order to be entitled to preliminary relief. Instead, the first step in a Rule 65(a) situation is for the court to balance the \u201clikelihood\u201d of irreparable harm to the plaintiff against t'he \u201clikelihood\u201d of harm to the defendant; and if a decided imbalance of hardship should appear in plaintiff\u2019s favor, then the likelihood-of-success test is displaced by Judge Jerome Frank\u2019s famous formulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">[I]t will ordinarily be enough that the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-10\"><em>Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., supra, </em>206 F.2d at 740, 743; <em>Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>429 F.2d 1197, 1205 (2d Cir. 1970). The importance of probability of success increases as the probability of irreparable injury diminishes, <em>Delaware River Port Authority v. Transamerican Trailer Transport, Inc., </em>501 F.2d 917, 923 (3d Cir. 1974); <em>Canal Authority of State of Florida v. Callaway, </em>489 F.2d 567, 576 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>District 50, United Mine Workers v. United Mine Workers, </em>134 U.S.App.D.C. 34,412 F.2d 165,168 (1969); <em>Packard Instrument Co. v. ANS, Inc., </em>416 F.2d 943 (2d Cir. 1969); and where the latter may be characterized as simply \u201cpossible,\u201d the former can be decisive. Even so, it remains merely one \u201cstrong factor\u201d to be weighed alongside both the likely harm to the defendant and the public interest. <em>Dino De Laurentiis Cinematografica, SpA. v. D-150, Inc., </em>366 F.2d 373, 375 (2d Cir. 1966) <em>(quoting </em>3 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 1433 at 493 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">We have expressly reaffirmed our <em>Sinclair Refining </em>rule in <em>West Virginia Conservancy v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>441 F.2d 232 (1971). <em>See also Phillips v. Crown Petroleum Corp., </em>376 F.Supp. 1250, 1253 (D.Md.1973). Finding that the balance of hardship favored the plaintiff, the <em>Island Creek </em>court readily upheld a grant of interlocutory relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Winter treated the \u201clikelihood of success\u201d factor in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">While we express no opinion on [the merits of the issues], we can say that their resolution is not immediately apparent. That is enough to say that Conservancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>has not embarked on frivolous litigation, <em>and thus interlocutory relief is not improper if Conservancy can also show a need for protection which outweighs any probable injury to [the defendant].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">441 F.2d at 235 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Thus in this circuit the trial court standard for interlocutory injunctive relief is the balance-of-hardship test. Whenever a district court has before it a Rule 65(a) motion, although it may properly consider the four general factors enumerated in <em>Airport, see </em>p. 192 <em>supra, </em>it should give them the relative emphasis required by the <em>Sinclair </em>rule: The two more important factors are those of probable irreparable injury to plaintiff without a decree and of likely harm to the defendant with a decree. If that balance is struck in favor of plaintiff, it is enough that grave or serious questions are presented; and plaintiff need not show a likelihood of success. Always, of course, the public interest should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Here the district court erroneously required <em>a strong showing of success </em>as a prerequisite to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The district court also found that interlocutory relief was barred by plaintiff\u2019s failure to show that without it it would be irreparably injured. But that requirement was also taken from the list of essentially independent factors that an <em>appellate </em>court ought to consider before staying an order entered after consideration of the merits below. Its emphasis is that of deference to a decision involving discretion, as well as greater attention to the facts than is possible on appeal. <em>Airport Comm\u2019n of Forsyth Co. v. CAB, </em>see p. 192 <em>supra. </em>Insofar as a trial court is concerned, the requirement of irreparable harm must also be evaluated within the basic context of the balance-of-hardship test.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Therefore, while \u201cirreparability\u201d may suggest some minimum of probable injury which is required to get the court\u2019s attention, the more important question is the <em>relative </em>quantum and quality of plaintiff\u2019s likely harm. The decision to grant preliminary relief cannot be intelligently made unless the trial court knows how much the precaution will cost the defendant. If it costs very little, the trial court should be more apt to decide that the threatened injury is \u201cirreparable\u201d for purposes of interlocutory relief. In addition, as we have noted above, even a \u201cpossible\u201d irreparable injury has been held to suffice if there is strong probability of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">The decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction depends upon a \u201cflexible interplay\u201d among all the factors considered. <em>Cf. Packard Instrument Co. v. ANS, Inc., supra, </em>416,,F.2d at 945. The district court erred in treating the four <em>Airport </em>factors as a defense in depth \u2014 to be overcome, each and every one, before entitlement to preliminary relief should be decreed. Its error was compounded by failure to decide the last two questions in the <em>Airport </em>test, for all four are intertwined and each affects in degree all the others. The failure to find that Seilig would not be harmed \u2014 although remarking that any such harm is hard to conceive \u2014 inevitably increased Blackwelder\u2019s burden of persuasion on the other questions \u2014 especially as to what degree it had to show irreparable injury. We agree with the district court\u2019s intimation, short of a finding, that the possible harm to Seilig, in light of the history of past, profitable dealings between the parties, is negligible. <em>National Screen Serv. Corp. v. Poster Exchange, Inc., </em>305 F.2d 647, 650 (5th Cir. 1962). Moreover, what little risk might be posed to Seilig is easily indemnifiable by a bond. <em>See Ohio Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Conway, supra, </em>279 U.S. at 81, 49 S.Ct. 256; <em>cf. </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">We view the trial court\u2019s finding that Blaekwelder will suffer no irreparable harm (on the basis that any injury to it would be readily calculable and collectible) as clearly erroneous. Blackwelder\u2019s past profits on Seilig furniture afford a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>plausible basis for calculating some of the damages from any wrongful termination. But not all. Word-of-mouth grumbling of customers can convert Blackwelder\u2019s inability to honor Seilig orders into a reputation for general unreliability as a merchant. Losing Seilig can set back Blackwelder\u2019s efforts to become known as a \u201cfull-line\u201d furniture discounter. <em>Cf. Bergen Drug Co. v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., </em>307 F.2d 725 (3d Cir. 1962). The harm posed to Blackwelder\u2019s general goodwill by its inability to fill outstanding and accumulating orders in excess of $15,000 for furniture listed in its catalogues is incalculable \u2014 not incalculably great or small, just incalculable. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Developments in the Law </em>\u2014 Injunctions, <em>78 </em>Harv.L.Rev. 994, 1002-1003 (1965); <em>cf. Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., supra, </em>429 F.2d at 1205. And, as Learned Hand observed, irreparability of harm includes the \u201cimpossibility of ascertaining with any accuracy the extent of the loss\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">That has always been included in its meaning; and I cannot see how the plaintiff will ever be able to prove what sales the defendant\u2019s competition will make it lose, <em>to say nothing of the indirect, though at times far-reaching, effects upon its good will .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><em>Foundry Servs., Inc. v. Beneflux Corp., </em>206 F.2d 214, 216 (2d Cir. 1952) (Hand, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The last of the <em>Airport </em>criteria is: \u201cWherein lies the public interest.\u201d One reason for the more lenient interlocutory relief standards, as opposed to those governing motions for stays pending appeal, is the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in preserving the <em>status quo ante litem </em>until the merits of a <em>serious </em>controversy can be fully considered by a trial court. The right to a stay after the merits have once been unfavorably determined is quite a different thing. That basic \u201cpublic interest\u201d is further enhanced where, as here, the private controversy may possibly vindicate public policy. Private actions are an important means of enforcing federal antitrust policies. <em>Bergen Drug Co. v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., supra, </em>307 F.2d at 727-728.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The presence of a federal statute both prohibiting the alleged acts of the defendant and supplying the gravamen of the complaint aligns Blackwelder, if only provisionally, on the side of the public interest and constitutes added weight in favor of precautionary relief. <em>West Virginia Conservancy v. Island Creek Coal Co., supra, </em>441 F.2d at 236; <em>Vanadium Corp. of America v. Susquehanna, </em>203 F.Supp. 686, 696 (D.Del.1962); <em>Yakus v. United States, </em>321 U.S. 414, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944). This is so especially where, as here, the statute expressly authorizes interlocutory injunctive relief. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26. <em>See </em>11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 2948 at 462 (1973); <em>United States v. Nutrition Serv., Inc., </em>227 F.Supp. 375 (W.D.Pa.1964), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>347 F.2d 233 (3d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Since decision below was entered upon conflicting affidavits, and some agreed facts, our ordinary deference to the district judge\u2019s findings of fact is less appropriate. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>486 F.2d 81, 84 (10th Cir. 1973); <em>Shumaker v. Groboski Industries, Inc., </em>352 F.2d 837, 840 (7th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">We have already noted our agreement with the district judge\u2019s statement that \u201cit is hard to conceive how the defendant can be economically damaged by a continued business relationship with the plaintiff.\u201d We also think that what we have said hereinbefore strongly suggests that Blackwelder has sufficiently shown that without preliminary relief it will likely be irreparably injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">Blackwelder has pleaded a prima facie case. <em>Cf. </em>11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2948 at 452 (1973). Moreover, the references we have made hereinbefore to the admissions of Seilig tend at least to partially support the allegations of the complaint. And it is clear that the public interest lies, as we have already said, in vindication of the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>It appears to us that the plaintiff has made a sufficiently strong showing that it is likely to prevail on the merits in light of the disparity of probable harm as between the plaintiff and the defendant and the location of the public interest. Since the issues are grave, and the balance of hardship substantially favors Blackwelder, the denial of relief in the district court will be reversed, arid the case is remanded with instructions that an appropriate preliminary injunction issue. On remand, the district court should consider whether Blackwelder should be required to post a bond conditioned upon: (1) indemnification of Seilig against harm if decision on the merits goes against Blackwelder, <em>cf. </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26, and (2) Blackwelder\u2019s expeditiously proceeding to prosecute its suit to a final decree. <em>See Ohio Oil Co. v. </em>Conway, <em>supra, </em>279 U.S. at 81, 49 S.Ct. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\">. The district court opinion recites the allegations of the pleadings, affidavits and counter-affidavits but does not resolve conflicts. We observe sympathetically that Rules 52(a) and 65(d) require findings of fact, albeit tentative. We agree with Judge Friendly that finding facts from conflicting affidavits is not always possible and endorse the Second Circuit suggestion that a perplexed district judge may in his discretion require live testimony \u201cwhere everything turns on what happened and that is in sharp dispute.\u201d <em>Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>429 F.2d 1197, 1204 (2 Cir. 1970). Here, both parties willingly joined in the battle of affidavits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\">. While the appellate origins of the fourfold rule have been noted, .the proper implications thereof have not. <em>See </em>11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 2948 at 430 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">. By contrast, in <em>Davis v. Crown Central Petroleum Corp., </em>483 F.2d 1014 (4th Cir. 1973) (an order granting preliminary relief was vacated), the court found that the balance of hardship stood at equipoise: \u201cthe plight of the defendant was not substantially different from that of the plaintiffs.\u201d 483 F.2d at 1016. It is in just such a case that the probability of success begins to assume real significance, <em>see </em>p. 195 <em>supra; </em>for if the factors of harm to the parties cancel each other, then \u201cgreater significance must be placed on the likelihood that each party will ultimately succeed upon the merits.\u201d <em>Delaware River Port Authority v. Transamerican Trailer Transports, Inc., </em>501 F.2d 917, 924 (3d Cir. 1974). For that reason the <em>Davis </em>court took notice that North Carolina\u2019s Statute of Frauds appeared to be a complete bar to the action and overturned the grant of relief. 483 F.2d at 1016.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
