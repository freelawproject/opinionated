We affirm. Appellant worked as a warehouse keeper in the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Social Services. On July 9, 1974, he was discharged by appellee, Eliza Diaz Gonzales, who was then the Secretary of Social Services. Appellant claims that he was dismissed because he was. a member of the New Progressive Party and they had lost in the elections to the Popular Democratic Party.' <em>See Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S. Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <em>Rivera v. Benitez, </em>541 F.2d 882 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">The day after he was fired, appellant filed an appeal before the Commonwealth\u2019s Personnel Board. On March 11, 1975, he asked the Board to dismiss his appeal, and it did so, with prejudice, on March 20. Unfortunately for appellant, he waited almost six months before bringing this lawsuit in the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">The district court held that the analogous state statute of limitations was that for torts (one year), 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 5298(2), and appellant urges that it is the one for contracts (fifteen years), 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 5294. Traditionally, civil rights actions have been considered to state a cause of action lying in tort, rather than contract. <em>Johnson v. Railroad Express Ag\u2019cy, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 456 n. 2, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). The analysis underlying that conclusion is particularly appropriate in the present action. Quoting from Dean Pros-ser, we have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">\u201c \u2018The duties of conduct which give rise to [tort actions] are imposed by the law, and are based primarily upon social policy . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Lexington Ins. Co. v. Abarca Warehouses Corp., </em>476 F.2d 44, 46 (1st Cir. 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-20\">The only clear-cut federal claim stated by appellant\u2019s complaint is that he was fired for political reasons. This suggests a claim founded on <em>Elrod v. Burns, supra. Elrod </em>imposes on government officers a duty grounded in social policies expressed by the First Amendment. Violations of that duty are torts, not breaches of contract. The district judge also concluded that \u00a7 5298(2) applies to this case, and we are inclined to give deference to his choice in this area of intermingled state and federal law. <em>See Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 180-182, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2599-2600, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-21\">Appellant next urges that even if the appropriate limitations period was one year, the year began to run on the date the Personnel Board dismissed his appeal. \u201c[S]tate law is our primary guide in this area\u201d. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 465, 95 S.Ct. at 1722. The district court held that under the law in Puerto Rico the action before the Personnel Board would only toll the one-year period if it were identical to the federal action, and it was not. Appellant does not seriously quarrel with this conclusion. Of course, \u201cconsiderations of state law may be displaced where their application would be inconsistent with the federal policy underlying the cause of action under consideration.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 465, 95 S.Ct. at 1722. But no overriding federal interest impels us to toll the applicable statute of limitations in this case. To the contrary, where an injunction is sought to obtain reinstatement in public employment, it behooves the plaintiff to act promptly. Indeed, if the government were to be prejudiced by the delay, laches might preclude purely equitable relief, i. e., rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>statement, even in cases brought within the one year period of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Appellant\u2019s last argument, that his action seeks only an injunction, is frivolous and is rebutted by prayers 3, 4, and 5 of his Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
