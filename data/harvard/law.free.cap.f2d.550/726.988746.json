Under the circumstances of this ease, we hold that it should not. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court which dismissed the complaint as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-23\">Walter J. Meyer was a detective in the Nassau County Police Department (the Department). On June 25, 1970 a Nassau County grand jury indicted him and another detective for attempted first degree grand larceny. On January 1, 1972 a jury acquitted Meyer of this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-24\">Before the criminal trial began, the Department conducted and concluded administrative proceedings to dismiss Meyer. On July 2, 1970, Meyer was charged with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>violation of Department rules. The departmental charges were based on the same conduct charged in the indictment. A departmental trial initially was scheduled for November 30, 1970. Repeated adjournments, all except one due to the unavailability of Meyer\u2019s counsel, resulted in its postponement until April 22, 1971. On that date Meyer\u2019s counsel again was absent. His substitute counsel requested another adjournment. The trial commissioner, ap-pellee Quinn, denied this request but. informed Meyer that he could stand mute. On the advice of his substitute counsel, Meyer did remain mute while the Department presented its case. When the Department rested, Quinn adjourned the trial until April 27 and informed Meyer that he could present his case at that time. When the trial resumed on April 27, Meyer again stood mute. Quinn found him guilty. On June 4, 1971, he was dismissed from the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Two months after his dismissal, Meyer commenced an Article 78 proceeding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Nassau County Supreme Court to review the action which resulted in his dismissal. His petition alleged various state law claims. It also alleged that the Department\u2019s action in trying him without the assistance of counsel of his choosing violated his federal constitutional rights to counsel and to confront witnesses. On July 15, 1971 the Article 78 petition was dismissed by Justice Pittoni of the Nassau County Supreme Court. The Appellate Division, Second Department, affirmed without opinion on October 10, 1972, 40 App.Div.2d 760, 336 N.Y.S.2d 239 (2nd Dept.1972) (mem.), and denied Meyer\u2019s motion for reargument on January 19, 1973. In July 1973 the New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">On June 6, 1975 Meyer commenced the instant civil rights action in the Eastern District of New York.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His complaint alleged that his subjection to a departmental trial violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and that his subsequent dismissal deprived him of the pursuit of his calling without due process of law. On March 12, 1976 Judge Costantino filed his opinion, 409 F.Supp. 1240, granting appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint as barred by the applicable three year New York statute of limitations. From the judgment entered the same day, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">An action brought under the federal Civil Rights Act is subject to the statute of limitations the state courts would apply in an analogous state action. Accordingly, the three year New York statute of limitations <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> governs Meyer\u2019s instant \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Ortiz v. LaVallee, </em>442 F.2d 912 (2 Cir. 1971); <em>Swan v. Board of Education, </em>319 F.2d 56 (2 Cir. 1963).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since Meyer\u2019s self-incrimination and due process causes of action accrued no later than June 4, 1971, the date of his dismissal from the force, the instant civil rights action commenced four years later is time-barred unless a tolling principle applies so as to excuse the year\u2019s delay. Meyer urges us to create a toll for the period during which he pursued a remedy in the state courts. Specifically, he urges us to toll the twenty-three month period from August 1971 to July 1973 so as to render the instant civil rights action timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>It is well settled that the federal courts have the power to toll statutes of limitations borrowed from state law in appropriate circumstances. <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 465 (1975); <em>Holmberg v. Armbrecht, </em>327 U.S. 392, 395 (1946); <em>Moviecolor Ltd. </em>v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co., </em>288 F.2d 80 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 821 (1961). We recently have affirmed the applicability of this principle in the context of a \u00a7 1983 cause of action. <em>Kaiser v. Cahn, </em>510 F.2d 282, 286-87 (2 Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Whether to toll in a particular case has been stated in terms of whether application of the borrowed state statute of limitations would frustrate the policy underlying the federal cause of action asserted. <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra, </em>421 U.S. at 465; <em>Burnett v. New York Central R.R., </em>380 U.S. 424, 426-27 (1965). The inquiry pursued in the eases, however, is somewhat broader than this statement implies. In practice, resolution of the tolling question involves striking a balance between protection of the substantive federal policy under consideration on the one hand and protection of the policy behind the statute of limitations on the other hand. The plaintiff\u2019s conduct \u2014 particularly his diligence in pressing his claim \u2014 also is taken into account. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra, </em>421 U.S. at 465-67; <em>UAW v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., </em>383 U.S. 696, 708 (1966); <em>Burnett v. New York Central R.R., supra, </em>380 U.S. at 428; <em>Blair v. Page Aircraft Maintenance, Inc., </em>467 F.2d 815 (5 Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The remedial policy underlying \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> considered alone, would not be impinged upon by applying the three year limitations period here. Since \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs are not required to exhaust state remedies, <em>Monroe v. Pape, supra </em>note 6, at 183, federal relief was available to Meyer all along. In consequence, the gravamen of his argument in support of a toll lies in federalism considerations of a general species. His theory is that the strong federal interest in redressing deprivations of constitutional rights manifested in \u00a7 1983 conflicts with a concomitant federal concern for encouraging the initial utilization of state agencies and courts for the vindication of wrongs committed by the state\u2019s agents. These can be accommodated, so the argument goes, only if a tolling principle assures the potential state court litigant of the residual availability of a \u00a7 1983 action. The Fifth Circuit adopted this reasoning in <em>Mizell v. North Broward Hospital District, </em>427 F.2d 468 (5 Cir. 1970), and tolled the period during which a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff had challenged an administrative ruling within the agency and in the state courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Meyer invites us to apply <em>Mizell </em>here. Assuming arguendo our agreement with the result reached there, the history of the instant litigation forecloses application here of the full force of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning. Meyer did not restrict his Article 78 petition to claims grounded in state law. Alleged violations of his Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and confrontation of witnesses were at the core of his petition. This is not a case like <em>Mizell </em>where the prior state court proceeding was directed at obtaining relief through an action grounded solely in state law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 470-71, 474. The only thing Meyer has held in reserve has been the federal court itself; federal law has played a principal role all along. The result is that the policy of avoiding federal interference with state affairs survives here in a diluted posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">We turn now from the federal policy consideration to the other relevant considerations, i. e. statute of limitations policy and Meyer\u2019s, conduct of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The policy of repose behind the statute of limitations protects defendants \u201cby preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\u201d <em>Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>321 U.S. 342, 348-49 (1944). It also protects the courts by. relieving \u201cthe burden of trying stale claims when a plaintiff has slept on his rights.\u201d <em>Burnett v. New York Central R.R., supra, </em>380 U.S. at 428. Meyer\u2019s conduct is the sort against which both of these considerations are directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Unlike Burnett,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> where the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was precisely the same in two successive suits and the defendant could not have relied on the policy of repose, this is a case where Meyer has prosecuted two different actions. Upon the conclusion of the state court action, which included state and federal claims, appellees hardly could be said to have been put on notice that an action in the federal court grounded on a different constitutional theory would follow two years later. The inference is just the opposite and brings to ap-pellees\u2019 side the policy of repose.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">Moreover, Meyer has slept on his rights \u201cin a very real sense.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, supra, 421 U.S. </em>at 466. In <em>Johnson, </em>limitations ran on the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1981 action in the midst of his efforts to obtain statutory relief from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Supreme Court faulted his conduct on the ground that a \u00a7 1981 action could have been brought at any time after his cause of action accrued.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Lack of diligence weighs even more heavily against Meyer. Not only might he have resorted to the federal court in the first instance, but he also had eleven months after the New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal in July 1973 before the three year limitations period ran out. <em>See UAW v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., supra, </em>383 U.S. at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">We hold that the federalism considerations urged by Meyer are of insufficient substance to outweigh the statute of limitations policy so directly brought to bear by the facts of this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-5\">.

Our conclusions below regarding the tolling of the limitations period for the \u00a7 1983 claim \u00bfpply likewise to the \u00a7 1985 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">. The purpose of \u00a7 1983, as explicated by the Supreme Court in <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 173-74 (1961), is to provide a federal remedy for federal constitutional rights where the remedy afforded by state law is either inadequate or unavailable as a practical matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\">. The Fifth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">\u201c[It] is clearly within the purpose of the Civil Rights Acts to encourage utilization of state administrative and court procedures to vindicate alleged wrongs <em>under </em>a <em>state-created cause of action </em>before requiring a plaintiff to bring his federal suit to prevent his being barred by a state statute of limitations.\u201d 427 F.2d at 474 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b793-13\">. We intimate no opinion as to how we would rule in a case indistinguishable from <em>Mizell.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. The plaintiff in <em>Burnett </em>began a timely FELA action in a state court only to have it dismissed for improper venue. The FELA limitations period ran out in the course of the state action. The Supreme Court held that the statute should be tolled during the period of the pendency of the state action so as to allow the plaintiff an action in the federal court. 380 U.S. at 428.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\">. Under <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra, </em>it may be that the factual question of whether the defendant was in a state of repose need be considered only when, as in <em>Burnett, </em>the two causes of action are the same. In other cases, an actual state of repose apparently may be presumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">\u201cOnly where there is complete identity of the causes of action will the protections [of the defendant\u2019s interests] suggested . . . necessarily exist and will the courts have an opportunity to assess the influence of the policy of repose inherent in a limitation period. ...\u201d 421 U.S. at 467, 468 n. 14.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b794-11\">. The question in <em>Johnson </em>was whether the timely filing \u00f3f a charge with the EEOC tolls the applicable state limitations period for an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1970). The Court held that it does not, relying on Congress\u2019 intent that administrative proceedings under Section 706 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (1970), and suit in court order \u00a7 1981 be \u201cseparate, distinct, and independent\u201d. 421 U.S. at 460-61, 465-66.

Robbins and Myers, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 229, 45 U.S.L.W. 4068 (U.S. Dec. 20, 1976). <em>Johnson </em>in no sense controls on the issue now before us, for the question of federalism policy presented in this case was not presented there. Nevertheless, we note the considerable weight <em>Johnson </em>places on upholding statute of limitations policy. 421 U.S. at 463-67, and 467 n. 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b794-17\">. In view of our holding above, we find it unnecessary to reach appellees\u2019 contention that Meyer\u2019s litigation of federal questions in his Article 78 proceeding bars the instant \u00a7 1983 action on the ground of res judicata.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>OAKES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A83\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">I would follow <em>Mizell v. North Broward Hospital District, </em>427 F.2d 468 (5th Cir. 1970). There the Fifth Circuit held that pursuit of state administrative and judicial remedies by a dismissed local government employee tolled the statute of limitations applicable to the employee\u2019s later-filed action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Judge Tuttle for the court reasoned that \u201cunder our system of federalism aggrieved persons should be encouraged to utilize state procedures before appealing to the federal courts . ,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 474; failure to toll the \u00a7 1983 statute of limitations while state remedies are being pursued would cause unnecessary filings of \u00a7 1983 actions and would defeat an \u201cunderlying purpose of the Civil Rights Act,\u201d <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Two crucial premises upon which the Fifth Circuit based its holding \u2014 that state remedies are separate and independent from \u00a7 1983 remedies, and that federal courts, while in general applying state statutes of limitations to \u00a7 1983 actions, have the authority and the obligation to create their own tolling rules when necessary, <em>id. </em>at 473-74 \u2014 have since been recognized as valid by our circuit. <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>502 F.2d 631, 635-37 (2d Cir. 1974) (federal claim under \u00a7 1983 separate from state claim), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 976, 95 S.Ct. 1400, 43 L.Ed.2d 656 (1975); <em>Kaiser </em>v. <em>Cahn, </em>510 F.2d 282, 286-87 (2d Cir. 1974). In the latter case, in reference to a \u00a7 1983 claim, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">We may in applying federal law to a claim based on a federal statute prevent a result that would substantially impair a valid federal interest. Thus a borrowed state statute of limitations may be tolled in conformity with federal doctrine where the right is the creature of federal statute, <em>Holmberg v. Ambrecht, </em>327 U.S. 392, 66 S.Ct. 582, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">We think that civil rights claimants, as well as seamen are entitled to, in the words of Mr. Justice Black \u201cfull benefit of federal law\u201d. <em>Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., </em>317 U.S. 239, 243, 63 S.Ct. 246, 87 L.Ed. 239 (1942).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-10\">In sum, we do not feel that we are necessarily bound by the state\u2019s determination of when its statute of limitations is tolled where the question arises in a civil rights claim in the federal court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACg\">510 F.2d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">The. majority distinguishes <em>Mizell </em>on the basis that appellant \u201cdid not restrict his [state court] petition to claims grounded in state law.\u201d Majority op., <em>ante </em>at 729. But appellant did not make the same federal claim in state court as he makes here; as the majority points out, \u201cthe core\u201d of his federal claim in his state petition was \u201c[alleged violations of his Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and confrontation of witnesses . . . ,\u201d <em>id., </em>while he here claims violation of \u201chis Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\u201d and de-prival of \u201cthe pursuit of his calling without due process of law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 728. The majority says that \u201c[t]he only thing Meyer has held in reserve has been the federal court itself . . . <em>id. </em>at 729, ignoring the fact that he has also \u201cheld in reserve\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Fifth Amendment and due process claims. The considerations set forth in <em>Mizell, Lombard </em>and <em>Kaiser </em>should apply to all federal claims not asserted in state court, regardless whether other federal claims were asserted in the state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The district court in this case refused to consider <em>Mizell </em>because it viewed as controlling the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), a view correctly rejected by the majority, majority op., <em>ante </em>at p. 730 n.ll. <em>Johnson </em>held that the filing of a Title VII charge with the EEOC did not toll the statute of limitations applicable to a \u00a7 1981 action. The <em>Johnson </em>case is readily distinguishable from this one in two respects. First, concerns of federalism were not implicated there, since both of plaintiff\u2019s avenues of relief were federal. Second, the procedures under Title VII and \u00a7 1981 were intended by Congress to complement each other, 421 U.S. at 459, 95 S.Ct. 1716, and essentially the same claims can be made in both types of actions. Here, by contrast, plaintiff\u2019s two avenues of relief derive from different sources of authority and involve entirely different claims, even though the same result (reinstatement) is being sought in both forums. Since constitutional issues raised in the state proceeding cannot be relitigated in the \u00a7 1983 action, <em>Lombard v. Board of Education, supra, </em>502 F.2d at 636-37, the two forums are, with regard to federal constitutional relief, mutually exclusive, whereas in the <em>Johnson </em>situation the Supreme Court emphasized the nonex-clusivity of the Title VII and Civil Rights Act procedures, 421 U.S. at 459, 95 S.Ct. 1716.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">I would hold that the statute of limitations applicable to Detective Meyer\u2019s present claims under \u00a7 1983 was tolled while he was seeking relief in the state courts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\">. In the Fifth Circuit <em>Mizell v. North Broward Hosp. Dist., </em>427 F.2d 468 (5th Cir. 1970), remains good law, <em>see Guerra v. Manchester Terminal Corp., </em>498 F.2d 641, 649 n.13 (5th Cir. 1974), despite some earlier concern about its demise, <em>see Blair v. Page Aircraft Maintenance, Inc., </em>467 F.2d 815, 821 (5th Cir. 1972) (Tuttle, J., dissenting) (suggesting possibility of \u201csub silentio\u201d overruling of <em>Mizell </em>by majority). The case of <em>Ammlung v. City of Chester, </em>494 F.2d 811, 816 (3d Cir. 1974), did criticize the \u201cfashioning [of] federal tolling principles\u201d in <em>Mizell, </em>but this aspect of <em>Mizell </em>has already been approved by the Second Circuit (without reference to Mizell) in <em>Kaiser v. Cahn, </em>510 F.2d 282, 286-87 (2d Cir. 1974). <em>Ammlung, </em>moreover, indicated that <em>Mizell </em>could be considered sound on its \u201cpeculiar facts,\u201d facts also extant in this case: <em>Mizell </em>involved \u201cthe utilization of state administrative procedures and the state courts to reinstate a privilege revoked by the state,\u201d and \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s success in having his [job] reinstated at the state level would have obviated the need for a federal civil rights action.\u201d 494 F.2d at 816.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-15\">. The majority\u2019s characterization of certain federal claims as being \u201cheld in reserve\u201d by litigants has a disapproving tone that I do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>accept. Litigants have a clear, unquestioned right to proceed with separate claims in state and federal forums. Indeed, one inevitable consequence of the majority\u2019s decision today is that state court litigants will hold many more issues \u201cin reserve\u201d for federal court consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
