Prior to trial, Nichel-son\u2019s court-appointed attorney filed a written motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 (1970) requesting a psychiatric examination to determine his client\u2019s competency to stand trial. After a brief pretrial hearing, the District Court denied the \u00a7 4244 motion. Nichelson\u2019s jury trial proceeded. He was convicted and appeals, contending that the trial court erred in denying his \u00a7 4244 motion for a psychiatric examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 provides, <em>\u00ednter alia, </em>that a District Court shall order a psychiatric examination when a motion filed thereunder recites \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that a person charged with an offense against the United States may be \u201cso mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense\u201d and sets forth the ground for this belief. The purpose of psychiatric examination under \u00a7 4244 is to establish competency to stand trial. <em>United States v. Maret, </em>433 F.2d 1064, 1067 (8th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 989, 91 S.Ct. 1678, 29 L.Ed.2d 155 (1971). A defendant is deemed competent if he has sufficient ability as of the time of trial to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of understanding and possesses rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him. <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>430 F.2d 526, 530 (8th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 1023, 91 S.Ct. 589, 27 L.Ed.2d 636 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The law in this circuit has long been settled that a trial court must grant a properly submitted request for a \u00a7 4244 examination unless the motion is frivolous or has not been made in good faith. <em>Rose v. United States, </em>513 F.2d 1251, 1255 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Kenner v. United States, </em>286 F.2d 208, 211 (8th Cir. 1960); <em>Krupnick v. United States, </em>264 F.2d 213, 216 (8th Cir. 1959). The ordering of a \u00a7 4244 examination is not a perfunctory or ministerial act on the district court\u2019s part, <em>Rose v. United States, supra </em>at 1255, but the permissible reasons for denying a \u00a7 4244 motion are narrowly circumscribed to lack of reasonable cause, frivolity or lack of good faith. A district court may make an initial inquiry to determine if the \u00a7 4244 motion is made in good faith, adequately shows reasonable cause and is not frivolous, <em>United States v. Varner, </em>467 F.2d 659, 661-62 (5th Cir. 1972), ' but a preliminary hearing is not to become a preliminary determination of competency. <em>Rose v. United States, supra </em>at 1255 n. 4. Thus, when a court makes an inquiry prior to ruling a \u00a7 4244 motion, it must take great care to eschew the ultimate issue of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The motion filed by defendant\u2019s counsel here comported with \u00a7 4244. The movant stated that he had \u201creasonable cause to believe [his] client may be presently insane or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his own defense.\u201d As grounds for this belief, counsel cited his own personal impression, gained during the course of \u25a0 preparation for trial, that Nichelson was unable \u201cintelligently to discuss the facts concerning the case.\u201d The motion also made reference to a history of mental disturbance in defendant\u2019s family and to defendant\u2019s having sustained a very severe blow to the head approximately six years previously. Nothing in this motion suggested frivolity, lack of reasonable cause or a lack of good faith on the movant\u2019s part. Thus, the motion was sufficient under \u00a7 4244 and the trial court erred in refusing to order a psychiatric examination of defendant thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Defendant urges that his conviction should be set aside because of the trial court\u2019s erroneous denial of his \u00a7 4244 motion. However, defendant\u2019s conviction would be rendered invalid by the denial of this motion only in the event that he was tried when he was in fact mentally incompetent to stand trial. <em>Krupnick v. United States, supra </em>at 218. Less than four months has passed since defendant\u2019s trial and conviction. The grounds cited in support of movant\u2019s belief that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial in October, 1976 are of a continuing rather than temporary nature. Thus, we believe that circumstances now are sufficiently similar to those in October, 1976 to permit a nunc pro tunc determination of defendant\u2019s mental competency to stand trial. Accordingly, we remand to the District Court with directions to order a psychiatric examination of defendant under \u00a7 4244. If, following this examination, the District Court finds defendant competent to stand trial, his convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tion is valid and it must stand. <em>Krupnick v. United States, supra </em>at 218. If, on the other hand, the District Court finds the defendant incompetent to stand trial, the conviction is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
