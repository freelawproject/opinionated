The agents then smelled marijuana in the car. A subsequent search confirmed that olfactory suspicion: some 71 pounds of marijuana were discovered. The trial court denied a motion to prevent use of the contraband as evidence against the Sosas, and found them guilty of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The Sosas were sentenced on June 26, 1975. They filed a notice of appeal to this Court the same day and timely met all ancillary requirements. The Supreme Court decided the case of <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975), on June 30,1975. On August 8, 1975, this Court in an unpublished opinion interpreted <em>Brignoni-Ponce </em>as requiring the reversal on direct appeal of convictions based on evidence obtained by use of the Hebbronville chekar device in circumstances identical to the Sosas\u2019 case. <em>United States v. Peralez, </em>517 F.2d 1402 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc denied sub nom. United States </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>526 F.2d 954 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">On September 23, 1975, the Sosas moved this Court to dismiss their direct appeal. The motion specified that the dismissal was <em>requested for the purpose of permitting the trial court to act on a section 2255 motion to vacate judgment and sentence in light of our Peralez decision.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Clerk of the Court, in accordance with FRAP 42 and as required by our Local Rule 9, entered an order of dismissal. The Sosas then filed a section 2255 motion in the sentencing court. The district court, after notifying the Government and receiving an answer which petitioners allege raised questions of law only, summarily granted the section 2255 motion. The Government now contends that the district court\u2019s order should be reversed because (1) the Sosas \u201cdeliberately bypassed\u201d appellate review, thereby forfeiting their right to seek section 2255 relief; (2) the fourth amendment claim that the Sosas seek to raise is not cognizable in section 2255 proceedings; and (3) the district court granted the motion without holding a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">I. SURROGATE APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Although section 2255 proclaims that a \u201cmotion for such relief may be made at any time,\u201d it is a judicial commonplace that \u201cthe writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>will not be allowed to do service for an appeal,\u201d <em>Sunal v. Large, </em>332 U.S. 174, 178, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 1590, 91 L.Ed. 1982 (1947); <em>accord, e. g., Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 274, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942). If the rule against employing habeas as a surrogate for appeal meant only that a petition should not normally be entertained while direct review is still available, application of the rule would occasion little difficulty. The rule, however, expresses substantive as well as procedural policies: in certain circumstances failure to pursue a direct appeal will be held to tilt the equities against a habeas petitioner and prevent him from obtaining collateral relief, e. <em>g., Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 428-29, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962) (petitioner had not appealed trial court\u2019s failure to afford him opportunity to make statement in his own behalf at sentencing); <em>Sunal v. Large, </em>332 U.S. 174,177-181, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982 (1947) (petitioners were part of concerted test case effort in which some judgments were appealed while others were not).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">In the instant case, the Sosa brothers dismissed their direct appeal and sought section 2255 relief. The Government insists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that this action constituted a \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d of direct review which forecloses collateral attack. But the Government\u2019s use of the rule that habeas will not be allowed to do service for an appeal is too pat. The Government fails to show how and why the Sosas have so abused the privilege of the Great Writ as to preclude them from obtaining relief to which they are obviously otherwise entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The term \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d is not self-executing; it depends upon legal conclusion. It encapsulates an equitable doctrine that took form as early as <em>Ex Parte Kear-ney, </em>20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 37, 42-43, 5 L.Ed. 391 (1822); <em>Matter of Gregory, </em>219 U.S. 210, 213, 31 S.Ct. 143, 55 L.Ed. 184 (1911). The term itself entered the habeas corpus lexicon after <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u201cAlthough we hold that the jurisdiction of the federal courts on habeas corpus is not affected by procedural defaults incurred by the applicant during the state court proceedings, we recognize a limited discretion in the federal judge to deny relief to an applicant under certain circumstances. . . . [Hjabeas corpus has traditionally been regarded as governed by equitable principles. Among them is the principle that a suitor\u2019s conduct in relation to the matter at hand may disentitle him to the relief he seeks. . We therefore hold that the federal habeas judge may in his discretion deny relief to an applicant who has deliberately by-passed the orderly procedure of the state courts and in so doing has forfeited his state court remedies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">372 U.S. at 438, 83 S.Ct. at 848 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Although the Supreme Court enforced the general rule against surrogate appeals in <em>Sunal v. Large, </em>332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982 (1947), the Court was careful to preserve the not inconsiderable number of exceptions to the rule, see 332 U.S. at 178-181 &amp; nn. 6-13, 67 S.Ct. 1588, when \u201cthe writ has . . . been entertained either without consideration of the adequacy of relief by the appellate route or where an appeal would have afforded an adequate remedy\u201d, 332 U.S. at 178, 67 S.Ct. at 1591. The Court\u2019s catalogue of exceptions shows that the archetypal case for the application of the rule precluding collateral attack is when direct appeal has been foregone as a tactical maneuver. <em>See </em>332 U.S. at 180-182, 67 S.Ct. 1588.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">We thus begin with the proposition recognized in <em>Sunal </em>and respected in subsequent decisions, that failure to appeal does not, by itself, require a habeas court to deny the petition. \u201c[T]he question rather is whether the case is one in which refusal to exercise that power [to adjudicate the merits of constitutional claims on habeas is] appropriate,\u201d <em>Kaufman v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 217, 220 n. 3, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1071 n. 3,22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969), for the rule against surrogate appeals \u201cis not one defining power but one which relates to the appropriate exercise of power\u201d, <em>Bowen v. Johnston, </em>306 U.S. 19, 27, 59 S.Ct. 442, 446, 83 L.Ed. 455 (1939). Our own jurisprudence traces a similar course, and consistently returns to the holding that the motivation or reason for the failure to appeal, and not the mere datum that an appeal was not taken or completed, determines whether a section 2255 motion ought to be entertained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rule against surrogate appeals is not, therefore, a strict jurisdictional requirement. Rather, it is a formulation of jurisprudential considerations that may vary as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>equities of a case vary. We believe the equities weigh heavily in the Sosas\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Our consideration of the Sosas\u2019 claim is not uninfluenced by the fact that our own procedures may have contributed to the problem. The motion for dismissal clearly states the Sosas\u2019 intention to dismiss the direct appeal <em>in order to seek section 2255 relief. </em>If we had specifically authorized the dismissal as a prelude to section 2255 proceedings, Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which provides that an \u201cappeal may be dismissed on motion of the appellant upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the parties or fixed by the court\u201d, would conclude the matter. However, our own Local Rule 9(a) makes perfunctory our approval of motions for voluntary dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, although we cannot be said to have countenanced the Sosas\u2019 action, we are reluctant to limit the exercise of an essentially equitable authority where the circumstances so visibly show the Sosas\u2019 good faith and our own indirect responsibility for their present predicament.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The Government reads several of our pri- or decisions as supporting its characterization of the Sosas\u2019 actions as a deliberate bypass. A careful analysis of those cases, however, leads to the opposite conclusion. In <em>Larson v. United States, </em>275 F.2d 673 (5th Cir. 1960), the petitioner had not appealed from a conviction and life sentence in a murder trial. His codefendant, who had been sentenced to die, appealed and eventually won retrial in circumstances that \u201creduced almost to zero\u201d the \u201crisk of a death sentence\u201d for Larson, 275 F.2d at 675. We affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Larson\u2019s subsequent section 2255 motion on the ground that his failure to appeal was part of a \u201cconsidered strategy not to jeopardize his life by running the risk of a new trial,\u201d 275 F.2d at 674; see 275 F.2d at 679-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Equally wayward is the Government\u2019s citation of <em>Montgomery v. Hopper, </em>488 F.2d 877 (5th Cir. 1973), for in that case we pointed out that not all intentional failures to appeal can be labeled as the \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d which also carries the prisoner past collateral attack. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQj\">\u201cThe term \u2018deliberate bypass\u2019 is one of art. . . . The circumstances revealed by this record fall short of authorizing the conclusion that [the petitioner] deliberately bypassed his right of appeal . to gain any tactical or strategic advantage in the pursuit of his claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">488 F.2d at 879-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">The Sosas, appellees here, contend that they only \u201ctried to expedite the instant case at the least expense and with the least inconvenience to this Court.\u201d We agree. They were free on bond pending appeal, so the section 2255 motion could secure them no particular tactical advantage over direct appeal as a means of avoiding imprisonment. No legal machinations appear to have influenced their decision. True, the <em>Peralez </em>case might have been reversed <em>en banc, </em>but the section 2255 proceedings would have been reviewable in this Court had <em>Peralez </em>gone the other way <em>en banc. </em>And since the only issue was the legality of the stop, the section 2255 motion offered no prospect that a nonappealable judgment of acquittal would be entered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">While we strongly discourage the withdrawal of a direct appeal in favor of a section 2255 motion, we see no reason to administer the rather harsh punishment demanded by the Government for conduct which, at worst, amounts to an excess of zeal. Our cases firmly reject any rigid application of the rule against surrogate appeals. Instead, they establish the principle that habeas will not be permitted to substitute for an appeal when the choice to seek habeas relief is made in order to seize some legal or tactical advantage for the defendant. No such ulterior purpose has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>shown to have directed the Sosas\u2019 actions. We therefore hold that the district court properly entertained the section 2255 motion despite the fact that the direct appeal had been voluntarily dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">II. THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE AND COLLATERAL ATTACK</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Recent Supreme Court decisions demonstrate that the exclusionary rule should be treated as a \u201cjudicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than [as] a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved\u201d, <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613, 620, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); <em>accord, United States v. Peltier, </em>422 U.S. 531, 538-39, 95 S.Ct. 2313, 45 L.Ed.2d 374 (1975). The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), that a state prisoner afforded an adequate opportunity to contest the admission of illegally seized evidence at his state trial is not entitled to federal habeas corpus consideration of such a claim, confirms that the exclusionary rule, while constitutionally inspired, is not constitutionally required. Hence, the Government \u25a0 contends, the same considerations which led the Supreme Court to disapprove the application of the exclusion rule by federal habeas courts as a remedy for fourth amendment violations brought to their attention by state prisoners, should spur us to restrict similarly the remedial powers of a section 2255 court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 217, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969), the Supreme Court held that fourth amendment exclusionary rule claims are cognizable in section 2255 proceedings. We need not now decide whether <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>a state prisoner case, overruled <em>Kaufman sub silentio, </em>because <em>Stone\u2019s </em>precondition for the denial of the exclusionary rule remedy by a habeas court has not been fulfilled in the special and unique circumstances of this case. <em>Stone </em>held that a habeas court should not order the suppression of illegally seized evidence when the petitioner has been \u201cprovided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of [his] Fourth Amendment claim\u201d by state tribunals. 428 U.S. at 482, 494, 96 S.Ct. at 3046, 3052. We recently interpreted the meaning of \u201cfull and fair consideration\u201d in <em>O\u2019Berry v. Wainwright, </em>546 F.2d 1204 (5th Cir. 1977). There, we held that the \u201copportunity for full and fair consideration\u201d must include at least one evidentiary hearing in a trial court and one decision by an appellate court which, if \u201cpresented with an undisputed factual record, gives full consideration to [the prisoner\u2019s] Fourth Amendment claims.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\"><em>Stone v. Powell </em>is inapposite to the instant case even if its rule is transposed to section 2255 proceedings. In the special circumstances of this case, the section 2255 proceedings served \u2014 but not improperly \u2014 as the appellate review which our <em>O\u2019Berry </em>decision requires. Consequently, when the Sosas sought section 2255 relief, they had not yet had an \u201copportunity for full and fair consideration\u201d of their fourth amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">This opinion through Section II is concurred in by all judges. The succeeding Section III and the judgment of the Court are concurred in by Judges Clark and Ro-ney. Judge Tuttle files a separate opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>dealing with the construction of section 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">III. REQUIREMENT OF A HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"A_V\">Section 2255 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At5\">\u201cUnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The Government argues that this language must be taken literally and that section 2255 mandates a hearing whenever the files and records do not make manifest the invalidity of the claim, including those cases in which the files and records conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to full relief as a matter of law. According to the Government, the statute forces the trial court to conduct a hearing whenever the petitioner\u2019s claim is plausible enough to cause the statutory \u201cnotice\u201d to be served upon the United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">This Court has recently construed this language in <em>Ferrara v. United States, </em>547 F.2d 861 (5th Cir. No. 76-1426, 1977) in a manner consistent with the Government\u2019s contention. While the <em>Ferrara </em>case dealt with a section 2255 motion in which there was a disputed fact issue, which may distinguish it from this case, we conclude that the preferred manner to deal with the Sosas\u2019 section 2255 case is to remand it to the trial court to permit the Government to have a hearing in support of its defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">SEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE TUT-TLE:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">With deference, I do not agree with the disposition of this case which requires another trip to the district court probably followed by another appearance here, when I am convinced that the trial court had full power to grant the section 2255 motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">As noted, I agree with the Court in holding that the section 2255 motion was properly filed. I disagree only in the construction of section 2255, since I am convinced that the requirement of a hearing was intended by Congress as protection for the petitioner only in that it was to prevent summary dismissals of section 2255 motions. The right of the Government to a hearing if only legal questions were presented and the petitioner\u2019s right to relief was clear was not, I have concluded, within the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute. I suppose the most difficult burden is the thesis that \u201cplain language\u201d does not always mean what it says. Nevertheless, because I believe that proper standards of statutory construction demand it, I feel it necessary to try to carry that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">\n<em>A. The \u201cPlain Meaning\" Approach to Statutory Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">I reject at the outset the notion that the \u201cliteral terms\u201d or \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute obviates the need for further analysis. The literal meaning of a statute is, after all, no more than that meaning which is most linguistically probable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The literal terms of a statute certainly do not preclude the very real possibility that Congress employed a particular collocation of words to effect a somewhat different purpose than that which might be inferred from the definitions of an unabridged dictionary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is particularly true where, as in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>case, the scope of a fairly clear statutory provision is questioned. Thus, the Supreme Court has often tempered the literal force of all-embracing statutory language in order to avoid untoward results. For example, in <em>Price v. Johnston, </em>334 U.S. 266, 285-86, 68 S.Ct. 1049,1060, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948), the Court held that although the literal terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 394 guaranteed all litigants an \u201cotherwise unqualified right\u201d to <em>pro se </em>appellate argument, that right could \u201cbe circumscribed as to prisoners [seeking habeas corpus] where reasonable necessity so dictates.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Standard Oil Co. v. United States, </em>221 U.S. 1, 63-70, 31 S.Ct. 502, 517, 55 L.Ed. 619 (1911), the Court announced the famous \u201crule of reason\u201d and specifically rejected the argument that Sherman Act section 1 \u201cembraces every contract ... in restraint of trade, and hence its text leaves no room for the exercise of judgment, but simply imposes the plain duty of applying its prohibitions to every case within its literal language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The \u201cplain meaning\u201d approach to statutory construction simply begs the question. In every case where the scope or terms of a statutory provision are subject to reasonable dispute, the issue is <em>which </em>meaning is \u201cplain.\u201d To say, without elaboration, that one possible interpretation is \u201cplain\u201d and that another possible interpretation is \u201cnot plain,\u201d obscures rather than clarifies the decisionmaking process. A court which employs the \u201cplain meaning\u201d approach and interprets the terms and scope of a statute literally, without inquiring whether that literal meaning is consistent with Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting the statute, fails to respect adequately Congress\u2019 lawmaking power. For these reasons, the Supreme Court repudiated the \u201cplain meaning\u201d approach nearly forty years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cOften [the words of a statute] are sufficient in and of themselves to determine the purpose of the legislation. In such cases we have followed their plain meaning. When that meaning has led to absurd or futile results, however, this Court has looked beyond the words to the purpose of the act. Frequently, however, even when the plain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one \u2018plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole\u2019 this Court has followed that purpose, rather than the literal words. When aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no \u2018rule of law\u2019 which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear on \u2018superficial examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, </em>310 U.S. 534, 543-44, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Any reliance on a literalist or \u201cplain meaning\u201d approach to section 2255 also ignores the history of the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the statute. In the landmark decision of <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), another case in which the scope of a fairly unambiguous provision of section 2255 was disputed, the Court refused to adopt a literal construction of language in section 2255 which provides that the \u201csentencing court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\u201d Instead, the Court first noted that Congress\u2019 purpose had been to make the section 2255 motion remedy as broad as habeas corpus, and that the habeas corpus statute (section 2244) authorized 'summary disposition of successive applications only when the petition raised \u201cno new ground not theretofore presented.\u201d <em>Sanders </em>therefore held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">\u201c[T]here is an apparent verbal discrepancy [between section 2244 and 2255], Under \u00a7 2255, [the \u2018similar relief\u2019] language might seem to empower the sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>fencing court to apply <em>res judicata </em>at will, since even if a second motion is predicated on a completely different ground . . . the prisoner ordinarily will be seeking the same \u2018relief\u2019. . <em>But the language cannot be taken literally. . . </em>[because a section 2244 applicant] would not enjoy the \u2018same rights\u2019 as the habeas corpus applicant .

It may be that the scope of section 2255\u2019s hearing requirement is as broad as the statute\u2019s literal sweep. But if <em>Price v. Johnston, Standard Oil Co. v. United States, United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, </em>and <em>Sanders v. United States </em>teach us anything about statutory interpretation, their lesson must be that fidelity to Congressional purpose often requires that a statute be given a less expansive construction than its literal terms might otherwise permit. I therefore turn to the task of ascertaining the scope of section 2255\u2019s hearing requirement in light of the purpose of section 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\n<em>B. The Purpose of Section 2255\u2019s Hearing Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I do not mean to disregard the language of section 2255 which requires a hearing unless the files and records conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief. I do intend, however, to ask whether Congress in employing that language meant to enable the Government to insist that useless evidentiary hearings be held, or whether Congress meant only to specify the conditions under which a prisoner could demand an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right. It may well be that in devising the section 2255 motion procedure, Congress did not address the problem of a \u201cconclusive\u201d loss for the Government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">In attributing legislative purpose, a court begins with the assumption that Congress acted reasonably in establishing the section 2255 hearing procedure. The question then immediately arises: why would a reasonable legislature require courts to hold eviden-tiary hearings when no facts are disputed, and why would a reasonable legislature require oral argument when the parties\u2019 written submissions are sufficient to decide a case? The function of an evidentiary hearing is to resolve contested issues of fact. <em>See Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 309 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). If the facts are not disputed, an evidentiary hearing is useless. And oral argument concerning issues of law \u2014 if not necessary to improve the court\u2019s understanding of the issues \u2014 is a luxury at best. I find it difficult to credit the argument that Congress in enacting section 2255 meant to have the federal courts make much ado about nothing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I would therefore hold that where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>files and records of a case conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled as a matter of law either to no relief or to full relief, the section 2255 court may \u2014 and indeed should \u2014 enter the appropriate order without holding an evidentiary hearing or oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">If I believed that Congress meant section 2255 to require a hearing in all cases where the petitioner\u2019s claim is not rebutted by the files and records, I could hardly maintain that the section 2255 court need not hold redundant evidentiary hearings and listen to unnecessary oral argument. But the legislative history of section 2255 belies any such Congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Prior to the revision of the Judicial Code in 1948, it was common practice for federal habeas courts to grant relief without holding a hearing if no facts were contested and no useful purpose could be served by oral argument. As stated in the leading case of <em>Walker v. Johnston, </em>312 U.S. 275, 284, 61 S.Ct. 574, 578, 85 L.Ed. 404 (1941): \u201c[0]n the facts admitted, it may appear that, as matter of law, the prisoner is entitled to the writ and to a discharge. This practice has long been followed by this court and by the lower courts.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A thorough sifting of the legislative history of section 2255 fails to unearth even a shard of evidence suggesting that Congress meant to change this practice. Instead, section 2255 was enacted to permit federal prisoners to seek postconviction relief in a court other than the district of confinement (where all habeas petitions had to be filed). The Supreme Court made this limited administrative purpose emphatically clear in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayman, </em>342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952), the first section 2255 case to reach the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">\u201c[T]he <em>sole purpose </em>was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum. The <em>very purpose </em>of Section 2255 is to hold any required hearing in the sentencing court because of the inconvenience of transporting court officials and other necessary witnesses to the district of confinement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 342 U.S. at 219-221, 72 S.Ct. at 272-273; <em>accord, </em>H.R.Rep. No. 2646, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (1946) 7; H.R.Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947) A120; S.Rep. No. 1559, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. (1948) 8-10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azn\">Surely Congress, in attempting to more equally distribute the judicial business of federal habeas corpus petitions did not intend to saddle the federal courts under the new procedure with the responsibility of needless hearings, not required under the old, when the merits of a section 2255 motion can be conclusively determined on the basis of the files and records. The beneficiary of the \u201chearing\u201d to which section 2255 refers was to be the prisoner, not the Government, for the section 2255 procedure represented a reduction in the number of hearings which some courts had felt compelled to afford a petitioner on successive applications. <em>See </em>the discussion of Chief Judge Parker, Chairman of the Judicial Conference Committee which drafted section 2255, in <em>Limiting the Abuse of Habeas Corpus, </em>8 F.R.D. 171, 174-75 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">I do not dispute that public policy requires that the Government be given notice and an opportunity to respond when there is a possibility that a criminal conviction will be vacated. But I can find no evidence in the legislative history of section 2255 indicating that the Government need be \u201cheard\u201d via an evidentiary hearing and oral argument. Rather, those procedures should be reserved for cases in which they could contribute to the court\u2019s understanding or the Government\u2019s articulation of its position. If the Government does not dispute the petitioner\u2019s version of the facts, I cannot imagine a responsible United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>attorney insisting on an evidentiary hearing; and the utility of oral argument on issues of law is best left to the informed discretion of the section 2255 court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">My conclusion that no hearing is <em>required </em>by section 2255 when no facts are disputed and when oral argument is not helpful, is buttressed by the Supreme Court\u2019s consistent holding that the remedies available under section 2255 are \u201cexactly commensurate with that which had previously been available by habeas corpus in the court of the district where the prisoner was confined\u201d, <em>Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 427/82 S.Ct. 468, 471, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962); <em>accord, e. g., Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 334, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 511, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954); <em>United States v. Hayman, </em>342 U.S. 205, 214-229, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952); <em>Larson v. United States, </em>275 F.2d 673, 676 n. 5 (5th Cir. 1960). Given the fact that summary disposition of habeas petitions in the prisoner\u2019s favor was common prior to the enactment of section 2255, and the lack of any indication that Congress sought to alter this practice, I believe that to force a section 2255 applicant to endure the rigamarole of needless hearings would ignore the teaching of those Supreme Court decisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">C. The <em>Ferrara </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"Aj2\">My interpretation here is not inconsistent with our recent decision in <em>Ferrara v. United States, </em>547 F.2d 861 (5th Cir. No. 76-1426,1977). In <em>Ferrara, </em>the prisoner filed a section 2255 motion to have his conviction and sentence vacated \u201con the ground that the government had failed to correct the testimony of its key witness, allegedly known by the government to have perjured himself.\u201d 547 F.2d at 862. The Government filed a general denial as an answer, and the district court granted the motion without a hearing. We reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The crucial distinction between <em>Ferrara </em>and the instant case is that in <em>Ferrara </em>the Government contested the facts, <em>i.e., </em>whether perjury did occur and whether the Government knowingly used perjured testimony, <em>see </em>547 F.2d 861 at 862, while in this case the Government opposed the section 2255 motion solely on legal grounds. Properly read, <em>Ferrara </em>stands only for the proposition that <em>the section 2255 motion cannot be granted without a hearing when the Government contests the petitioner\u2019s version of the facts. </em>Our statement in <em>Ferrara </em>that \u201c[granting [section 2255] relief . without a hearing is not authorized by statute,\u201d 547 F.2d at 863, was partially dictum. Moreover, our suggestion that <em>Fontaine v. United States, </em>411 U.S. 213, 215, 93 S.Ct. 1461, 36 L.Ed.2d 169 (1973); <em>Reed v. United States, </em>441 F.2d 569, 572 (9th Cir. 1971); and <em>Tucker v. United States, </em>138 U.S.App. D.C. 345, 427 F.2d 615, 617 (1970), had construed section 2255 \u201cin accordance with its literal language\u201d must be understood in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>light of the actual facts and holdings of those three cases. <em>Fontaine, Reed, </em>and <em>Tucker </em>all reversed lower court decisions where the petition had been dismissed \u2014 not granted \u2014 without a hearing although the prisoner alleged facts which, if proved at an evidentiary hearing, would have entitled him to relief. Those cases merely applied the earlier Supreme Court decision of <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), which announced a comprehensive set of rules specifying when a petition could be dismissed without a hearing. Neither they nor <em>Fer-rara </em>confronted the question whether section 2255 hearings must be held when the parties raise only questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\">. Because the section 2255 proceeding, like ha-beas corpus, is equitable in nature, the sentencing court in its discretion may decline to entertain the motion while direct appeal is still available. <em>See </em>Part I <em>infra. </em>However, the statute provides that the motion for relief may be made \u201cat any time,\u201d and therefore the completion of appellate review is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to section 2255 relief. <em>See </em>authorities cited in note 2 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\">. <em>E. g., Nash v.

Such a distinction makes practical sense because it ensures that a criminal defendant is given a full hearing on his Fourth Amendment claims and the facts underlying those claims at least once at the state level, but it does not require the State to hold evidentiary hearings which would be useless and inefficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">546 F.2d at 1213.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\">. \u201cLiteral meaning is the meaning carried by language when it is read in its dictionary sense unaffected by considerations of particular context.

In its response to the Sosas\u2019 section 2255 motion, the Government contended (1) that the Sosas had \u201cdeliberately bypassed appellate review,\u201d (2) that \u201cthe search complained of . was based upon probable cause. <em>United States v. Santibanez, </em>517 F.2d 922 (5th Cir. 1975),\u201d and (3) that \u201cthere was reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle for a routine immigration inspection, considering the notoriety of Texas Highway 16 and Farm Road 3073 as smuggling route, and the time of night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">As indicated in Part I, <em>supra, </em>deliberate bypass is a question of law, not of fact, and neither in its response to the Sosas\u2019 motion nor in this Court has the Government alleged any facts different from those conclusively shown by the files and records. Since the Government was attempting to characterize undisputed facts as a \u201cdeliberate bypass,\u201d rather than offering to prove new facts in support of such a\" contention, no evidentiary hearing was required to determine the deliberate bypass claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">In contending that the <em>search </em>was based upon probable cause and in citing <em>Santibanez, </em>the Government was arguing for the established principle that an officer has probable cause to search when he smells the odor of marijuana, <em>see United States v. Santibanez, </em>517 F.2d 922, 923 (5th Cir. 1975). But the Government was in no way disputing the fact that the <em>stop </em>had been made only because the chekar device had been triggered, nor could it have disputed the fact that the Hebbronville chekar device did not amount to a \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of the border which might have permitted a <em>stop </em>without reasonable suspicion. <em>See United States v. Del Bosque, </em>523 F.2d 1251, 1252 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Estrada, </em>526 F.2d 357, 358 (5th Cir. 1976). And as long as the stop was illegal, the legality of the subsequent search was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-20\">Finally, the argument that the notoriety of the roads and the time of night constituted the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d necessary to justify a stop by a roving patrol presented only a question of law that we have already decided adversely to the Government. <em>See United States v. Partner, </em>527 F.2d 1337, 1338 (5th Cir. 1976) (no reasonable suspicion where vehicle was traveling on Highway 16 at 1:15 a. m.). <em>Compare United States v.

United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 495, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); <em>accord Sanders v.

For this reason, maxims of construction such as <em>expressio unius est exclusio aiterius </em>are not particularly helpful in the instant case.

I need not, however, align myself with those commentators who have contended that for every maxim of construction there is always an opposite, <em>see </em>Llewellyn, <em>Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to be Construed, </em>3 Vand.L.Rev. 38 395, 401-08 (1950), or that the maxims \u201care useful only as facades, which for an occasional judge may add lustre to an argument persuasive for other reasons,\u201d Newman &amp; Surrey, Legislation \u2014 Legislation\u2014Cases and Materials 654 (1955).

(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">The Advisory Committee note accompanying Rule 8 says that the \u201cstandards for \u00a7 2255 hearings are essentially the same as for eviden-tiary hearings under a habeas petition, except that the previous federal fact-finding proceeding is in issue rather than the state\u2019s.\u201d This is particularly significant because under the habe-as procedure outlined in <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 312-313, 318, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), no evidentiary hearing is required when state factfindings are not disputed. <em>Accord, Wright v. Dickson, </em>336 F.2d 878, 881 (9th Cir. 1964) (\u201cOnly if it appears from undisputed facts . . . that as a matter of law [a prisoner] is entitled to discharge, or that as a matter of law he is not, may an evidentiary hearing be avoided.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
