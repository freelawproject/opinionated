We affirm in the case of Enrique Platt-Lopez (Enrique), and we reverse the convictions of Rene Esquer-Ga-mez (Esquer) and Guillermo Platt-Lopez (Guillermo).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-16\">While in Phoenix, Arizona, Enrique, a Mexican citizen, was introduced to Ron Umbower, a government informant. Um-bower asked Enrique whether Enrique could buy cocaine for him in Mexico. Enrique agreed to \u201clook into it.\u201d From November, 1975, to February, 1976, Umbower contacted Enrique approximately twenty times regarding the possibility of obtaining cocaine. Umbower told Enrique that his \u201cpeople\u201d were upset with Enrique, who could earn a substantial amount of money if he cooperated. Finally, Enrique agreed to meet with the \u201cdealers,\u201d and at the meeting produced an ounce of cocaine, which the \u201cdealers,\u201d actually narcotics agents, purchased. At another meeting on April 13, 1976, the agents showed Enrique $26,000 in cash, which they said they were willing to exchange for 20 ounces of cocaine. The transaction was to be completed three days later in Nogales, Arizona. On the morning of April 16, Enrique contacted the agents at their hotel room in Nogales and gave them three ounces of cocaine. He then took one of the agents to the restaurant of the hotel and called Esquer over to them, after which the three men proceeded to the restroom. There, Esquer handed Enrique an opaque package and left. Next, Guillermo, Enrique\u2019s brother, entered the restroom, gave Enrique a similar package and left. Each of the packages contained three ounces of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-18\">I. <em>Enrique Platt-Lopez\u2019s Appeal, No. 76-2745.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-20\">Enrique raises three issues: (1) that he was entrapped as a matter of law; (2) that a remark made by the prosecutor was prejudicial; and (3) that the court erred in not striking a prejudicial and unresponsive statement made by a prosecution witness. We find no merit in any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-21\">(1) Entrapment is established when it is shown that a government agent has persuaded an unwilling person to commit a crime. The crucial factor is the predisposition of the defendant rather than the degree of government participation. The question is one of fact, and on appeal we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>1976, 425 U.S. 484, 488, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 48 L.Ed.2d 113; <em>United States v. Rus</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number><em>sell, </em>1973, 411 U.S. 423, 433, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366; <em>United States v. Reynoso-Ulloa, </em>9 Cir., 1977, 548 F.2d 1329; <em>United States v. Hermosillo-Nanez, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 545 F.2d 1230, 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">Enrique argues that he was not predisposed to commit the crime, pointing out that he did not provide cocaine immediately upon Umbower\u2019s initial request and that he only cooperated after repeated inducements, approximately twenty in number. Yet Enrique never refused to become involved. The first time Umbower asked him whether he could obtain cocaine in Mexico, Enrique said that he would \u201clook into it.\u201d He supplied cocaine to the agents at a meeting before the one at which he was arrested, and he was willing to, and did, do so again. Moreover, the only inducement offered by the informant and the other agents was money. \u201cThe defense of entrapment, while protecting the innocent from Government creation of crime, is unavailable to a defendant who, motivated by greed and unconcerned about breaking the law, readily accepts a propitious opportunity to commit an offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Reynoso-Ulloa, supra, </em>548 F.2d at 1338. On the evidence, the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Enrique was predisposed to commit the crime. <em>United States v. Hermosillo-Nanez, s\u00fapra, </em>545 F.2d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">(2) During redirect examination of one of the agents, the prosecutor asked a leading question. In response to an objection, he explained that he was \u201ctrying to avoid bringing out some other matters that should not come out.\u201d Enrique argues that the statement implied that he had been engaging in narcotics activities before his arrest and that that implication could well have \u201ctipped the scales\u201d against him. While it is improper for a prosecutor to remark on any prior criminal conduct of a defendant that has not been made a part of the record, <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>9 Cir., 1975, 514 F.2d 334, 343, the prosecutor\u2019s statement in this case is not such a remark. The preceding questions dealt with Enrique\u2019s voluntary participation and his active role in the negotiations. While the prosecutor might have been more careful, there was no reference to any prior criminal conduct by Enrique. Finally, even if the jury could have interpreted the statement as Enrique suggests, the evidence against him was overwhelming. Thus, the statement was harmless, Rule 52(a), F.R. Crim.P.; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>9 Cir., 1972, 460 F.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">(3) Enrique argues that the trial court should have stricken a prejudicial, unresponsive statement by one of the agents. The agent had described the field tests which he performed on the substance given to him by Enrique and testified that he had not \u201csnorted the cocaine.\u201d The first question on cross-examination by defense counsel, and the answer, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-10\">BY MR. HOOKER:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-11\">Q Mr. Rogers, you wouldn\u2019t tell us if you did snort it, would you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-12\">MR. HAWKINS: Objection, Your Honor, I think that is highly improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-13\">THE COURT: No, he may answer. A I\u2019m willing to take a polygraph, if that is what you are leading to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-14\">(Reporter\u2019s Transcript at 290)</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-15\">Enrique claims that the answer requires a new trial. The argument verges on the frivolous. Counsel got the sort of answer that the question deserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-16\">II. <em>Esquer-Gamez\u2019s and Guillermo Platt-Lopez\u2019s Appeals, Nos. 76-2734 and 76-2799.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-18\">Both Esquer and Guillermo maintain that they did not know that the packages which Enrique gave them contained narcotics. They argue that the trial court committed reversible error by giving a version of the <em>\u201cJewelT\u2019 </em>instruction which failed to tell the jury that if the defendants believed that what they were carrying was not contraband, they must be acquitted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>In <em>United States v. Jewell, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 532 F.2d 697, <em>(in banc), </em>we affirmed a marijuana possession and importation conviction and held that the term \u201cknowingly,\u201d as used in the criminal statute involved, was not limited to positive knowledge but included the state of mind of one who did not possess actual knowledge only because he consciously avoided it. In <em>Jewell, </em>the trial court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJNO\">The Government can complete their [sic] burden of proof by proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that if the defendant was not actually aware that there was marijuana in the vehicle he was driving when he entered the United States his ignorance in that regard was solely and entirely a result of his having made a conscious purpose to disregard the nature of that which was in the vehicle, with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">532 F.2d at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">The instruction given in this case is basically the same as that given in <em>Jewell.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">In <em>Jewell, </em>we said that the model instruction which should have been given would have included two elements, that \u201c[t]he jury should have been instructed more directly (1) that the required knowledge is established if the accused is aware of a high probability of the existence of the fact in question, (2) unless he actually believes it does not exist.\u201d 532 F.2d at 704, n.21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">In this case the trial court failed, over defense counsels\u2019 objections, to include the second of those two elements in its instructions. That precise issue was not before us in Jewell.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only court which has dealt directly with this problem is the Second Circuit. In <em>United States v. Bright, 2 </em>Cir., 1975, 517 F.2d 584, that court reversed a conviction because the trial court refused to add the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-17\">One distinction must be drawn between the case at bar and <em>Jewell. </em>Here, a timely objection to the instruction was made. In <em>Jewell, </em>there was no objection to the instruction. Thus, the standard of review in <em>Jewell </em>was whether the instruction as given amounted to \u201cplain error.\u201d F.R. Crim.P. 52(b). Applying that standard, we held that the deficiency in the instruction was not so substantial as to justify reversal because the two elements, which a proper <em>Jewell </em>instruction should contain, were implied in the general instruction given. In the case at bar, as in <em>Bright, supra, </em>an objection on the relevant grounds was raised, and therefore the issue is whether the deviance from the suggested <em>Jewell </em>instruction was harmless error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> F.R.Crim.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>52(a). Here, we cannot conclude that the \u201d error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">We have no assurance that the jury succeeded in considering what the instruction did not tell them expressly to consider. As Judge Gurfein observed in Bright:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-5\">The juror\u2019s difficult task of probing the mind and will of another person is hard enough with the aid of a charge that balances the countervailing considerations. His verdict becomes suspect when he has not had the benefit of a balanced instruction from the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-6\">517 F.2d at 587.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">In this case, the jury was not given the required balancing instruction. It was given only the part favoring the government. That instruction focused upon the defendants\u2019 conscious purpose to disregard the truth and failed to add that the required knowledge was <em>not </em>established if Esquer or Guillermo actually believed that he was not holding any illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">This was Esquer and Guillermo\u2019s main defense. They claimed that they thought that the packages were presents for Enrique\u2019s girlfriend. Guillermo testified that he asked his brother what the package contained, but Enrique refused to explain and merely repeated his request that Guillermo hold it for him. While the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the packages make the defendants\u2019 explanations highly suspect, the jury might have believed them and concluded that each of them honestly believed that the package that he handled did not contain drugs. Yet the jury was not given a direct instruction to acquit if that were what it found. Thus, we find that the failure to include the limiting instruction was prejudicial, and we reverse the convictions of Esquer and Guillermo and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">In No. 76-2745, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">In Nos. 76-2734 and 76-2799, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">. Guillermo argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to grant a motion for severance was prejudicial and that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction on the importation charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>Esquer also raised the severance issue and challenges the admissibility of various incriminating statements which he made while being questioned. Because of our disposition of the <em>Jewell </em>issue, we do not reach these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">. The pertinent part of the instruction states: \u201cWith respect to the Government\u2019s burden of proving as to a defendant that his possession of cocaine was knowing or intentional, I instruct that the Government can complete its burden of proof as to that element of the offense by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that if the defendant was not actually aware he had cocaine, his ignorance in that regard was solely and entirely a result of his having made a conscious purpose to disregard the nature of that which he had with a conscious purpose to avoid the truth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">. In <em>United States v. Valle-Valdez, </em>9 Cir., 1977, -F.2d-, we held that it was reversible error in that case to fail to include in the instruction element (1) quoted in the text from footnote 21 in the <em>Jewell </em>case. That question is not before us in this case because the objection to the instruction was not based upon that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1299-19\">. In <em>Jewell, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-20\"><em>\u201cUnited States v. Bright, </em>517 F.2d 584, 586-88 (2d Cir. 1975), reversed a conviction because the trial court refused to add to a \u2018deliberate ignorance\u2019 instruction the qualification \u2018unless he actually believes it did not exist,\u2019 found in Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02(7). This question was not raised below, or in this court, perhaps because the evidence to support it was lacking.\u201d 532 F.2d at 702, n.12.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1299-21\">. The impact of the distinction between the plain error standard and the harmless error rule in cases such as this is demonstrated by the Second Circuit\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>decision after a petition for rehearing in <em>United States v. Dozier, 2 </em>Cir., 1975, 522 F.2d 224, 228, also a case in which the second part of the \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d instruction was not given. That court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-22\">\u201cThe petition for rehearing based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Bright, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>. . is denied. While the trial counsel in <em>Bright </em>made \u2018acute\u2019 objections to the claimed lack of balance and fairness in the portion of the charge on the subject of conscious avoid-anee of knowledge, counsel in the present case made no objection to the jury charge and certainly there was nothing plainly erroneous in the judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1300-13\">CHOY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3vN\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-14\">I concur in the majority opinion as far as it covers Enrique Platt-Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-15\">However, I believe it was entirely unnecessary and harmless error that the district court gave the Jewell-type jury instruction in view of the admissions made by the three appellants when they were first questioned shortly after their arrest at the border. The border agents told each of them his <em>Miranda </em>rights before questioning him. (They are educated and well-placed men in Mexico: Rene is an attorney in public administration; Enrique is an attorney; and Guillermo studied business administration three years at the university of Sonora and is the administrator of a ranch.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-16\">Rene said Enrique gave him a package of the merchandise (cocaine) at Nogales, Sonora; the merchandise came from Culiacan; he (Rene) was going to get something from the deal, but did not know how much.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-17\">Enrique admitted he divided the cocaine in Hermosillo among himself, his brother (Guillermo) and Rene; Enrique and Guillermo walked across the border with the cocaine in their clothing; Rene drove through the port of entry carrying a quantity of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-18\">Guillermo said the cocaine was from Si-naloa (the state in which Culiacan is located); Enrique paid 100,000 pesos for the cocaine \u2014 10,000 for one ounce; he and his brother carried the cocaine across the border in their pants; he loaned Enrique some money to use in buying the cocaine; he was going to get a profit from the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-19\">With this kind of evidence before the jury of knowledge that the merchandise which they carried across was cocaine, the giving of the Jewell-type instruction was needless. In any event, having read the entire trial transcript, I am convinced that the erroneous instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to Rene and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>Guillermo. I would affirm their conviction as well.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
