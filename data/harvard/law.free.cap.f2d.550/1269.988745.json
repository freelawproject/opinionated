A light image of the document is projected onto a moving, charged photoconductive member.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Light areas of the document will reflect light and will discharge portions of the member corresponding to the light areas. Dark areas of the document will not reflect light and will leave a charged area on the member. Toner particles are collected on the charged area and are transferred therefrom to the copy paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-19\">All areas of the member upon which light is not projected remain charged. The charged areas of the member thus include those corresponding to the dark areas of the document and those additional areas created between and around documents successively exposed as the member moves. A \u201ccharge removing means\u201d (discharge lamp) across the moving path of the member is energized and de-energized to dissipate the charge in the additional areas. Energizing of the discharge lamp must be controlled to limit discharge to the additional areas and to avoid discharge of the area corresponding to the dark area of the document. Appellant\u2019s \u201ccontrol means,\u201d i. e., his control circuit, is depicted in the drawings as a block labeled \u201cLOGIC.\u201d Appellant\u2019s specification merely describes the function of the control circuit as that of dissipating the charge in the additional areas. No specific circuit is disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-20\">Claim 9<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>9. An apparatus for forming an electrostatic image on a photoconductive layer in accordance with an original comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-5\">charging means for applying a uniform charge to the layer,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axrq\">exposing means for exposing a charged surface of the layer in accordance with the original to provide an electrostatic image on the charged surface occupying less than all of the surface,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ach\">sheet feeding means for moving the layer past the charging means and the exposing means,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-6\">charge removing means for removing the charge from the charged surface of the layer,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-7\">and control means for controlling the charge removing means to operate the charge removing means to remove the charge on the portion of said surface that is not occupied by the electrostatic image subsequent to the formation of the electrostatic image by the exposing means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">\n<em>Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-9\">The board reversed the examiner\u2019s rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 and, exercising its authority under 37 CFR 1.196(b), entered a new rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph, for insufficient disclosure of the control means, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-10\">The disclosure as it stands, would not enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention without designing a control system to actuate the charge removal apparatus. Appellant\u2019s total disclosure of the control circuit is to be found in a mysterious block labeled, \u201cLOGIC.\u201d We do not know what is in this block or exactly how it receives its inputs from the remainder of the equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-11\">As we view it, an unreasonable amount of experimentation would be required before one of ordinary skill in the art could practice the invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-12\">The board maintained its position on reconsideration. It further reasoned that simple timing circuits, if available, would not be adequate to control the discharge lamp because the additional areas would vary with the size of the document. The board found conclusory an affidavit of Webb, an electrical engineer employed as senior scientist for eleven years by Xerox Corporation. The pertinent assertions in the affidavit are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-14\">That as a result of my reading of application S.N. 145,013, I could without undue experimentation provide control logic to operate discharge lamp LMP-5 in the manner described in application S.N. 145,-013, more particularly, that I, using my knowledge and training as a graduate electrical engineer and the experience of one working in the copier art, and using standard state of the art circuits, components and parts, could, with minimal experimentation, provide for the box-like representation identified as \u201cLOGIC L\u201d in application S.N. 145,013 timing circuits which would produce a signal activating discharge lamp LMP-5 at the beginning of the copying cycle; which would interrupt said signal to turn discharge lamp LMP-5 off when an image formed on the photoreceptor moves past the discharge lamp LMP-5; and which would terminate said signal at the end of the copy cycle in the manner described in application S.N. 145,013.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-15\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-16\">The sole issue is whether appellant\u2019s disclosure of a block labeled \u201cLOGIC\u201d in a drawing and a description of its function as a mere control circuit is adequate under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph, to enable one skilled in the art to construct a circuit effective to control the operation of the discharge lamp as set forth in the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-17\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-18\">Employment of block diagrams and descriptions of their functions is not fatal under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph, providing the represented structure is conventional and can be determined without undue experimentation. <em>In re Ghiron, </em>442 F.2d 985, 58 CCPA 1207, 169 USPQ 723 (1971). It is apparently agreed by the parties that a conventional circuit would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>effective to control the discharge lamp if the additional areas to be discharged were unvarying and that a more sophisticated circuit would be required if the additional areas were of varying sizes and configurations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">Dispute exists over the meaning of the term \u201cimage\u201d in the claims. Appellant argues that \u201cimage\u201d must be understood as referring to the exposed area on the member, that the exposed area corresponds to the platen size and that the \u201cimage\u201d will thus be constant. The board, on the other hand, notes that \u201cimage\u201d may be understood as that of the document, that documents to be copied may vary in size, and that the \u201cimage\u201d will thus vary. If the \u201cimage\u201d be constant, the additional areas to be discharged will also be constant and a simple circuit will serve. If the \u201cimage\u201d be varying, the additional areas to be discharged will vary and a sophisticated circuit will be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">The parties having argued the case around the meaning of the word \u201cimage\u201d in the claim, we look to the specification for guidance. <em>In re Moore, </em>439 F.2d 1232, 58 CCPA 1042, 169 USPQ 236 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">The specification includes the statement, \u201cAs in all electrostatic systems such as a xerographic machine of the type illustrated, a <em>light image of a document </em>to be reproduced is projected onto the sensitized surface of a xerographic plate to form an electrostatic latent image thereon\u201d (emphasis ours). Appellant incorporated by reference in his specification a Hewes et al. application (Hewes)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> disclosing a xerographic reproduction machine in which the image area varies with document size and with the size of the copy paper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on the disclosure and description of the timing chart in Hewes\u2019 Figures 69 and 70 is unavailing. The chart reflects a single timing cycle involving numerous machine components but does not list a discharge lamp. One skilled in the art would not be taught thereby to construct a circuit effective to control the discharge lamp in response to changes in document size.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-11\">Though appellant argues that light would be reflected by the bare portion of the platen regardless of document size, the platen is transparent. No written description of reflection by the platen appears in the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-12\">There is no evidence of record establishing that one skilled in the art would understand that the \u201cimage\u201d was intended to be constant, or that a platen cover would be employed to insure a constant image regardless of document size, thus permitting use of a simple circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-13\">We conclude, therefore, that the specification and drawings fail to disclose that the \u201cimage\u201d would be constant and that a conventional circuit could be employed as the \u201ccontrol means\u201d set forth in the claim. Hence the block diagram and function description were inadequate under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-14\">The Webb affidavit does not overcome the board\u2019s finding of inadequacy of disclosure. We agree with the board that the affidavit is conclusory, citing no specific control circuits effective to achieve the function of the claimed control means, and being premised upon the gratuitous assumption that the image area is defined by the platen area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-15\">Accordingly, the decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1334-12\">.
