Taylor claims such a fee pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1619 (1970), as made applicable by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 881(d) and (f) and 965 (1970). We affirm, but remand for further proceedings since, as we view the law, Taylor may be entitled to an informer\u2019s fee computed on a different basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">Taylor, a merchant seaman aboard a vessel bound for the United States from Amsterdam, discovered thirty-three pounds of hashish in the back of a stereo speaker that he had agreed to list on his customs declaration for Brown, a fellow seaman. Brown had in turn agreed to transport the speaker and certain other articles for a man he had met in Amsterdam. Taylor reported the discovery to the ship\u2019s master, who took custody of the hashish and the speaker, as well as three switchblades, another speaker, and a radio receiver, and reported the find to customs officials. When the ship docked at New Orleans, a customs officer and special agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) boarded the vessel and seized the hashish and equipment. Under the authority of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 886, Taylor and his fellow seaman were paid $150 for their services by DEA, but further demands for payment made to the United States Attorney, the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Customs Office were rejected. Taylor, acting on his own behalf, filed suit seeking further recovery. The district court awarded an informer\u2019s fee for the speakers and other goods transported equal to twenty-five percent of their value as established by a customs official, but allowed no informer\u2019s fee for the hashish on the ground that it could not legally be valued at its street value and plaintiff offered no other evidence of value. Taylor appeals, alleging that there should have been an award of twenty-five percent of the street value of the hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-16\">Resolution of this case ultimately turns on the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1619,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the extent that it is applicable. Our inquiry into the application of that provision to this case must begin with the Controlled Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>stances Act. Hashish, a marihuana derivative, is a schedule I controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(15) (1970); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c) Sched. I(c)(10) (1970); and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.11(d) (1975). A schedule I substance is defined to be a drug or other substance that has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and for which there is a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1). Unless the Attorney General finds the importation of such a substance to be necessary for medical, scientific, or other legitimate needs of the United States at a time when domestic sources or domestic competition are inadequate and the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration issues a permit, such a substance may not be legally imported. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a) (1970); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1312.13 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">All controlled substances are subject to forfeiture if acquired or manufactured in violation of the Act, and forfeiture will extend to other conveyances and equipment used to make or transport the substances. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(2), (3) and (4) (1970). If a schedule I substance is transferred, possessed, or offered for sale in violation of the Act, it is subject to <em>summary </em>seizure and forfeiture. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(f) (1970). Section 881(d) states the law applicable to property seized under \u00a7 881:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-5\">All provisions of law relating to the seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture, and condemnation of property for violation of the customs laws; the disposition of such property or the proceeds from the sale thereof; the remission or mitigation of such forfeitures; and the compromise of claims and the award of compensation to informers in respect of such forfeitures shall apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been incurred, under the provisions of this subchapter, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions hereof; except that such duties as are imposed upon the customs officer or any other person with respect to the seizure and forfeiture of property under the customs laws shall be performed with respect to seizures and forfeitures of property under this sub-chapter by such officers, agents, or other persons as may be authorized or designated for that purpose by the Attorney General, except to the extent that such duties arise from seizures and forfeitures effected by any customs officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">The effect of \u00a7 881(d) was described in <em>United States v. One Motor Yacht Named Mercury, </em>527 F.2d 1112, 1114 (1 Cir. 1975): \u201c[fjorfeiture proceedings arising out of drug offenses are governed by the same statutory provisions as apply to customs forfeitures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">Section 881(e) of Title 21 deals with property forfeited pursuant to the Act and provides that the Attorney General may retain the property for official use, may sell the property if it is not <em>required to be destroyed by law and is not harmful to the public, </em>may require General Services Administration to take custody of the property, or may forward it to DEA (previously the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs) for disposition, including delivery for medical or scientific use. Since by definition a schedule I substance is harmful, it cannot be sold nor could it be retained for use, but presumably it will be forwarded to GSA or DEA for destruction or will be turned over to agencies for research. <em>See </em>Newsweek, Nov. 8, 1976, at p. 53 (approval of application by University for research in medical use of marihuana for treatment of glaucoma; drugs to be supplied by National Institute on Drug Abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">Plaintiff asserted his cause of action was pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1619 (1970) and the trial judge, over objections by the government which claimed \u00a7 1619 did not apply, decided the case on that basis. Somewhat inarticulately, the government continues to assert that position before us. We agree with the government that \u00a7 1619 as such does not apply to the instant case. Instead, the case must be decided under Title 21, although, as we shall show, important pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>visions of \u00a7 1619 are incorporated into Title 21 and made applicable to proceedings under Title 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">Sections 881(d) and 965 of Title 21 make customs procedures applicable to the Controlled Substances Act and the Import and Export Controlled Substances Act by incorporating portions of Title 19, such as \u00a7\u00a7 1602 through 1621, into Title 21 <em>insofar as applicable and to the extent not inconsistent.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The text of the Title 21 analogue then delimits one clear amendment to the Title 19 text by stating that DEA officers shall perform the duties for seizures and forfeitures under Title 21 except when customs officers make the seizure. Yet, even in those instances where customs officers still make the seizure, they act, not under Title 19 but under Title 21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statutory scheme clearly suggests then that seizures and forfeiture proceedings involving drugs are governed by Title 21 even though the basic authority to proceed is supplied by Title 19 and the seizure is carried out by customs officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Since Title 21 provides a remedy and a procedure dealing with this case, we think that the informer\u2019s fee provision of that Title must be used to determine whether a fee should be paid in this case for the drugs seized. In concluding so, we do not intimate that all seizure cases involving drugs must be determined under Title 21, but we think the wiser course will usually be to do so. By doing so, dangers of duplicitous claims under Title 19 and Title 21 will be avoided, and the courts will have the advantage of the expertise of the agency most concerned with controlled substances (DEA), and most able to present information concerning the appropriate value to be placed on such substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, 38 Fed.Reg. 15,932, 87 Stat. 1091 (1973), <em>as amended, </em>Pub.L. 93-253, \u00a7 1, 88 Stat. 50 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>5 U.S.C. app., at 79 (1970), DEA was created with the express purpose of creating a central organization within the Department of Justice to deal with law enforcement in illicit drug activities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Department of the Treasury retained its function of seizing illicit narcotics at the border provided \u201cthat any illicit narcotics, dangerous drugs, marihuana, or related evidence seized ... by the Secretary . . . shall be turned over forthwith to the jurisdiction of the Attorney General.\u201d Thus, Treasury retained its powers of inspection of goods at the border, but those powers were to be exercised to insure the proper operation of DEA, the organization that after the reorganization is to dispose of the drugs. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(f) (1970). In combination with the text of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(d), these two concerns indicate that as a general matter Title 21 should control judicial action involving drug seizures at the border.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">While the two concerns expressed heretofore apply to any seizure or forfeiture involving drugs, the facts and circumstances of this case, involving as it does a claim for an informer\u2019s fee arising out of a seizure for drugs, even more clearly indicate that Title 21 and not Title 19 must control. This case does not involve a violation of the customs laws such as failure to manifest drugs, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1584 (1970), or to pay a valid duty, but instead involves seizure by customs officers [and DEA offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>cers] pursuant to a statutory mandate requiring seizure of merchandise \u201cunlawfully introduced\u201d into the United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 (1970); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.36 (1975); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.61 (1975). The drugs were seized, then, by officers acting to enforce the drug law\u2019s prohibition against importation, and not to enforce an independent rule of the customs law. Moreover, DEA officers accompanied the customs officer to the seizure and the report of seizure indicated it had occurred pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952. Under these facts, even if the district court could find that the seizure was pursuant to both laws,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> where the government has denied the seizure was pursuant to the customs law, the forfeiture must be construed as occurring under the drug laws and there can be no recovery of fees under the customs law. <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>135 F.2d 1005,1010 (3 Cir. 1943).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Finally, the provisions of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1619, by its terms, do not directly apply to informer\u2019s fees for drugs, since (a) the drug may not be sold for use since it is a schedule I substance, (b) it will not be destroyed \u201cunder the customs laws or navigation laws\u201d but under the drug laws,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (c) it will be transferred to a governmental agency pursuant to \u00a7 881(f) of Title 21 and not the customs law. In sum, then, we conclude that the customs law\u2019s informer fee provision does not apply to this case while the drug law\u2019s provision does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-14\">Since we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is one governed by Title 21, the regulations promulgated by DEA are directly applicable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After most controlled substances are seized pursuant to Title 21, they must be appraised as required by the Title 21 analogue of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606. Section 1606 requires that \u201cdomestic value\u201d is to be used to determine the appraised value. This value is then used to compute the informer\u2019s fee pursuant to Title 21\u2019s analogue to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1619. In doing so, DEA regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-15\">The custodian shall appraise the <em>property </em>to determine the domestic value at the time and place of seizure. The domestic value shall be considered the <em>retail price </em>at which such or similar <em>property </em>is <em>freely offered </em>for sale. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1316.74 (1975). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-16\"><em>Property </em>is defined by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1316.-71(c) (1975) to include \u201ca controlled substance.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(d) and 965, the informer should therefore receive twenty-five percent of the domestic retail price at which the controlled substance is freely offered for sale.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We think the terms <em>retail </em>and <em>freely offered </em>clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>preclude the use of street value. Such terms indicate a sale to the consumer which is not prohibited by law. We agree with the district court that a controlled substance sold illegally is not one which is <em>freely offered.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is doubtful that Congress in passing the legislation desired to peg an informer\u2019s compensation at an illegally obtained price, thereby providing a procedure awarding either directly or indirectly illegal schemes sought to be extinguished. Moreover, the history of the original \u00a7 1619 indicates that the informer\u2019s fee was designed to turn over part of the government\u2019s recovery to the informer, not provide payment generated by other sources.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Many of the controlled substances seized will have medical uses,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> indicating that there will be a domestic value for them as set by pharmaceutical firm purchases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In such cases, the drug informer\u2019s fee is akin to fees paid during prohibition for whiskey.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Ordinarily, then, the case would be remanded to determine the retail domestic value for legal sales. But hashish is a schedule I substance which is subject to summary seizure and which has no medically determined use. It would seem to follow that there can be no <em>freely offered </em>sales. However, such drugs may still have scientific or research uses. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1312.01 to 13.12.47 (1975). <em>See generally United States v. Randall, </em>20 Crim.L.Rep. (BNA) 2301 (D.C.Super.Ct. Nov. 24, 1976) (use of marihuana to prevent blindness). Schedule I substances may be imported for medical or scientific reasons under certain circumstances. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a)(2) (1970); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.22(a)(9) (1975). As well, persons who properly register may conduct research and instructional activities with schedule I controlled substances. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1301.22(a)(7), (b)(3), (b)(4), (c) (1975); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1301.32(a)(7) &amp; (8) (1975); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.33 (1975). And applications may be taken for bulk manufacture of schedule I substances. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>(1975).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Given these limited legal activities, it is conceivable there exists a retail market price for drugs used in such programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">The district court found that plaintiff offered no evidence of value other than street value. This is true, but we recognize that when this case was tried there was a dearth of authority recognizing that there could be a legal, albeit limited, free market. We think that, since we have now expressed our views in this regard, plaintiff should be afforded the opportunity to present evidence on this point, if he be advised to do so. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in all respects except that we remand the case with the direction that, upon plaintiff\u2019s motion to reopen the proceedings made not later than thirty days after the district court\u2019s receipt of our mandate, the district court shall reopen the proceedings, take evidence as to the existence of a legal retail market price for the computation of an informer\u2019s fee and enter an amended judgment in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">.

While 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1619 states the fee \u201cmay\u201d be paid, the Title 21 analogue, as does \u00a7 1619, requires payment if the prerequisites are satisfied. <em>Wilson v.

Initially, the statute only allowed a fee when there was a \u201cnet amount\u201d recovered. <em>See Wilson v. United States, </em>135 F.2d 1005, 1011 (3 Cir. 1943). Since the seized merchandise might be utilized by the government or destroyed instead of being sold, changes were made in the statute to deal with these contingencies, and the fee became in effect equivalent to what a sale could have brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">This view is further supported by the prior drug import statute. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 183 (1964). It provided that informers would receive one-half of any fine recovered from a person violating the statute and one-half of any bail forfeited in any proceedings thereunder. <em>United States v.

News, pp. 4567, 4639, to other \u201cdangerous drugs,\u201d and therefore similar methods of payment of fees seem warranted. Since discretionary payments not pegged to revenues may already be made as in the old law, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 886 (1970); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 199 (1964), it is preferable to gear these further awards to the recovery or worth in a United States market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1053-11\">. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a)(1) (1970) (opium and cocoa leaves); <em>cf.
