Judge Hays heard argument on November 9, 1976, but has not had an opportunity to participate further in the case because of illness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1385-10\">ROBERT P. ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1385-11\">This is a proceeding to answer the following question, certified to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-15\">\u201cWhether [New York\u2019s Business Corporation Law] BCL \u00a7 1312 may be invoked to preclude a non-qualifying foreign corporation from maintaining an action predicated upon diversity jurisdiction to compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, <em>et seq.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AePQ\">The district court felt that there was substantial ground for difference of opinion on this issue, citing <em>In Re Master Key Antitrust Litigation, </em>528 F.2d 5 (2d Cir. 1975), although it did have some reservations as to whether its order involved \u201ca controlling question of law\u201d as prescribed by the statute. It was of the opinion, however, that if BCL \u00a7 1312(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> could be invoked by Asiatic Petroleum Corp. (Asiatic), a New York corporation, against Grand Bahama Petroleum Co. (Grand Bahama), a Bahamian corporation, \u201cthe action would terminate at once without the necessity for trial by jury of the present issues before the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4,\u201d and that therefore the matter qualified under the requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) that resolution of the legal issue \u201cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. . \u201d This court granted leave to appeal on April 29, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-17\">The certified question arises out of a petition to compel arbitration under the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et <em>seq., </em>initiated by Grand Bahama against Asiatic. In compliance with 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4, the declared jurisdictional basis of the petition were diversity of citizenship and more than $10,000 in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-18\">The Petition alleged that Grand Bahama and Asiatic had signed an agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in April, 1972, whereby Asiatic agreed to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>and deliver to Grand Bahama 32,000 barrels per day ,bf No. 6 fuel oil, while Grand Bahama agreed to pay for the oil. Deliveries would take place between April 1, 1972 and March 31, 1978, in .accordance with various terms and provisions of the agreement and subject to a clause referring all controversies and claims arising therefrom to arbitration in New York City. The rules of The American Arbitration Association were to govern. It was also agreed that judgment upon any award could be entered in any court having appropriate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">Paragraph 2(d)(iv) of the 1972 agreement provided that price renegotiations for fuel oils to be delivered during each calendar year after 1974 were to take place during the fourth calendar quarter of the preceding year. If the parties could not agree on a price, either party was given the right to terminate the agreement by giving 60 days notice. Pursuant to this Paragraph, Asiatic notified Grand Bahama on September 13, 1974 that it wished to renegotiate a price for 1975 oil deliveries. Negotiations did not go well, and Asiatic wrote to Grand Bahama on December 4, 1974 that if agreement was not reached by December 31, 1974, the contract would be terminated as of March 2, 1975. Grand Bahama replied that it did not consider Asiatic's new price proposals as \u201cgood faith efforts to renegotiate the fuel oil price\u201d and shortly thereafter, on December 18, 1974, Grand Bahama served and filed a demand for arbitration with the, American Arbitration Association pursuant to the 1972 agreement provisions. On January 10, 1975, pursuant to the 1972 agreement, Asiatic gave written notice of termination (effective March 2,1975) because the parties had been unable to agree on 1975 fuel oil prices. Grand Bahama unsuccessfully sought to enjoin Asiatic in Supreme Court, New York County, from terminating the contract. It next sought to prevent the agreement\u2019s termination through an expedited preliminary hearing before the arbitrators pursuant to the earlier demand for arbitration. The hearing took place on February 28, 1975, two days before the expiration date under Asiatic\u2019s notice. As a result of the hearing, an interim agreement was entered into on February 28, 1975 by stipulation of the parties, through which Asiatic would continue delivering No. 6 fuel oil to Grand Bahama and its parent company, New England Petroleum Corp., a New-York corporation, pending the final award of the arbitrators. This stipulation was in turn amended on April 28,1975 by a supplemental written agreement which provided that disputes arising therefrom \u201cmay be submitted to the Panel of Arbitrators in this proceeding. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-6\">Asiatic did in fact continue to deliver oil to Grand Bahama and New England Petroleum Corp. during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings. Grand Bahama, however, served and filed another demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association on May 29, 1975, claiming that it had been overcharged many millions of dollars by Asiatic. Grand Bahama has alleged in the present petition to compel arbitration that as of February, 1976, Asiatic had not filed any counterclaims in this latest arbitration and had \u201csimply stricken whatever lists of arbitrators have been supplied by the AAA [American Arbitration Association].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">On October 22,1975, the arbitrators made their award on the original claims of Grand Bahama, found that Asiatic\u2019s purported termination of the 1972 agreement was not effective, and directed Asiatic specifically to perform the agreement. A judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County, was entered on the award on January 8,1976, as the parties had stipulated in the 1972 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-8\">Meantime, however, the controversy over alleged overcharges by Asiatic continued to be a matter of major concern. Grand Bahama took delivery of three shipments of oil on September 13, 14 and 15,1975, for which Asiatic claims it was never paid. As a result Asiatic instituted a diversity action against Grand Bahama in the Southern District of Texas to recover the value of the three shipments. Grand Bahama then filed the present petition, based upon diversity jurisdiction, to compel arbitration under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, <em>et seq., </em>in the Southern District of New York. In addition to arbitration, Grand Bahama sought temporary and permanent injunctions against Asiatic\u2019s maintenance of its action in the Southern District of Texas. It also alleged that Asiatic was in violation of the arbitrators\u2019 award of October 22, 1976 and the judgment entered thereon on January 8, 1976. It further claims that Asiatic could not sue in Texas on the theory that the September, 1975, oil deliveries in question \u201cwere made pursuant to the arrangement worked out in the arbitration,\u201d presumably the April 28, 1975 written agreement between Asiatic and Grand Bahama, which continued oil shipments during the .pendency of the arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">Soon after the February 25,1976 filing of Grand Bahama\u2019s petition to compel arbitration, the district court in the Southern District of New York issued a show cause order to proceed to arbitration. On March 1, 1976 Asiatic filed a notice of taking the deposition of Grand Bahama through various officers and directors thereof. Next, Grand Bahama successfully moved for an order quashing Asiatic\u2019s notice to take depositions. In its memorandum opinion of March 11,1976, the district court noted that the depositions sought by Asiatic were for the limited purpose of determining whether Grand Bahama was \u201c \u2018doing business\u2019 within the State of New York within the meaning of \u00a7 1312(a) of the New York Business Corporation Law (\u2018BCL\u2019) which would preclude petitioner [Grand Bahama] from bringing suit in* this court.\u201d Asiatic reasoned that given the district court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction, and assuming Asiatic could show that Grand Bahama was \u201cdoing business\u201d in New York within the meaning of BCL \u00a7 1312(a), the district court would be compelled to stay the action pending Grand Bahama\u2019s payment of the requisite New York fees and franchise taxes. The court instead agreed with Grand Bahama that because the petition had been brought under the United States Arbitration Act and \u201cthere is a body of federal substantive law which governs the case, <em>Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., 271 F.2d 402 </em>(2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 801, 81 S.Ct. 27, 5 L.Ed.2d 37 (1960); <em>Lawn v. Franklin, </em>328 F.Supp. 791 (S.D.N.Y.1971),\u201d BCL \u00a7 1312(a) was not applicable even though the petition\u2019s underlying jurisdiction rested on diversity. The court also held that \u201c[i]t is unnecessary to look to State law for any purpose once jurisdiction has been obtained; and \u00a7 1312 is not a jurisdictional requirement. <em>Hot Roll Mfg. Co. v. Cerone Equipment Co., </em>38 A.D.2d 339, 329 N.Y.S.2d 466 (3d Dept. 1972).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">Following the denial of Asiatic\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court considered Asiatic\u2019s motion to reconsider the March 11th order quashing notice of depositions or, in the alternative, for a certificate pursuant to 28 U.S. \u00a7 1292(b) for leave to appeal the order. The court reaffirmed its March 11th order, but granted the \u00a7 1292(b) certificate for the reasons set out at the beginning of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\">At the outset, this court is confronted with a <em>res judicata </em>issue, which was neither fully briefed nor orally argued by either side. As pointed out at the beginning of this opinion, the arbitrators\u2019 October 22, 1976 award to Grand Bahama was entered as a judgment in the Supreme Court, New York County, on January 8,' 1976. During this prior proceeding, Asiatic could have raised the very same issue of Grand Bahama\u2019s purported non-compliance with BCL \u00a7 1312(a) that it now presses before this court and the Southern District of New York. Well-established principles of <em>res judicata </em>dictate that a final judgment on the same claim or demand between the same parties is conclusive both as to matters actually litigated and those that could have been litigated, <em>Cromwell v. County of Sac, </em>94 U.S. 351, 24 L.Ed. 681 (1876); <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948); <em>Saylor v. Lindsley, </em>391 F.2d 965, 968 (2d Cir. 1968); 1 B <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>K 0.405[1] (1965 ed). It is equally clear that the doctrines of <em>res judicata and </em>collateral estoppel apply in New York arbitration proceedings, 8 Weinstein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>Korn &amp; Miller, <em>New York Civil Practice </em>17514.03 at 75-192 (1976 ed.). Grand Bahama alleged in its Petition to Compel Arbitration that the three cargoes of oil which comprise the present dispute are controlled by the arbitrators\u2019 award and New York judgment. The argument could be further extended to include the assertion that Asiatic is now barred from re-litigating the issue of the arbitration clause\u2019s enforceability and related matters. This court recognizes, however, that \u201c[\u00a1Judgment on an award does not bar an action or further arbitration under the contract on an issue not before the arbitrators,\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 75-192; <em>Matter of Nors Holding Corp., </em>261 App.Div. 997, 26 N.Y.S.2d 686 (2d Dep\u2019t 1941). In view of this court\u2019s ruling on the certified question, <em>infra, </em>however, the applicability of <em>res judicata </em>to this proceeding need not be further considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">On full consideration of the certified question, this court holds that BCL \u00a7 1312(a) may not be raised in an action to compel arbitration brought pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act with diversity as the jurisdictional basis. It is first of all highly significant that this action is brought under the Arbitration Act for, as this court found in <em>Robert Lawrence Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., supra, </em>271 F.2d at 404-5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-5\">\u201cWe find a reasonably clear legislative intent [in the enactment of the Arbitration ActJ to create a new body of substantive law relative to arbitration agreements affecting commerce or maritime transactions. Thus we think we are here dealing not with state-created rights but with rights arising out of the exercise of the Congress of its constitutional power to regulate commerce and hence there is invoked no difficult question of constitutional law under <em>Erie.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">The Supreme Court approved this court\u2019s <em>Robert Lawrence </em>holding in <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 399-400, 87 S.Ct. 1801,18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967), where it went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-7\">\u201cAnd it is clear beyond dispute that the federal arbitration statute is based upon and confined to the incontestable federal foundations of \u2018control over interstate commerce and over admiralty.\u2019 H.R.Rep. No.96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1924); S.Rep.No.536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924).\u201d 388 U.S. at 405, 87 S.Ct. at 1806.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-9\">Thus, while it is settled that the United States Arbitration Act will control the substantive questions as to the validity and interpretation of arbitration agreements, <em>Robert Lawrence, supra, </em>at 406, the issue here becomes whether a state \u201cdoor closing\u201d statute such as New York\u2019s BCL \u00a7 1312(a) does and can affect the district court\u2019s jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship. <em>Hot Roll Mfg. Co. v. Cerone Equipment Co., supra, </em>faced and decided the issue of BCL \u00a7 1312(a)\u2019s jurisdictional effect. New York\u2019s Third Department there held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-10\">\u201cFailure of a foreign corporation doing business in New York to comply with the requirement of subdivision (a) of section 1312 of the Business Corporation Law affects that corporation\u2019s legal capacity to maintain the action; it does not affect jurisdiction . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-11\">The <em>Hot Roll, supra, </em>holding logically followed prior decisions of the New York courts that the word \u201cmaintain\u201d in BCL \u00a7 1312(a) does not mean \u201ccommence,\u201d so that a New York court would not be forced to dismiss an action, once begun, for failure of a party to comply with \u00a7 1312(a) but the party may pay the fees and taxes and then go forward with his action. <em>Hooton Chocolate Co. v. Star Chocolate Novelties Inc., </em>63 Misc.2d 482, 311 N.Y.S.2d 698 (Sup.Ct.1970); <em>Oxford Paper Co. </em>v. <em>S. M. Liquidation Co., </em>45 Misc.2d 612, 257 N.Y.S.2d 395, 399 (Sup.Ct.1965). Consequently the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is unaffected by BCL \u00a7 1312(a); and Grand Bahama may proceed with this action in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-12\">Even if BCL \u00a7 1312(a) may be described as affecting the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, New York may not place such a financial and procedural burden on a foreign corporation seeking to vindicate its right to bring a diversity action before the federal courts. In <em>Markham v. City of Newport News, </em>292 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>F.2d 711 (4th Cir. 1961), a diversity case involving the purported application of a Virginia statute limiting tort actions against a city or other political subdivision to a court of the Commonwealth, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-5\">\u201cIn determining its own jurisdiction, a District Court of the United States must look to the sources of its power and not to the acts of states which have no power to enlarge or to contract the federal jurisdiction.\u201d 292 F.2d at 713.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">This basic principle of Federalism is not affected by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), and the doctrine announced therein. The <em>Markham, supra, </em>court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-7\">\u201cThe Erie doctrine does not extend to matters of jurisdiction or, generally, to matters of procedure. ... A nonresident litigant on resorting to the federal diversity jurisdiction should obtain the same relief a resident litigant asserting the same cause of action would receive in the state courts.\u201d 292 F.2d at 718.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">In the present case, of course, a New York resident litigant would not be subject to BCL \u00a7 1312(a) in the courts of New York. If a nonresident litigant is to receive the same relief as a resident of New York in a federal diversity suit, then, the offending local statute must give way. To rule otherwise would enable any state to place impermissible financial conditions on free access to the federal courts by those litigants who have met the federal jurisdictional requirements, <em>Terral v. Burke Construction Co., </em>257 U.S. 529, 532-33, 42 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed. 352 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-9\">In a decision following <em>Markham, supra, Szantay v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>349 F.2d 60 (4th Cir. 1965), the Fourth Circuit reviewed major Supreme Court opinions interpreting <em>Erie, </em>including <em>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, </em>326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945) (wherein the Court announced the \u201coutcome determinative\u201d test: \u201cThe outcome of the litigation in federal courts should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court.\u201d 326 U.S. at 109, 65 S.Ct. at 1470); <em>Angel v. Bullington, </em>330 U.S. 183, 67 S.Ct. 657, 91 L.Ed. 832 (1947), and <em>Byrd v. Blue Ridge Cooperative, </em>356 U.S. 525, 78 S.Ct. 893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958), in determining not to apply South Carolina\u2019s \u201cdoor closing\u201d statute to wrongful death diversity actions. In the <em>Szantay </em>case, the Fourth Circuit, in resolving federal-state conflicts in a diversity case, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-11\">\u201c1. If the state provision, whether legislatively adopted or judicially declared, is the substantive right or obligation at issue, it is constitutionally controlling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-12\">2. If the state provision is a procedure intimately bound up with the state right or obligation, it is likewise constitutionally controlling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-13\">3. If the state procedural provision is not intimately bound up with the right being enforced but its application would substantially affect the outcome of the litigation, the federal diversity court must still apply it unless there are affirmative countervailing federal considerations. This is not deemed a constitutional requirement but one dictated by comity.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 349 F.2d at 63-64.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">See also, <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Blue Ridge Cooperative, supra, </em>at 537-38; Meador, <em>State Law and the Federal Judicial Power, </em>49 Va.L.Rev. 1082, 1100, <em>et seq. </em>(1963). Applying the thorough test of <em>Szantay, supra, </em>to the situation here, it is readily evident that BCL \u00a7 1312(a) has no relationship to the substantive right, the enforceability of the arbitration clause, nor can it be considered a procedure intimately bound up with any \u201cstate right or obligation,\u201d because the \u201cright\u201d is a federal one, <em>Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire Fabrics, supra, </em>271 F.2d at 404-5. As for the third prong of the <em>Szantay, supra, </em>test, there is a definite federal interest in seeing to it that federal control over arbitration contracts involving interstate or foreign commerce not be frustrated or burdened by state statutes such as BCL \u00a7 1312(a), <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number><em>Conklin Mfg. Co., supra, </em>388 U.S. at 405, 87 S.Ct. 1801.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">Despite these persuasive precedents, however, and based primarily on <em>Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., </em>337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949), Asiatic argues that \u201cdoor closing\u201d statutes must be given full effect by a federal court in cases brought under diversity jurisdiction. <em>Woods, supra, </em>concerned the application of Mississippi\u2019s \u201cdoor closing\u201d statute, similar to New York\u2019s BCL \u00a7 1312(a), in a diversity action involving a broker\u2019s commission from the sale of real estate in Mississippi. Citing <em>Angel v. Bullington, supra, </em>and <em>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra, </em>the Court applied the Mississippi \u201cdoor closing\u201d statute. Dissenting, Justice Jackson noted that the Mississippi statute, by its own terms, closed only state, and not federal, courts to unqualified corporate litigants and did not deprive the contract in question of its validity. By thus reading the state statute to prevent a litigant from resorting to either a federal or state forum, an unwarranted expansion of the statute\u2019s terms and restrictions, the majority was \u201cdoing the very thing we profess to avoid; that is, giving the state law a different meaning in federal court than the state courts have given it.\u201d 337 U.S. at 539, 69 S.Ct. at 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\"><em>Woods, supra, </em>is readily distinguishable from the instant proceeding on its facts. First, the brokerage contract in <em>Woods </em>was undoubtedly governed by local law. The Supreme Court had earlier written in <em>Erie, supra, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-6\">\u201cExcept in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state.\u201d 304 U.S. at 78, 58 S.Ct. at 822.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">Unlike <em>Woods, </em>this case is \u201cgoverned\u201d by an Act of Congress, the Arbitration Act. That BCL \u00a7 1312(a) may now be applied to Grand Bahama so as to frustrate the petitioner\u2019s access to a federal forum to litigate an admittedly federal matter and thereby limit the uniform and effective application of a federal statute, <em>Robert Lawrence Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Fabrics Inc., supra, </em>271 F.2d at 406 \u2014 7; <em>In re A/S J. Ludwig, Mowinckles Rederi v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>25 N.Y.2d 576, 307 N.Y.S.2d 660, 662, 255 N.E.2d 774 (1970), is a result not contemplated by <em>Erie. </em>As the Court wrote in <em>Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., </em>317 U.S. 173, 63 S.Ct. 172, 87 L.Ed. 165 (1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-10\">\u201cBut the doctrine of . <em>[Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra </em>] is inapplicable to those areas of judicial decision within which the policy of the law is so dominated by the sweep of federal statutes that legal relations which they affect must be deemed governed by federal law having its source in those statutes, rather than by local law.\u201d 317 U.S. at 176, 63 S.Ct. at 174.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-12\"><em>See also, </em>1A (Part 2) <em>Moore's Federal Practice, </em>H 0.324 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-13\">Further light on the correct meaning and application of <em>Woods, supra, </em>is provided by <em>Allenberg Cotton Co. v. Pittman, </em>419 U.S. 20, 95 S.Ct. 260, 42 L.Ed.2d 195 (1974). In that case the Court again considered the application of the Mississippi \u201cdoor closing\u201d statute to a Tennessee corporation suing in a Mississippi state court on a cotton contract. The Mississippi Supreme Court previously had found the contract was wholly intrastate in nature, 419 U.S. at 24, 95 S.Ct. 260. Nonetheless, the Court concluded that the contract was part of a \u201c \u2018unitary interstate transaction,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 33, 95 S.Ct. 260, and went on to hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-14\">\u201cMississippi\u2019s refusal to honor and enforce contracts made for interstate or foreign commerce is repugnant to the commerce clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 95 S.Ct. at 267.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-15\"><em>Allenberg </em>stands for the proposition that a state \u201cdoor closing\u201d statute may not impede a diversity action concerning interstate or foreign commerce, which the present case unquestionably does, brought in a federal court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>Asiatic\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Allenberg </em>is not persuasive. Appellant claims that <em>Allenberg </em>in fact supports its view that BCL \u00a7 1312(a) must here be applied, because the Court\u2019s result in that case was reached solely after a factual finding that the foreign corporation did not have sufficient intrastate contacts in Mississippi to justify a requirement that it qualify to do business there. 419 U.S. at 33, 95 S.Ct. 260. This reading of <em>Allenberg </em>is both overly restrictive of the Court\u2019s holding and ignores the facts that the case before <em>this </em>court invokes both a federal forum, at the trial level, unlike the situation in <em>Allenberg, </em>and, more importantly, the undisputed application of the Arbitration Act, a federal statute, because the contract in question involves foreign commerce. It is further of significance that Asiatic has made no <em>prima facie </em>showing, through affidavits or other means, to support its claim that Grand Bahama <em>is </em>doing business in New York, other than by negotiating and signing in the State, the contract at issue. Asiatic\u2019s request for discovery on the matter is, therefore, nothing more than a \u201cfishing expedition,\u201d which would needlessly delay the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">Accordingly, the certified question is answered in the negative and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1385-13\">. BCL \u00a7 1312(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-14\">\u201cA foreign corporation <em>doing business </em>in this state without authority <em>shall not maintain any action or special proceeding in this state unless and until </em>such corporation has been authorized to do business in this state and it has paid to the state all fees, penalties and franchise taxes for the years or parts thereof during which it did business in this state without authority.
