Each appellant was sentenced to 99 years imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">At 11:35 A.M. on October 31, 1974, three black men armed with handguns entered the Bank of St. Charles in Boutte, Louisiana. After forcing the bank employees and a customer into the vault, the men robbed the bank of $21,982.75, and left the scene in a 1973 Mercury Comet (white with a brown top), which had been parked in front of the bank. Judy Gibbs, a witness who was parked in front of the bank, saw three black men leave the bank, get into the Mercury Comet, back out \u201creal fast\u201d and head west on Highway 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">At about noon Joyce Bernard, who had been driving west on Highway 90, turned onto Bayou Gauche Road where she saw two cars in the righthand lane (her lane) of traffic \u2014 a late model two-toned compact car and a larger late model white car. Two black men stood between the cars conversing. One of them entered the larger car, drove past the compact, made a U-turn, and stopped next to the compact. The other man, who was wearing a red bandana around his throat, a \u201cmultiple-colored flannelette shirt\u201d, and a \u201clittle hat\u201d, squatted down behind the trunk of the compact as if he was \u201cunlocking the trunk or fixing a flat\u201d. Both men then drove off in the larger ear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">Susan Lewis was also driving on Bayou Gauche Road at about noon. As she stopped behind a two-toned compact car parked in the right lane in order to let a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>truck pass from the opposite direction, she noticed blood dripping from the trunk of the car. Upon the arrival of police, the car\u2019s trunk was pried open, revealing the body of Irwin Brown, who had died of a gunshot wound in the head. The car was identified as a 1973 Mercury Comet belonging to Brown. Recovered from the roadside near the car were an orange hardhat, a red bandana, a glove, a blue workshirt, and a button identified as coming from the shirt. An examination of the car revealed a latent palm print on the right-front door handle, a spent .45 caliber shell casing, and the .45 caliber bullet which killed Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The evidence disclosed that Irwin Brown, a customs broker and international freight forwarder in New Orleans, had a parking contract with the Holiday Inn on Royal Street and always parked his car, a white 1973 Mercury Comet with a brown top, there. On the morning of October 31,1974, Brown followed his daily routine of dropping his son off at school and proceeding to work, but Brown never appeared for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Emile Carmouche, an employee of the Holiday Inn, testified that between 7:30 and 8:00 A.M. on October 31 he noticed two men, one wearing a red bandana on his head, enter the Holiday Inn from Exchange Alley and walk up the stairwell leading to the parking lot. Carmouche identified one of the men as appellant Washington, although he could not be \u201csure beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Employees of the bank identified one of the robbers as wearing a \u201cbluish-gray shirt\u201d and another as wearing a \u201cred scarf\u201d, an orange hardhat, and a flannelette shirt, black with red stripes. The articles of clothing found near the car on Bayou Gauche Road were identified by the employees as similar to those worn by the robbers. Two of the employees, Myra Fields and Mona Scott, testified that they had been shown photo spreads by the F.B.I. following the robbery and had identified the picture of Johnson as being similar to one of the men involved. Mrs. Fields testified that, although she was not positive, Johnson \u201ccould be the person that had come to my window\u201d. Mrs. Scott identified Johnson in court as one of the robbers and testified that she was \u201cabout ninety per cent sure\u201d of her identification. A third employee, Gilda Rachael, identified Johnson as \u201calmost definitely\u201d being one of the robbers, and testified that she had previously identified Johnson at a police lineup on May 20, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Althea Tolliver, a friend of Johnson and Washington, was called as a witness by the Government. Tolliver, on October 31, 1974, was awaiting trial on charges of armed robbery. She agreed with a Government detective to assist in this case in return for his assistance in the disposition of the charges against her. Tolliver testified that upon her release on bail, she met Johnson, who told her that he \u201cknew just what went down\u201d at the bank robbery. Johnson said that one of the women at the bank had on a blue dress and that he knew one of the black women who worked there but wasn\u2019t worried. He told Tolliver that her \u201cpistol sure came in handy that day\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Tol-liver asked him for some money, Johnson replied: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any right now. If you would have come to me a couple of weeks ago, I had a fist full of fifties <em>ti</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">Tolliver testified that she later met Washington. Upon being asked about the robbery, he said: \u201cWell, I did it [but] I didn\u2019t get my share of the money\u201d. When asked about the guns used in the robbery, Washington replied: \u201cI got a prettier .38 than your .45\u201d. Tolliver further testified that the hardhat was similar to one owned by Washington and that the workshirt was similar to one owned by Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">A .45 caliber colt automatic pistol was received in evidence as Exhibit 17. Testimony revealed that the gun had been purchased from Gretna Gun Works, Inc. by Charles Strickland, who sold it to George <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Evans, who in turn sold it to J. Bruton. As noted <em>supra, </em>Tolliver testified that she stole the gun from Bruton and gave it to Washington. She identified Exhibit 17 as similar to the gun she stole from Bruton. A firearms expert testified that the shell casing found in the trunk of the Mercury Comet had been fired from that pistol \u201cto the exclusion of all other weapons in existence\u201d. He also testified that the slug recovered from the trunk could have been fired from the gun.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">A fingerprint expert testified that a latent palm print found on the right front door handle of Brown\u2019s Comet was definitely the palm print of Stanley Johnson. Records of South Central Bell Telephone Company showed that at 2:35 P.M. on October 31,1974, Johnson made a person-to-person phone call from a phone booth in Lul-ing, Louisiana, to his home in Marrero, Louisiana. The phone booth was three miles from Boutte on River Road, which connects Boutte with New Orleans.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Washington did not take the stand or call any witnesses. Johnson called several witnesses who testified that after 3:00 P.M. on the afternoon of October 31, 1974, Johnson had attended a football game - and had helped a friend clean graves. Johnson himself testified about his activities on the afternoon of October 31, but could not recall what he had done that morning. He denied participating in the robbery of the Bank of St. Charles, denied making any statements to Althea Tolliver, and denied owning a .45 automatic. Johnson further testified that he didn\u2019t know how his palm print got on Brown\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>Comments by Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Both appellants argue that the court erred in remarks concerning the acceptability of a proffered Government expert in lifting latent fingerprints. In accepting the expert over defense counsel\u2019s objection that the witness was unfamiliar with leading texts and articles on the lifting of latent prints and was not an expert in the field of fingerprint analysis, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQr\">\u201cHe\u2019s totally acceptable to the Court as an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">\u201cI say that he has had more experience than any F.B.I. agent that\u2019s worth his salt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">\u201cHe\u2019s had more experience than any police officer who\u2019s worth his salt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">\u201cHe\u2019s had more experience than all of those nutty professors that you have talked about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"App\">\u201cIt\u2019s done by the school of hard knocks, is where you learn to dust something and lift fingerprints, and not by some professor sitting in some university who doesn\u2019t know his neck from third base.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">Johnson contends that these remarks denied him effective cross-examination of the expert\u2019s qualifications. Both appellants contend that the court\u2019s statement adversely affected the credibility of Johnson\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Elder, a psychologist and professor, who testified about the possibility of error in photographic identifications. Appellants claim that the court violated its duty to remain neutral and improperly trespassed on the jury\u2019s fact-finding duties. See <em>United States v. Williams, </em>447 F.2d 894 (5 Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">While the remarks were unfortunate, viewing the record as a whole they do not constitute reversible error. First, they took but a few moments of a five day trial, concerned a procedural matter, and did not reflect on appellants\u2019 guilt or innocence. See <em>United States v. James, </em>510 F.2d 546, 550 (5 Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied </em>423 U.S. 855, 96 S.Ct. 105, 46 L.Ed.2d 81 (1976). Second, the comments were made long before appellants\u2019 expert took the stand, and were not directed toward him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\n<em>Comments by Witness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV6\">The Government\u2019s first witness was Sandra Brown, widow of the murder victim. Following her testimony, defense counsel asked that Mrs. Brown remain under subpoena and subject to the court\u2019s sequestration ruling. The Government objected, arguing that the defense could have asked anything they wanted of Mrs. Brown while she was on the stand, and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201cMrs. Brown, you may go home if you wish, but you will remain under subpoena so that you can come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Why can\u2019t I sit in here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: You can\u2019t sit in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: They are doing that on purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: There\u2019s a possibility that you will be recalled as a witness, therefore, you can\u2019t sit in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: They are doing that on purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s not for you and me to say, I don\u2019t know, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: That\u2019s not right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. But, the circumstances are that you must stay out of the courtroom now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-14\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: It\u2019s not fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you must stay out of the courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which the court denied, stating: \u201cI don\u2019t think that her outburst amounted to that much\u201d. Appellant Washington contends that the court erred in denying his motion for mistrial on the ground that Mrs. Brown\u2019s remarks prejudiced the jury against the defense at the outset of the trial. He argues that the Government violated its duty of fairness in the prosecution of the case by making the objection which prompted the outburst. Washington contends that the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>should have taken steps to eliminate or cushion the effect of the remarks on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-21\">We disagree. This dialogue occupied only a moment of a lengthy trial and concerned a procedural issue. See <em>United States v. James, supra. </em>The witness\u2019s remarks were unsolicited by the Government. Any effect this incident may have had on the ultimate verdicts was minimal. Neither defense counsel requested any cautionary instructions. The court bears no duty, sua <em>sponte, </em>to give such instructions. We conclude that Washington was not substantially prejudiced by the unsolicited remarks of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-22\">\n<em>Suppression of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Au0B\">Johnson testified on cross-examination that he had never owned a .45 caliber pistol and had never kept any ammunition or holster in his house. Over defense objection, the Government rebutted Johnson\u2019s testimony by introducing a shoulder holster and .45 caliber bullet seized on May 19, 1975, from Johnson\u2019s bedroom pursuant to a search warrant. Johnson contends that the evidence seized in the search should have been suppressed and not used for impeachment because the affidavit made in support of the search warrant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> did not establish probable cause. Relying on <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964) and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), Johnson argues that the affidavit did not state sufficient facts to establish the reliability of the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The affidavit was made by Detective Mitchell of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s office. In addition to stating facts about other crimes in which Johnson was believed to be involved, Mitchell set forth in detail a conversation on April 15, 1975, between F.B.I. Agent Beinner, who was in charge of the investigation of this case, and an informant Beinner knew to be \u201creliable\u201d. The informant told Beinner that the informant was standing on a street corner on November 1, 1974, when Johnson and Washington drove up. Johnson displayed a .45 caliber pistol and told the informant that it had been used in the commission of an armed robbery of a bank near Hahnville, Louisiana. Johnson said that during the robbery, they had to place a man in the trunk of the car. While Johnson was telling the informant about the robbery, he suddenly remembered that he had left a blue shirt marked \u201cLoop Uniform\u201d on the inside at the scene of the abandoned getaway car and was afraid the shirt might be traced to him. Washington then became upset and advised Johnson to leave. Beinner corroborated the informant\u2019s information with facts discovered during the F.B.I. investigation of the armed robbery of the Bank of St. Charles and the murder of Irwin Brown. Affiant stated that these facts \u201cwere not publicized and were known only to investigators and the perpetrator\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We conclude that the affidavit alleged facts sufficient to meet the \u201csubstantial basis\u201d test of <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960) and <em>United States v. Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971). In <em>Jones, </em>the Court stated that \u201c[a]n affidavit is not to be deemed insufficient\u201d because it sets out observations by someone other than the affiant, \u201cso long as a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented\u201d. 362 U.S. at 269, 80 S.Ct. at 735. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201c[W]e have held that [an officer] may rely upon information received through an informant, rather than upon his direct observations, so long as the informant\u2019s statement is reasonably corroborated by other matters within the officer\u2019s knowledge. <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327.\u201d 362 U.S. at 269, 80 S.Ct. at 735.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The Court found a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for crediting the hearsay in the search warrant affidavit because the informant had previously given accurate information, his story was corroborated by \u201cother sources\u201d, and the defendant was known to the police as a user of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\"><em>United States v. Harris </em>concerned the sufficiency of an affidavit for a search warrant based on the hearsay statements of an unnamed informant whom the affidavit stated was a \u201cprudent person\u201d, and on the affiant\u2019s knowledge of the defendant\u2019s reputation as a \u201ctrafficker of nontaxpaid distilled spirits\u201d. In finding probable cause for the issuance of a warrant based on the affidavit, the Court reviewed its holding in <em>Jones, supra, </em>and stated that <em>\u201cAguilar </em>cannot be read as questioning the \u2018substantial basis\u2019 approach of <em>Jones\". </em>403 U.S. at 581, 91 S.Ct. at 2081. The Court found that the affidavit, like the one in <em>Jones, </em>\u201ccontained a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay\u201d because both affidavits purported \u201cto relate the personal observations of the informant\u201d and recited \u201cprior events within the affi-ant\u2019s own knowledge\u201d \u2014 factors \u201cclearly distinguishing] <em>Spinelli </em>\u201d. It was held that an averment that the informant had previously given \u201ccorrect information\u201d was not necessary. The Court declined to follow <em>Spinelli </em>to the extent that it precluded reliance by a policeman on his knowledge of a suspect\u2019s reputation in assessing the reliability of the informant\u2019s tip. 403 U.S. at 583, 91 S.Ct. 2075.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The affidavit here provided a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that the search of Johnson\u2019s residence was made pursuant to a valid warrant and that the evidence obtained thereby was properly admitted for purposes of impeaching Johnson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Appellant Johnson contends that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on what he terms \u201cthe defendant\u2019s theory of the ease\u201d, contained in his requested instructions VIII and IX. Requested instruction VIII reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cIn order to convict the accused, each individual juror should arrive at the conclusion that the defendant has been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that is, each individual juror, \u2018and each juror\u2019 having in view the oath he had taken and his duty and responsibility thereunder should have his own mind convinced beyond a reasonable doubt upon all the evidence before he should consent to a verdict of guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">This requested instruction was fully covered by the court\u2019s charge that the Government bore the duty of proving each element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that each juror must independently reach his own conclusion. See <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>531 F.2d 1303, 1307 (5 Cir. 1976). Proposed instruction VIII was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The second paragraph of Johnson\u2019s proposed instruction IX reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201cFurther the defense theory of the case on the palm print is that the evidence produced did not establish how long the laten[t] prints had been on the car, or who the other prints on the car belonged to, therefore the evidence on the palm print is inconclusive. I charge you where any element of prosecution\u2019s rests on circumstantial evidence, such evidence may be a basis for conviction only if it shows complete inconsistency with innocence and excludes every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt of the accused. This simply means that the prosecution must prove each and every link in its chain of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, and if any one link in the chain has not been proved beyond such reasonable doubt, a verdict must be returned. In order to convict the defendant on circumstantial evidence, such evidence must be inconsistent with his innocence and fairly consistent with his guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">This instruction was also properly rejected. The first sentence is clearly a comment on the weight of the evidence. The remainder of the instruction deals with the \u201creasonable hypothesis\u201d test. This court has consistently followed <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954) and held that such an instruction \u201cis not required where there [are] adequate instructions on reasonable doubt\u201d. <em>United States v. Pipkins, </em>528 F.2d 559, 564 (5 Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 952, 96 S.Ct. 3177, 49 L.Ed.2d 1191 (1976). The jury here was adequately instructed on reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Appellant Washington contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction. He argues that Carmouche\u2019s identification testimony was so tentative as to raise only a suspicion that he could have been one of the robbers. Washington attacks the credibility of Althea Tolliver\u2019s testimony by reciting the evidence offered to impeach her.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">Upon a review of the record and taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to sustain Washington\u2019s conviction. Tolliver testified that when asked-about the bank robbery, Washington said \u201cWell, I did it\u201d. In further conversation about the weapons used in the robbery, Washington stated that they were a .38 and \u201cyour [Tolliver\u2019s] .45\u201d. While there was evidence to impeach Tolliver\u2019s testimony, this evidence was argued at length by counsel and considered by the jury. The jury obviously believed Tolliver. Carmouche\u2019s identification of Washington as one of the two men who entered the Holiday Inn ga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>rage on the morning of October 31, 1974, while by no means positive, further implicated Washington. There was testimony that Washington owned an orange hardhat similar to that found near the murder victim\u2019s car. Although the evidence against Washington may not be overwhelming, we find it sufficient to establish Washington\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\n<em>Motion for New Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Washington moved for a new trial on grounds that (1) comments made by Johnson\u2019s attorney in closing argument reflected on Washington\u2019s failure to testify, and (2) the court should have severed the trials of the two defendants. Washington claims error in the court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">During his argument to the jury, counsel for Johnson referred to facts to which his client had testified during the trial. Washington contends that these references by inference drew the jury\u2019s attention to Washington\u2019s failure to testify and deprived him of the right to remain silent, thereby falling within the prohibition of <em>De Luna v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 140 (5 Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">We find no merit in this contention. <em>De Luna </em>is distinguishable. There counsel for one defendant repeatedly commented on the failure of the co-defendant to testify. Here Johnson merely summarized the facts to which his client testified. He made no reference to Washington\u2019s failure to testify. It is clear from the holding of this court in <em>United States v. Hodges, </em>502 F.2d 586, 587 (5 Cir. 1974) that <em>De Luna </em>is inapplicable. The court there said: \u201cA mere favorable comment upon the fact that one of several co-defendants testified does not involve the same potential for prejudice as an adverse comment by counsel upon the failure to testify of the other co-defendant. We decline to extend <em>De Luna </em>to cover the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Washington concedes that the \u201ccourt did, in its general charge to the jury, correctly state the law regarding the failure of an accused to testify in his own behalf\u201d. This charge was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Washington contended for the first time in his motion for a new trial that his trial should have been severed to avoid \u201cthe cascading effect of the evidence introduced against Stanley Johnson\u201d. Since he did not either before or during the trial move for a severance, to prevail on this issue now, Washington must demonstrate actual prejudice resulting from the failure to sever his trial from that of his co-defendant. <em>Tillman v. United States, </em>406 F.2d 930, 934-935 (5 Cir. 1969), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>395 U.S. 830, 89 S.Ct. 2143, 23 L.Ed.2d 742 (1969). Washington has failed in this burden. Washington and Johnson were properly joined since both were involved in both counts of the indictment. See F.R.Crim.P. 8(b). Washington does not claim that his co-defendant had an antagonistic defense, or that the jury was confused by the number of defendants or issues. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>526 F.2d 256, 260 (5 Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 839, 97 S.Ct. 110, 50 L.Ed.2d 106. The law of this circuit is clear that \u201c[a] defendant cannot claim prejudice from failure to sever merely because his likelihood of acquittal is not as great in a joint trial as in a separate trial\u201d. <em>United States v. Larson, supra </em>at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Furthermore, the trial court properly instructed the jury on their duty to consider the guilt of each defendant separately. \u201c[T]his instruction was given to the jury near the end of the judge\u2019s instructions, such that it cannot be argued that it did not make an impression on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Larson, supra </em>at 260. Washington has failed to demonstrate any actual prejudice. The trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial was clearly within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">\n<em>Brady Material</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Following trial, defense counsel learned that a five thousand dollar reward had been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the robbery of the Bank of St. Charles and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the murder of Irwin Brown.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Upon learning of the reward, appellants moved for a new trial, contending that the Government had a duty under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194,10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) to reveal the reward offer to the defense and argued that the Government\u2019s failure to do so denied them a fair trial. The court, following a hearing, denied the motions stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that the government has the duty to disclose, but even if they had the duty, I don\u2019t think it would have made any difference, it was brought out to the jury that Althea Tolliver was paid a thousand dollars by the government and she entered into a plea or bargain for her testimony. It was all brought out to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) controls our disposition of this issue. The Court there held that the <em>Brady </em>rule may apply in three different situations: (1) where \u201cthe undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution\u2019s case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury\u201d; (2) where there is a pretrial request for specific evidence; and (3) where there is no request or simply a general request for \u201call <em>Brady </em>material\u201d. With respect to the third category the Court recognized that, \u201cIf there is a duty to respond to a general request of that kind, it must derive from the obviously exculpatory character of certain evidence in the hands of the prosecutor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The Court in <em>Agurs </em>held that, \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d 96 S.Ct. at 2400. It was recognized that the courts \u201ccannot consistently treat every nondisclosure as though it were error\u201d. The Court continued: \u201cIt necessarily follows that the judge should not order a new trial every time he is unable to characterize a nondisclosure as harmless under the customary harmless error standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2401.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">In discussing the \u201cstandard of materiality\u201d which gives rise to a duty on the part of a prosecutor \u201cto volunteer exculpatory matter to the defense\u201d, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">\u201cIt necessarily follows that if the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, constitutional error has been committed. This means that the omission must be evaluated in the context of the entire record. If there is no reasonable doubt about guilt whether or not the additional evidence is considered, there is no justification for a new trial. On the other hand, if the verdict is already of questionable validity, additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2401-2402.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>This court summarized the <em>Brady </em>rule in <em>Galley </em>v. <em>Callaway, </em>519 F.2d 184, 223 (1975) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201cThe basic import of <em>Brady </em>is not that there is an abstract right on the part of the defendant to obtain all evidence possibly helpful to his case, but rather that there is an obligation on the part of the prosecution to produce certain evidence actually or constructively in its possession or accessible to it in the interests of inherent fairness. As we stated most recently in <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 513 F.2d 72, 78, <em>Brady </em>\u2018rests upon an abhorrence of the concealment of material arguing for innocence by one arguing for guilt.\u2019 513 F.2d at 78.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The parties stipulated that the reward offer had been published in four newspapers in New Orleans and St. Charles and telecast on a New Orleans station, and that the \u201cGovernment did not solicit, was not a source of, nor was a party to the offer of reward\u201d. It was stipulated further that Althea Tolliver knew of the offer of reward; that attorneys for the Government were aware that she knew of the offer and \u201choped to receive same\u201d; and that attorneys for the Government informed the court and defense counsel immediately prior to trial, in response to a defense request for <em>\u201cBrady\" </em>material, that there was no <em>Brady </em>material. The defense was allowed \u201copen file\u201d discovery by the Government, but no reference to the award was contained in the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We question whether the reward offer under the circumstances was the type of \u201cexculpatory evidence\u201d contemplated by <em>Brady </em>and subsequent cases. This is not a case where the Government had \u201cexclusive access\u201d to and concealed evidence or information which would exculpate the defendant. The Government was not a party to the reward offer and did not participate in making or obtaining it. The reward offer did not directly exculpate the defendant. At most it cast further doubt on the credibility of Tolliver, admittedly a crucial witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">In any event, from a review of the entire record, we are satisfied that the \u201comitted evidence\u201d, the reward offer, does not create \u201ca reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist\u201d. Althea Tolliver admitted that her motive for testifying was that she had made a plea bargain in a state case where she was charged with armed robbery.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She testified that her bond on the charge was reduced from $200,000 to $11,000, and that she was ultimately given a suspended sentence on a plea to a lesser charge. Tolliver further testified that she had received \u201ca little over one thousand dollars\u201d from the F.B.I. in return for the information she supplied. There was other testimony that Tolliver was a thief and had been a prostitute. The evidence provided a substantial basis for the impeachment of Tolliver\u2019s testimony and was extensively argued to the jury by all counsel. The jury was in a good position to assess Tolliver\u2019s credibility. In light of all the evidence, it is unlikely that evidence concerning the offer of reward would have affected the jury\u2019s determination of Tolliver\u2019s credibility or would have produced a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as to Washington\u2019s guilt. In the words of <em>Agurs, </em>\u201cthe mere possibility that [this] item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense . . . does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">While we are concerned about the Government counsel\u2019s remark in closing argument that Althea Tolliver \u201chas got noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ing to gain by coming in here to testify\u201d, we do not think it requires a conclusion contrary to the one we reach here. This was an isolated comment upon which the Government did not elaborate. It was made in the middle of a lengthy argument on Tolliver\u2019s credibility and was not prominent in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">We conclude that the district court could properly find that the reward offer would not have \u201cmade any difference\u201d and that under the criteria of <em>United States v. Agurs, supra, </em>the reward information was not required to be disclosed by the Government. The motion for a new trial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-20\">. It was stipulated that appellant Johnson owned a white 1974 Chevrolet Malibu Super Sport sedan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">. Tolliver testified that she had stolen a .45 caliber automatic pistol from J. Dudley Bruton, one of her prostitution clients, and had given it to Washington. Washington later told her that he had sold the gun to Johnson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. The expert also testified that two .45 cartridges given to the F.B.I. by Bruton had been inserted and extracted from Exhibit 17. He testified that these cartridges and the spent casing found in the Comet\u2019s trunk had been inserted in the same gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-16\">. Moreover, immediately following the comments, the court admonished the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-17\">\u201cI want the Jury to understand that the Court\u2019s not vouching for the qualifications of this witness, for his testimony, or anything. I accept him as an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_Vb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201cI accept him on the basis of his expertise, of his training, of his having done the thing over a period of thirteen years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-18\">\u201cI think he\u2019s certainly capable of examining, having been an expert in the field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-19\">\u201cNow, it\u2019s up to the Jury to give the weight that their \u2014 that they are going to give to his testimony, whether they believe it or not. I\u2019m not vouching for him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-23\">Furthermore, the court in its charge instructed the jury that they were the sole judges of the facts and were not to be influenced by the court\u2019s comments during trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b389-24\">. Two search warrants were obtained, the other pursuant to an investigation in an unrelated murder case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b390-5\">. It may be noted also that the evidence relating to the search was introduced for impeachment purposes. In a different context the Court has recognized that evidence inadmissible in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief under the exclusionary rule may be used for impeachment purposes to attack the credibility of the defendant\u2019s trial testimony. <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">. The reward was offered jointly by the Bank of St. Charles and the \u201cFriends of Irwin M. Brown\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">. See also <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) which falls into the first category established by <em>Agurs. </em>The Government there failed to disclose to the defense that the Government\u2019s key witness had been promised immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony, despite the statement of the witness on cross-examination that \u201cNobody told me I wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted\u201d. In discussing the necessity for disclosure, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201cWhen the \u2018reliability of a given witness may well by determinative of guilt or innocence,\u2019 nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility falls within this general rule. <em>Napue, supra, [Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264 (1959)] at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 317. We do not, however, automatically require a new trial whenever \u2018a combing of the prosecutors\u2019 files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict . . . .\u2019 <em>United States v. Keogh, </em>391 F.2d 138, 148 (CA 2 1968). A finding of materiality of the evidence is required under <em>Brady, supra, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. [1194] at 1196. A new trial is required if \u2018the false testimony could . . . in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury . . . .\u2019 <em>Napue, supra, </em>360 U.S. at 271, 79 S.Ct.
