C. Murphy Company violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>The company was charged with (1) creating the impression that an employee\u2019s union activities were under surveillance, (2) threatening to close its Rock-ville, Maryland store if the union won the election, and (3) cancelling previously prepared wage increase requisitions and refusing to proceed with its annual employee wage review procedure because of the union\u2019s organizational campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-15\">We have examined the record and find substantial evidentiary basis to support the NLRB\u2019s decision in those three respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-16\">In this case, the union sent a letter to the company assuring it that no charges would be filed by the union if the company wished to grant employee wage increases during the pendency of the union\u2019s organization effort. For this reason, the employer had no ground to fear that granting wage increases at that time would provoke an unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-17\">The decision of the Board is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-18\">ENFORCED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
