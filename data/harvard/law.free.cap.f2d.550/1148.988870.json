We conclude that the order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">PSA operates a printing and publications shop at its principal place of business in San Diego, California. During 1971, James Heck was the \u201cleadman\u201d in the shop. In June 1971, six of the shop\u2019s eight employees signed authorization cards designating the Lithographers and Photoengravers International Union as their representative to bargain collectively on their behalf. Over succeeding months, PSA \u2014 principally through Heck and Thomas Irwin, the shop manager \u2014 pursued a course of conduct which included interrogation of employees about their union activities and sympathies, rescission of a previously-announced wage adjustment without assurances of future considerations, threats to lay off employees if the union were voted in, and the firing of Vernon Hover, a senior employee in the shop, because of his union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">\n<em>Unfair Labor Practice Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">PSA attempts to minimize, but does not seriously deny, that Hover was wrongfully fired for his pro-union activities. It does urge, however, that Heck was not a \u201csupervisor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2(11) of the Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, therefore, that his actions are not attributable to it. But there is substantial evidence to support the findings of both the trial examiner and the Board that Heck had authority to \u201cresponsibly direct\u201d employees as required by section 2(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">In any event, as we said under closely analogous circumstances in <em>N.L.R.B. v. L. B. Foster Company, </em>418 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1124, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-12\">Resolution of the supervisory status of [the employee in question] is not necessary for the purpose of determining whether the respondent violated section 8(a)(1). The Board found that the employer <em>acted through </em>[the employee]. Since his agency is supported by substantial evidence, his acts are attributed to the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-13\">418 F.2d at 2 n.l (emphasis in original). Since, as the Board properly found, PSA did act through Heck for the purpose of undermining the Union, those actions are fully attributable to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-14\">We believe that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that PSA engaged in these activities in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) &amp; (3). This is particularly true since Irwin\u2019s conduct (e. <em>g., </em>in firing Hover) accounted in substantial part for the unlawful acts complained of, and no one contests Irwin\u2019s supervisory status. We find PSA\u2019s other contentions on this question also lacking in merit, there being substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-15\">\n<em>Appropriateness of Bargaining Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-16\">PSA\u2019s principal contention is that however wrongful its conduct toward the Un-. ion, its nature falls short of the drastic and \u201cpervasive\u201d conduct required for implementation of a bargaining order. It argues that the Board should instead have ordered a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-17\">In evaluating the Board\u2019s selection of remedies, we bear in mind the admonition set down in <em>N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Company, </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>It is for the Board and not the courts, however, to make that determination [whether a bargaining order is warranted], based on its expert estimate as to the effects on the election process of unfair labor practices of varying intensity. In fashioning its remedies under the broad provisions of \u00a7 10(c) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)), the Board draws on a fund of knowledge and expertise all its own, and its choice of a remedy must therefore be given special respect by reviewing courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1o\">395 U.S. at 612, n.32, 89 S.Ct. at 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\">In <em>Gissel, </em>the Court delineated three categories of wrongful employer conduct: (1) \u201cexceptional\u201d cases marked by \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices, in which cases a bargaining order would be strongly endorsed; (2) \u201cminor or less extensive\u201d unfair labor practices which, because of their minimal effect on the election process, will not merit a bargaining order; and (3) \u201cless extraordinary cases marked by less pervasive practices\u201d which nevertheless still tend to undermine the majority strength and impede the election machinery, in which case a bargaining order is still warranted. The <em>Gissel </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-5\">If the Board finds that the possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight and that employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance, be better protected by a bargaining order, then such an order should issue ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">395 U.S. at 614-15, 89 S.Ct. at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">We think that PSA\u2019s conduct in the case at bar falls into the third category above and that the preferences of the employees already expressed through cards should be protected by the order. Therefore, we affirm the Board\u2019s bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">Two questions arise in this case, however, which bear some additional scrutiny. Both relate to the propriety of the bargaining order, relative to other remedies which the Board could have ordered. They are: (1) Must the Board make specific findings and articulate its reasons when issuing a bargaining order; and (2) does the lapse of time involved in the case at bar \u2014 over five years \u2014 affect the propriety of the bargaining order?</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">\n<em>Findings of Fact and Articulation of Reasons</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-11\">At oral argument, counsel for PSA called our attention to <em>Peerless of America, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>484 F.2d 1108 (7th Cir. 1973), in which the court was disturbed about the perfunctory quality of the Board\u2019s findings. There, in quashing a bargaining order of the NLRB as unwarranted by the circumstances, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-12\">We have consistently held that <em>Gissel </em>contemplates that the Board must make \u201cspecific findings\u201d as to the immediate and residual impact of the unfair labor practices on the election process and that the Board must make \u201ca detailed analysis\u201d assessing the possibility of holding a fair election in terms of any continuing effect of misconduct, the likelihood of recurring misconduct, and the potential effectiveness of ordinary remedies. <em>But once again the Board has failed to give a satisfactory explanation of its decision.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-13\">\n<em>This substitution of conclusion for explanation does not permit a reviewing court to do its job.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-14\">[W]e cannot responsibly guard against administrative arbitrariness unless the Board explains in what respects this case differs from the others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1215-15\">484 F.2d at 1118-19 (emphasis added; citations &amp; footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>The problems troubling the Seventh Circuit have been noted by other courts. <em>See, e.g., N.L.R.B. v. Gibson Prod. Co. of Washington Parish, La., Inc., </em>494 F.2d 762, 766 (5th Cir. 1974) (\u201cThe Board is under an obligation to articulate its reasoning and to distinguish factually similar cases with contrary results.\u201d); <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Armcor Industries, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 239, 244-45 (3d Cir. 1976) (case remanded for more detailed findings by Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">It is customary for the Board to make findings of fact on which to base its order. Indeed, this is mandated by \u00a7 10(c) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The law does not, however, explicitly state that the Board must specify its reasons for so acting. Nevertheless, in light of the mandatory findings of fact, together with the statutory requirement that the order be reasonable and substantiated by the evidence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it follows that the fact findings are in most cases tantamount to the reasons for which the order was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">There is controversy, however, as to the specificity and detail with which these orders should be stated. We believe that to the maximum extent possible they should reflect the reasoning behind the remedy selected. <em>Secretary of Agriculture v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 645, 655, 74 S.Ct. 826, 98 L.Ed. 1015 (1954); <em>City of Lawrence, Massachusetts v. C.A.B., </em>343 F.2d 583, 588 (1st Cir. 1965). <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 420, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). In no case should orders and findings of fact be perfunctory or \u201cboiler-plate,\u201d as is sometimes the case. <em>See, e. g., N.L.R.B. v. Armcor Industries, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 239, 244 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Walgreen Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>509 F.2d 1014, 1018 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Gibson Prod. Co. of Washington Parish, La., Inc., </em>494 F.2d 762, 766-67 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">On this point we agree with the Seventh Circuit. Effective appellate review, as well as judicial and administrative accountability, requires that the Board clearly articulate the reasons behind any order, and particularly why other remedies were found to be inappropriate. <em>N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 614-15, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Four Winds Industries, Inc., </em>530 F.2d 75 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">In the case at bar, the findings of the trial examiner and the Board were, in fact, sufficient to support the bargaining order. The respondent\u2019s malfeasances were clearly set forth together with the reasons why its misconduct was so pervasive as to make a new election unfeasible. <em>See Pacific Southwest Airlines, </em>201 N.L.R.B. 647, 657 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-12\">\n<em>Lapse of Time</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-13\">Five years have elapsed since this matter was initiated. The question arises whether this delay vitiates the utility of the bargaining order in light of the possible turnover of the few printshop personnel involved, changes in the desires of the employees to be unionized, and other conditions. Should the Board instead be required to implement a new union election?</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-14\">Concededly, a bargaining order based on authorization cards is considered less desirable than the free expression of employees in a fair election. <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 603, 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); <em>N.L.R.B. v. L. B. Foster Co., </em>418 F.2d 1, 3 (9th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1124, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">But the law is clear: The passage of time does not by itself compel a new election. As we said in <em>N.L.R.B. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of San Mateo, </em>472 F.2d 140 (9th Cir. 1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-5\">[P]assage of time for the orderly adjudication of labor disputes cannot be used as a basis for denying an enforcement order. The relevant period for determining the appropriateness of the bargaining order is <em>as of when it was before the NLRB. </em>That there is a rapid turnover of employees does not militate against the appropriateness of the bargaining order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">472 F.2d at 141 (emphasis added; citations omitted). This rule was set down long ago by the Supreme Court in <em>Franks Bros. Co. v. Labor Board, </em>321 U.S. 702, 704-05, 64 S.Ct. 817, 88 L.Ed. 1020 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">There is a good reason for this rule, particularly where \u2014 as here \u2014 the lengthy and unfortunate delay since the union\u2019s formation has been caused by the employer. To hold otherwise would be to allow an employer to benefit from purposefully protracting litigation as long as possible. <em>N.L. R.B. v. International Van Lines, </em>473 F.2d 1036, 1037 (9th Cir. 1973); <em>N.L.R.B. v. L. B. Foster Co., </em>418 F.2d 1, 4 (9th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1124, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">Accordingly, in cases such as the one at bar, the appropriate time for determination of the propriety of a bargaining order relates back to the time when the case arose before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-11\">THE BOARD\u2019S ORDER WILL BE ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1214-9\"><em>. 29 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-10\">The term \u201csupervisor\u201d means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">. The Seventh Circuit went on to question the \u201cpresumed expertise\u201d of the Board to make judgments as to the effect of employer misconduct on the prospects for a fair union election:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMqs\">[T]hat presumed expertise does not relieve the Board of its responsibility to explain its conclusions in terms reviewing courts can understand. Insofar as they can be discerned, it is beginning to appear that many of the Board\u2019s expert assumptions about the impact of employer misconduct on employee voting behavior are invalid. Nevertheless, until they are conclusively invalidated, we must accept plausible assumptions in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>area, <em>but require their articulation and particularized application to the facts of each case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABg\">484 F.2d at 1118 n.16 (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">. Section 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-8\">If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the Board shall be of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this subchapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1216-16\">. Section 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-18\">The findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">. In <em>Foster </em>we also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-10\">The delay is not the fault of the union; if it is anyone\u2019s fault, it is that of the employer. But regardless of fault, it is an unfortunate but inevitable result of the process of hearing, decision and review prescribed in the Act. And to deny enforcement, with or without remand for reconsideration on the basis of facts occurring after the Board\u2019s decision, is to put a premium upon continued litigation by the employer; it can hope that the resulting delay wili produce a new set of facts, as to which the Board must then readjudicate. Suppose that the Board does so, and again finds against the employer. There can then be a petition to this court, a decision by it, and a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court. By that time there will almost surely be another new set of facts. When is the process to stop?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1217-23\">418 F.2d at 4. <em>See Franks Bros. Co. v.
