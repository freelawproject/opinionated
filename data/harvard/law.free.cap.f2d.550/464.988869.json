Zurcher, </em>353 F.Supp. 124 (N.D.Cal.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We reject appellants\u2019 contention that the issuing magistrate is the sole proper party defendant. Having lost in the. lower court, the appellants raise this issue for the first time upon appeal. In this respect, the argument is at least, untimely. Moreover, we are not persuaded that it has merit. The appellants are proper defendants in a suit to declare that actions theretofore performed were illegal and to enjoin them from acting illegally or permitting their subordinates from engaging in such illegal conduct in the future.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Cf. Schnell v. City of Chicago, </em>407 F.2d 1084 (7th Cir. 1969); <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Noel, </em>323 F.Supp. 779, 783 (Conn.1970) (\u201cIn a number of recent cases seeking damages against police officers under the Civil Rights Act, it has been held that no liability exists unless it is alleged and proved that the officer was either present at or directed or personally cooperated in the acts relied on for liability. . Where injunctive relief is sought, however, no such rigid requirements obtain.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We also reject appellants\u2019 argument that their good faith in securing what turned out to be an invalid warrant insulates them from liability. The appellants rely on the rule that gives public officials a qualified immunity in damage actions under Section 1983 if the officials acted in good faith. Extension of this rule to suits like the present one, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, has been rejected by the courts. We accept the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rationale in <em>Rowley v. McMillan, </em>502 F.2d 1326, 1332 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201c. . . [T]he immunity rule, whatever its scope, is grounded upon the inhibitory effect of suits for money damages. Manifestly, actions for injunctive relief do not have that effect. The federal defendants have cited no case, and we have found none, which holds that the immunity doctrine insulates a public official or public employee from injunctive relief to prevent what would otherwise be an illegal act on his part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-12\"><em>(Accord: Hogge v. Hedrick, </em>391 F.Supp. 91 (E.D.Va.1975). <em>See Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 315, n.6, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975); <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. Nixon, </em>160 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 492 F.2d 587, 609 (1974); <em>Gouge v. Joint School Dist. No. 1, </em>310 F.Supp. 984, 990 (W.D.Wis.1970); <em>Richmond Black Police Officers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>386 F.Supp. 151, 154 (E.D.Va.1974); <em>Saffron v. Wilson, </em>70 F.R.D. 51 (D.D.C.1975); <em>Safeguard Mutual Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>472 F.2d 732, 734 (3d Cir. 1973).)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">The district court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the appellees. It applied the then prevailing law permitting such awards based on the private attorney general doctrine, and pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent equitable power. <em>(E. g., Brandenburger v. Thompson </em>(9th Cir. 1974) 494 F.2d 885.) While the case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court decided <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. The Wilderness Society </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141, which severely restricted the private attorney general doctrine and destroyed the legal foundation for appellees\u2019 fee award. While this case was still pending on appeal, Congress passed the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976 (the \u201cAct\u201d), 1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 90 Stat. 2641 (October . 19, 1976), which restored pre-<em>Alyeska </em>law to \u201ccases arising under our civil rights laws, a category of cases in which attorney\u2019s fees have been traditionally regarded as appropriate. It remedies gaps in the language of these civil rights laws by providing the specific authorization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>required by the Court in <em>Alyeska, </em>and makes our civil rights laws consistent.\u201d (Sen.Rep.No.94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 5908, 5912 accompanying S. 2278 (hereinafter \u201cSenate Report\u201d).) <em>(See also id. </em>at p. 4, 1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 5911) (\u201cThis decision <em>[Alyeska] </em>and dictum created anomalous gaps in our civil rights laws whereby awards of fees are, according to <em>Alyeska, </em>suddenly unavailable in the most fundamental civil rights cases. For instance . . . fees are allowed in a suit under Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act . , . but not in suits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 redressing violations of the Federal Constitution . . . .\u201d); 122 Cong.Rec. 12163 (daily ed. October 1, 1976) (\u201cThis bill restores to the courts authority which they had exercised for years under the private attorneys general concept.\u201d (remarks of Rep. Fish).)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We are not left to speculate whether Congress intended the Act to apply to attorney\u2019s fee awards in cases like this one. The Act expressly states that it is applicable to \u00a7 1983 actions like the present ease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And the legislative history is crystalline on the point. The House Report accompanying the House version of the same bill states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\u201cIn accordance with applicable decisions of the Supreme Court, the bill is intended to apply to all eases pending on the date of enactment as well as all future cases. <em>Bradley v. Richmond School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974).\u201d (H.R.Rep.No.94-1558, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, n.6 (1976).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM8\"><em>(See also </em>122 Cong.Rec. 17052 (daily ed. September 29, 1976) (\u201cThis application is necessary to fill the gap created by the <em>Alyeska </em>decision and thus avoid the inequitable situation of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees turning on the date the litigation was commenced.\u201d (remarks by Sen. Abour-ezk)); 122 Cong.Rec. 12155 (daily ed. October 1, 1976) (\u201c[I]t would apply to cases now pending, for the simple reason that if that were not the case, the award of fees would depend on the date that the case is filed. I do not think that is the basis on which a determination is made. To that extent, it is retroactive. Pending cases could receive an award of reasonable fees.\u201d (remarks of Rep. Anderson)); <em>id. </em>at 12160 (remarks of Rep. Drinan).)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">As if this were not enough, the Senate Report cited the award in this very case as an example of the fee awards which it approved and which it intended to authorize in the Act. (Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>pp. 4, n.3, 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">Under these circumstances, no useful purpose would be served in requiring a remand to the district court to decide the impact of the Act on the fee awarded to the appellees. The attorney\u2019s fee awarded by the district court was valid when it was made, and it was revalidated by the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Cf. Lytle v. Commissioner of Election </em>(4th Cir. 1976) 541 F.2d 421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\">.
