The conviction was affirmed. <em>State v. Cancler, </em>252 La. 380, 211 So.2d 298 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-25\">On two prior appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we remanded this case to the district court for the production and examination of the state trial transcript to determine whether due process was violated by the state\u2019s introduction of evidence regarding an extraneous similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>offense, occurring six months earlier, for the limited purpose of showing \u201cintent, system, and knowledge\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\">A review of the entire state record, including the trial transcript, persuades us that even if the evidence of the extraneous offense was improperly admitted, concepts of fundamental fairness were not violated, and that the admission of such evidence was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v.
