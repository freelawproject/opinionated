Said claims 13 and 17 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\u201c13. In a machine of the class described, the combination of a pair of rotors having intermeshing teeth, a easing having a curved wall fitted substantially airtight to the teeth of the rotors on the inlet side and an open exhaust chamber ou tbe outlet side of said rotors, and means for deliverying fluid pressure through said curved wall to the inter-spaces between the wall and rotor teeth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">\u201c17. In a machine of the class described, the combination of an open easing divided by a curved partition wall having a pressure inlet port into a rotor chamber and a fluid pressure chamber, a pair of rotors mounted in said open chamber with their teeth in substantially air-tight contact on the inlet side with said curved wall, and means for delivering fluid pressure to said fluid pressure chamber and through said pressure inlet port in said curved wall to the interspaces between the teeth of said rotors and said curved wall.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The claims were rejected by the Board on reference to Backstrom, No. 572,946, dated December 15, 1896. The examiner also cited Keats, No. 981,862, dated January 17, 1911, and Taylor, No. 1,152,862, dated September 7, 1915, as references.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The appellant insists as to elaim 13 that the feature therein specified \u201can open exhaust chamber ou the outlet side of said rotors\u201d is new to the art and patentable. As to elaim 17, he insists that the language \u201ca fluid pressure chamber\u201d is sufficient, together with the further language \u201can open casing,\u201d to differentiate his invention from the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">The cited patent to Backstrom is a steam engine, consisting of two cylindrical rotating drums with teeth which intermesh, and whieh receive a jet of steam directed against them, and the force of whieh causes the drums to revolve in opposite directions. The steam, after having performed its function, passes through between these drums and exhausts, through portholes into an open chamber above the drums, and separated from said drums by a solid metal wall except where said portholes are located. The only openings in the walls surrounding said drums are the ports above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">The device of applicant here has similar metallic walls surrounding the bottom portion of the rotors, and with an opening through which the actuating fluid enters and strikes the intermeshing tooth blades of the rotors. After the actuating fluid has passed through the rotors, it exhausts into the upper portion of the easing. No walls surround the upper portion of the rotors as are found below them. The appellant claims that his device thus differs from Backstrom, and that the chamber into which the actuating fluid exhausts is open, as contradistinguished from Backstrom, whieh he claims is not open. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">The Board of Appeals held against his contention in this respect, holding that the language used was sufficient to cover either the Backstrom device or that of appellant.  We agree with the Board of Appeals in this respect. An open chamber means a chamber having openings into it. Certainly, in the common language of the people, in speaking of an open chamber, one would not have in mind a chamber without any walls at all. So, in this case, the open chamber described in appellant\u2019s application is satisfied by an exhaust chamber whieh has an opening into it. It is probable the applicant has novelty in his mechanism. However, claims 13 and 17 are too general to give him the benefit and advantage of the same, in view of the cited references.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
