Thera were no requests to find any specific facts, and so, of course, no exceptions for failure to find specific facts. There was a general opinion discussing the facts \u25a0and the law, and directing judgment against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-22\">Appellant\u2019s complaint is that as to certain parts' of the judgment there was no evidence in support, and that as to other parts or the whole the evidence conclusively established affirmative defenses. No one of these matters was presented to the court as matter of law and ruling asked upon it, before the judgment was entered in \u201cthe progress of the trial.\u201d Fleischmann v. U. S., 270 U.

S., 46 S. Ct. 284, 70 L. Ed. 624. There is no basis for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
