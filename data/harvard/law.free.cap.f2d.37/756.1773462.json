The examiner denied patentability, in view of the patent to Peterson, No. 68,061, August 25, 1925, but the Board of Examiners in Chief held the applicant\u2019s design patentably distinguished from that disclosed in the reference. The appellant tribunal held, however, that the design was not patentably distinguished from that on which the applicant had already obtained a patent, No. 72,262, March 22,1927, and recommended the denial of the claim in view of the latter patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s rejection rests upon there being no patentable distinction between the oval-shaped panel and the circular-shaped panel. With this conclusion we agree. Our reasons for such conclusion are more fully set out in In re Hopkins, 37 F.(2d) 755, patent appeal No. 2226, decided concurrently herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
