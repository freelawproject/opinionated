Both the broker\u2019s memorandum and the letter of confirmation of the plaintiff, to whieh defendant must be held to have consented, provided that the transaction should be governed by said rules. In addition thereto, the confirmatory letter, in giving instructions as to loading, specifically required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201cAfter removing dome cover, the outlet valve should be examined to ascertain if it is properly seated and that the valve rod is securely attached to the valve and is operative from the dome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">\u201cBefore any oil is loaded the outlet cap should be removed and allowed to hang by the chain until tank has been loaded, which will quickly indicate whether valve is properly seated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u201cBefore loading refined oil, in addition to the above the steam coils should be thoroughly tested (preferably with air) to detect any leaks, and if any are found they should be repaired and the coils made tight under pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201cAfter loading has been completed, the outlet cap should be reapplied and screwed tight, and care should be exercised to see that the steam coil connection caps are also securely applied. Both dome cover and outlet cap should then be sealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">One of the applicable rules (No. 2) also provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">\u201c * * \u25a0 * Seller will be responsible for loss in transit of commodities shipped in tank ears if seller has failed to comply with instructions regarding loading of tank cars. * * * \u00bb\u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Section 2 of Rule 118 declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">\u201cThe shipper is required to inspect all tank cars before loading, to see that all mechanical parts are in good condition, especially steam pipes, coils, outlet pipes and outlet valves. Where cars are found to be defective they shall not be loaded until buyer has been notified by wire and specifically authorizes their loading. The shipper shall also inspect ears after loading to see that the valves are properly seated and caps are properly applied to outlet pipe's, that caps or plugs are properly applied to steam pipes, that dome covers are properly applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-14\">\u201cFailure to observe the foregoing shall constitute negligence on the part of the shipper, and shall relieve the buyer from responsibility for any and all loss or damage resulting therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Defendant further contends that it was error for the lower court to charge that the burden was upon defendant to show that it (had complied with its contract as to the manner of loading the ear, as well as the refusal to charge that the burden was upon the plaintiff at all times, and, unless it showed that the defendant\u2019s failure to take the cap off the outlet pipe was the proximate cause of the loss, plaintiff could not recover, even if the valve stem was not properly set, provided defendant had screwed the cap on securely; it being contended that the evidence showed the oil could not escape in transit if the cap was so applied unless it was disturbed by some human agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">Of course parties cannot make contracts that will deprive the courts of jurisdiction or power to decide their controversies when they arise, but we see no reason why, in Icircumstances like these, where the loading of a tank ear was to be by the seller, in whose power it would be to take the necessary precautions and safeguards against loss, and who would also be in possession of all the evidence as to what was done, a stipulation could not be made whieh would compel it to assume the risk if it did not perform those things whieh were reasonably necessary to prevent the loss. The requirement of the shipping instructions authorized by the rules with respect to the removal of the outlet cap was one calculated to make certain that the valve would be closed when the oil was pumped into the car, for the simple reason that, if it was not, the oil would run out and be discovered immediately. On the other hand, if it was left screwed on, and any one attempted to set the valve stem to close the outlet from the dome cap, he might easily be mistaken in thinking it was closed when it was not. In the light of the undisputed facts, which we have outlined above, we are convinced, as was no doubt the jury below, that this is exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>what happened. No one got into the ear, but the effort to close the valve was made from the dome cap and with only such chance to see as that situation afforded. It was found after the outlet cap had come off and the oil had been lost that, because of a nut having been screwed up too tight, the valve stem was too short to close the opening until it was lengthened. The evidence further showed that there was a small amount of oil in the car before loading was started, which almost came up to the top of the nut on the lower end of the valve stem, and we have no doubt the man who attempted to close it honestly believed he had succeeded; whereas, if he had removed the cap from the outlet pipe as required by the rules and shipping instructions, he would have at once discovered his mistake. In view of these considerations, we cannot see how any one could say that the requirement was either unreasonable or an attempt to take away from the courts their jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties. We are justified, we think, in assuming the experience of members of the association and men engaged in the business, had been such as to require provision against contingencies wherein attempts would be made to shift responsibility from one party to the other. . The difficulties which they sought to meet are apparent, such as the fact that the ears would often have to pass through the hands of two or more connecting railroads, with the consequent trouble in obtaining evidence to establish liability, when, by the simple expedient of complying with this requirement, all question as to whether the valve had been closed would be eliminated. We do not think it necessary to go into an extended discussion of legal principles, but find it sufficient to say that the requirement was reasonable and for a substantial purpose, and one to which the parties were at liberty to agree, if not complied with, should place the risk upon the seller. We therefore conclude that there was no error, either in the refusal to strike the allegations from the petition, or in the charge that the burden was upon the defendant to show that it had taken the precautions required by its contract, and, if not, then it had assumed the risk of loss. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Voight, 176 U. S. 498, 20 S. Ct. 385, 44 L. Ed. 560; Dorrance et al. v. Barber &amp; Co., Inc. (C. C. A.) 262 F. 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The conclusions which we have thus reached make it unnecessary to consider the remaining assignments, and, finding no error otherwise in the rulings of the lower court, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
