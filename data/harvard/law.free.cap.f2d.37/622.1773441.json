S. Co. 1857,\u201d both marks being used upon silverware. International Silver Company filed oppositions to both applications, claiming use of the trade-mark \u201c1847 Rogers Bros.\u201d upon the same.kind of goods, and alleging damage if -said applications were allowed. The two oppositions were consolidated by tbe Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">The Commissioner of Patents.affirmed the decision of the examiner of trade-mark interferences, sustaining the opposition to the registration of applicant\u2019s mark \u201c1857,\u201d adjudging the applicant not entitled to sueh registration, and dismissing the opposition to the registration of applicant\u2019s mark \u201cA. S. Co. 1857,\u201d and adjudging the applicant entitled to sueh registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">The opposer appeals from that part of the decision relating to the mark \u201cA. S. Co. 1857,\u201d and applicant appeals from that part of the decision relating to the mark \u201c1857.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-22\">Both parties took testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-23\">The Commissioner found that opposer, through its predecessor, has used its mark upon silverware continuously since as early as 1862, and has built up a very large business, with expenditures in advertising sometimes reaching half a million dollars per year; that its business has been very largely conducted on the advertising set forth in connection with its trade-mark \u201c1847 Rogers Bros.\u201d; that opposer has never used the date \u201c1847\u201d alone or dissociated with the words \u201cRogers Bros.\u201d He further found that applicant has used its mark \u201cA. S. Co. 1857,\u201d inclosed in. lozenge shaped panels, since about June 1, 1925, but has used the date \u201c1857\u201d since about November 1,1894; that the applicant took over the silver plating business of another company which began making and selling silver plated table ware in 1857, when sueh firm took over the business of still another company that had sueeumbed\u2019to the effects of the panic of 1857; that the date \u201c1857\u201d had long been used by applicant to indicate when the business to which it had succeeded had begun; that the date \u201c1857\u201d alone does not appear ever to have been used by the applicant, but it was used in connection with the words \u201cWelehAtkins' <em>XXX\u201d </em>as early as November 1, 1894, and sueh trade-mark was registered in 1895.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ4T\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The Commissioner, after finding in substance the foregoing, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">\u201cFrom the foregoing, it is clear that neither party has ever used the date alone but only' in connection with other distinguishing words or letters. These dates are important dates in connection with the respective histories of the establishment of the opposer and applicant companies. Their similarity as to three figures seems accidental. It is believed, even if the applicant company were otherwise entitled to registration of the numbers comprising the date, which alone it has never used as a trade mark, yet it should not be permitted registration in view of these numbers being so deceptively similar to the numbers indicating the date in opposer\u2019s trade mark. It is believed the conclusion of tbe examiner of interferences sustaining the opposition as to this application of the applicant company is sound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\u201cRegarding the application No. 225,691, wherein registration of the combination mark \u201cA. S. Co. 1857\u201d arranged in two lozenge shaped panels is sought, it appears this mark is not similar to that of the opposer. While there is some similarity in connection with! the respective dat\u00e9s included in the two marks, yet the distinguishing features are believed to be sufficient to prevent confusion or mistake in the mind of the publie. It is evident that the applicant has not sought to adopt a mark similar to that of the opposer hut in adopting the combination mark including the date when its business may be said to have been started, it has merely adopted a date having some numbers similar to those appearing in the date included in the opposer\u2019s mark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We are of the opinion that the testimony and record support the conclusions of the Commissioner. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The testimony shows that purchasers of the silverware bearing the trade-mark \u201c1847 Rogers Bros.\u201d very frequently order it by reference to the numerals \u201c1847\u201d alone. If the numerals \u201c1857\u201d alone were used by applicant, purchasers might be misled, believing that they were purchasing goods manufactured by tbe owner of tbe trade-mark \u201c1847 Rogers Bros.\u201d While it is not entirely clear to us that confusion would be likely to result \u2022 from tbe use by applicant of the numerals \u201c1857\u201d as a trade-mark, we think the doubt should be resolved in favor of the opposer who is the prior user in good-faith. Wayne County Preserving Company v. Burt Olney Canning Company, 32 App. D. C. 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">As to the application for the registration of the combination mark <em>\u201cA. </em>S. Co. 1857,\u201d we believe that tbe use of tbe letters \u201cA. S. Co.\u201d in combination with the numerals \u201c1857\u201d sufficiently distinguishes the goods bearing said combination from goods bearing the trade-mark \u201c1847 Rogers Bros.,\u201d so that confusion or mistake in the mind of the public is not likely to result therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">We may take judicial notice of tbe fact that the purchase of silverware, sterling or plated, involves a considerable degree of care and discrimination upon the part of the purchaser. The goods are valuable. They are not a matter of every day purchase upon the part of an individual, like food products or other products that require frequent replacement. A person might purchase silverware bearing the mark \u201c1857\u201d alone in tbe belief that he was buying goods manufactured by the owner of the mark \u201c1847 Rogers Bros.,\u201d but we do not think this confusion is likely to occur with the mark \u201cA. S. Co. 1857.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Were the goods upon which the marks are used of a character involving less discrimination and care in their purchase, we might come to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
