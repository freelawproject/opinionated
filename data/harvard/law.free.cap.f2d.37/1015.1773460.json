He deserted his ship, and ever since has remained here, working as an employee in a restaurant. More than three years after desertion he was arrested on a warrant charging him -with remaining in the United States for a longer time than permitted by the Immigration Act of 1924 (43 Stat. \u2022 153), or the regulations prescribed thereunder. After a hearing at Ellis Island, he was ordered to he deported to Greece, whence he had come.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">The relator contends that his deportation is governed by section 34 of the Immigration Act of 1917 (39 Stat. 896 [8 USCA \u00a7 166]).

Piccolella v. Commissioner (decided December 2, 1929, C. C.
