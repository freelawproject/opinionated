The product complained of here is a cotton fabrie made in a satin weave, and has been advertised under the trade-name of \u201cSa.tiuma.id\u201d and \u201cSatinized,\u201d and has also been referred to on the labels and tags as a \u201csatinized\u201d fabric. The petitioner has a trade-mark of the name \u201cSatinmaid\u201d and \u201cSatinized.\u201d In sueh advertising, since the 7th of December, 1925, the petitioner has used the word \u201cSatin-maid,\u201d and in almost equally large type or letters has added \u201cA cotton fabric.\u201d The same has been true in the use of the word \u201cSatinized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">' Prior to the addition of the words \u201ca cotton fabrie,\u201d in each instance, the Federal Trade Commission, after complaint made, enter\u00e9d into a stipulation on December 7, 1925, with the petitioner, in part, as follows: \u201e</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-16\">\u201cIt is further stipulated and agreed that hereafter when respondent (referring to N. Fluegelman &amp; Co.) shall use said trade name \u2018Satinmaid\u2019 in advertising, labeling or describing a fabrie composed entirely of cotton or not containing a substantial amount of silk, it will, in every case,, use in immediate conjunction with said trade name apt words dearly showing that sueh fabric is all cotton or contains no silk or the truth as to its silk content.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-17\">Prior to this stipulation, the Commission found that the product \u201cwhen sold and delivered by respondent has had so-called board ends affixed to the cards or boards around which the fabrie was wound, containing said trade name, accompanied by the words \u2018A Satinized Fabric/ in one or more places, which also have appeared on paste tickets, hanging tags, salesmen\u2019s color cards, and other descriptive matter used in connection with the sale and distribution of said fabrie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-18\">It found that, after December 7, 1925, the petitioner in its advertisements and descriptive matter used in connection with the sale and distribution of this fabric the words \u201cA Cotton Fabric\u201d either below or above the word \u201cSatinmaid\u201d and \u201cSatinized,\u201d but in letters considerably smaller, except in the so-called color cards used by traveling salesmen to exhibit the various colors in which petitioner offers its fabrie for sale. On these color cards the words \u201cA Cotton Fabric\u201d appear in letters larger but less conspicuous than the trade-name \u201cSatinmaid\u201d or \u201cSatinized.\u201d The Commission found that the word \u201csatin\u201d described a fabric composed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>wholly of silk, woven in a peculiar manner so as to impart a high luster to the surface of the fabric; that the word \u201cSatinmaid,\u201d composed of two words \u201csatin\u201d and \u201cmaid,\u201d had the same phonetie significance as if it were used with the word \u201cmade,\u201d and has a capacity and tendency to mislead and deceive buyers into the belief that this cotton fabric consisted wholly or in part of 'silk, and thus induced purchasers to the same belief. Moreover, it found that in its selling the petitioner had paste tickets, hanging tags, hoard ends, and color cards bearing the name \u201cSatinmaid,\u201d and thus misled the buyers into the belief that the fabrics consisted in, whole or in part of silk.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">There are many definitions in the different recognized dictionaries of the word \u201csatin,\u201d hut all substantially holding it to be a silk fabric made of a thick close texture and overshot woof having a glossy surface. Much expert testimony has been adduced as to the meaning of the word \u201csatin,\u201d hut substantially agreeing that it is used in one of two senses to describe any satin woven cloth. But if the word \u201csatin\u201d is not alone used and there be a qualifying phrase which is descriptive of the material, there can be no deception of the public. The fact that the petitioner has trade-marked the word \u201cSatinmaid\u201d and \u201cSatinized\u201d gave it no unlimited sanction to use it when it would deceive. Brougham et al. v. Blanton Mfg. Co., 249 U. S. 495, 39 S. Ct. 363, 63 L. Ed. 725; Federal Trade Comm. v. Kay, 35 F.(2d) 160 (decided Sept. 18, 1929, 7th C. C. A.).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The test of the unfair method of competition was not whether a trade-mark may have been registered, but whether the method of using it falls within the prohibition of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 41-51), which forbids unfair method of competition in commerce and declares it to be unlawful. Any misleading trade-marks and labels used in merchandising a product which misleads the purchasing public is forbidden. Fed. Trade Comm. v. Winsted Hosiery Co., 258 U. S. 483, 42 S. Ct. 384, 66 <em>L. </em>Ed. 729. But the evidence coneededly shows that \u201csatin,\u201d among other things, means the weave of the cloth, and \u2022therefore may be used, with or without additional qualifying words to describe fabrics or cloths woven in the satin weave. Satin may also he used with qualifying words indicating the yam in which the fabne described is woven, and such would not he misleading. Thus used, if the word \u201csatin\u201d makes reference to the weave as well as the yam, and the petitioner makes known that the yam of which the fabric is woven is not silk \u2014 yam usually employed in manufacturing satin \u2014 there can be no deception on or misleading of the public. Where cotton yam is used, reference should be dearly made that it is used. In December, 1925, the parties recognized this by their stipulation, and agreed upon a policy of sale, with a reference to the cotton fabric, as safe to the purchasing public. Silk manufacturers, who have a great interest to prevent the sale of materials as silk made when they are not, define satin as including a weave and a silk-faced fabric. The petitioner has a satin weave, and there can be no deception by the use of the word \u201cSatinmaid\u201d or \u201cSatinized\u201d if it is sufficiently made known that all of the material used is not silk. Thus the petitioner would describe its \u201cSatinmaid\u201d and \u201cSatinized\u201d as a cotton fabric with a satin weave, which, if thus truly made and truthfully displayed and offered to the purchasing public, will not be deceptive. An order which would forbid such merchandising prohibits that which is lawful, and the order to cease and desist entered upon such a basis cannot stand. Fed. Trade Comm. v. Curtis Pub. Co., 260 U. S. 568, 43 S. Ct. 210, 67 L. Ed. 408; Heuser v. Fed. Trade Comm. (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 632. This court has the power, under the statute (U. S. Code, title 15, \u00a7 45 [15 USCA \u00a7 45]), to conform the order to the complaint and findings. Fed. Trade Comm. v. Balme (C. C. A.) 23 F.(2d) 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Accordingly, the order to cease and desist will be modified so as to require the petitioner to cease and desist, directly or indirectly, from using the words \u201cSatinmaid\u201d or \u201cSatinized\u201d or any word or words or combination of words embracing the word \u201csatin\u201d as a trade-name for or to describe or designate a cotton fabric offered for sale or sold in interstate commerce, unless there be added, in letters equally conspicuous and on the same side of the label, advertising matter, wrapper, stationery, or board ends on which the words \u201cSatinmaid,\u201d or \u201cSatinized\u201d appear, the words \u201ca cotton fabric,\u201d \u201ca cotton satin,\u201d \u201cno silk,\u201d or equivalent modifying terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">As thus modified, the order is confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
