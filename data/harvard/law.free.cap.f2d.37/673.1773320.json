They did not question the sufficiency of the indictment by demurrer or otherwise, nor do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>they bring here for review any objection or exception made or taken during the course of the trial; but they contend for the first time on this appeal that the indictment fails to charge an offense, and that they were denied a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The conspiracy count charges that appellants conspired \u201cto smuggle into the United States foreign intoxicating liquors in violation of the Tariff Act of 1922.\u201d The smuggling counts . charge that appellants \u201cdid unlawfully, knowingly and wilfully smuggle and clandestinely introduce into the United States\u201d intoxicating liquor. The remaining counts charge that appellants \u201cdid unlawfully, fraudulently and knowingly receive, conceal and facilitate the transportation and concealment\u201d of intoxicating liquor, with knowledge that it had been imported contrary to law and to regulations of the Treasury Department. It is argued that the indictment is fatally defective, because it fails to charge, substantially in the language of the statute, an intent knowingly and willfully to defraud the revenue of the United States or to smuggle merchandise which should have been invoiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">It is to be conceded that the indictment is inartifieially drawn, but the question is whether it can be attacked after verdict. An indictment which 'contains averments necessary to constitute an offense, but which are stated loosely or without technical accuracy, is- cured by verdict. 2 Bishop\u2019s Cr. Pr. \u00a7 707; 18 USCA \u00a7 556. If the act complained of is in its very nature unlawful, it need not be alleged that it was done unlawfully. Middlebrooks v. United States (C. C. A.) 23 F.(2d) 244. It is unlawful to smuggle merchandise into the United States. The word \u201csmuggling\u201d carries with it the implication of knowledge, and \u201cthe fraudulent taking into a country, or out of it, merchandise which is lawfully prohibited.\u201d Dunbar v. United States, 156 U. S. 185, 15 S. Ct. 325, 328, 39 L. Ed. 390. \u201cThe idea conveyed by it is that of a secret introduction of goods with intent to avoid payment of duty.\u201d United States v. Claflin, Fed. Cas. No. 14,798.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Intoxicating liquor is merchandise, and is required to be invoiced and shown on a vessel\u2019s manifest, although its importation is prohibited by the National -Prohibition Act. United States v. Santini (C. C. A.) 279 F. 534; United States v. Bengochea (C. C. A.) 279 F. 537. The necessary effect of smuggling intoxicating liquor is to defraud the government of any duty imposed on it by law; and a duty is imposed by the Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 897 (19 USCA \u00a7 121, schedule 8). We conclude that the indictment was sufficient to enable appellants to prepare their defense and to protect themselves against a subsequent prosecution, and that the averments as to smuggling contained in it charged an offense. Rosen v. United States, 161 U. S. 29, 16 S. Ct. 434, 40 L. Ed. 606; Gay v. United States (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The contention that appellants were not given a fair trial is based upon assertions that accomplices testified against them pursuant to an understanding with the district attorney, in the hope of getting light sentences, and that the District Judge took part in the examination of those accomplices, and favorably commented upon their testimony in his charge to the jury. It is enough to say that the record fails to show any unfairness at the trial, and, on the contrary, affirmatively discloses that the District Judge was careful to warn the jury to receive the testimony of the accomplices with great caution, and not to convict upon it in the absence of strong corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
