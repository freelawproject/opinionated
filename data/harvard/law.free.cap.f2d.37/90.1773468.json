The insurance policy involved contains a provision that the insolvency or bankruptcy of the assured does not operate to release the insurance company from the payment of damages, and that in ease of a judgment against the insured and return of an execution thereon unsatisfied, \u201can action may be maintained by the injured person * * * against the company under the terms of the poliey for the amount of the judgment,\u201d etc. Applicable also, the parties seem to concede, is a California statute (St. 1919, p. 776) requiring that all policies of this character contain a provision \u201cthat the insolvency or bankruptcy of the person insured shall not release the insurance carrier from the payment of damages for injury sustained or loss occasioned during the life of sueh policy and stating that in ease judgment shall be secured against the insured in an action brought by the injured person * * * then an action may be brought against the company, on the poliey and subject to its terms and limitations, by sueh injured person, * * * to recover on said judgment.\u201d A like policy provision and this statute we have considered in Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Colthurst (No. 5823) 36 F.(2d) 559, decision filed December, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">After the issue was joined, trial by jury Was waived and the case submitted to the court upon a stipulation of the facts. In general, the question presented here is whether the failure or refusal of Gomez to furnish the appellant, the insurance carrier, with a copy of the process served upon him in the original suit, and to authorize it to appear and defend in his behalf, should be held to debar the plaintiff herein from recovering on her judgment against him, and on the policy. In that respect appellant alleged that Gomez failed and refused to forward or deliver to it the summons and complaint although requested by it so to do, and failed and refused to appear or authorize or permit the' entering of an appearance in his behalf by appellant and, though so requested, failed and refused to authorize or consent .to the defense of the action by appellant or its attorney. And the stipulation is to the effeet that these averments are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">It is further stipulated that service of the complaint and summons in the action was made on Gomez on January 12, 1928, and on the same day counsel for the plaintiff mailed to appellant copies of the complaint and summons with the date of service indorsed thereon, all of which appellant received on January 12th. Also that on January 11th the Hertz Drivurself Stations, Inc., one of the companies named as the insured in the poliey, forwarded to appellant copies of the complaint and summons. And it is still further stipulated that appellant was given timely notice of the automobile aeeident. In view of these facts, it is no defense that Gomez did not in person forward copies of the complaint and process. Slavens v. Standard Accident Ins. Co. (C. C. A.) 27 F.(2d) 859, and the Colthurst Case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is predicated upon the requirement that, \u201cIn the event of a claim or suit covered by this policy the Insured shall in no manner aid or abet the claimant but shall co-operate fully with the company, the Royal Indemnity Company, in defense of sueh claim or suit.\u201d In connection therewith is to be considered a further provision under which the insurer agreed in the name and on behalf of the insured to defend all suits for damages upon claims falling within the scope of the poliey.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">The poliey, unusually comprehensive in its coverage, was intended to protect numerous persons of different classes and, owing to the fact that in its preparation a standard form was supplemented and modified by attaching thereto other provisions in the nature of riders, the instrument exhibits no little complexity and a measure of confusion. Generally speaking, the business to which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>relates consists of the renting of automobiles, without drivers, to persons who1 either drive them or independently employ drivers. Apparently there are three parent or principal companies to whom the policy was issued. In paragraph 1 of the \u201cSchedule of Statements,\u201d specifying who are insured, these three concerns are expressly named as Hertz Diivurself Corporation, Hertz Diivurself Sales Corporation, and Hertz Drivurself System, and they together with all their \u201csubsidiary and associated corporations,\u201d it is added, are in the policy \u201csometimes referred to as the \u2018named insured.\u2019 \u201d Under licenses from one or more of these corporations, local companies conduct such business of renting ears, and these are also insured, being specifically designated as \u201clicensees.\u201d Those who rent cars from the local companies are insured and distinctively classified as \u201crenters\u201d; those who for the renters drive cars so rented are protected and designated as \u201cdrivers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Upon an analysis of the entire instrument, we think with reasonable clearness the intent is disclosed to designate all who can claim protection under the policy (excepting only the conditional and limited protection afforded to an injured person) as \u201cinsured,\u201d and in the general class are groups designated as \u201cnamed insured,\u201d \u201clicensees,\u201d \u201crenters,\u201d etc. Hence while a \u201cnamed insured\u201d is necessarily an \u201cinsured,\u201d an \u201cinsured\u201d may not be a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d Under this view Gomez was both a \u201crenter\u201d and an \u201cinsured,\u201d and such contentions made upon behalf of appellee as rest upon the ground that the terms \u201cinsured\u201d and \u201cnamed insured\u201d are synonymous are untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Upon the assumption that Gomez, as we hold, was an \u201cinsured,\u201d it must be conceded, under the facts stipulated, that he violated a material condition of the policy in declining to permit any defense to be made to the action brought against him, by the appellee; and, as we understand, it is not controverted that as a result of the default he forfeited his right to claim indemnity under the policy. That being true, the question remains whether the appellee is in any better position. This question we expressly reserved in the Colt-, hurst Case, supra, but it' now- becomes necessary to decide it. Upon consideration we feel constrained to answer it in the negative. Such is the weight of authority as appears from the citations in the Colthurst Case. And see, also, Coleman v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 247 N. Y. 271, 160 N. E. 367, 369. Speaking of a statute of New York to which the provision of this policy in favor of the injured person conforms, the Court of Appeals of New York in the Coleman Case said: \u201cThe statute was prompted by a definite mischief. * * * Before its enactment; the insolvency of the assured was equivalent in effect to a release of the surety. The policy was one of indemnity against loss \u2022suffered by the principal, and loss to him there was none if he was unable to pay. The effect of the statute is to give to the injured claimant a cause of action against an insurer for the same relief that would be due to a solvent principal seeking indemnity and reimbursement after the judgment had been satisfied. The cause of action is no less but also it is no greater. Assured and claimant must abide by the conditions of the contract.\u201d We see no escape from the reasoning of this and the other eases referred to in which a similar conclusion is reached, and it is equally applicable to the California statute. If tike protection afforded by the statute is inadequate, that is a consideration for the Legislature and not for the eourts.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">It may be added that the duty of the insured in respect of permitting a defense in his name is not susceptible to precise general definition. He is not to be a mere puppet in the hands of the insurer; he is under no obligation to permit a sham defense to be set up in his name, nor can he be expected to verify an answer which he does not believe to be true; he cannot evade personal responsibility, and hence is not bound to yield to any demand which would entail violation \u00f3f any law or ethical principle; but he cannot arbitrarily or unreasonably decline to assist in making any fair and legitimate defense. Here it is stipulated that he declined to permit any defense to be made in his name, and it is to be presumed that the defendant in such a ease could at least legitimately challenge the amount of the alleged damage and require proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Appellee argues that, notwithstanding Gomez\u2019s refusal to defend, the insurance company might have protected itself by intervention. But while intervention might have afforded it a measure of protection, clearly in that position it would be at a disadvantage; and, besides, we are here discussing, not the question whether in spite of Gomez\u2019s default the insurance company could have protected itself, but whether he forfeited his rights by violating a material condition of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The judgment will be reversed, with directions to take further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
