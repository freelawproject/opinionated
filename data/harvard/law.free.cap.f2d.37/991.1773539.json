She has no germ any more. I could stop that but I do not want to stop that because it would not be good for her condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Mrs. Clementine Koon testified that before submitting to treatments by Rubin she made inquiries about bim and went to see Dr. W. E. Pbiles, a duly licensed practicing physician; and also that she saw a letterhead used by Rubiu, containing a copy of a District license to maintain a private hospital \u201cUnder General Management of Prof. B. Rubin. Under Supervision of Dr. W. E. Philes.\u201d She further testified that Rubin was called a doctor, and that he stated that \u201cshe had arthritis and) treated her by dabbing liquid on her whole body with his hand which badly burned her, leaving scars on her body\u201d; that Rubin told her he got the liquid from India. A sister of Mrs. Koon testified that Rubin told her he was a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Mrs. Elizabeth Davis testified that Rubin told her he was a doctor and that he promised to cure her daughter for $300; \u201cthat Rubin made a number of applications of liquid to the body of the child. That he rubbed liquid all over her with his hand, that the child was severely burned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">For the defense, Dr. Philes testified \u201cthat Rubin Health Institute has him, as a physician, and that he was called in for.consultar <em>tion </em>upon occasion when any patient needed medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Other witnesses testified to the effect that Rubin had given them \u201chis massage treatment with his liquid,\u201d and that they had been benefited thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Plaintiff in error contends that his motion for a directed verdict, both at the close of the evidence for the prosecution and at the close of all the evidence, should have beeu granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">The Act of June 3,1896 (29 Stat. 198), makes it a misdemeanor for any person to practice <em>\u201cmeddcme,\u201d </em>or publicly to profess to do so, without a license. In the absence of a definition in tbe statute, we are remitted to the general understanding as to the meaning of the term \u201cpracticing medicine.\u201d Springer v. District of Columbia, 23 App. D. C. 59. \u201cThe practice of medicine is a pursuit very generally known and understood and so also is that of surgery. The former includes the application and use of medicines and drugs for the purpose of curing, mitigating or alleviating bodily diseases. * * *\u201d Smith v. Lane, 24 Hun (N. Y.) 632; Nelson v. State Board of Health, 108 Ky. 769, 57 S. W. 501, 504, 50 L. R. A. 383. There is nothing in the Act of 1896 evidencing a legislative intent that the term \u201cpracticing medicine\u201d should bear other than its common meaning. It will be observed that the Act of February 27, 1929 (45 Stat. 1326), embraces'\u201cthe practice of the healing art,\u201d instead of merely \u201cthe practice of medicine and surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">Under section 12 of the Act of 1896, any person may engage in \u201cthe practice of massage\u201d without a license. The meaning of that term also is left to- common understanding, since the act does not define it. Webster thus defines it: \u201cMassage: A method of treating the superficial soft parts of the body for remedial or hygienic purposes, consisting in rubbing, stroking, kneading, tapping, etc., with tbe band or an instrument; med., to treat by means of massage; to rub or knead; \u25a0as, to <em>massage </em>a patient with ointment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">Having in mind the meaning of the terms \u201cpracticing medicine\u201d and \u201cthe practice of massage,\u201d and that Congress expressly excepted the latter from the provisions of the act, we come now to determine whether under the evidence it can. reasonably be said that Rubin either practiced medicine or publicly professed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">At the outset, it may he observed that he was charged with practicing medicine without a license, and not with fraudulent conduct. No witness testified that Rubin made any examination of persons treated; nor is there any testimony that his treatments amounted to anything more than applying or rubbing \u201csomething like vaseline\u201d over the body; nor is there any evidence that he professed to do more than massage with his ointment. The faet that he called himself a \u201cdoctor\u201d is of little significance, for, as stated by Dr. Philes in his testimony, \u201cthe wprd Doctor does not without an. explanation mean anything in particular as it is used by osteopaths, veterinarians, chiropractors, dentists, athletic instructors and others.\u201d The fact that Rubin \u201cstated to one witness that she had arthritis\u201d is of no par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>tieular significance, in view of the fact that he made no examination of her. It amounted to nothing more than an expression of opinion, and to characterize if as a diagnosis would accord it undue dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">But it is said that Rubin made statements as to the efficacy of his particular kind of massaging. Presumably, when Congress in the Act of 1896 permitted the practice of massaging, both .common and Swedish, without a license, it did so upon the theory that such practice would be beneficial. Rubin had a legal right to practice massaging, and it would be a strained and unreasonable construction of the act to hold that he was without right to express his opinion as to the beneficial results of the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">We conclude that the motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to discharge plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
