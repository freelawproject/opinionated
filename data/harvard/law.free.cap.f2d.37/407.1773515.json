Section 14b(7) Bankruptcy Act as amended by the Act of May 27, 1926 (11 USCA \u00a7 32).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">This ease presents purely a question of fact. The District Court in 37 F.(2d) 403 reviewed the material facts and reached the conclusion that a discharge should be withheld. It would serve no good purpose to again review the facts. It is enough to say that the record supports the conclusion reached by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
