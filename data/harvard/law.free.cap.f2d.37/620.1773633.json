Wrapped around one of the resilient contact tongues is a heating winding connected, in series with the filament. The contact tongues are provided with break contacts of tungsten. When the thermostat is under the direct control of radiation of heat from the filaments, the same will be brought into operation to close the current through the lamp, so that the current is interrupted every few seconds in the break contacts. When, on account of the interrupting current, the thermostat again cools down, the current circuit is again closed, and the filament begins to glow anew. The repetition of these functions produces a flash light result without any external relay devices. It is said that the device may be attached to or used in connection with sadirons, curling irons, soldering irons, cooking plates, and other similar electrical devices, where it is essential that overheating does not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-21\">The five claims are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-22\">\u201c1. An incandescent flash-light lamp having inserted in the hollow cap of the lamp, base a detachable, hermetically closed glass receptacle, and a self interrupting device enclosed in said receptacle and arranged to dose and break the lamp, circuit periodically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-23\">\u201c2. An incandescent flash-light lamp having inserted in the hollow cap of the lamp-base a detachable, hermetically closed evacuated glass receptacle, and a thermostatic switch enclosed in said receptacle and arranged to close and break the lamp circuit periodically, said switch consisting of a bimetallic tongue provided with a heating winding connected in series with the filament.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-24\">\u201c3. An incandescent flash-light lamp having inserted axially in the hollow cap of the lamp base a detachable, hermetically closed evacuated glass receptacle, and a thermostatic switch enclosed in said receptacle and arranged to- dose and break the lamp circuit periodically, said switch consisting of a bimetallic tongue provided with a heating winding connected in series with the filament.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-25\">\u201c4. An incandescent flash-light lamp having inserted in the hollow cap of the lamp base a detaebable hermetically closed evacuated glass receptacle, and a thermostatic switch endosed in said receptacle and arranged to close and break the lamp circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>periodically, said switch consisting of a bimetallic tongue provided with a heating winding connected in series with the filament, and break contacts consisting of tungsten.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\u201c5. An incandescent flash-light lamp having inserted in the hollow cap of the lamp base a detachable, hermetically closed glass receptacle filled with inert gas, and a thermostatic switch enclosed in said receptacle and arranged to close and break the lamp cdreuit periodically.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The claims were rejected on the following references: Phelps, 976,287, November 22, 1910; Houehin, 1,280,227, October 1, 1918; Birbeck, British, 13,156, of 1905; Graham et al., British, 136,101, of 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In this court, appellants call attention to the fact that the Board of Appeals in its decision comments upon the \u201cremovable\u201d feature in the first four claims, and states that there was confusion before the Board concerning the word \u201cdetachable,\u201d and here request that they be allowed to withdraw the \u201cappeal as to all claims except Claim <em>2\u201d </em>and that \u201cthis claim; be considered with this word \u2018detachable\u2019 left out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In the brief of the solicitor for the Patent Office, after stating this .request on the part of appellants, it is said: \u201cWith the approval of the Court, no objection is made.\u201d The solicitor\u2019s brief then proceeds upon the theory that there is but one claim, claim 2, with the word \u201cdetachable\u201d omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">We know of no applicable law or rule of practice to justify the allowance in this court of the amendment of a claim which would substantially change the character of the same from what it was before the Board of Appeals. No such law or practice has been called to our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">It seems to us, however, that, regardless of whether the word \u201cdetachable\u201d is in or out of the claim, the decision of the Board rejecting the five claims must be affirmed. As far as we have been able to observe, every material element in applicant\u2019s device is fully disclosed in the references. Certainly nothing new of a patentable character has been suggested in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Appellants\u2019 counsel, both in brief and argument before this court, has vary earnestly and forcefully urged the patentability of their device on the grounds that it is a new combination of old elements producing new results, which is patentable. Appellants\u2019. learned counsel argues that appellants are the \u201cfirst to have produced a flash-light lamp with enclosed thermostatic switch which has stood the practical test and whieh is actually a commercial lamp that has found an extensive sale. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 This result has been attained by using, in a lamp of the kind in question, a thermostatic switch of a type known, but which heretofore has not been used in this combination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">- It is not contended that either the thermostatic switch, the heating winding device, or the hermetically sealed glass receptacle filled with inert gas, is new. Nor is it contended that the principle of resilient contact tongues is new. It is urged that taking these different known devices and assembling them together in the form of a flash light lamp is such a combination as produces a new result and requires invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">It is a well-settled principle of patent law that a combination of old devices which produces no other result than the sum of the results produced by each of the devices is not patentable. Where a given number of elements, which produce a known result when functioning separately, is assembled, and the assembly produces only a combination of the results found in the individual units, no invention is shown, and amounts to an aggregation. While decreasing or increasing the size of the known units or making a rearrangement of them may produce a valuable and efficiently working mechanism which is conducive to commercial success, this fact does not necessarily suggest invention. If appellant by their assembly or combination have produced a flash light lamp, popular with the public (which probably they have done), they are entitled to a commercial success from its manufacture and sale. Patent law, however, is not alone concerned with use and salability. The law was intended, in part, to stimulate and reward inventive genius. This praiseworthy motive on the part of the Legislature would hardly be promoted by the granting of a monopoly upon a mere aggregation of things already invented or known, when no new inventive genius is displayed.

D. 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
