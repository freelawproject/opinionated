The gear covering at the latter end is of inverted V shape, the upper portion thereof being within the ventilating opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-23\">In one of the figures (3) of the patent to Gray there is a semicircular arrangement of openings in the upper half of the casing, and the patent to Kelley shows the end members also provided with radial openings; those in one of the ends being V-shaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-24\">It appears that openings in dynamo casings of this type are essential as a matter of utilitarian consideration and in any design openings of some character must be provided for purposes of ventilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-25\">' We are unable from our study of the drawings and specifications to see any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>advance over the prior art as shown in the references as to justify our holding that the Board of Appeals was in error in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">It may readily be conceded that applicant has produced a design which is quite distinguishable from those of the references, but it seems to us that the suggestions of the applicable reference features negative any real inventive art, or inventive accomplishment on applicant\u2019s part. We can detect nothing showing that degree of originality which we think would have to be present to justify the granting of a patent as sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
