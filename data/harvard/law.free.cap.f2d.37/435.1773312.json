It further appears that opposer has never used the mark upon any internal remedies adapted to the uses for which applicant\u2019s goods are manufactured, or in fact upon any internal remedies or preparations, but it is argued that since both kinds of goods are largely handled by the same retail dealers or druggists, together with other goods of the same character as those of applicant, confusion of origin would likely result in a. manner which should cause registration to be refused to appellee (applicant), particularly in view of the fact that the numerals \u201c7-11\u201d are the same as three of those in the mark \u201c4711.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-19\">It appears that applicant\u2019s mark \u201c7-11\u201d was first used upon tonic to a very limited extent by his predecessor in business, beginning about 1897, but it was not used to any appreciable extent in interstate commerce prior to 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-20\">An examination of the respective design drawings on file as a part of the record in the case does not show any similarity of arrangement. Opposer\u2019s mark as registered is simply the four numerals, \u201c4711,\u201d except that in No. 9,405 there are several adornments in the nature of designs, arranged in circular inclosures, and also several words, and, in No. 50,-685, the numerals are inclosed in a somewhat circular design; the letters \u201cNo\u201d being so printed in connection with the circular line as to precede the numerals. Applicant\u2019s design consists of the figures 7 and 1, 1, arranged thus: 7-11. These numerals so arranged are on a black background, inclosed within a lozenge-shaped panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-21\">Nevertheless the dominant portion of applicant\u2019s mark appears to be the numerals and they are the same as three of the four numerals which constitute the dominant feature of the mark of opposer. If therefore they were applied to goods of the same descriptive properties, notwithstanding the differences in arrangement and style, we should think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>such confusion might result as to bring the application under the bar of the statute, although there are numerous authorities that seem to support applicant\u2019s insistence to the contrary. However, it does not appear to be important definitely to determine that question in this case, because we think the Commissioner was clearly right in concluding that the goods are not of the same descriptive properties in the sense of the statute. Their appearance and uses are quite different; they are manufactured for and applied to entirely different purposes. It is true that opposer states that certain of his soaps are medicinal in character. Accepting this as true, the fa.et remains that applicant\u2019s tonic is liquid in form and not solid as is the soap. The one is for internal and the other for external use, and they are for the treatment of entirely different ailments or afflictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">It was shown in the case that the numerals \u201c7-11\u201d have been registered in connection with other goods by other persons without opposition by opposer. We would not give undue weight to this fact without a.more careful scrutiny of the goods for which the registrations were made. We take it that opposer did not regard the articles upon which those marks were applied as being of the same descriptive properties with its own articles. Such is our opinion of the materials here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
