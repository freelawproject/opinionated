State, </em>62 Wis.2d 521, 215 N.W.2d 541 (1974), wherein it was stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>strict construction of Sec. 971.20, Stats.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> would deny in many cases the constitutional right to a fair trial because a defendant is unable at the time of arraignment to know what judge is to try his case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 530.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The above quote from the <em>Baldwin </em>case indicates that a defendant has an opportunity to request a substitution of judge for a reasonable period of time after he learns specifically which judge will be assigned to his case. Applying that rationale to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the four defendants are entitled to a reasonable time after assignment to a particular judge becomes known to them in which to request a substitution of such judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Sec. 345.315(1) provides that a substitution request be filed not later than seven days after the return date of the citation. This period should thus be applied to allow seven days after defendants learn of which judge will be hearing their case in which to request a substitution of judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">IT IS ORDERED that a. writ of prohibition issue directing the County Court of Marathon County, the Honorable Joseph Kucirek, presiding, to promptly request assignment of another judge to the proceedings in the four above-captioned traffic regulation cases.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\"> Sec. 971.20 controlled in <em>Baldwin </em>because that case was a criminal prosecution. Sec. 345.315(1) controls the instant case which is a traffic regulation matter. Nonetheless, the rationale underlying the substitution of a judge is the same in both cases \u2014 \u25a0 the constitutional right to a fair trial. Accordingly, what was said in <em>Baldwin </em>applies to the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
