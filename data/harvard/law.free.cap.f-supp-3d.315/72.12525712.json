The Act, however, does not require such parallel litigation in this case because the ELG Rule Amendment approves or promulgates effluent limitations or other limitations within the meaning of Section 1369(b)(1) in at least two ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, the ELG Rule Amendment approves or promulgates \"limitation[s] related to the discharge of pollutants\" by subjecting power plants to different effluent limitations for all five wastestreams implicated by the Indefinite Stay issued in April 2017.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Mfrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616021\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/617/#p625\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs rely heavily on the argument that the Amendment does not create new effluent limitations but rather \"takes existing\n   restrictions that were established by EPA in the 2015 ELG Rule and delays their compliance date by two years.\" Pls.' Reply at 9. But in doing so, the plaintiffs ignore an intervening event-the Indefinite Stay-that changes the relevant status quo ante.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When the ELG Rule Amendment was promulgated, much of the ELG Rule was not in effect; rather, the Stay had\n   <em>\n    indefinitely\n   </em>\n   postponed compliance for five wastestreams. 82 Fed. Reg. at 19,005-06. As a result, under the status quo immediately preceding the Amendment, five wastestreams were not at all subject to \"existing restrictions\" established by the ELG Rule. The Amendment, by withdrawing the Indefinite Stay, limits effluents compared to the status quo ante. In particular, the Amendment (i) imposes December 31, 2023 as the \"no later than\" compliance deadline for bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization, as it had been under the ELG Rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.13\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1)(i) (flue gas desulfurization wastewater), (k)(1)(i) (bottom ash transport water);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2043%2C494\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,496 ; and (ii) imposes effluent limitations initially set by the ELG Rule but indefinitely postponed by the Stay for three other wastestreams: flue gas mercury control wastewater, fly ash transport water, and gasification wastewater,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 43,494 -96. In other words, the ELG Rule Amendment sets \"limitation[s] related to the discharge of pollutants\" that were not in effect on the day before the Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Mfrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616021\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/617/#p625\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the Amendment approves or promulgates limitations related to the discharge of pollutants by revising the ELG Rule. In particular, the Amendment changes the ELG Rule's earliest compliance deadlines for two wastestreams: bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater. 82 Fed. Reg. at 43,496. Under the ELG Rule, the earliest compliance deadlines for those effluent limitations would have been November 1, 2018. Under the Amendment, the earliest deadlines are November 1, 2020.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43,500. Changing a compliance deadline is \"tantamount to amending ... a rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Clean Air Council v. Pruitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275779\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/1/#p6\">\n    862 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (D.C. Cir. 2017). By amending a rule that established effluent limitations, the ELG Rule Amendment revised the limitations and thus set different limitations. This is particularly true because the Amendment, while changing the compliance deadlines, does not free bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater from all limitation until November 1, 2020. Rather, the Amendment subjects the two wastestreams to \"legacy wastewater\" limitations for a longer period of time. Under the ELG Rule, the \"legacy wastewater\" limitations would have applied until the earliest compliance deadlines in 2018. But under the ELG Rule Amendment, power plants must comply with the \"legacy wastewater\" limitations until at least 2020.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this way, the Amendment approves or promulgates different limitations related to the discharge of pollutants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To illustrate, consider a road with a speed limit of forty miles per hour. Changing the road's speed limit sets a new speed limit, and the analysis is no different if the change only affects future compliance deadlines. If a rule (like the ELG Rule) sets twenty miles per hour as a new speed limit that will apply on the road starting in late 2018, and a later rule (like ELG Rule Amendment) revises the compliance deadline to 2020, the later rule sets a different speed limit on that road for the period from late 2018 to 2020: forty miles per hour instead of twenty miles per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In fact, the plaintiffs acknowledge as much. Their proposed amended complaint characterizes the ELG Rule Amendment as \"a revision of the ELG [R]ule's effluent limitations.\" Proposed. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 108-11. And the proposed complaint asserts that the revision was unlawful because the EPA did not make findings required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201314\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which provides \"Effluent limitation guidelines\" for \"adopting or revising effluent limitations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201314\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; Proposed Am.

And due to these differences, the proposed claims assert different causes of action, namely that (1) the Amendment exceeds the EPA's statutory authority under the Clean Water Act, which requires \"compliance with effluent limitations\" \"as expeditiously as possible, but in no case later than three years after the date such limitations are promulgated,\" Proposed Am.

The EPA not only withdrew the Indefinite Stay, but also replaced the Stay with the ELG Rule Amendment. As a result, this case does not present a situation in which the agency voluntarily ceased an informal action but might reinstate the same action at any time. Rather, the EPA deliberated via full notice-and-comment rulemaking, then decided that \"there is no longer any need for the Agency to maintain\" the Stay and formalized that decision by partially changing compliance dates for some wastestreams while imposing compliance dates for other wastestreams as originally set by the ELG Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed.

In a similar case, the D.C. Circuit held moot a challenge to the EPA's decision to waive federal preemption of California's more stringent vehicle standards. After waiving preemption, the EPA promulgated new vehicle standards as stringent as California's. California, no longer needing a waiver to enforce stringent standards, then withdrew its own standards in favor of the EPA's. Holding the case moot, the D.C. Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The prospect that litigants could be injured \"if\" a court were someday to invalidate the federal regulations and \"if\" California thereafter were to reimpose its standards, is little different from the prospect that any litigant could be injured \"if\" EPA (or Congress) were eventually to enact a rule it presently had under consideration.

Opp'n at 10-11. In support, the plaintiffs point to the preamble of the ELG Rule Amendment, which stated: \"If EPA does not complete a new rulemaking by November, 2020, it plans to further postpone the compliance dates such that the earliest compliance date is not prior to completion of a new rulemaking.\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 43,494. It is speculative to conclude, based on the preamble alone, that the EPA will need more than three years from the ELG Rule Amendment to complete its new rulemaking. Indeed, the three-years projection is not guesswork; rather, the EPA calculated that the new rulemaking will take approximately three years by \"reflecting on the time it typically takes the Agency to propose and finalize revised effluent limitations guidelines and standards\" and \"the characteristics of this industry and the anticipated scope of the next rulemaking.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43,498.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   And even if the rulemaking ends up requiring three years, the EPA may not issue a stay like that challenged here. Instead, the EPA may postpone the compliance dates with a notice-and-comment rule, just as it did via the ELG Rule Amendment. And any future stay would likely involve only the two wastestreams currently under reconsideration, not the five wastestreams addressed by the challenged stay, because the ELG Rule Amendment already reinstated deadlines for three of the five wastestreams based on an explicit EPA decision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to reconsider the ELG Rule's requirements for those wastestreams.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed.

The plaintiffs also assert that the EPA might issue stays in the future because the agency has expressed a general intent to review current regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2017%2C793\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 17,793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Apr. 13, 2017). Such examples, however, have little bearing on whether the challenged stay will recur. Isolated invocations of Section 705 to stay other regulations promulgated under other substantive statutes do not indicate that the EPA will again stay the ELG Rule specifically, or even other regulations generally promulgated under the Clean Water Act. And the examples certainly do not indicate that the EPA will stay the particular aspects of the ELG Rule implicated in this case. To the contrary, the EPA decided via the notice-and-comment process that the ELG Rule Amendment made such a stay unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 43,496. As a result, there is not a reasonable expectation that the challenged stay will recur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Turning briefly to the second prong of the \"voluntary cessation\" exception to mootness, intervening events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation. Because the Indefinite Stay was withdrawn and replaced by the ELG Rule Amendment, the Stay is \"now devoid of any legal effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Coal. of Airline Pilots Ass'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5662433,9244622\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/370/1184/\">\n    370 F.3d at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the extent that the plaintiffs suffer any harm from the modified compliance deadlines going forward, the harmful effects will stem from the ELG Rule Amendment, not the withdrawn Stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To resist this conclusion, the plaintiffs conjecture that the withdrawal \"has not alleviated ... the disruptive effects that the [S]tay has had on state and utility implementation of the ELG Rule.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 14. But regardless of whether the Indefinite Stay encouraged states and utilities to delay implementation during summer 2017, the Stay ceased to have that effect when it was withdrawn and replaced in September 2017. Consider the plaintiffs' examples. The plaintiffs assert that the Stay continues to have harmful effects because the state of Nebraska and an Indiana utility cited the Stay in summer 2017 when making compliance decisions regarding the ELG Rule. The extent to which these past compliance decisions would have differed in the absence of the Stay, however, remains entirely speculative. And regardless of whether Nebraska and the Indiana utility modified their behavior based on the Stay, the ELG Rule Amendment requires them to adhere to a different compliance regime, from which any continuing harms will stem. As a result, the ELG Rule Amendment eradicated the effects of the allegedly unlawful stay,\n   and the Court concludes that the \"voluntary cessation\" exception does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   2. Capable of Repetition yet Evading Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Similarly inapplicable is the mootness exception for disputes that are \"capable of repetition yet evade review.\" This exception applies if the plaintiffs show that (1) \"the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration\" and (2) \"there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\"\n   <em>\n    United Bhd. of Carpenters v.

First, the plaintiffs fail to show that the duration of the challenged action was by its nature too short to be fully litigated. In this case, multiple dispositive motions, including cross-motions for summary judgment, were fully briefed before the stay was withdrawn and replaced by the ELG Rule Amendment; the litigation was thus ripe for decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20; Dkt. 32; Dkt. 49.

Second, even if the challenged action were too short to be fully litigated, the plaintiffs fail to show a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again. As discussed above, the EPA is unlikely to subject the plaintiffs to the same stay again.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.1.

In doing so, the Court emphasized that the Rule merely \"announces\" \" 'a definitional rule that clarifies the scope of' the statutory term 'waters of the United States,' \" but \"does not establish any regulatory requirements\" and \"imposes no enforceable duty on any state, local, or tribal governments, or the private sector.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616021\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/617/#p625\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616021\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/617/#p625\">\n     at 626, 628\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting 80 Fed.
