Rather, the Fourth Amendment still governs public workplaces, protecting most employees against random, suspicionless drug testing while on the job. The District of Columbia nevertheless instituted such a regime for its new\n   Consolidated Forensics Laboratory, a facility that houses several law-enforcement agencies. It gave Plaintiff Patricia Lewis, a human-resources liaison in that office, two choices: submit to testing or be fired. Lewis chose the latter course, and when the District dismissed her, she responded with this lawsuit. The case ultimately proceeded to trial, where a jury resolved all contested facts in her favor and awarded her $802,800. Unhappy with this result, the District now moves for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, asks the Court to either order a new trial or reduce Lewis's damages. The Court will deny the Motion across the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Here, the Court had previously identified the two predicate facts necessary to decide Fourth Amendment reasonableness as a matter of law: (1) whether Lewis would have access to confidential information in the CFL (beyond those personnel files to which she previously had access); and (2) if so, whether the District could have practically addressed its concern through alternative means.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522618\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/169/#p190\">\n    282 F.Supp.3d at 186, 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It therefore submitted a special-verdict form to the jury encompassing both questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While the District objected to the jury instructions during trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   JMOL at 15 n.4, it no longer maintains that the use of a special-verdict form was improper\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . Instead, its complaint is more technical: \"[R]egardless of whether the reasonableness of the search under the Fourth Amendment is to be determined by the Court or the jury,\" it says, \"the Court did not make a specific finding\" that the policy was unreasonable in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JMOL at 9, 11. On the contrary, the Court repeatedly made clear that reasonableness would hinge on Lewis's level of access. In its prior Opinion, it stated unequivocally that if \"Plaintiff could ... not enter other key areas of the lab, the city's interest in preventing corruption\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   outweigh her privacy interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522618\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/169/#p190\">\n    282 F.Supp.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Even were that holding ambiguous, the Court reiterated the same point when proposing its jury instructions to counsel. It stated, on the record, that its \"prior opinions\" had \"made the determination on reasonableness [that] if there is access by the plaintiff to the sensitive and confidential material then the testing would be reasonable, but if there isn't, then it's not.\" Trial Tr. (Mar. 15, 2018) at 9:22-10:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court instructed the jury as much. It explained that Lewis was challenging the District's \"suspicionless drug-testing policy [as] a[n] unreasonable search of her person.\" Trial Tr. (Mar. 16, 2018) at 10:19-25. It then explained that to \"prevail on this claim\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to prove the District's policy was an unreasonable search-Lewis must prove by a preponderance of evidence that either:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) \"Upon moving to the new CFL, she would not have had access to confidential and sensitive information within OCME (beyond the personnel and employment files she previously could access)\"; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) \"If she would have had such access, the District could have practically addressed its confidentiality and secruity concerns through alternative means.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:1-10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 80.

As it acknowledges, \"With a special verdict, the jury's sole function is to determine the facts; the jury needs no instruction on the law because the court applies the law to the facts as found by the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11360631\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/1271/#p1274\">\n    307 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1274 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JMOL at 10. The only problem here, according to the District, was that the \"balancing [test] was not later performed by either the jury or the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. To the extent there is any confusion, the Court can easily repeat the balancing test as a matter of law now-after all, it is \"the\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   [that] applies the law to the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11360631\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/1271/#p1274\">\n    307 F.3d at 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lest there be any doubt, it therefore holds that the scales tip in Lewis's favor.

Until now, however, the city never disputed that question, nor could it seriously do so.

In \"accordance\" with that order, DCHR so designated all employees moving to the CFL,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Exh. 5 at 2. Finally, on January 3, 2013, Lewis received a letter notifying her that she was being \"remove[d] ... for cause\" due to \"neglect of duty and insubordination.\" Pl. Exh. 11. More specifically, it informed her that she had \"failed to comply with the requirement stated\" on the District's Drug and Alcohol Testing form, and that her behavior \"serves as a violation of Mayor's Order 2012-84 and the ...

From there, causation is equally straightforward. In this case, the constitutional violation occurred when DCHR insisted that Lewis submit to a suspicionless drug test. Those officials had not gone rogue. Rather, they acted pursuant to a Mayor's Order and, then, an Emergency Act. Indeed, far from contesting this point during trial, the District emphasized it repeatedly.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr.

More specifically, she explained that the agency's most sensitive departments, such as death investigations and autopsies, were located on the fifth floor, and Lewis would have no key-card access to that area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85:22-25; 88:7-24. Instead, she could only access the sixth floor, which housed toxicology, fatality review, and administrative staff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86:6-8, 87:13-22. Even within that space, the Toxicology Department was \"[c]ompletely separated,\" secured by separate key-card access.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86:23-25. Meanwhile, \"[e]verything\" within the Fatality Review section \"was under lock and key.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:21;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The District tries to paint Dr. Pierre-Louis's testimony as more equivocal, latching onto her concession during cross that it would not be \"impossible\" for Lewis to access secured areas of the CFL.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101:5. While Pierre-Louis acknowledged, as the age-old axiom teaches, that \"[n]othing is impossible,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 101:6, she stressed that \"the only way [Lewis] would have access to [those areas] would be that someone else introduced her into\" them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101:3-4. Such \"access\" is no access at all. At the summary-judgment stage, the District posited that Lewis would \"have had clearance to enter all divisions,\" and this \"unbridled access\" required \"blanket random drug testing.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522618\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/169/#p190\">\n    282 F.Supp.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). By contrast, had the District asserted only that Lewis might have gained\n   <em>\n    supervised\n   </em>\n   entry into sensitive areas, the Court would have rejected that weak interest out of hand. After all, the city's professed fear was that Lewis might, for instance, steal or \"misplace[ ] evidence\" or otherwise contaminate \"samples.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522618\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/169/#p190\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). It seems farfetched, however, that even a drug-addled employee could do so with a co-worker looking over her shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Next, the District makes much of the fact that \"plaintiff's workstation would have been in the fatality review section, where sensitive and confidential non-public information is handled.\" JMOL at 18. True, Pierre-Louis acknowledged that Lewis's office within the CFL would be \"close\" to Fatality Review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. (3/12) at 88:1-3. She repeatedly emphasized, however, that those files, \"as they were at 1910 [Massachusetts], were locked.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:6-8;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 88:1-5. Indeed, Pierre-Louise testified that Lewis actually had \"less access\" to Fatality Review than at the old building, as she previously walked through that unit on a daily basis just to arrive at her desk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111:8-14 (describing her as \"more separated from [Fatality Review] than she was at 1910\"). The jury therefore had no reason to assume she \"would [ ] have had access to confidential and sensitive information within OCME (beyond the personnel and employment files she\n   <em>\n    previously\n   </em>\n   could access\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, the District alludes to testimony by Beverly Fields, the OCME chief of staff who claimed to \"run[ ] the agency.\" Tr. (3/15) at 88:18. Fields testified that \"Lewis [would] have had access to secured areas,\" such as the Mortuary Division, Toxicology Division, and Investigation Division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112:5-9;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:3-11. She also maintained, however, that Lewis would have had the same \"level of access at the Massachusetts Avenue facility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:12-14. If so, the move to the CFL would provide little reason to institute a new drug-testing regime. In any event,\n   Fields's testimony directly contradicted Pierre-Louis's statement that Lewis would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have access to confidential information,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. (3/12) at 89:15-19, and \"[r]esolving such conflicting [testimony] is precisely the type of function [courts] leave to the jury, not to a judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

Cir. 2016). The jury here had ample reason to side with Pierre-Louis, as she, rather than Fields, made the final decisions regarding access.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. (3/12) at 53:11-17; 88:20-89:5.

It asks the Court for a new trial or to reduce the damages, claiming that the award of $802,800 was excessive. The Court may grant a new trial only when it \"is convinced the jury verdict was a 'seriously erroneous result' and where denial of the motion will result in a 'clear miscarriage of justice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nyman v.

Economic Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The District first attacks the jury's award of economic damages, which totaled $499,800. At trial, Lewis pegged her economic loss at precisely that figure, based on five years of lost wages and benefits since her termination on April 9, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. (3/13) at 113:1-114:22 (explaining expected salary, as well as five-percent contributions to her retirement account). Though Defendant did little to dispute those calculations at trial, it now argues that Lewis would have retired when she became eligible for Social Security, thereby reducing her total lost wages. While Plaintiff did testify to that effect, she left open the possibility that she might retire either at age 66 or 67.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 151:1-7. If the former, she would have retired on April 3, 2017 (her 66th birthday), and been owed less than five years of damages. The latter date, by contrast, would accrue the full five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The District now cites evidence that Lewis would have been eligible for full retirement pay at age 66.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JMOL at 22 &amp; n.5. The problem, however, is that it never presented such evidence at\n   <em>\n    trial\n   </em>\n   , despite prompting from the Court. When proposing jury instructions, the Court expressly raised the issue of wage calculations, noting Lewis's testimony \"that she wanted to work until she was 66 or 67.\" Tr. (3/15) at 5:16-19. It allowed Plaintiff to argue for the full five years but reminded both parties that \"[t]he District, of course, can argue that ... she testifed [that] she only wanted to work five years past July 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:21-25. The District did not object, and while it briefly noted the discrepancy in closing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. (3/16) at 40:2-5, it never substantiated that argument with evidence. The jury was thus free to award Lewis the full amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant more forcefully argues that Lewis failed to\n   <em>\n    mitigate\n   </em>\n   damages, as is required under section 1983.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JMOL at 19-20 (citing\n   <em>\n    Meyers v.

As the District's own citations make clear, however, \"once the plaintiff has presented evidence of damages, the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   has the burden of establishing a failure to properly\n   mitigate damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531240\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1115/#p1119\">\n    14 F.3d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Indeed, she offered compelling testimony to the contrary. She explained that to find \"substantially equivalent positions,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531240\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1115/#p1119\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531240\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1115/#p1119\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   she searched \"public sector employment, specifically human resource jobs.\" Tr. (3/13) at 110:15-17. Each of those job applications, however, asked expressly whether she had previously been terminated, and, if yes, to explain why.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110:17-22. That disclosure would not only be personally embarrassing, but Lewis testified it would be a death knell to her application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110:25-111:10 (explaining that in her own role as an HR employee, she \"would not adjudicate that information favorably\"). That is true regardless of whether, as the District argues, it would have reported her refusal to submit to a drug test. Even were the city mum, Lewis would still need to self-disclose the cause for her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The District, of course, was free to contradict Plaintiff's testimony, such as by introducing its own expert to testify about \"the number and availability of HR jobs in the public and [even] private sectors.\" Pl. Opp. at 20. It chose not to do so; indeed, it surprisingly offered\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   affirmative evidence regarding mitigation. It thus falls far short of meeting \"its burden of establishing failure to mitigate.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531240\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1115/#p1119\">\n    14 F.3d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without more, the Court has no basis to reduce the award to the requested $125,000, much less order a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    2. Non-Economic Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The District last challenges the jury's non-economic damages award of $303,000, claiming the Court should award it a new trial or, at least, \"reduce the award of non-economic damages to no more than $50,000.\" JMOL at 25. The Court treads cautiously in considering that request, as it \"must be especially hesitant to disturb a jury's determination of damages in cases involving intangible and non-economic injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Langevine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703544,7652794\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/1018/\">\n    106 F.3d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The city focuses primarily on the\n   <em>\n    fiscal\n   </em>\n   consequences of Plaintiff's job loss, including her testimony that she could no longer afford to cook gourmet meals, go to the movies, travel to see relatives, or pay her son's college tuition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JMOL at 23-24. It overlooks, however, her extensive testimony about the\n   <em>\n    psychological\n   </em>\n   consequences of being fired. First, she testified that she was forced to work for months in an isolated building, with inadequate security, no heating, and a pervasive rodent problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr.

Second, she presented evidence that the District had posted her photo outside the new CFL, broadcasting her refusal to submit to a drug test for all to see.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104:5-25 (testifying the poster was \"like [she] had been placed on the FBI's most wanted list\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   She also testified to her anguish at being dismissed after an unblemished thirty-five-year career, as well as her inability to support her family.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:3-9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:7-12. Multiple family members similarly\n   testified that after her termination, Lewis became \"depressed.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 172:3-9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 179:14-16. Once a \"vibrant spirit,\" she \"lost the desire to be in the world and exist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 186:14-22. She also let her appearance become \"disheveled\" and lost interest in activities she once loved, such as \"attend[ing] church\" on a weekly basis with her family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172:4-17. Lewis's sister testified that she \"almost stopped eating\" altogether.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The District dismisses this behavior as \"Lewis's own decision to 'self-isolate,' \" JMOL at 25, but that does little more than blame the victim. She became reclusive\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   the District fired her, and the jury was entitled to compensate her for such emotional harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The District's comparator cases, meanwhile, are not to the contrary. It cites\n   <em>\n    Nyman\n   </em>\n   , a case in which the court reduced a $300,000 award to $175,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"500539\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/967/1562/#p1569\">\n    967 F.Supp. at 1572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That case, however, is readily distinguishable. As an initial matter,\n   <em>\n    Nyman\n   </em>\n   was decided two decades ago, and the inflation-adjusted value of $175,000 approaches the $303,000 awarded here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n   <em>\n    CPI Inflation Calculator\n   </em>\n   (last accessed May 30, 2018),\n   <em>\n    available\n   </em>\n   at https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm. The plaintiff there, moreover, sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a, which had a statutory cap of $300,000. Anchored by that number, the court thought the \"maximum amount recoverable under the applicable cap ... should be reserved for the most egregious cases of unlawful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Nyman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"500539\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/967/1562/#p1569\">\n    967 F.Supp. at 1572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, unlike in this case, the plaintiff \"did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   lose her employment\" as a result of the defendant's retaliatory conduct, and the court adjusted her damages accordingly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"500539\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/967/1562/#p1569\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).
