Indeed, Individual Defendants have knowledge of what transpired between themselves and Plaintiff; the Government might seek their input before making any production pursuant to Plaintiff's requests. Individual Defendants even may\n   <em>\n    want\n   </em>\n   to review the Government's discovery responses, notwithstanding their objection to discovery proceeding against either the Government or themselves, because the Court's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   rulings mean that they could be held personally liable in this action. As Defendants observe, \"[t]he discovery sought against the United States would be freely transferable against and almost certainly used to establish a factual record against the Individual Defendants.\" Defs.'

The likelihood that Individual Defendants would be asked or invited to review discovery responses prior to the D.C.

The Fifth Circuit recognizes that \"[t]he district court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   compel discovery disclosures\" concerning claims not subject to qualified immunity assertions, rather than that the district court must always do so.\n   <em>\n    Alice L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507582\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/563/#p565\">\n    492 F.3d at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The First Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lugo\n   </em>\n   was based on appellant's having already engaged in discovery prior to seeking a stay thereof, and on certain considerations focused on the equitable relief sought alongside damages.\n   <em>\n    Lugo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710220\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/5/#p7\">\n    819 F.2d at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such discovery has been taken by Defendants here, and Plaintiff seeks only damages. Mindful of other courts' discretion to manage their own cases, this Court shall exercise its own discretion to manage this one in light of Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff should not have proceeded with discovery prior to the Initial Scheduling Conference that the Court had already scheduled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order of Dec. 11, 2017. As with his prior attempt to initiate discovery, Plaintiff's current total of thirty requests for production exceeds the Court's standard limitation to twenty-five requests, of which Plaintiff previously was advised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. 70, at 7 (discussing Court's presumptive limit). The Court would have considered, at the Initial Scheduling Conference, any argument for an exception to its presumptive limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The current iteration of the requests for production is once more so \"far-reaching\" that \"it is almost certain that Defendants will seek to litigate its scope,\" Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. 70, at 7, particularly as to requests that arguably invite Individual Defendants' review of any response.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Mot. at Ex. 1 \u00b6 4 (\"All documents and communications relating to allegations or investigations of racial bias or retaliatory conduct involving the OCC\n   <em>\n    or the Individual Defendants\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added) ). Any attempt to resolve such disputes during the pending interlocutory appeal-which may trench on jurisdictional boundaries discussed above-would ultimately waste the Court's and the parties' resources if they must revisit discovery disputes after the D.C. Circuit's resolution of the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   and qualified immunity issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute that his discovery requests touch on the interests of Individual Defendants. Rather, he argues that case-dispositive motions are no longer pending, as they were when the Court previously granted a stay, nor does the proposed discovery seek more than documents, unlike the depositions at issue in some of the case law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Opp'n at 3-4, 9-10. Plaintiff also seems to suggest that Individual Defendants would be involved in discovery anyway even if they are found immune from liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710220\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/5/#p7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710220\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/5/#p7\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Galarza v.

Feb. 28, 2012) ). None of these factors truly mitigates the concerns described above with premature involvement of potentially immune individuals, whose role in this case conceivably would differ if a D.C. Circuit decision renders them non-party witnesses,\n   rather than defendants at risk of liability. Any discovery now almost certainly would need to be revisited after the D.C. Circuit's decision, regardless of whether it is in Individual Defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Beyond the passage of time, Plaintiff's claim of prejudice is limited to \"the risk that critical evidence will be lost and witnesses' memories will fade.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. However, this issue arises whenever there is a reason to postpone discovery. The Court presumes that the parties long ago instituted litigation holds triggering the retention of documents relevant to this matter. But even if they did not, this latest stay is unlikely to make the difference for documents generated up to two decades ago.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 (discussing factual background from late 1990s through 2012 filing of this case). The Court previously articulated why it should pause for the resolution of \"important legal questions\" in this case. Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. 70, at 7-8. A variety of such questions have been important at different stages of this case; currently the key issues are the availability of the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim and certain Individual Defendants' alleged immunity thereto. Despite the Court's own determination of those questions, now the D.C. Circuit's view has been invited once again in this case. \"The Court finds that any prejudice to Plaintiff in delaying the commencement of discovery is outweighed by the necessity of [awaiting the D.C. Circuit's] resol[ution] [of] the 'threshold immunity questions' before permitting discovery to commence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194865\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/800/#p818\">\n    457 U.S. at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194865\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/800/#p818\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
