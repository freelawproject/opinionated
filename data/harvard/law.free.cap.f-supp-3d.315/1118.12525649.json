Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 13. In 2011, Armas refinanced the original mortgage through a mortgage loan with defendant Fifth Third Bancorp.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. In 2013, Armas moved to California, but kept the Minnesota home as a rental property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. In July 2015, Fifth Third contacted Armas and notified him that the payment for that month was overdue and that the monthly payment had increased due to a change in his escrow payment amount.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. On July 30, Armas made a $2,500 payment on the loan, which included the monthly mortgage payment plus a late fee ($2,315.68) and an additional $184.32.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Thereafter, Armas made monthly payments of at least $2,250, which he believed covered his monthly payment plus an additional amount to be applied toward the principal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 15, 2016, one day before the payment was due, Armas contacted Fifth Third to see how much he owed that month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Fifth Third told him that he owed $2,433.24, but did not inform him that his account was in arrears.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Armas made the January payment in full and thereafter made monthly payments in the amount of $2,250 through October 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2016, Armas contacted Fifth Third to obtain a tax statement for his 2015 taxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Fifth Third told him that his account was in arrears and that the house had been sold to defendant Freddie Mac in a foreclosure sale on May 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 47. Fifth Third fully refunded Armas's post-foreclosure mortgage payments in December 2016 in the amount of $27,066.76.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because Armas had not provided his forwarding address to Fifth Third, the bank sent the foreclosure notice and related documents to the Lino Lakes address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. The renters apparently did not forward those documents to Armas.

Specifically, in August 2015, the payments increased from $2,236.27 to $2,433.24 per month, but Armas continued to pay $2,250 per month.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20508.02\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20508.02\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 27, 36-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the terms of the mortgage, Fifth Third holds insufficient payments in a suspense account without applying them to the mortgage loan until the bank receives funds that equal a full mortgage payment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20508.02\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20508.02\">\n    \u00b6 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Sater Aff.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 40. Armas does not deny, however, that his account was perpetually in arrears beginning in September 2015 and was never made current.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20508.02\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20508.02\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 42-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 19, 2017, Armas filed suit against defendants in Anoka County, and defendants timely removed.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). The court may, however, consider matters of public record and materials that are \"necessarily embraced by the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Porous Media Corp. v.

Here, the court will consider the mortgage and note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Wrongful Foreclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Armas asserts that the foreclosure sale should be voided because Fifth Third waived the right to default by accepting monthly payments during the foreclosure process and for several months after the foreclosure sale. Fifth Third argues that it is entitled to dismissal of this claim because the mortgage allows it to receive payments during and after the foreclosure and expressly states that such acceptance does not constitute a waiver. The court agrees with Fifth Third.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The mortgage provides that Fifth Third \"may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such\n   payment or partial payments in the future ....\" Salter Aff. Ex. A \u00a7 1. Thus, the fact that Fifth Third accepted partial payment from Armas did not prohibit it from proceeding with foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Armas attempts to sidestep the mortgage's non-waiver provision by citing to cases in which courts have held that post-foreclosure payments effectively waive the sale. Those cases are inapposite, however. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Hayes-Broman v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4107644\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/724/1003/#p1007\">\n    724 F.Supp.2d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007 (D. Minn. 2010), the mortgagor and mortgagee reached agreement during the redemption period that allowed the homeowner to regain ownership of the property. The court held that \"by negotiating an agreement with [the mortgagee] to pay off the mortgage, Plaintiff asserted her interest in the Property and [the mortgagee] reflected its intent to restore Plaintiff's interest in the property[,]\" thus voiding the foreclosure sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4107644\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/724/1003/#p1007\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4107644\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/724/1003/#p1007\">\n    at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is no post-foreclosure agreement between the parties altering their relationship as set forth in the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Armas's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Brack v. Brack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"223210\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/218/503/\">\n    218 Minn. 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20N.W.2d%20557\">\n    16 N.W.2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944) is likewise unavailing. In\n   <em>\n    Brack\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the lender's agreement to accept partial payments waived any contractual right to declare default.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20N.W.2d%20557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20N.W.2d%20557\">\n    at 560-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the contract in\n   <em>\n    Brack\n   </em>\n   did not include an anti-waiver provision as does the instant mortgage. And, unlike the lender in\n   <em>\n    Brack\n   </em>\n   , Fifth Third never agreed that Armas's partial payments were sufficient to meet his obligations under the mortgage. Indeed, the mortgage provides to the contrary: \"[Fifth Third] may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current ... but ... is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are accepted.\" Salter Aff. Ex. A \u00a7 1. Therefore, given the circumstances of this case, Fifth Third did not waive its right to foreclose by receiving or accepting Armas's partial payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Further, Minnesota law allows a mortgagor the opportunity to redeem the property following foreclosure by paying the amount in arrears plus interest within six months of the sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20580.23\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 580.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   subdiv. 1. Because the law contemplates that payments may be made following the foreclosure sale, the court cannot conclude that Fifth Third's receipt of those payments constitutes a waiver of its right to foreclose. Doing so would undermine the purpose of the redemption statute. As a result, the wrongful foreclosure claim fails as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Armas next contends that Fifth Third breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by stockpiling his payments in the suspense account rather than applying them to the loan. The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Every contract under Minnesota law, \"includes an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requiring that one party not unjustifiably hinder the other party's performance of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hennepin Cty. 1986 Recycling Bond Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10705082\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/540/494/#p502\">\n    540 N.W.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 502 (Minn. 1995) (internal\n   quotation marks and citation omitted).

To state a quiet-title claim, a plaintiff must state facts sufficient to allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that he or she is in possession of property and that a defendant claims a right or title to the property but has no such right or title.\"\n   <em>\n    Haubrich v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-565,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203612023\">\n    2012 WL 3612023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Minn. Aug. 21, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Armas's quiet-title claim is based on the allegations already considered and rejected by the court. Am. Compl. \u00b6 95. Further, Armas has not established that he is in possession of the property-a prerequisite for bringing a quiet title action.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.01\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 559.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, according to the amended complaint, Armas has not lived in the house since December 2013, and Freddie Mac evicted his tenants in January 2017. Am Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 51. As a result, the court must also dismiss the quiet-title claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, based on the above,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1. The motion to dismiss the amended complaint [ECF No. 29] is granted; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2. The case is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The court will refer to plaintiffs in the singular for ease of reference.

Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66. To the extent that claim is also based on the assertion that Armas was not actually in default,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20580.041\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20580.041\">\n     \u00b6 67\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , it still fails.
