Notwithstanding defendants' arguments that FAQ 33 is merely the \"type of workaday advice letter that agencies prepare countless times per year in dealing with the regulated community\" that \"is not binding on the agencies or on third parties,\" Defs.' Summ. J. Mem., ECF No. 25-1 at 10-11, the Court finds that FAQ 33 effects a substantive change in existing law. As explained above, FAQ 33 modifies the formula for calculating the hospital-specific limit in a manner not provided for by any prior rule or statutory source.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, FAQ 33 \"is irreconcilable with a prior legislative rule\" and thus \"the second rule must be an amendment of the first.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

As discussed above, the 2008 Rule clearly defines what is included in calculating \"uncompensated care costs.\"\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   III.A.2. Thus, FAQ 33, which alters the calculation of the hospital-specific limit, effectively amends the 2008 Rule.

Defs.' Summ J. Mem., ECF No. 26-1 at 15. This argument is flawed in at least two respects: first, the phrase \"uncompensated care costs\" is used as a term of art to refer to costs as previously defined in the statute under subsection (g), and second, the term \"uncompensated costs\" is specifically defined otherwise in the 2008 Rule.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section III.A.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Defendants also point to a 2002 letter from CMS to state Medicaid agencies as further evidence that defendants' interpretation that the Medicaid Act requires subtraction of third-party insurance payments is \"longstanding and consistent.\" Defs.'

As an initial matter, the 2002 letter is not a legislative rule promulgated through appropriate notice-and-comment procedures, but rather interpretive guidance of the governing statute. Thus, the 2002 letter would suffer from the same procedural deficiencies as FAQ 33 and therefore cannot provide a legal basis for the defendants' policy. Moreover, even if the 2002 letter did support defendants' interpretation as embodied in FAQ 33, the letter conflicts with the plain text of the 2008 Rule, which was promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Defendants also argue that \"considerations of equity\" support denying plaintiffs' requested relief.
