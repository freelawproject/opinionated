He contends that all of these communications show that the Dean \"made sure the FERC subcommittee was keenly aware of her opposition to [his] tenure bid, well before she exercised any formal role in the process,\" and that the Dean had prejudged his application before the subcommittee had issued its report. Pl.'s Opp. at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While this evidence may reveal that the Dean had concerns about plaintiff's application before the subcommittee issued its recommendation, none of it demonstrates that the Dean's reservations about the plaintiff were racially motivated, and it does not supply grounds for a jury to conclude that the school's stated reasons for denying plaintiff's tenure application\n   were pretextual. Rather, the evidence shows that the Dean identified other legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for her recommendation against tenure: concerns with plaintiff's teaching and service, the other two criteria considered in the tenure review process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standards and Procedures at 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The fact that the Dean had her own view about whether plaintiff satisfied these criteria is not evidence of discriminatory intent. The Standards and Procedures require that the \"Dean will prepare a separate evaluation of the applicant's teaching, scholarship, and service\" and that she will ultimately make a recommendation relying on both her own \"independent evaluation\" of plaintiff and the FERC's written report and recommendation. Standards and Procedures at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Further, the record does not indicate that the Dean's comments influenced the subcommittee or the FERC recommendation. FERC members were aware that the Dean was concerned about plaintiff's teaching and service, but the committee denied his application based on its assessment of scholarship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subcomm. Report. Thus, even if the Dean's criticisms of plaintiffs use of teaching assistants or service were unfair, as plaintiff asserts, Pl.'s Opp. at 13, the FERC specifically found that plaintiff satisfied the teaching and service standards and based its recommendation on its independent review of plaintiffs application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Evidence of the Dean's Statements about Plaintiff to the Provost\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff does not suggest that the Provost or University President harbored any bias against the plaintiff based on his race. He argues, though, that the Provost's decision was improperly tainted by the Dean's recommendation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court has recognized that in some circumstances, an employer can be liable for discrimination even in the absence of racial bias on the part of the ultimate decision maker if that decision was prompted by an unlawful recommendation made by a lower level supervisor. Under what has been called the \"cat's paw\" theory of discrimination, a plaintiff must show that \"a supervisor performs an act motivated by [discriminatory] animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and ... that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate [adverse] action.\"\n   <em>\n    Staub v.

Moreover, the evidence of proximate cause is weak given the Provost's own assessment of the application and the recommendations presented to him. To support his cat's paw theory of discrimination and his claim that the Dean played a significant role \"both below and above her formal role in the process,\" plaintiff asserts without citation to the record that the Dean discussed two other tenure applications-for Professors [redacted] and [redacted]-with the then-Provost Graeme Baxter before that Provost rejected their applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 34. But he cites no evidence that the Dean discussed\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   application with Provost Ken Bain, who was Provost when plaintiff's application was under review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff complains that defendant presented no evidence that the Provost or President independently reviewed his application, and he asserts that any tenure applicants the Dean opposes do not receive tenure. Pl.'s Opp. at 34. But plaintiff points to no evidence to dispute the Provost's statement that he conducted his own review of \"the complete application for tenure of Professor Kemit Mawakana; examples of his scholarly writing; the report submitted by the [FERC]; the recommendation of Dean Shelley Broderick ...; and the response from Professor Mawakana to the FERC report,\" and that he \"found no compelling reason\" to overrule the recommendations of the FERC or the Dean. Provost's Tenure Recommendation, Def.'s Ex. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, plaintiff argues that \"a jury could rationally believe that the recommendation of a Dean who had been running the law school for more than 15 years carried substantial weight.\" Pl.'s Opp. at 34. That is not disputed. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 25(b)-(c). But that circumstance does not make the organization liable under\n   <em>\n    Staub\n   </em>\n   unless there is evidence from which a jury could conclude that the Dean's recommendation was itself racially motivated. So even if a jury could fairly concluded that the Dean's recommendation was the proximate cause of the decisions that followed, plaintiff has not come forward with sufficient evidence to establish a Title VII violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Plaintiff contends that defendant's failure to grant tenure to him and to two other African-American professors at a time when it promoted white professors with \"weak records of scholarship,\" Pl.'s Opp. at 1-2, demonstrates \"a wealth of 'third party' evidence of disparate treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.

Pl.'s Opp. at 28, 33. [redacted] So there is evidence of one other African-American professor whose appointment the Dean opposed, but her view was shared by [redacted] members of the FERC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff next asserts that Professor # 2 [redacted] was the subject of racial discrimination by the Dean. Pl.'s Opp. at 16-18. [redacted] the Dean recommended Professor # 2 for tenure. Dean's Tenure Recommendation for [redacted] Def.'s Ex. 86. So this set of facts hardly constitutes an example of an adverse action by the Dean based on race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff disputes that the Dean supported Professor # 2 tenure application,\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 165, but the Dean's December 8, 2009 recommendation letter to the Provost plainly demonstrates otherwise: \"I am writing to endorse, unequivocally, the unanimous recommendation of the [FERC] that the University award tenure to Professor # 2 Memorandum from Katherine Broderick to Graeme Baxter (Dec. 8, 2009), Def.'s Ex. 86. It was Provost Graeme Baxter, not the Dean, who later recommended denying tenure.

[redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   These conclusory statements of opinion are the only evidence of possible discriminatory intent in the record, but none of it is evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of Dean Broderick, and none of it relates to the plaintiff. And more importantly, the situations are not analogous because both Professor # 1 and Professor # 2 received a positive recommendation for tenure from at least one of the five levels of tenure review, while plaintiff received none.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FERC Report and Recommendation to Grant Tenure to Professor Professor # 1 Def.'s Ex. 77; FERC [redacted] Tenure Recommendation and Report Regarding Professor Professor # 2 Def.'s Ex. 82; Subcomm.Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff contrasts the denial of tenure for Professor # 1, Professor # 2, and himself with the grant of tenure to three white professors: Professor # 3, Professor # 4, and Professor # 5. Pl.'s Opp. at 20-23. [redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The problem is that all of this evidence invites the Court to weigh in on the merits of the University's academic judgments in a manner that is contrary to the legal principles governing these disputes. More important, even if plaintiff had come forward with compelling and less conclusory evidence contrasting the white professors' scholarship to his, the comparison is of little utility in proving that plaintiff was discriminated against. While plaintiff's materials were reviewed by one set of University officials, the other professors' tenure applications were reviewed by different subcommittee members, and a different Provost and University President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 23-24; Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 94, 127-29, 136, 138-39, 143, 147-48, 168-72; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 94, 127-29, 136, 138-39, 143, 147-48, 168-72. As other courts in this district have observed, for comparator evidence to be useful, plaintiff must point to a similarly situated employee who was treated more favorably by the same deciding official.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sledge v.

Here, the difference in the evaluators undermines the probative value of the comparison. And while the Dean is the one constant in the tenure process, plaintiff has presented no evidence of discriminatory intent on her part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, although [redacted]o, [redacted] professor # 2, and plaintiff were denied tenure, and plaintiff can point to three white professors he considers unworthy, the record indicates that seven out of eighteen, or 38.88%, of the professors who\n   were awarded tenure since 1995, have been African American. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 10; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 10. Plaintiff argues that the award of tenure to three of the African American professors is irrelevant because they received tenure after plaintiff filed his lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opp. at 35,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bishopp v.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Kyriakopoulos\n   </em>\n   stands for the principle that a claim for breach of a continuing duty may be timely, but only if recent actions within the limitations period \"provide the basis for the asserted breach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3465005,10528085\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/438/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   That is not what happened here. Assuming defendant had a continuing duty to provide plaintiff feedback and annual reviews and failed to do so in academic year\n   2011-12, as plaintiff asserts, that omission does not provide a fresh basis for a breach of contract claim alleging a failure to afford plaintiff \"a reasonable opportunity to address any real or perceived issues with his scholarship prior to his tenure review process,\" Compl. \u00b6 53, because plaintiff filed his tenure application\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the 2011-12 academic year. So even if defendant breached the contract that year, that breach did not cause the harm of which plaintiff complains. And any breaches of the contract that occurred before October 2, 2011 are time barred. Accordingly, the Court holds that plaintiffs breach of implied contract claim is untimely, and defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Count III as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff has failed to present facts to prove his breach of contract claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Even if plaintiffs breach of contract were not time-barred and assuming defendant breached a contractual duty, there is sufficient evidence on the record to show that plaintiff did receive reviews and feedback, and that he declined to avail himself of all the opportunities that were offered. In his first year, academic year 2006-07, plaintiff had an annual review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 40-49; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 40-49. In his second year, academic year 2007-08, plaintiff failed to submit the required annual statement by October 15, 2007, but in April 2008, Professors [redacted] and [redacted] invited him to prepare the statement and to meet for an annual review.

In his third year, academic year 2008-09, plaintiff submitted a combined annual statement for his second and third years as part of his contract renewal application, and he was evaluated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 53-57, 64; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 53-57, 64. In his fourth year, academic year 2009-10, plaintiff was again evaluated as part of his application for promotion to Associate Professor. Def.'s SOF 69-70; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The record also shows that plaintiff received feedback on his scholarship as part of these evaluations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Draft FERC Annual Report on Prof. Samuel L.

Accordingly, defendant is also entitled to summary judgment on Count III on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
