XIV, \u00a7 2. Article I of the Constitution provides, in turn, that the number of persons in each state is to be calculated by means of an \"actual Enumeration\" - known as the census - every ten years \"in such Manner as [Congress] shall by Law direct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. Since 1790, the government has conducted that \"actual Enumeration\" through questions - initially asked in person and, later, by means of written questionnaire - about both the number and demographic backgrounds of those living in each American household. Beginning in 1820, one such question concerned (in one form or another) citizenship status. The government ceased asking that question of everyone nationwide in 1960. Earlier this year, however, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., exercising authority delegated by Congress over the census, announced that he was reinstating the citizenship question on the 2020 census questionnaire. Secretary Ross explained that reinstatement of the citizenship question is necessary for the Department of Justice to enforce, and courts to adjudicate, violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs in these two related cases (which have been informally consolidated for purposes of scheduling and discovery) contend that Secretary Ross's decision to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 census questionnaire violates both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   In 18-CV-2921, Plaintiffs are eighteen states and the District of Columbia, as well\n   as various cities, counties, and mayors; they challenge the Secretary's decision under both Article I's Enumeration Clause and the APA. (Docket No. 214 (\"SAC\"), \u00b6\u00b6 178-97). In 18-CV-5025, Plaintiffs are five nongovernmental organizations, four suing on behalf of themselves and their members and one suing only on its own behalf; they challenge the Secretary's decision on the same grounds and also as a violation of equal protection, as embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. (18-CV-5025, Docket No. 1 (\"NGO Compl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 193-212).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 25, 2018, Defendants - the United States Department of Commerce; Secretary Ross (the \"Secretary\"); the Bureau of the Census (the \"Census Bureau\"); and Acting Director of the Census Bureau, Ron Jarmin - moved, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss the First Amended Complaint in 18-CV-2921. (Docket No. 154).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 29, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint in 18-CV-5025. (18-CV-5025, Docket No. 38). The Court held oral argument on the first motion on July 3, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 3, 2018 Transcript, Docket No. 207 (\"Oral Arg. Tr.\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Broadly speaking, in this Opinion, the Court reaches three conclusions with respect to Defendants' motions.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Court categorically rejects Defendants' efforts to insulate Secretary Ross's decision to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 census from judicial review. Contending that Plaintiffs cannot prove they have been or will be injured by the decision, and citing the degree of discretion afforded to Congress by the Enumeration Clause and to the Secretary by statute, Defendants insist that this Court lacks jurisdiction even to consider Plaintiffs' claims. As the Court will explain, however, that contention flies in the face of decades of precedent from the Supreme Court, the Second Circuit, and other courts. That precedent makes clear that, while deference is certainly owed to the Secretary's decisions, courts have a critical role to play in entertaining challenges like those raised by Plaintiffs here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that the citizenship question is a permissible - but by no means mandated - exercise of the broad power granted to Congress (and, in turn, to the Secretary) in the Enumeration Clause of the Constitution. That conclusion is compelled not only by the text of the Clause, which vests Congress with virtually unlimited discretion in conducting the census, but also by historical practice. The historical practice reveals that, since the very first census in 1790, the federal government has consistently used the decennial exercise not only to obtain a strict headcount in fulfillment of the constitutional mandate to conduct an \"actual Enumeration,\" but also to gather demographic data about the population on matters such as race, sex, occupation, and, even citizenship. Moreover, it reveals that all three branches of the government - including the Supreme Court and lower courts - have blessed this dual use of the census, if\n   not a citizenship question itself. In the face of that history and the broad constitutional grant of power to Congress, the Court cannot conclude that the Secretary lacks power under the Enumeration Clause to ask a question about citizenship on the census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , although the Secretary has\n   <em>\n    authority\n   </em>\n   under the Enumeration Clause to direct the inclusion of a citizenship question on the census, the Court concludes that the particular\n   <em>\n    exercise\n   </em>\n   of that authority by Secretary Ross may have violated NGO Plaintiffs' rights to equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. That is, assuming the truth of NGO Plaintiffs' allegations and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor - as the Court must at this stage of the proceedings - they plausibly allege that Secretary Ross's decision to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 census was motivated by discriminatory animus and that its application will result in a discriminatory effect. As discussed below, that conclusion is supported by indications that Defendants deviated from their standard procedures in hastily adding the citizenship question; by evidence suggesting that Secretary Ross's stated rationale for adding the question is pretextual; and by contemporary statements of decisionmakers, including statements by the President, whose reelection campaign credited him with \"officially\" mandating Secretary Ross's decision to add the question right after it was announced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The net effect of these conclusions is that Defendants' motions to dismiss are granted in part and denied in part. In particular, Plaintiffs' claims under the Enumeration Clause - which turn on Secretary Ross's power rather than his purposes - must be and are dismissed. By contrast, their claims under the APA (which Defendants seek to dismiss solely on jurisdictional and justiciability grounds) and the Due Process Clause - which turn at least in part on Secretary Ross's purposes and not merely on his power - may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted, the Constitution requires an \"actual Enumeration\" of \"the whole number of persons in each State\" every ten years, and grants to Congress authority to conduct that enumeration - commonly known as the census - \"in such Manner as [Congress] shall by Law direct.\" U.S. C ONST . art. 1, \u00a7 2, cl. 3 &amp; amend. XIV. The modern census is governed by the Census Act, which was enacted in 1976.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Act delegates to the Secretary of Commerce the duty to \"take a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year ... in such form and content as he may determine.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The federal government, however, has long used the decennial census to do more than take a mere headcount of the population for purposes of apportioning Representatives.

As a history of the census prepared in 1900 for the Senate Committee on the Census described the first census: \"Instead of providing simply for an enumeration of the population in 1790 ... which would have answered all the requirements of the Constitution,\" Congress \"called for [more information] ... thus recognizing at the very outset the desirability of using the census as a means of securing data beyond the mere statement of population needed for apportionment purposes.\" CARROLL D.

The third census, taken in 1810, also required the Marshals to give \"an account of the several manufacturing establishments ... within their several districts.\" Act of May 1, 1810,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20Stat.%20605\">\n    2 Stat. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (1810). Interestingly, civic groups - including the American Philosophical Society, led by Thomas Jefferson - encouraged Congress to add questions regarding citizenship (and other topics) as early as the second census, but those proposals were rejected at that point without debate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WRIGHT, HISTORY AND GROWTH 19-20. For reasons that are not clear, however, Congress did add a question about citizenship to the fourth census in 1820, directing enumerators to tally the number of \"Foreigners not naturalized.\" Act of March 14, 1820 (\"1820 Census Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20Stat.%20548\">\n    3 Stat. 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550 (1820).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The fifth census in 1830 - which was the first to rely on standardized, pre-printed forms - tallied all \"white persons\" who were \"ALIENS - Foreigners not naturalized.\" Act of March 23, 1830 (\"1830 Census Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20Stat.%20383\">\n    4 Stat. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389 (1830). For unknown reasons, the sixth census in 1840 did not ask about citizenship or birthplace, although it did include nearly every other question that had been asked in the fifth census, including questions regarding occupation,\n   mental illness, and military service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WRIGHT, HISTORY AND GROWTH 142-43 (reprinting the inquiries on the sixth census).

It was also the first census to pose the majority of questions to only a fraction of the population: The census posed only five questions to all respondents, with more detailed questions going to twenty-five percent of the population. MEASURING AMERICA 72. The five universal questions included the respondent's relationship to the head of household, sex, color or race, marital status, and month and year of birth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1960 CENSUSES OF POPULATION AND HOUSING 364. The lengthier questionnaire that went to a sample of the population included questions regarding respondents' and parental birthplace, highest level of education attained, salary earned, and how many working television sets a household had.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Notably, the 1960 census was the first since 1840 not to include a question about citizenship (or birthplace) for all residents. It did, however, ask all residents of New York and Puerto Rico about citizenship - the former \"at the expense of the State, to meet State constitutional requirements for State legislative apportionment\" and the latter, at the request of a census advisory committee, \"to permit detailed studies of migration.\" 1960 CENSUSES OF POPULATION AND HOUSING 10, 130. In a review of the census, the Census Bureau explained the decision not to ask all respondents about citizenship as follows: \"It was felt that general census information on citizenship had become of less importance compared with other possible questions to be included in the census, particularly in view of the recent statutory requirement for annual alien registration which could provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the principal user of such data, with the information it needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Between 1970 and 2000, the census continued to feature a short questionnaire distributed to the vast majority of the population (known as the \"short-form census\") and a longer questionnaire, which included both the inquiries on the shorter questionnaire as well as additional questions, distributed to a sample of the population (known as the \"long-form census\"). During that time, none of the short-form questionnaires included a question about citizenship or birthplace.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MEASURING AMERICA 77 (1970), 84 (1980), 91 (1990), 100 (2000).

Unlike the decennial census, the ACS is conducted annually and is not used to obtain an \"actual Enumeration\" of the population for purposes of apportionment; instead, it is given each year to only about 3.5 million households - roughly one in every thirty-eight households in the country - for the sole purpose of collecting demographic data on the population.

The ACS \"requires citizens to disclose whether they were born in 'United States territories,' whether they were born 'abroad' to U.S. parents, or if and when they were 'naturalized.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2010 census\n   asked about \"the age, sex, race, and ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) of each person in a household,\" as well as \"whether the housing unit was rented or owned by a member of the household.\" WILLIAMS, THE 2010 DECENNIAL CENSUS: BACKGROUND AND ISSUES 3.

Notably, since then, the Census Bureau and former Bureau officials have opposed periodic efforts to reinstate a citizenship question on a universal basis. In 1980, for example, several plaintiffs (including the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which appears here as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   in support of Defendants) sued the Census Bureau, contending that the census was constitutionally required to count only citizens.\n   <em>\n    Fed'n for Am.

In that litigation, the Census Bureau argued that reinstating a citizenship question for all respondents would \"inevitably jeopardize the overall accuracy of the population count\" because noncitizens would be reluctant to participate, for fear \"of the information being used against them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137326\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/486/564/#p576\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137326\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/486/564/#p576\">\n    at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, in Congressional testimony prior to the 1990 census, Census Bureau officials opposed reinstating a citizenship question for all respondents, opining that it could cause people to \"misunderstand or mistrust the census and fail or refuse to respond.\"\n   <em>\n    Exclude Undocumented Residents from Census Counts Used for Apportionment: Hearing on H.R. 3639, H.R. 3814, and H.R. 4234 Before the Subcomm. on Census &amp; Population of the H.

Specifically, on March 26, 2018, Secretary Ross issued a memorandum directing the Census Bureau to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census.

(SAC \u00b6 94). The DOJ letter, in turn, requested the question's reinstatement on the grounds that more granular citizenship data was necessary to\n   enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory voting laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95).

First, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' inclusion of a citizenship question on the census will \"drive down response rates and seriously impair the accuracy of the decennial population count.\" (SAC \u00b6 39;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6 4). In support of that assertion, Plaintiffs proffer an array of evidence - much of it from Defendants themselves. For instance, Plaintiffs cite the Census Bureau's own argument in 1980 that \"any effort to ascertain citizenship will inevitably jeopardize the overall accuracy of the population count\" because \"[q]uestions as to citizenship are particularly sensitive in minority communities and would inevitable trigger ... refusal to cooperate.\" (SAC \u00b6 40 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Fed'n for Am. Immigration Reform\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137326\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/486/564/#p576\">\n    486 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   568 );\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6 84). Plaintiffs also cite testimony, interviews, and an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief filed by former Directors of the Census Bureau, arguing in sum and substance that the \"citizenship inquiry would invariably lead to a lower response rate to the Census in general.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 39-47;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 81-90). Moreover, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that this risk is \"heightened in the current political climate because of President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.\" (SAC \u00b6 48;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-26, 140-46). Accordingly, Plaintiffs claim, Defendants' actions \"will add to this unprecedented level of anxiety in immigrant communities,\" leading to \"nonresponse and lower participation by many immigrants.\" (SAC \u00b6 53;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 141-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The second step in Plaintiffs' argument is that this \"undercounting\" will result in various concrete harms to them and their constituents or members. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6 105 (\"[I]n 2014, New York State had the fourth largest population of undocumented residents in the nation.\");\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104-38;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , NGO Compl. \u00b6 52 (\"Make the Road New York members ... will be deprived of political influence and funding ....\") ). For example, Plaintiffs identify various federal programs, including \"the Highway Trust Fund program, the Urbanized Area Formula Funding program, the Metropolitan Planning program, and the Community Highway Safety Grant program,\" which \"distribute funds based, at least in part, on population figures collected through the decennial census.\" (SAC \u00b6 140 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20104\">\n    23 U.S.C. \u00a7 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205305\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5307, 5340 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n    23 U.S.C. \u00a7 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n    \u00b6 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiffs will lose millions of dollars in [Medicaid] reimbursement as a result of even a 1% undercount.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6 197 (identifying the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, the Highway Trust Fund program,\n   and other programs that rely on population figures from the census) ).

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6 143(a)-(v) ). Citing these programs, they plausibly allege that an undercount in their jurisdictions will \"depriv[e] them of their statutory fair share of federal funding, and remov[e] crucial resources for important government services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6 52). That alone is sufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carey v.

But on top of that, Government Plaintiffs also plausibly allege that an undercount \"will lead to loss of representation in Rhode Island\" - which is apparently teetering on the edge of losing one of its two Representatives already - and will the \"harm representational interests\" of local government Plaintiffs \"within their states.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 160-63). That, too, is sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Commerce v.

(Defs.' Br. 14). That may ultimately prove to be the case, but Defendants' contentions are misplaced at this stage in the litigation, when Plaintiffs \"bear[ ] no evidentiary burden.\"\n   <em>\n    John\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276539\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/732/#p736\">\n    858 F.3d at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Citing a memorandum authored by Secretary Ross, for example, Defendants claim that \"there is little 'definitive, empirical' evidence regarding the effect of adding a citizenship question.\" (Defs.' Br. 15). But Plaintiffs allege otherwise, citing ample evidence - spanning decades and much of it from the Census Bureau itself - in support of the proposition that including a citizenship question will cause an undercount. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 39-47;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 81-90). Moreover, Plaintiffs cite testing that the Census Bureau conducted in 2017 that tended to show that \"fears, particularly among immigrant respondents, have increased markedly this year.\" (SAC \u00b6 51;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-26). These findings, the Census Bureau explained, \"have implications for data quality and nonresponse.\" (SAC \u00b6 52;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6 127). For the time being, those allegations are sufficient to establish Plaintiffs' point.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Spear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p168\">\n    520 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p168\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p168\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (\"[W]hile a plaintiff must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts to survive a motion for summary judgment, and must ultimately support any contested facts with evidence adduced at trial, at the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\" (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted) ). Defendants' reliance on contrary evidence merely raises disputes of fact that the Court may not resolve on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Next, Defendants claim that the Census Bureau \"has extensive procedures in place to address non-response and to obtain accurate data for those households that decline to respond.\" (Defs.' Br. 15). Defendants repackaged this argument slightly in their reply brief, (Defs.' Reply Br. 4), and\n   at oral argument, (Oral Arg. Tr. 12), claiming that Plaintiffs fail to distinguish between the\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   \"self-response\" to the written census form, and the \"non-response followup\" employed by the Census Bureau to reach initial non-responders. As Defendants see it, Plaintiffs allege only that the initial self-response rate will decrease; they fail to consider that the nonresponse followup could cure any diminished self-response. (Defs.' Reply Br. 4). However packaged, though, those arguments are also factual and thus premature. Moreover, they ignore well-pleaded allegations in Plaintiffs' complaints. Plaintiffs allege broadly that adding the citizenship question will \"significantly deter[ ]\n   <em>\n    participation\n   </em>\n   \" in the census. (SAC \u00b6 5 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6 141 (alleging that \"adding the citizenship question\" will \"reduc[e] participation by Latinos and Immigrants of color\") ). And Plaintiffs support that assertion with concrete allegations, citing, for example, reports from the Census Bureau that census respondents \"sought to break off interviews\" because of \"concerns about data confidentiality and the government's negative attitudes toward immigrants.\" (SAC \u00b6 51;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 133-37). In other words, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the addition of the citizenship question will affect not only the initial response rate to the questionnaire itself, but also cooperation with the in-person followup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, Defendants claim that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding loss of representation and federal funding are \"too speculative\" because apportionment and the allocation of funds are both \"complex\" and could be affected by, among other things, \"potential undercounting in other states.\" (Defs.' Br. 16-18).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that argument is squarely foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   , in which the Second Circuit held that New York City and New York State had standing to challenge the Census Bureau's conduct during the 1980 census because they had \"made a showing ... that Census Bureau actions in New York State have caused a disproportionate undercount which will result in loss of representation\" and \"decreased federal funds ... under revenue sharing.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1353773\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/637/834/#p838\">\n    637 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   838 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Detroit v.

Br. 17 n.8), but that consideration is irrelevant to the standing inquiry. Equally irrelevant is the fact that the Second Circuit \"cited New York City's 'present financial condition' in finding that the city and the state had standing as recipients of federal funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The loss of federal funds constitutes\n   injury whether or not a jurisdiction is in sound fiscal shape, and nothing in\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   suggests that the Court's passing reference to the financial condition of New York City (not the State) was essential to its holding. Finally, the fact that\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   analyzed standing after preliminary results from the census had been tabulated - a point that Defendants pressed at oral argument, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg.

The plaintiffs in those cases could not make a showing at that level of specificity. In these cases, by contrast, the alleged injuries are aggregate or communal in nature. That is, Plaintiffs do not need to show that a particular person will be deterred by Defendant's conduct from responding to the census; instead, their ability to prove injury that is fairly traceable to Defendants' actions turns on whether they can show that Defendants' conduct is likely to result in an undercount at the aggregate level, something that can presumably be done through surveys or other statistical proof. Plaintiffs may or may not be able to make that showing when the time comes, but that is a question for another day.

Moreover, the Secretary's decision to reinstate a citizenship question is consistent with historical practice dating back to the founding era.\" (Defs.' Br. 30).

Relying on language from the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   , they contend that reinstating the citizenship question violates the Enumeration Clause because it \"does not bear 'a reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of an actual enumeration of the population, keeping in mind the constitutional purpose of the census' \" to aid in the apportionment of Representatives.

The Court is particularly compelled to reach that conclusion by historical practice, which demonstrates that the census has been consistently used - since the Founding era -for an end unrelated to the \"actual Enumeration\" textually contemplated by the Enumeration Clause: to collect data on residents of the United States. For example, the nation's first census, taken in 1790, included information about age and sex, in order to \"assess the countries [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] industrial and military potential.\" M EASURING A MERICA 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1790 Census Act \u00a7 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%20101\">\n    1 Stat. 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Over the course of the nineteenth century, the demographic questions on the census expanded to include all manner of questions unrelated to the goal of a simple headcount, from questions about the number of persons \"engaged in agriculture, commerce, and manufactures,\" 1820 Census Act, 3 Stat. at 549; to whether members of a household were \"deaf,\" \"dumb,\" or \"blind,\" 1830 Census Act, 4 Stat. at 383; to the \"[p]rofession, occupation, or trade of each male person over 15 years of age,\" the \"value of real estate owned,\" and whether persons over age twenty could read and write, 1850 Census Act, 9 Stat. at 433; to respondents' marital status,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11187682\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/116/801/\">\n    116 F.Supp.2d at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A question on marital status has been asked in the census since 1880.\").

Congress itself first included a question about citizenship on the fourth census, in 1820.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M EASURING A MERICA 6 (noting that the 1820 census included questions \"to ascertain the number of foreigners not naturalized\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1820 Census Act, 3 Stat. at 550. And with one exception (in 1840),\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   decennial census thereafter until 1950 asked a question related to citizenship or birthplace in one form or another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-71. In 1960, the Secretary ceased asking\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   respondents about citizenship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 73. Notably, however, the 1960 census\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   include a citizenship question for residents of New York and Puerto Rico, and it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   ask a sample of respondents to provide where they were born, the language they spoke before coming to the United States, and their parents' birthplaces.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 72-76;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 124 n.4 (confirming that these questions were asked on a \"sample basis generally\" and that \"[c]itizenship was asked only in New York and Puerto Rico, where it was a 100-percent item\"). From 1970, the first year in which a longer census questionnaire was sent to a segment of the population, to 2000, the last year in which such a long-form questionnaire was used, the subject of citizenship remained on the census, albeit only for some respondents - namely, the one-sixth or so of households that received the \"long-form\" questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 78, 91-92. In 2010, when the long-form questionnaire was deemed unnecessary in light of the annual ACS, the census did not ask about citizenship at all. But there is no indication that the decision to drop the question from the 2010 census was made because Congress or the Secretary had come to believe that asking about citizenship was beyond the broad authority granted to Congress and, in turn, the Secretary by the Enumeration Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Thus, for two centuries, there has been a nearly unbroken practice of Congress either expressly including a question concerning citizenship on the census or authorizing (through delegation of its power and its non-intervention) the executive branch to do so. This history is significant for two reasons. First, as noted, the Supreme Court has made clear that \"[l]ong settled and established practice\" can be given \"great weight\" in construing constitutional provisions that define the scope of the political branches' powers.\n   <em>\n    Noel Canning\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 2559 (internal quotation marks omitted). For nearly two hundred years, all three branches have agreed that the census may be used to collect demographic information unrelated to the goal of an \"actual Enumeration,\" and two of the three branches have explicitly approved the inclusion of questions about citizenship status. That is plainly \"long enough to entitle a practice to 'great weight in a proper interpretation' of the constitutional provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2564 (quoting\n   <em>\n    The Pocket Veto Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906030\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/655/#p690\">\n    279 U.S. at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906030\" index=\"404\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/655/#p690\">\n    49 S.Ct. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Second, in assessing the meaning of the Enumeration Clause's broad grant of power, there is independent significance to the fact that demographic questions appeared on the very first census and that citizenship appeared on the census as early as 1820, little more than three decades after the Founding. As the Supreme Court explained nearly 150 years ago, \"[t]he construction placed upon the constitution by the [earliest acts of Congress], by the men who were contemporary with its formation, many of whom were members of the convention which framed it, is of itself entitled to very great weight, and when it is remembered that the rights thus established have not been disputed during a period of nearly a century, it is almost conclusive.\"\n   <em>\n    Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v.

In arguing otherwise, Plaintiffs make two principal arguments. First, they rely heavily on\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the Secretary's decision not to apply a post-census statistical adjustment. (Pls.' Br. 32-35). In doing so, the Court stated that, \"[i]n light of the Constitution's broad grant of authority to Congress, the Secretary's decision not to adjust [the census] need bear only a reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of an actual enumeration of the population, keeping in mind the constitutional purpose of the census.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/\">\n    517 U.S. at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Arguing that the sole constitutional purpose of the census is \"accuracy in the count,\" Plaintiffs contend that that standard should be applied here and that reintroduction of a citizenship question is impermissible because it does not bear a \"reasonable relationship\" to the accomplishment of an actual enumeration. (Pls.' Br. 35). Second, relying on history themselves, Plaintiffs place great weight on the fact that the Census Bureau has not included citizenship on the universal census form since 1950 and, in the years since, has repeatedly reaffirmed that doing so would harm the accuracy of the count. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Neither argument is persuasive. First,\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   cannot be read to suggest, let alone hold, that each and every question on the census must bear a \"reasonable relationship\" to the goal of an actual enumeration. Doing so would contravene the Supreme Court's own acknowledgement that the census \"fulfills many important and valuable functions,\" including \"in the allocation of federal grants to states based on population\" and in \"provid[ing] important data for Congress and ultimately for the private sector.\"\n   <em>\n    Baldrige\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305565\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/345/#p361\">\n    455 U.S. at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305565\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/345/#p361\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And doing so would also fly in the face of the history discussed above, which makes clear that all three branches have long blessed, and certainly tolerated, the practice of asking sensitive demographic questions on the census. Indeed, taken to its logical conclusion, application of the\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   \"reasonable relationship\" standard to every decision concerning the census would lead to\n   the conclusion that it is unconstitutional to ask\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   demographic question on the census. After all, asking such questions bears no relationship whatsoever to the goal of an accurate headcount. Far from it: Common sense and basic human psychology dictate that including\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   additional questions on the census - particularly questions on sensitive topics such as race, sex, employment, or health - can serve only to reduce response rates, as both the transaction costs of compliance and the likely concerns about intrusiveness increase.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rickenbacker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"196796\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/309/462/#p463\">\n    309 F.2d at 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the defendant had refused to answer census questions based on the view that they were an \"unnecessary invasion\" into his privacy);\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11187682\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/116/801/\">\n    116 F.Supp.2d at 809-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similar);\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6738790\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/58/993/#p999\">\n    58 F. at 999-1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similar).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, as noted, the census takers have, with the blessing of all three branches, asked such questions of respondents since the very first census in 1790.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   To read\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   as Plaintiffs suggest would, therefore, lead ineluctably to the conclusion that each and every census - from the Founding through the present - has been conducted in violation of the Enumeration Clause. That would, of course, be absurd, and leads the Court to conclude instead that the\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   standard applies only to decisions that bear directly on the actual population count. Notably, the Supreme Court's own language supports that limitation, as it held only that \"the Secretary's decision\n   <em>\n    not to adjust\n   </em>\n   \" the census count \"need bear only a reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of an actual enumeration of the population.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/\">\n    517 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). That is, the Court did not purport to announce a standard that would apply to a case such as this one.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rickenbacker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"196796\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/309/462/#p463\">\n    309 F.2d at 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding, in a criminal prosecution for failure to respond to the census, that the questionnaire did not violate the Fourth Amendment because \"[t]he authority to gather reliable statistical data reasonably related to governmental purposes and functions is a necessity if modern government is to legislate intelligently and effectively\" and the questions at issue \"related to important federal concerns ... and were not unduly broad or sweeping in their scope\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs' second argument -based on the conduct of the Census Bureau since 1960 - is also unpersuasive. That history may support the contention that reintroducing the citizenship question is a bad decision - and that, in turn, may be relevant to whether Plaintiffs can establish a violation of the APA or the Due Process Clause, both of which invite examination into the Secretary's bases for making that decision. But nothing in the history of the census, recent or otherwise, plausibly suggests that asking a citizenship question is beyond the scope of Congress's broad\n   <em>\n    power\n   </em>\n   under the Enumeration Clause - which is the sole relevant question for purposes of Plaintiffs' Enumeration Clause claims. Moreover, Plaintiffs' argument from recent history ignores the fact that citizenship\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   appear on all but one of the censuses since 1960. To be sure, it did so for only a portion of the population, but that fact alone has no constitutional significance. If Congress and the Secretary lack authority under the Enumeration Clause to ask about citizenship on the census, they could not ask about it of anyone, whatever the length of the questionnaire. Conversely, if the Enumeration Clause permits Congress\n   and the Secretary to ask some respondents about citizenship, it follows that the Clause permits them to ask all respondents. It makes no sense to say that Congress's power (and, by extension, the Secretary's) is dependent on the length of the questionnaire or on whether the entire population or only a portion of the population receives a particular questionnaire. Put simply, if the Enumeration Clause allows the Secretary to ask anyone about citizenship status -and historical practice makes clear that it does - then the Clause permits the Secretary to ask everyone about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court holds that Plaintiffs do not - and cannot - state a plausible claim that addition of the citizenship question on the 2020 census constitutes a violation of the Enumeration Clause. That does not mean - as Defendants have audaciously argued (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 48) - that there are no constitutional limits on Congress's and the Secretary's discretion to add questions to the census questionnaire. First, there is \"a strong constitutional interest in accuracy,\"\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255253\" index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/452/\">\n    536 U.S. at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255253\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/452/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and a decision to add questions to the census without the historical pedigree of the citizenship question could conceivably undermine that interest to a degree that would be constitutionally offensive. The Court need not define the outer limits of Congress's powers under the Enumeration Clause to decide this case, as it suffices to say that the Secretary's decision\n   <em>\n    here\n   </em>\n   is \"consonant with, though not dictated by, the text and history of the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/\">\n    505 U.S. at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255253\" index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/452/\">\n    536 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255253\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/452/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e need not decide here the precise methodological limits foreseen by the Census Clause.\"). But there may well be questions or practices that would be so extreme and unprecedented that they would not be permissible even under the Enumeration Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, to say that the Secretary has authority\n   <em>\n    under the Enumeration Clause\n   </em>\n   to ask about citizenship on the census is not to say that the particular exercise of that authority here was constitutional or lawful.

These departures include overruling career staff who strongly objected to including the citizenship question, failing to extensively test reintroduction of the question, and ignoring the recommendation of the Census Bureau's advisory committee. (NGO Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 191). The Administrative Record - of which the Court may take judicial notice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall Cty. Health Care Auth. v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516859,3813445\" index=\"467\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/1221/\">\n    988 F.2d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1226 (D.C. Cir. 1993) - lends support to these allegations. It shows, for example, that Secretary Ross overruled Census Bureau career staff, who had concluded that reinstating the citizenship question would be \"very costly\" and \"harm[ ] the quality of the census count.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. Record 1277). It also confirms that Defendants made the decision to add the question without the lengthy consideration and testing that usually precede even minor changes to the census questionnaire; in fact, it was added without any testing at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ross Mem. 2, 7). Notably, Defendants challenge only one of these alleged aberrations - the failure to test the question, which they attribute to the fact that it had previously been included on the ACS. (Defs.' NGO Br. 19). Whatever its merits, however, that challenge is premature, as all inferences must be drawn in Plaintiffs' favor at this stage of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheppard v.

And, in any event, Defendants do not address, let alone dispute, the other procedural irregularities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Second, various considerations -including the \"specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,\"\n   <em>\n    Arlington Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"469\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n    429 U.S. at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"470\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - suggest that Secretary Ross's sole proffered rationale for the decision, that the citizenship question is necessary for litigation of Voting Rights Act claims, may have been pretextual. For one thing, there is no indication in the record that the Department of Justice and civil rights groups have ever, in the fifty-three years since the Voting Rights Act was enacted, suggested that citizenship data collected as part of the decennial census would be helpful, let alone necessary, to litigate such claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 187-1, at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   NGO Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 183, 186). For another, while Secretary Ross initially (and repeatedly) suggested that the Department of Justice's request triggered his consideration of the issue, it now appears that the sequence of events was exactly opposite. In his memorandum, Secretary Ross stated that he \"\n   <em>\n    set out\n   </em>\n   to take a hard look\" at adding the citizenship question \"[\n   <em>\n    f\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ollowing receipt\n   </em>\n   \" of a request from the Department of Justice on December 12, 2017.

Along similar lines, in a May 2, 2017 e-mail to Secretary Ross, the director of the Commerce Department's office of policy and strategic planning stated that \"[w]e need to work with Justice\n   <em>\n    to get them to request\n   </em>\n   that citizenship be added back as a census question.\" (Docket No. 212, at 3710 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3699 (e-mail from Secretary Ross, earlier the same day, stating that he was \"mystified why nothing have [sic] been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship question\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   To prove a violation of the Fifth Amendment, of course, NGO Plaintiffs need to prove that Defendants acted with a discriminatory purpose, and evidence that Secretary Ross's rationale was pretextual does not necessarily mean that it was a pretext for discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, \"[p]roof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is ... one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive.\"\n   <em>\n    Reeves v.

Most notably, NGO Plaintiffs identify several statements made by President Trump himself in the months before and after Secretary Ross announced his decision that, while not pertaining directly to that decision, could be construed to reveal a general animus toward immigrants of color. Those statements include (1) his alleged complaint on January 11, 2018, about \"these people from shithole countries\" coming to the United States, (NGO Compl. \u00b6 109); (2) his assertion in February 2018 that certain immigrants \"turn out to be horrendous....

Granted, courts must give proper deference to the Secretary, but that does not mean that they lack authority to entertain claims like those pressed here. To the contrary, courts have a critical role to play in reviewing the conduct of the political branches to ensure that the census is conducted in a manner consistent with the Constitution and applicable law.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' claims under the Enumeration Clause - which turn on whether Secretary Ross had the\n   <em>\n    power\n   </em>\n   to add a question about citizenship to the census and not on whether he\n   <em>\n    exercised\n   </em>\n   that power for impermissible reasons - must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , assuming the truth of their allegations and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, the Court finds that NGO Plaintiffs plausibly allege that Secretary Ross's decision to reinstate the citizenship question was motivated at least in part by discriminatory animus and will result in a discriminatory effect. Accordingly, their equal protection claim under the Due Process Clause (and Plaintiffs' APA claims, which Defendants did not substantively challenge) may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   None of that is to say that Plaintiffs will ultimately prevail in their challenge to Secretary Ross's decision to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 census. As noted, the Enumeration Clause and the Census Act grant him broad authority over the census, and Plaintiffs may not ultimately be able to prove that he exercised that authority in an unlawful manner. Put another way, the question at this stage of the proceedings is not whether the evidence supports Plaintiffs' claims, but rather whether Plaintiffs may proceed with discovery and, ultimately, to summary judgment or trial on their claims. The\n   Court concludes that they may as to their claims under the APA and the Due Process Clause and, to that extent, Defendants' motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Per the Court's Order entered on July 5, 2018 (Docket No. 199), the deadline for the completion of fact and expert discovery in these cases is October 12, 2018, and the parties shall appear for a pretrial conference on September 14, 2018.

Assessing the legislative history of the 1976 statute amending the Census Act to include the language \"in such form and content as he may determine,\" Justice Stevens concluded that \"[t]he legislative history [of that statute] evidences no intention to expand the scope of the Secretary's discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     Franklin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"534\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/\">\n     505 U.S. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    816 n.16,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2767\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). But the 1976 statute replaced a version of Section 141(a) requiring the Secretary to \"take a census of population,\n    <em>\n     unemployment, and housing (including utilities and equipment)\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    H.R. Rep. No. 92-1288, at 23 (emphasis added) (comparing the old statutory language and the proposed amended language). Moreover, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service explained that the purpose of replacing \"unemployment, and housing (including utilities and equipment)\" with the present language - \"in such form and content as he may determine\" - was \"not intended to deny to the Secretary the authority to ask questions on [unemployment and housing] in the decennial censuses. Rather it is directed towards permitting the Secretary\n    <em>\n     greater discretion\n    </em>\n    in the determination of the extent to which questions on unemployment and housing are to be included.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12 (emphasis added). Thus, the legislative history could be read to suggest that Congress sought to expand the scope of the Secretary's discretion.
