Before the bankruptcy court held the evidentiary hearing, however, EMI Equity filed a notice of appeal. (Docket No. 83.) EMI Equity contends that the bankruptcy court's holding is erroneous because \"there is no showing of willfulness, an essential element of [an automatic stay violation].\" (Docket No. 8 at p. 24.) The Court reserves judgment regarding EMI's purported violation of the automatic stay because the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment on an incomplete record and issued an ambiguous order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court remands this appeal for two reasons. First, the factual basis underlying the bankruptcy court's disposition is incomplete. Second, the summary judgment order is ambiguous. Further analysis pursuant to Puerto Rico law is required to determine whether EMI Equity possesses a secured interest in the mortgaged property, and whether EMI Equity violated the automatic stay pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" section 362\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Summary Judgment is Inappropriate Because Vald\u00e9s Failed to Submit a Statement of Uncontested Material Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Vald\u00e9s moved for summary judgment without submitting a statement of uncontested material facts. (Docket No. 55.) Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056 states that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (\" Rule 56\") \"applies in adversary proceedings.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7056. Pursuant to Rule 56, the \"Court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Local Rule 56 governs the factual assertions made by both parties in the context of summary judgment. Loc. R. 56 ;\n   <em>\n    Hern\u00e1ndez v.

The movant must submit factual assertions in \"a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts, set forth in numbered paragraphs.\" Loc. R. 56(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Courts \"disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material properly considered on summary judgment.\" Loc. Rule 56(e).

The First Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly \"emphasized the importance of local rules similar to Local Rule 56 [of the District of Puerto Rico],\" which \"are designed to function as a means of 'focusing a district court's attention on what is-and what is not-genuinely controverted'.\"\n   <em>\n    Hern\u00e1ndez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3115677\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/1/#p7\">\n    486 F.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his motion for summary judgment, Vald\u00e9s relies on facts set forth in \"the record of debtor's chapter 13 case no. 11-04694B and/or are admitted by [EMI Equity] in its answer to the Complaint and/or its response to plaintiff's request for discovery.\" (Docket No. 55 at pp. 2-3.) Vald\u00e9s' cursory reference to facts asserted throughout the record is insufficient pursuant to Local Rule 56 and inhibits this Court from adjudicating EMI Equity's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RG Primier Bank v.
