Compl. 3 n.5, 5, \u00b6 3.\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff John Raynor is a former director and outside counsel to one of Mr. Prosser's companies, has pursued legal claims against the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, or CFC, and has been the defendant in what he characterizes as an extortionary adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Plaintiffs allege that CFC has engaged in an extensive scheme of accounting fraud and public corruption in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. Through this lawsuit, they seek to compel Attorney General Jeff Sessions to intervene in Mr. Prosser's bankruptcy proceedings. They also seek to compel Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to cease and desist funding CFC from the United States Treasury. Because Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that entitles them to the requested intervention and have not shown standing to challenge CFC's funding, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint and other filings focus mainly on allegations about CFC's misconduct. Although CFC is not a party to this case, Plaintiffs' allegations against CFC provide the basis for their request that the Attorney General intervene in Mr. Prosser's bankruptcy proceedings and that the Secretary of the Treasury discontinue funding of CFC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   CFC is a tax-exempt, member-owned financing cooperative that supplements federal loan programs to support the generation and distribution of electricity in rural America.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Plaintiffs allege that CFC engaged in extensive accounting fraud, including embezzling nearly $263 million in five years from the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative, or RTFC, which CFC controls.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-56. Plaintiffs also allege that CFC corrupted public officials in the Virgin Islands, including several federal prosecutors and former Governor John Percy de Jongh, Jr., who was arrested for financial crimes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 21, 23. According to Plaintiffs, \"Fraud and criminality is a systemic part of CFC's operations and without it, CFC cannot financially survive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that CFC has victimized them for their efforts to address its misconduct. Mr. Prosser alleges that he discovered CFC's accounting fraud when his three companies borrowed money from RTFC, which CFC controlled, and CFC embezzled funds from those companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Mr. Prosser says that, because he \"raised the issue of Embezzlement,\" RTFC illegally foreclosed on loans that it made to his companies and forced Mr. Prosser and his companies into bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Raynor, a former director and outside counsel to at least one of Mr. Prosser's companies, alleges that he filed a civil False Claims Act complaint against CFC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. He also alleges that he provided information to the Department of Justice to encourage an investigation of potential RICO violations, potential criminal False Claims Act violations, and potential bank fraud, and that the Department of Justice responded by conducting an extensive criminal investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 &amp; n.14, 14. Mr. Raynor says that he was forced to defend himself in an extortionary adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that, in what they call the \"ICC Bribery,\" CFC paid about $20 million in bribes to public officials \"to facilitate the involuntary bankruptcy of New ICC [one of Mr. Prosser's companies] and to enlist the support of those public officials ... in pursuing CFC's retaliatory agenda.\" Pls.' Statement of Facts in Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 4-5. CFC arranged these bribes through a consultant and several court-appointed bankruptcy professionals in Mr. Prosser's bankruptcy proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. According to Plaintiffs, CFC bribed two federal prosecutors, at least one witness in the bankruptcy proceedings, and a former Territorial Senator, Alvin Williams, who was arrested on six counts of bribery in 2012. Compl. 6-7. Plaintiffs also allege the Department of Justice forced the judge presiding over the bankruptcy proceedings to retire from the bench after a pattern of unsupportable decisions that suggested bribery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The District Court for the U.S. Virgin Islands sealed at least some records in the criminal proceeding against former Territorial Senator Williams to protect the Department of Justice's ongoing criminal investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Plaintiffs have tried to have these records unsealed, but without success.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Plaintiffs allege the sealed records would show that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (i) the foreclosure which resulted in the Prosser Bankruptcies was unlawful; (ii) the Bankruptcy proceedings in the Prosser Bankruptcies were completely and thoroughly corrupted and lacked any integrity whatsoever; (iii) the Bankruptcy proceedings in the Prosser Bankruptcies were not impartially adjudicated; and (iv) with the implied consent of the DOJ, the U.S. Treasury has funded CFC's pattern of racketeering activities in violation of the False Claims Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. This allegation is based at least in part on statements made to Mr. Prosser by a co-indictee of Mr. Williams.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Prosser and Mr. Raynor brought this case against the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury in their official capacities, seeking an order from the Court compelling the Attorney General to intervene in Mr. Prosser's bankruptcy proceedings and directing the Secretary to cease and desist funding CFC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38. Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Miscellaneous Relief, seeking an order from the Court directing the Department of Justice to file under seal in this case: (1) the sealed documents from Mr. Williams' criminal case; and (2) any documents involving admissions by the bankruptcy judge that he did not impartially adjudicate Mr. Prosser's bankruptcy proceedings. Defendants moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim to the requested relief and for lack of standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Second, they cite the United States Attorneys' Manual, stating, \"Courts have recognized that the [United States Trustee Program] serve[s] as the vanguard, especially on those issues that impact upon the integrity of the [bankruptcy] process.\" Compl. \u00b6 69. Third, they cite the United States Trustee Program Policy and Practices Manual, which states that the United States Trustee Program \"is responsible for overseeing the nation's bankruptcy system,\" that its \"mission is to promote the integrity and efficiency of the bankruptcy system,\" and that it pursues its mission by enforcing bankruptcy laws and by ensuring that those involved in the bankruptcy process fulfil their legal obligations.

Plaintiffs cite Collier on Bankruptcy for the proposition that \"the statutes establishing the federal bankruptcy crimes seek to prevent and redress abuses of the bankruptcy system\" and that \"they set basic rules for participation in the civil bankruptcy process.\" Compl. \u00b6 68.

Plaintiffs have not pointed to any authority that cabins the Attorney General's discretion for bankruptcy proceedings. They have not pointed to any authority plainly defining a nondiscretionary duty that requires the Attorney General to intervene in Mr. Prosser's bankruptcy proceedings.

But their standing arguments focus exclusively on injuries caused by the Department of Justice's alleged failure to perform its law enforcement duties.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have not shown that the APA, the mandamus statute, or the Constitution makes federal funding of an enterprise engaged in a pattern of RICO violations a cognizable injury for purposes of Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Under the APA, as Plaintiffs note, \"A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Neither statute creates substantive rights violated by federal funding of the CFC. Nor is it apparent that this fending violates any of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Thus, Plaintiffs have not shown that the APA, the mandamus statute, or the Constitution provides grounds for determining that federal funding of the CFC injures the Plaintiffs or that a cease-and-desist order would redress any injuries that Plaintiffs have suffered. So Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of establishing standing to challenge the federal funding of CFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
