In April 2018, this Court held that decision unlawful and set it aside, concluding both that it was reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and that the reasons given to support it were inadequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP v.

However, because the Court also determined that DHS could possibly remedy the decision's inadequacies-at least in theory-the Court stayed its order of vacatur for a period of ninety days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   That ninety-day period has now expired. In the interim, DHS has issued a new memorandum \"concur[ring] with and declin[ing] to disturb\" its September 2017 rescission decision. Mem. from Sec'y Kirstjen M. Nielsen (\"Nielsen Memo\") [ECF No. 71-1] at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, the government has now moved the Court to revise its April 2018 order, arguing that the Nielsen Memo demonstrates that DACA's rescission was neither unlawful nor subject to judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Revise the Court's April 24, 2018 Order (\"Gov't's Mot.\") [ECF No. 74].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the government's motion will be denied. Although the Nielsen Memo purports to offer further explanation for DHS's decision to rescind DACA, it fails to elaborate meaningfully on the agency's primary rationale for its decision: the judgment that\n   the policy was unlawful and unconstitutional. And while the memo offers several additional \"policy\" grounds for DACA's rescission, most of these simply repackage legal arguments previously made, and hence are \"insufficiently independent from the agency's evaluation of DACA's legality\" to preclude judicial review or to support the agency's decision.\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the memo does offer what appears to be one bona fide (albeit logically dubious) policy reason for DACA's rescission, but this reason was articulated nowhere in DHS's prior explanation for its decision, and therefore cannot support that decision now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By choosing to stand by its September 2017 rescission decision, DHS has placed itself in a dilemma. On the one hand, it cannot rely on the reasons it previously gave for DACA's rescission, because the Court has already rejected them. On the other, because \"an agency's action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself,\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

The government's attempt to thread this needle fails. The motion to revise the Court's April 2018 order will therefore be denied, and the Court's vacatur of DACA's rescission will stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The DACA program offers renewable, two-year grants of deferred action to certain undocumented aliens who were brought to the United States as children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing DACA's eligibility criteria in greater detail).

The Court held, among other things, that: (1) DHS's September 5, 2017 decision to rescind DACA was reviewable under the APA because it was predicated chiefly on the agency's legal judgment that DACA was unlawful,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 226-235 ; and (2) the decision was arbitrary and capricious because (a) DHS's legal judgment was inadequately explained,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    at 238-240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (b) the other reasons offered for DACA's rescission-mainly, the purported \"litigation risk\" that DACA would be preliminarily enjoined by the district court in\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   -were insufficiently reasoned,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    at 241-243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nielsen issued a memorandum responding to the Court's order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nielsen Memo at 1. Instead of issuing a new decision rescinding DACA, as the Court's order had contemplated, Secretary Nielson simply \"declin[ed] to disturb\" the earlier decision to rescind the program by then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine C.

The reasons in this last category included that: (a) DHS \"should not adopt public policies of non-enforcement of [federal] laws for broad classes and categories of aliens,\" particularly aliens whom \"Congress has repeatedly considered but declined to protect\"; (b) \"DHS should only exercise its prosecutorial discretion not to enforce the immigration laws on a truly individualized, case-by-case basis\"; and (c) \"it is critically important for DHS to project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear, consistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws,\" particularly given that \"tens of thousands of minor aliens have illegally crossed or been smuggled across our border in recent years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Finally, Secretary Nielsen wrote that although she was \"keenly aware that DACA recipients have availed themselves of the policy in continuing their presence in this country,\" she nonetheless \"do[es] not believe that the asserted reliance interests outweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the other reasons [given] for ending [it].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In July, following the issuance of the Nielsen Memo, the government filed the instant motion to revise the Court's April 24, 2018 order. According to the government, the Nielsen Memo demonstrates that DHS's September 2017 decision to rescind DACA was neither subject to judicial review nor arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mot. at 1-2. This is so, the government contends, because Secretary Nielsen's articulation of \"serious doubts\" regarding DACA's legality,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-13, as well as her \"additional\" discussion of enforcement-policy concerns,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16, \"confirm[ ]\" that the rescission was both an exercise of enforcement discretion (as opposed to a legal judgment) and, at a minimum, reasonable,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Thus, the government asks the Court either to dismiss all of plaintiffs' claims (including their constitutional claims) or to enter judgment in its favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Finally, the government states that, if the Court denies the motion, it intends to seek \"a further continuation of the stay of the vacatur order,\" either \"to consider seeking a stay pending appeal or to give DHS time to appropriately prepare\" to accept new DACA applications, \"which DHS has generally not accepted since September 5, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs offer several arguments in response. First, they contend, the Court should not even consider Secretary Nielsen's memorandum, because it is not \"the new agency action [the] Court anticipated [DHS] might take\" during the ninety-day stay-of-vacatur period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Revise the Court's Apr. 24, 2018 Order (\"Pls.' Opp'n\") [ECF No. 75] at 3-8. Second, they argue that if the Court considers the Nielsen Memo at all, it should consider only the memorandum's legal analysis, because the remainder of the memorandum offers impermissible\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalizations of DHS's rescission decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Food Mktg.

Cir. 1978) ). Third, they contend that even if the Court considers the Nielsen Memo in full, its arguments present no reason to reconsider the Court's prior determination that DACA's rescission was both judicially reviewable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-14, and arbitrary and capricious,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-20. Therefore, plaintiffs ask the Court to deny DHS's motion and to allow the vacatur of DACA's rescission to take effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

[ECF No. 60] at 252-56. Pls.' Opp'n at 8-10. With one notable exception, the Court disagrees. Although many of the Nielsen Memo's rationales are quite attenuated from those offered in the Duke Memo and its supporting documentation, only one is so far afield as to constitute an impermissibly\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization for DACA's rescission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although \"\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalizations 'have traditionally been found to be an inadequate basis for review' of agency decisions,\" the D.C.

Specifically, they contend, Secretary Nielsen's assertion of \"serious doubts\" about DACA's legality \"does not amplify or explicate\" the Duke Memo's prediction that DACA would be abruptly enjoined in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation; rather, \"it silently abandons it.\" Pls.'

Although the Nielsen Memo certainly expands on the Duke Memo's points, most of its arguments are not so detached from the earlier document as to appear\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   . For example, the Nielsen Memo contends that \"serious doubts\" about DACA's legality could \"undermine public confidence in ... the rule of law\" and lead to \"burdensome litigation.\" Nielsen Memo at 2. Similarly, the Duke Memo expressly relied on a September 4, 2017 letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions (the \"Sessions Letter\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 254-55, which cited \"the costs and burdens\" associated with rescinding DACA in response to \"potentially imminent litigation,\" and opined that \"[p]roper enforcement of our immigration laws is ... critical ... to the restoration of the rule of law in our country,\" J.A. at 251. The Nielsen Memo's \"serious doubts\" rationale strikes this Court as a permitted amplification, rather than a prohibited\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization, of these statements in the Sessions Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The same is true of the Nielsen Memo's remaining \"policy\" justifications (again, save one). Like the Nielsen Memo, which faults DACA for protecting a class of aliens whom Congress has \"repeatedly considered but declined to protect,\" Nielsen Memo at 2, the Duke Memo relied on \"Congress's repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result\" as DACA, J.A. at 254. Similarly, the Nielsen Memo's concerns about \"individualized, case-by-case\" discretion, Nielsen Memo at 3, parallel the Duke Memo's observation that DACA was \"meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis\" and that DHS \"has not been able to identify specific denial cases ... based solely upon discretion,\" J.A. at 253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The same cannot be said, however, about the Nielsen Memo's concern with \"project[ing] a message\" to noncitizen children (and their parents) who would attempt to enter the United States unlawfully. Nielsen Memo at 3. Nothing in the Duke Memo or the Sessions Letter even\n   remotely parallels the Nielsen Memo's discussion of a \"pattern\" of illegal immigration by minors, and neither document mentions the \"tens of thousands of minor aliens [who] have illegally crossed or been smuggled across our border in recent years,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662139,3542167\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/209/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the closest either document comes is the Sessions Letter's assertion that \"[p]roper enforcement of our immigration laws is ... critical to the national interest,\" J.A. at 251, but this statement is far too vague-on some level, nearly any policy statement could be seen as an explication of an agency's view of the \"national interest.\" Consequently, the Court will decline to consider the Nielsen Memo's \"messaging\" rationale, which appears for the first time on remand and is therefore impermissibly\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Food Mktg.

To start with, Secretary Nielsen makes clear that her decision not to disturb DACA's rescission is predicated first and foremost on her view that \"the DACA policy was contrary to law.\" Nielsen Memo at 2. Thus, this case continues to be like\n   <em>\n    Crowley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    OSG\n   </em>\n   : at bottom, it involves an enforcement policy that is predicated on the agency's view of what the law requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nor do the Nielsen Memo's remaining rationales immunize from judicial review DHS's decision to rescind DACA. The first of these revolves around Secretary Nielsen's \"serious doubts about [DACA's] legality,\" which she says would lead her to rescind the policy regardless of \"whether the courts would ultimately uphold it or not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These doubts, Secretary Nielsen explains, raise concerns like \"the risk that such policies may undermine public confidence in and reliance on the agency and the rule of law, and the threat of burdensome litigation that distracts from the agency's work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the government, this rationale renders DACA's rescission unreviewable because it \"cannot be meaningfully distinguished from other 'bona fide discretionary reasons' that this Court found acceptable\" in its prior opinion, \"such as an agency's fear that 'negative publicity ... would undermine the policy's effectiveness.' \" Gov't's Mot. at 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   233 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But as the Court's opinion explained in the very next paragraph, it is difficult to conclude that such policy assertions are \"bona fide\" when they are accompanied by an assertion from the agency that its longstanding policy is \"\n   <em>\n    unlawful\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this respect, the\n   \"serious doubts\" rationale suffers from the same defect as the \"litigation risk\" rationale: accepting it here would permit agencies to insulate their legal judgments from judicial review simply by couching them as enforcement policies and then adding a boilerplate assertion that any other course of action would lead to litigation and undermine confidence in the rule of law. Judicial review of agency legal determinations cannot be so easily evaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Next, the Nielsen Memo asserts a handful of \"sound reasons of enforcement policy\" that it argues would justify DACA's rescission \"regardless of whether ... the DACA policy [is] illegal or legally questionable.\" Nielsen Memo at 2. First among these is the memo's claim that, \"if a policy concerning the ability of this class of aliens to remain in the United States is to be adopted, it should be enacted legislatively.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. But the Court rejected the government's reliance on this argument in its prior opinion, concluding that the government had failed to explain why \"an agency's view as to which branch of government ought to address a particular policy issue is an assessment appropriately committed to the agency's discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   243 n.28.

This is so, Secretary Nielsen claims, not because \"a categorical deferred-action policy\" like DACA raises legal or constitutional concerns-as previously argued-but rather because such a policy \"tilts the scales significantly and has the practical effect of inhibiting assessments of whether deferred action is appropriate in a particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In essence, the Secretary claims that even though DACA \"on its face ... allow[s] for individual considerations,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   it should nonetheless be rescinded because its programmatic nature somehow misleads those charged with its implementation into applying it categorically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As an initial matter, this rationale strikes the Court as specious. It would be one thing for a challenger\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   DHS to claim that although DACA calls for case-by-case discretion in theory, its application is categorical in practice. Indeed, this argument was made by the plaintiffs in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas v.

But when made by the agency itself, the argument becomes a\n   <em>\n    non sequitur\n   </em>\n   : if Secretary Nielsen believes that DACA is not being implemented as written, she can simply direct her employees to implement it properly. An agency head cannot point to her own employees' misapplication of a program as a reason for its invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Specious though it may be, this rationale nonetheless presents as the sort of policy consideration that, when offered as an independent reason for adopting a general enforcement policy, might foreclose judicial review. When viewed in the broader context of this litigation, however, this rationale reveals itself to be yet another attempt to disguise an objection to DACA's legality as a policy justification for its rescission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Throughout the litigation over DAPA and DACA, the programs' challengers have consistently claimed that although DACA \"facially purports to confer discretion,\" in practice deferred action was categorically granted to anyone who met the\n   program's eligibility criteria.\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/#p171\">\n    809 F.3d at 171-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[ECF No. 55] at 22 (\"While [the Fifth Circuit's] finding [that DACA was applied categorically] had to be 'extrapolated' to invalidate DAPA, it\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   dooms DACA itself ....\" (citation omitted) ). Likewise, the Duke Memo cast DACA's alleged categorical application as an issue of lawfulness, explaining that deferred action was \"meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis,\" not to \"confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress had not otherwise acted to provide by law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 253. Even a 2014 memorandum by the Office of Legal Counsel (the \"OLC Memo\") cautioned that \"it was critical that ... the DACA program require immigration officials to evaluate each application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting deferred action automatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria.\" J.A. at 21 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Taken in context, then, Secretary Nielsen's claim that rescinding DACA would further her policy objective of ensuring the distribution of deferred action grants on a \"case-by-case\" basis is simply a repackaging in policy terms of an oft-repeated objection to DACA's lawfulness. And while a remand provides an agency the opportunity to elaborate on its prior positions in good faith, it is not an opportunity for the agency to alter those positions-particularly where the chief design of doing so appears to be to defeat judicial review. The Court therefore concludes that the Nielsen Memo's individualized-discretion rationale does not preclude judicial review here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the memo asserts that \"it is critically important for DHS to project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear, consistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws,\" particularly given that \"tens of thousands of minor aliens have illegally crossed or been smuggled across our border in recent years.\" Nielsen Memo at 3. As the Court has already explained, this rationale is a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization and hence is not entitled to consideration on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Food Mktg.

But even if the Court were to consider this rationale, it would not immunize DACA's rescission from judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With this messaging rationale, Secretary Nielsen finally articulates (albeit in a single sentence) what might be properly characterized as a policy reason for DACA's rescission: a judgment that DACA's benefits-whatever they may be-are outweighed by the fact that, in Secretary Nielsen's view, the policy encourages noncitizen children and their parents to enter the United States illegally. Of course, this rationale is not without its logical difficulties: after all, DACA is available only to those individuals who have lived in the United States since 2007,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so the \"tens of thousands of minor aliens\" who Secretary Nielsen asserts have illegally entered the United States \"in recent years\" would not even be eligible under the program. But no matter. The question for reviewability purposes is not whether the rationale makes sense, but rather whether it transforms DACA's rescission from a decision based \"solely on [DHS's] belief that it lacks jurisdiction,\"\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n    470 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   833 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , into a decision based on \"factors which are peculiarly within [DHS's] expertise,\" such as \"whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits the agency's overall policies,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n    at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even if the messaging rationale were sufficiently grounded in the Duke Memo so as to be an amplification rather than a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization, ultimately it would still be too little, too late. Although the Nielsen Memo states several paragraphs earlier that each of its reasons is \"separate and independently sufficient\" to support DACA's rescission, Nielsen Memo at 1, the document's cursory discussion of the messaging rationale-which is articulated in a single sentence on the last page of the three-page memorandum-does not support this assertion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 233-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, in\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   , the agency took the position that \"even if it had jurisdiction, it would still decline to act pursuant to its 'inherent discretion to decline to pursue certain enforcement matters' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n    470 U.S. at 824-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). The Court would not conclude that this solitary sentence in the Nielsen Memo wholly transmutes the explanation for DACA's rescission from an issue of law into an issue of policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In any case, the Court need not reach this conclusion because, as it has already explained, the messaging rationale is merely a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization of DACA's rescission. And because, as explained above, the other rationales offered by the Nielsen Memo are \"insufficiently independent from the agency's evaluation of DACA's legality\" to defeat review,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 235, the Court declines to reverse its prior conclusion that DACA's rescission is reviewable. The government's motion for reconsideration will therefore be denied as to reviewability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Nielsen Memo again ignores the 2014 OLC Memo laying out a comprehensive framework for evaluating the lawfulness of nonenforcement policies in the immigration context,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 4-36-an omission that plaintiffs properly characterize as \"mystifying,\" Pls.'

But as this Court has already said, the Sessions Letter's conclusory legal assertions are themselves inadequately explained, and the Fifth Circuit's analysis in the DAPA case is \"inapposite\" here given the meaningful distinctions between DAPA and DACA, which include DAPA's open-ended nature, broad scope, and apparent conflict with express provisions of the INA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   238-40 (citing\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/#p171\">\n    809 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   179 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In response, Secretary Nielsen states that \"[a]ny arguable distinctions between the DAPA and DACA policies are not sufficiently material to convince me that the DACA policy is lawful.\" Nielsen Memo at 2. But she does not explain why. Secretary Nielsen also asserts that the Fifth Circuit's DAPA ruling was based not on any particular statutory conflict, but rather on DAPA's \"incompatibility ... with the INA's comprehensive scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/#p171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But as plaintiffs correctly point out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 15-16, even if this were an accurate characterization of the Fifth Circuit's opinion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Nielsen Memo offers no clue as to how an agency official, a court, or anyone else would go about determining whether a particular nonenforcement policy meets Secretary Nielsen's test for \"compatibility\" with the overall statutory scheme. Thus, like the Duke Memo before it, the Nielsen Memo offers nothing even remotely approaching a considered legal assessment that this Court could subject to judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nor do the Nielsen Memo's remaining rationales persuade the Court to revise its prior conclusion that DACA's rescission was arbitrary and capricious. As the Court has already indicated, those rationales carry varying degrees of persuasive force, and some may fall below the APA's standard of rationality. But as the D.C. Circuit has explained, \"[w]here ... an agency has set out multiple independent grounds for a decision,\" courts will uphold that decision \"so long as any one of the grounds is valid, unless it is demonstrated that the agency would not have acted on that basis if the alternative grounds were unavailable.\"\n   <em>\n    Fogo De Chao (Holdings) Inc. v.

Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, Secretary Nielsen states in a somewhat conclusory fashion that each of the grounds offered in her memo is \"independently sufficient\" to support DACA's rescission. Nielsen Memo at 1. The Court is skeptical of this assertion, particularly given its conclusion that three of those grounds-the substantial-doubts, legislative-inaction, and individualized-discretion rationales-simply recapitulate the Secretary's inadequately explained legal assessment, and that the remaining ground-projecting a message to would-be illegal immigrants-appears nowhere in the Duke Memo and is therefore\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   . Even assuming that these rationales are indeed independent and that at least one is sufficiently rational to survive APA review, however, DACA's rescission would still be arbitrary and capricious because the Nielsen Memo-like the Duke Memo before it-fails to engage meaningfully with the reliance interests and other countervailing factors that weigh against ending the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although this time around the Nielsen Memo at least \"acknowledge[s] how heavily DACA beneficiaries had come to rely on\" the program,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   it does little more than that. Instead of considering DACA's benefits to DACA recipients and to society at large,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 19-20, Secretary Nielsen simply states that \"the asserted reliance interests\" are outweighed by DACA's \"questionable legality ... and the other reasons for ending the policy,\" and then goes on to suggest that she should not even have to consider those interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (asserting that \"issues of reliance would be best considered by Congress\"). However, it is not up to Secretary Nielsen-or even to this Court-to decide what she should or should not consider when reversing agency policy.

The Court has already once given DHS the opportunity to remedy these deficiencies-either by providing a coherent explanation of its legal opinion or by reissuing its decision for bona fide policy reasons that would preclude judicial review-so it will not do so again. Consequently, the government's motion to reconsider the Court's April 24, 2018 order will be denied. Per the government's request, however, the Court will continue the stay of its order of vacatur for a brief period-twenty days-to permit the government to determine whether it intends to appeal the Court's decision and, if so, to seek a stay pending appeal. In all other respects, the Court's April 24, 2018 order will remain in force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, a few words about the nature of the relief being granted by this Court. The Court did not hold in its prior opinion, and it does not hold today, that DHS lacks the statutory or constitutional authority to rescind the DACA program.
