A at 10. CCHP included this pay in cost reports that it submitted to Medicare for reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For 2004, CCHP claimed $2,420,063 in Medicare reimbursements for Dr. Thareja's salary-$300,00 for his work as CEO of CCHP, $300,000 for his work as CEO of QMC, $300,000 as a bonus for his work as CEO, and just over $1.5 million for his cardiology services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 10. For 2005, CCHP claimed $3,128,208 in Medicare reimbursements-$435,00 for his work as CEO of CCHP, $300,000 for his work as CEO of QMC, $300,000 as a bonus for his work as CEO, and nearly $2.1 million for his cardiology services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Initially, CCHP also sought Medicare reimbursement for other benefits that it provided Dr. Thareja, such as a car, life insurance, travel, entertainment, donations, gifts, meals, and exercise equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 11 n.4; AR 865;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot.

CMS based this determination on a statement to the CMS auditor by Janet Cody, QMC's CFO, that she thought Dr. Thareja spent about 55% of his time practicing cardiology and 45% of his time performing managerial and administrative tasks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20417.544\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20417.544\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given the evidence that Dr. Thareja spent significant time working as a CEO and the inadequacy of the evidence that he worked full time as a cardiologist, the Administrator correctly determined that a full-time salary for Dr. Thareja's cardiology services was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , CCHP argues that the Administrator's decision erroneously relies on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20413.102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 413.102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and on Chapter 9 of the Provider Reimbursement Manuel, or PRM, to establish the principle that a physician-owner should allocate his reimbursement claims between work as a physician and work as an owner.

Although the Administrator's opinion does reference these regulations, they provide only one of the grounds for his decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. A 14-15. The other regulations cited above set forth the requirement that costs be reasonable and adequately documented, and the Administrator also cited these requirements to show that Dr. Thareja's cardiology work did not entitle him to the same salary as a full-time cardiologist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20413.102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20413.102\">\n    at 15-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since a full-time physician salary was not a reasonable and documented cost and since CCHP itself offered testimony that Dr. Thareja spent 55% of his time working as a cardiologist, the Administrator acted reasonably-and perhaps generously-in determining that Medicare should compensate Dr. Thareja for his cardiology services at 55% of a top-paid, full-time cardiologist's salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Pl.'s Mot. Summary J. 7, 25-27. But whatever other merits the MGMA survey may have, it has the distinct disadvantage that it aggregates salary data across the entire southern United States, while Salary.com provides an estimate of what a cardiologist in the same metropolitan area as Dr. Thareja would make.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR 240\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR 250. This makes the MGMA data less useful for determining what compensation would be \"commensurate with the compensation paid for similar services performed by similar physicians practicing in the same or a similar locality.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20417.544\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 417.544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Pl.'s Mot. Summary J. 27-29. CMS tried to calculate a 100th percentile salary as 133% of a 75th percentile salary. AR 185-86, 548. CCHP points out that it is impossible to calculate a 100th percentile salary and that, assuming a normal distribution, a salary in the 99.8th percentile would be higher than the value CMS calculated. Pl.'s Mot. Summary J. 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Administrator distanced himself from CMS's misguided calculations, noting that CMS \"determined the amount it calculated to be the 100th percentile of salaries\" without endorsing the calculation. Compl. Ex. A 12. The Administrator did not determine that CMS correctly calculated a 100th percentile salary or that Dr. Thareja deserved 55% of a 100th percentile salary. Instead, he simply determined that it was reasonable to pay Dr. Thareja, as a highly regarded physician, a salary considerably above the 75th percentile for the time that he worked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17; AR 159. Although the Administrator's estimate of Dr. Thareja's reasonable salary may be a rough approximation, it finds support in the record and does not violate the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the reasons above, the Administrator's reimbursement decision does not violate the APA. CCHP depicts the decision as a miserly effort to deny a hard-working doctor his due, but the record shows that\n   the decision provides high compensation to a doctor who inflated his Medicare reimbursement claims by millions of dollars. CCHP's Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied, and the Secretary's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted. A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The Complaint named then-Secretary Thomas E. Price as the Defendant in his official capacity.

Azar II, as the Defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Even if Dr. Thareja worked these hours, CCHP has not given a convincing justification for claiming $1.5 million in 2004, when Dr. Thareja allegedly worked 68.8 hours a week, and $2.1 million in 2005, when Dr. Thareja allegedly worked 61.2 hours a week. CCHP claims almost 55% more for each hour it alleges that Dr. Thareja worked as a cardiologist in 2005 than in 2004, which undermines any suggestion that its reimbursement claims have a rational connection to the amount of work Dr. Thareja performed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    If that were 55% of his work as Ms. Cody estimated, he would have worked another 57 hours each week as a CEO, for a total 127 hours per week, or over 18 hours every day of 50 weeks each year. CCHP has distanced itself from this position, saying that Ms. Cody's statement to the auditor was an estimate and that it never directly claimed Dr. Thareja worked that much. Pl.'s Mot.
