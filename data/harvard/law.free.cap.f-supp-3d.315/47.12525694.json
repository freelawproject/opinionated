Accordingly, the Court will order the defendants to now comply with the requirements of Local Civil Rule 7(n). Second, because the defendants have yet to respond to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, which raises many of the same legal issues which the Court has determined were inadequately addressed in the defendants' motion to dismiss, the\n   Court does not find it appropriate to consider the plaintiff's motion at this time.

In any event, the exhaustion requirement appears to be satisfied here because the Court concludes that the plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to show that the Department denied the plaintiff's expatriation request, and the defendants concede that although further administrative review of such denials is available, the \"availability of judicial review is not conditioned on pursuing\" further administrative review of that denial.

Even if the Court agreed with the defendants on this point, that would not negate the viability of the plaintiff's claim because it does not resolve the question of whether the Secretary may impose an in-consular appearance requirement on the plaintiff.

The Court rejects these requests for three reasons. First, the plaintiff has not argued that he will be prejudiced by any delay caused by allowing the defendants to now comply with Rule 7(n) and respond to the plaintiff's summary judgment motion, and no such prejudice is apparent to the Court. Second, this Court \"enjoys broad discretion in managing its docket and determining the order in which a case should proceed,\"\n    <em>\n     Grimes v.

Mem. at 29 n.23 (only asserting that \"there is no need to refer to an administrative record to adjudicate this motion\"), the Court must assume that the exhibits represent only a partial record, and this Circuit has instructed that \"[f]or review to go forward on a partial record, [the Court] would have to be convinced that the selection of particular portions of the record was the result of mutual agreement between the parties after both sides had fully reviewed the complete record,\"\n    <em>\n     Walter O.
