INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants Uber Technologies Inc. and Raiser, LLC (collectively \"Uber\") move to\n   compel arbitration of all claims asserted by plaintiffs Stephan Namisnak, Francis Falls, and Mitchell Miraglia. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the motion is suitable for disposition without oral argument, and the hearing set for April 19, 2018, is vacated. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted as to claims asserted by Miraglia and denied as to claims asserted by Namisnak and Falls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Namisnak, Falls, and Miraglia are persons with disabilities who live in New Orleans, Louisiana. As a result of their physical limitations, they are dependent on electric wheelchairs for mobility. One service they cannot utilize is Uber's ride-sharing service, which allows mobile phone app users to call a car to get from one place to another. Because the Uber App in New Orleans does not provide an option for riders to call a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, plaintiffs are unable to use the service. Accordingly, plaintiffs allege, Uber has violated its obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), the California Disabled Persons Act (\"CDPA\"), and the California Unfair Competition law (\"UCL\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When customers sign up to use Uber's services, they must first create an account using the Uber App. The app user's registration page displays the phrase, \"by creating an uber account, you agree to our terms &amp; conditions and privacy policy,\" which is hyperlinked so the registrant may view the agreement. Creating an account requires the customer to accept Uber's terms and conditions, including a mandatory arbitration provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2016, Miraglia used a smartphone to access the Uber App and create a rider account. As part of the registration process, as described above, Miraglia was required to agree to Uber's terms and conditions and privacy policy. Uber asserts that Miraglia is bound by the terms of that agreement and must submit his claims to arbitration pursuant to its arbitration provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Falls and Namisnak never downloaded the Uber App or created an Uber account. As a consequence, neither plaintiff manifested agreement to Uber's terms and conditions or had the opportunity to review any provisions contained therein. Nonetheless, Uber argues that because plaintiffs rely upon Uber's terms and conditions in bringing this action, they are equitably estopped from challenging the agreement's arbitration requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Uber's terms and conditions agreement is \"a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\" subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Chiron Corp. v.

In the context of an electronic consumer transaction, the occurrence of mutual assent ordinarily turns on whether the consumer had reasonable notice of a merchant's terms of service agreement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nguyen v.

Rather, Namisnak and Falls deny being bound by an arbitration agreement to which they did not assent, seeing as neither plaintiff ever downloaded the Uber App or had the opportunity to review its terms and conditions. Miraglia contends that although he initially agreed to Uber's terms and conditions, the arbitration provision is unenforceable against him because he deleted the Uber App. In the alternative, he argues that he cannot be compelled to submit his claims to arbitration because the defendants named in this action were not parties to the terms and conditions contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Had Falls and Namisnak downloaded and used the Uber App, they would have been required to agree to Uber's terms and conditions, including the arbitration provision. Therefore, Uber reasons, plaintiffs necessarily rely on the agreement in bringing this suit and should be equitably estopped from avoiding its obligations. This argument is unpersuasive. The fact that Uber's terms and conditions are implicated in the averments of the complaint does not by itself indicate that plaintiffs are claiming some privilege or benefit derived from Uber's terms and conditions, or that they are seeking to use the terms and conditions against Uber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The purpose of equitable estoppel is to prevent parties from invoking the terms of a contract as the basis for suit while avoiding a corresponding contractual obligation to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    Goldman v.

Falls and Namisnak assert claims against Uber based on rights created by the ADA, which are not dependent upon or bound up in the terms and obligations of Uber's service agreement. It is Uber's alleged refusal to comply with the requirements of the ADA, not the requirements of its consumer agreements, which form the basis of this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20534\">\n    92 Cal.Rptr.3d at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that plaintiff signatories were not equitably estopped from refusing to arbitrate under the terms of an agreement because their \"allegations depend solely on the actions of [defendant nonsignatories], not on the terms of the operating agreements, for their success.\"). Therefore, it does not offend the principles of equity and fairness to conclude that Uber's arbitration agreement is not binding upon Falls and Namisnak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Uber cannot use its consumer arbitration agreements so expansively as to block all prospective ADA plaintiffs from seeking relief in federal court.

Because Miraglia asserts a challenge to the validity of his contract with Uber, not the validity of the specific arbitration provision contained therein, the question of rescission must go to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Alternatively, Miraglia claims that Uber Technologies, Inc. and Raiser, LLC cannot enforce the arbitration provision against him because they are not parties to the terms and conditions agreement. The agreement purports to create a contract between the Uber App user and \"Uber USA, LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively 'Uber').\" In California, \"[a] corporation is an 'affiliate' of, or a corporation is 'affiliated' with, another specified corporation if it directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the other specified corporation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20150\">\n    Cal.

Thus, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Raiser, LLC are affiliates of Uber USA, LLC, and parties to the arbitration agreement embedded in Uber's terms and conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Miraglia asserts that defendants in this matter are not affiliated with Uber USA, LLC, because that entity does not appear on Uber's certification of interested entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 12. The Federal Rules, however, only require Uber to disclose a parent or controlling entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 7.1. Because Uber Technologies, Inc. is the parent company, it was not required to disclose Uber USA, LLC. The relevant local rules require disclosure of any entity which has \"(i) a financial interest of any kind in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding; or (ii) any other kind of interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.\" Civ. Loc. R. 3-15. Uber denies that Uber USA, LLC has a financial interest or any other kind of interest that might be affected by the outcome of this litigation, and Miraglia has pointed to no evidence indicating otherwise. Therefore, the failure to list Uber USA, LLC on the certification disclosure does not demonstrate that Uber USA, LLC, Uber Technologies, Inc., and Raiser, LLC are not affiliates who are all parties to the arbitration agreement that binds Miraglia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Not only is the arbitration agreement enforceable against Miraglia, his ADA dispute with Uber is within the scope of the agreement. The 2016 terms and services arbitration agreement, which was in effect when Miraglia created his Uber account, is drafted broadly to cover \"any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or\n   <em>\n    the use of the Services\n   </em>\n   .\" Barajas Decl. Exh. 1 \u00a7 6 (emphasis added). Miraglia's ADA claim, which arises out of his inability to access and use Uber's transportation services, is within the scope of the agreement. Accordingly, Uber's motion\n   to compel arbitration of Miraglia's claims is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, Uber's motion to compel arbitration is granted as to claims brought by Miraglia, and denied as to claims brought by Falls and Namisnak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Uber's consumer contracts contain a choice of law provision selecting California law. Barajas Decl. Exh. 1 \u00a7 7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
