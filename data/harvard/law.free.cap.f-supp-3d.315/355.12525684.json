COOPER, United States District Judge\n   Over a half-century after President Kennedy's assassination, theories still abound as to who was responsible. Investigative journalist David Talbot points the finger at the Central Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\"). In a quest for supporting evidence, Talbot filed Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") requests with the CIA and the State Department for passport and travel records of two deceased CIA agents who Talbot suspects were aware of the agency's involvement in the assassination, or worse. Talbot apparently seeks the records in order to link the agents' comings and goings to the known whereabouts of other characters in the continuing whodunit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this suit, Talbot challenges the adequacy of the agencies' searches in response to his requests and the appropriateness of their reliance on a number of FOIA exemptions to withhold otherwise responsive records. Both sides now seek summary judgment. For the reasons explained further below, the Court will grant summary judgment to the agencies with two exceptions: it concludes that (1) the State Department's search for passports issued to one of the agents under two pseudonyms was unduly restrictive and (2) certain potentially responsive records in operational files that the CIA claimed were exempt from disclosure fall under an exception to that exemption and, consequently, the CIA must either search the files for those records or explain why no responsive records are likely to be found there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   David Talbot is a journalist, author, and co-founder of the online newspaper Salon.com. Compl. \u00b6 1. He has written multiple books covering the historical period of the presidency of John F. Kennedy, including the Kennedy assassination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. In May 2013, in connection with research for a now-published book on former CIA Director Allen Dulles, Talbot submitted FOIA requests to the Department of State and the CIA. The request to the State Department sought \"[a]ll passport and visa records pertaining to\" two former CIA agents, William King Harvey and F. Mark Wyatt, from January 1, 1950 through July 1, 1976, as well as copies of all photographs of the two men.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1. The request to the CIA also sought records related to Wyatt and Harvey, specifically \"[a]ll records pertaining to temporary duty (TDY) travel,\" \"[a]ll passport and visa records,\" \"[a]ll records reflecting assignment to a[ ] station, post, base, unit or other component of the CIA,\" and \"[a]ll photographs pertaining to\" the two from January 1, 1950 to July 1, 1976 for Harvey and from January 1, 1948 to 1975 for Wyatt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   State and the CIA informed Talbot they had received his requests and began processing them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 20. When the agencies failed to fully process Talbot's requests, he brought suit against them in this Court. After production was completed, both parties filed motions for summary judgment, with Talbot challenging the agencies' searches and their withholdings. The Court held a hearing on the motions on May 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

While the Court will grant the Department summary judgment as to its withholdings, the April 2016 request, and its search for Agent Wyatt's records, it will deny both motions without prejudice as to the adequacy of the Department's search for passport records associated with Agent Harvey's two pseudonyms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    1. Adequacy of the State Department's search\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The State Department's search for passport records for both Harvey and Wyatt is described in declarations submitted by Eric F. Stein, the Director of the Department's Office of Information Programs and Services. According to Mr. Stein, the Department determined that any responsive records were likely to be found in the Department's Office of Passport Services because that office handles the issuance of passports to U.S. citizens. Decl. of Eric F. Stein \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. Department personnel conducted a search of several electronic databases that typically contain records for more recent passports, but also include some imaged records for older passports.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These personnel searched for records listing Harvey's name and birthdate, Wyatt's name and birthdate, or two pseudonyms used by Harvey that Talbot provided and Harvey's actual birthdate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, Department personnel searched the agency's archived hard copy passport files, again for passport records with Harvey's name and birthdate, Wyatt's name and birthdate, or Harvey's two pseudonyms and actual birthdate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Department found ten documents pertaining to Wyatt but none to Harvey.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Talbot advances several arguments as to why this search was inadequate, all but one of which are unavailing. First, Talbot faults the Department for searching using only Harvey's and Wyatt's first and last names rather than their full names including their middle names. Mem. P. &amp; A. Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. &amp; Supp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Cross-MSJ\") at 12-13, 16. But Mr. Stein clarifies in a supplemental declaration that any results from the search using first and last names would necessarily include results associated with their full names. Suppl. Decl. of Eric F. Stein \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, Talbot contends that the Department should have searched for records related to two specific passports, which other records produced by the Department indicated were used by Wyatt. Pl.'s Cross-MSJ at 18. In his supplemental declaration, however, Mr. Stein attests that the Department ran an additional search for any responsive records related to those two passports and found none. Suppl. Decl. of Eric F. Stein \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Third, Talbot contends that the search excluded theoretical locations where records could have been found. He speculates, for instance, that there must be some sort of \"records system relating to passport services provided to CIA officers\" that the Department neglected to search. Pl.'s Cross-MSJ at 14. Similarly, Talbot argues\n   that the Department also needed to search \"employment and personnel records relating to employees who receive 'special passports.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as the Department notes, Talbot's request was for\n   <em>\n    passport and visa records\n   </em>\n   pertaining to Wyatt and Harvey, not for any records or even for any employment or personnel records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 1. The Department does not typically create or maintain records on visas that Americans receive from foreign countries-those are housed with the foreign country authorizing the visa. Decl. of Eric F. Stein \u00b6 14 n.1. As to passport records, the Department has explained why the locations searched-the electronic and paper records of the office responsible for processing and issuing passports to U.S. citizens-were the logical places to find any responsive records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 14-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Talbot also contends that the search for Harvey's passport records was inadequate because the Department failed to find any responsive records-a result he argues \"beggars belief\" because Harvey \"was a CIA officer serving in overseas posts in the 1950s and 1960s\" and it is \"well documented that he travelled extensively during that time.\" Pl.'s Cross-MSJ at 14. But it is well-settled that the adequacy of a search \"is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.\"\n   <em>\n    Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n    315 F.3d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Records, especially ones that are several decades old, \"may have been accidentally lost or destroyed, or a reasonable and thorough search may have missed them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Department has attested that it searched the place most likely to contain passport records using reasonable terms, namely Harvey's name and birthdate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Talbot's final argument fares better. When the Department searched for passports issued under two pseudonyms that Harvey is known to have used, it limited its search to records containing those pseudonyms and Harvey's\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   birthdate. Decl. of Eric F. Stein \u00b6 18. It strikes the Court as unlikely that a CIA officer using a pseudonym would list his real birthdate with the false name rather than a false birthdate. The Department's declarations offer nothing to support a contrary conclusion. The Court therefore concludes that the Department's search for only records reflecting Harvey's actual birthdate was too narrow. As a result, the search was not reasonably calculated to find all responsive records. The Court will, accordingly, deny both motions without prejudice as to this aspect of the Department's search and will require a further search for records associated with Harvey's pseudonyms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That said, the Court appreciates that there may be many passports issued to other individuals who share a name with Harvey's pseudonym, especially the pseudonym \"William Walker,\" which the State Department would not be at liberty to produce. At the hearing, Talbot's counsel proposed several possible ways to limit the Department's search so as to exclude results that are not likely to be Harvey's passport records-namely, using a range of birthdates falling within five years of Harvey's actual birthdate (that is, two-and-a-half years on either side of his actual birthdate) and limiting the search to passport applications listing planned travel to Germany or Italy (where Talbot believes Harvey travelled during the relevant time period). Given these reasonable limitations, the Court will require the State Department to conduct another search with these parameters and to report back on whether the search yields any results. If it does, the Court will consider ways that it might determine whether the passport records are associated with Harvey and not someone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    2. The State Department's withholdings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, Talbot challenges the State Department's decision to withhold certain information pursuant to Exemption 6. As explained by Johnathan Rolbin, the Director of Legal Affairs and Law Enforcement Liaison for the Department's Passport Services Directorate, the Department redacted from the disclosed records the names and signatures of Department employees and the names, birth dates, and places of birth of Wyatt's then-minor children. Decl. of Johnathan M. Rolbin \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9-12. As to the details regarding Wyatt's children, the Department concluded that the release of that information \"would reveal private details of these individuals' lives, including when and how these individuals were documented as U.S. citizens\" and \"other biographical information in which these individuals have a privacy interest\" but would \"shed no light on the operations and activities of the U.S. government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. For the Department employees, it was felt that the release of the redacted information could \"subject them (and their family members) to harassment, violence, or even improper civil judgments outside of the workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. For instance, Mr. Rolbin explains that \"Department employees involved in passport adjudication process have been named personally in state court lawsuits seeking personal monetary civil judgments\" and \"have been subject to personal threats and harassing communications,\" even if the employees no longer work for the Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As noted above, the Court applies a two-part test to determine the applicability of Exemption 6.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Multi Ag Media\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644291,5864700\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/1224/\">\n    515 F.3d at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court disagrees. With respect to Wyatt's children, the disclosure of information regarding \"private citizens\" which \" 'reveals little or nothing about an agency's own conduct' does not serve a relevant public interest under FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Consumers' Checkbook Ctr. for the Study of Servs. v.

Rolbin \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11-sheds little if any light on the Department's own conduct.

It would not. Mr. Rolbin points to several legitimate concerns the employees might have about the disclosure of their names, including the possibility of harassment and threats. Decl. of Johnathan M. Rolbin \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. These concerns exist even if the particular passport application decisions here are favorable: the release of the names and signatures provides a possible target for other members of the public who have received unfavorable decisions. While these concerns strike the Court as somewhat attenuated, Talbot points to little value that would be gained by knowing the specific civil servants involved in the processing of the passports beyond what was already disclosed by the released redacted records. The Court therefore concludes that the public interest here does not outweigh the privacy interest of the employees.

The Court will grant the CIA summary judgment on each aspect of its search and production except for its failure to search its operational files.

Shiner, the Information Review Officer at the CIA's Litigation Information Review Office, submitted a declaration on behalf of the agency outlining its search for records. According to Ms. Shiner, the CIA determined that the Official Personnel File (\"OPF\") for Harvey and Wyatt were likely to contain any responsive records, since such files \"contain[ ], among other things, work-related travel records (TDY records) and records pertaining to the assignment\n   and reassignment of officers throughout their career at the CIA.\" Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23.

Pl.'s Cross-MSJ at 33-34. He points to specific documents suggesting an assortment of other offices-such as the agency's Office of Personnel Security-that might have other responsive records. But the CIA is obligated to search where records are most likely to be housed\n   <em>\n    today\n   </em>\n   . As Ms. Shiner explains, in the fifty plus years that have passed since the operative dates of Talbot's request, the CIA has \"undergone numerous internal reorganizations\" involving \"the creation of new divisions and components and the closure or merging of other divisions and components, as well as a corresponding reshuffling of responsibilities among the various divisions within CIA.\" Suppl. Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner \u00b6 10. Some of the divisions that might have housed records in the 1950s and 1960s no longer do so or may even no longer exist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Ms. Shiner has explained that given the age of the records, any existing records would not be digitized.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These are adequate explanations for why the agency concluded that the hard copies of Harvey's and Wyatt's personnel files were the most likely\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   repository for any existing responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Antoinette B.

Pl.'s Cross-MSJ at 30-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Starting with the Church Committee, the D.C. Circuit has already held that it meets the first requirement-that it is a \"congressional intelligence committee\"-and that its inquiry into the CIA's efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro meets the third requirement-that it is an investigation into impropriety or violation of law in the conduct of an intelligence activity.\n   <em>\n    Morely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566353,6046285\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1108/\">\n    508 F.3d at 1117, 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What remains, then, is whether the requested records meet the second requirement: whether the Church Committee \"would have deemed the records at issue to be central to its inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566353,6046285\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1108/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566353,6046285\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1108/\">\n    at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to a subset of the requested records, the answer is yes. In 1975, William Harvey testified as a witness before the Church Committee regarding his role from November 1961 to March 1963 in a covert operation directed at overthrowing the Castro regime dubbed \"Operation Mongoose\" and a related plan to assassinate Castro.\n   <em>\n    Hearing Before the S. Select Comm. to Study Gov't Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities\n   </em>\n   , 94th Cong. 86:21, 105:3-13, 107:20-24, 140:23-24 (1976) (testimony of William K. Harvey). The Committee released an interim report specifically addressing several CIA planned assassinations, including that of Castro, which discussed Harvey, his testimony, and his role in those operations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders\n   </em>\n   , S. Rep. No. 94-465, at 164-65 (1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Given the Church Committee's interest in Harvey, it seems clear that it would have considered records reflecting his TDY travel and station or base assignments (both subjects of Talbot's request,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 6) with respect to the specific operations at issue central to its investigation. Indeed, the Committee asked Harvey about his travel at the hearing,\n   <em>\n    Hearing Before the S. Select Comm. to Study Gov't Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities\n   </em>\n   , 94th Cong. 63:11-13, 66:11-13 (1976) (testimony of William K. Harvey), and discussed trips he took for meetings in the interim report it released,\n   <em>\n    Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders\n   </em>\n   , S. Rep. No. 94-465, at 83-84 (1975). Thus, the second requirement of the D.C. Circuit's three-part test is also met. The Court therefore concludes that a specific, narrow subset of the possible requested records in operational files-those that would relate to Operation Mongoose or the Castro assassination plots, during the time period of November 1961 to June 1963-fall within the exception in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and are not categorically exempt from FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The other investigations that Talbot points to do not meet the requirements in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and thus records associated with those operations remain exempt. For one, the D.C. Circuit has indicated that the House Select Committee on Assassinations does not meet the definition of a congressional intelligence committee.\n   <em>\n    Morley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566353,6046285\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1108/\">\n    508 F.3d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the Warren Commission, while Harvey may have been mentioned in witness testimony before the Commission, he was not a witness himself and his name does not seem to appear once in the Commission's 900-page final report. This relative dearth of discussion about Harvey indicates that any records concerning him were incidental rather than central to the investigation. These additional investigations that Talbot points to thus do not suffice to place any further requested records within the scope of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To conclude: because Harvey's activities and involvement with Operation Mongoose and the Castro assassination plots in 1961 to 1963 were central to the Church Committee investigation, any responsive records related to those operations contained in the agency's operational files fall within\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and the CIA must search those files to the extent necessary to conduct an adequate search. However, other records located within operational files remain exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Shiner Declarations suggest that the CIA has not considered whether any\n   responsive records would even be found in the operational files discussed above because it believed all records in operational files were exempt wholesale.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner \u00b6 24 (\"The decision to task HR and focus the search on Harvey and Wyatt's OPFs was informed by CIA's knowledge of specific databases and/or files-other than operational files of the CIA which are exempt from the search, review, publication, and disclosure requirements of the FOIA ...\"); Suppl. Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner \u00b6 8 (\"Again, based on the CIA's knowledge of specific databases and/or files, excluding exempt operational files, the CIA determined that the OPF files were the most likely repository of the information Plaintiff sought.\"). Consequently, the Court will require the CIA to either search the operational files for the specific universe of non-exempt records-those responsive records related to Operation Mongoose or the Castro assassination during the period of November 1961 to June 1963-or provide an explanation for why it need not do so to perform an adequate search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    3.

In analyzing a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index's sufficiency, the Court's \"focus is on the functions served by the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index: to organize the withheld documents in a way that facilitates litigant challenges and court review of the agency's withholdings.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

For another, Talbot's argument would vitiate the scope of the National Security Act's protection under Exemption 3: if the disclosure of unclassified information pursuant to a valid FOIA request is necessarily authorized, then any protection accorded by the National Security Act under Exemption 3 would be co-extensive with Exemption 1's protection for classified information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Finally-and most importantly-the statutory text does not comport with Talbot's interpretation that declassification automatically makes any disclosure authorized. As the Supreme Court has recognized, \"Congress [did not] state that only confidential or nonpublic intelligence sources are protected. [The statute] contains no such limiting language.\"\n    <em>\n     Sims\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p168\">\n     471 U.S. at 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p168\">\n     105 S.Ct. 1881\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fitzgibbon v.

Ultimately, the question the Court confronts here is whether the information at issue would disclose intelligence methods and sources.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Larson v.

Ms. Shiner's declarations adequately attest that it would.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner \u00b6\u00b6 28-33, 37; Suppl. Decl. of Antoinette B.

According to Ms. Shiner, the CIA withheld the \"names and personally identifiable information of CIA officers and other individuals found in the responsive records\" under Exemption 6. Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner \u00b6 39.

For the reasons discussed above as to the State Department's Exemption 6 withholdings, the Court concludes these withholdings were proper.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Segregability\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Finally, Talbot challenges the agencies' compliance with the requirement to release any \"reasonably segregable portion of a record,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(9).

Mr. Rolbin similarly attests that the State Department released all reasonably segregable information. Decl. of Johnathan M. Rolbin \u00b6\u00b6 9-12. The burden is on Talbot to proffer contrary evidence to rebut the applicable presumption.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sussman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565051,6047422\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1106/\">\n     494 F.3d at 1117\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing standards to rebut this presumption).

It will grant the agencies summary judgment except as to the State Department's search for passport records under Harvey's pseudonyms and the CIA's search of the operational files. On these two points, the Court will deny both motions without prejudice and require the State Department to conduct a supplemental search and the CIA to either do the same or justify why no such search is needed.
