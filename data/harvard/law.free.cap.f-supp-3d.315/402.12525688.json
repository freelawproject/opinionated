INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Stephanie A. Gilliard seeks a protective order, a temporary restraining order, and a preliminary injunction authorizing her to decline to hand over to her employer, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), audio tapes containing conversations between her and her supervisors that she recorded surreptitiously while at work. Ms. Gilliard also asks this Court to bar the FDIC from taking disciplinary action against her for making the recordings and for refusing to allow her employer to access them. Finding that Ms. Gilliard has not demonstrated that the relief that she seeks is warranted, the Court denies her motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Gilliard, an African-American woman, is a Senior Administrative Specialist in the Administrative Management Section (\"AMS\"); Strategic Planning, Budget, and Reporting Branch (\"SPBR\"); Division of Risk Management Supervision (\"RMS\") at the FDIC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7, ECF No. 53. She has worked at the FDIC since June 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gilliard Affidavit at 1, Ex. A, Def.'s Combined Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Protective Order &amp; Mot. for Temp. Restraining Order &amp; Prelim. Injunction (\"Def.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 52-1. According to Ms. Gilliard, her tenure has been marked by \"years\" of \"harassment, discrimination, infliction of severe emotional distress, threats, disparate treatment and more from her supervisors.\" Mot. for Protective Order at 3, ECF No. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Gilliard filed this action in October 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. In her complaint, she alleged that during a period from about March 2013 to December 2014, she suffered a host of alleged adverse employment actions-the denial of several promotions, the loss of employment responsibilities, unfavorable performance reviews, and exposure to a hostile work environment-due to racial discrimination and/or as retaliation for her protected EEO activity.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. Many of Ms. Gilliard's claims focus on her interactions with Ms. Janice Butler (the former Chief of AMS and Ms. Gilliard's former first-line supervisor) and Mr. Phillip Mento (the former Associate Director of SPBR, RMS and Ms. Gilliard's former second-line supervisor).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 10-30. One such allegation states that Ms. Butler and Mr. Mento learned that Ms. Gilliard had been recording conversations she had with them and that she planned to use the recordings to support her claims before the Equal Employment Office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45, 67-69. Purportedly to stop her from doing so, on or about October 29, 2014, Ms. Butler and Mr. Mento ordered Ms. Gilliard not to record conversations she had with any FDIC employees and warned her that she would face disciplinary action if they learned that she had defied their order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 68. Ms. Gilliard asserted that the order was given as retaliation for her engagement in protected EEO activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 69. In addition, Ms. Gilliard contended that the command constituted part of a hostile work environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly after Ms. Gilliard filed her complaint, Defendant FDIC moved to have it dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss or, in the Alternative for Summ. J., ECF No. 18. While Defendant's motion was pending, Ms. Gilliard filed the motions for a protective order and for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction that are presently before the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order; Mot. for Temp. Restraining Order &amp; Prelim. Injunction (\"Mot. for PI\"), ECF No. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Gilliard's motions concern events that occurred in 2017 and early 2018. In July 2017, Ms. Gilliard emailed Maureen Sweeney, the Deputy Director of RMS, seeking \"medical leave due to stress\" and asking for \"intervention\" in Ms. Gilliard's dealings with Mr. Mento.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Gilliard to Sweeney (July 17, 2017), Ex. H, ECF No. 52-8. Ms. Gilliard asserted that Mr. Mento \"continued to lie to [her] about [her] performance expectations, milestones and instructions,\" and contended that when around Mr. Mento, she \"fear[ed] for her physical safety\" and \"fe[lt] like a victim of rape.\" Email from Gilliard to Sweeney (July 17, 2017), Ex. H. The next month, Ms. Gilliard followed up with Ms. Sweeney, suggesting that she could provide audio tapes of meetings during which Mr. Mento had purportedly lied to and berated her. Email from Gilliard to Sweeney (Aug. 23, 2017), Ex. J, ECF No. 52-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Days later, Mr. Joseph Masisak, the Assistant Director for Labor and Employee Relations at the FDIC, emailed Ms. Gilliard, noting that his staff was investigating her recent complaint and asking for evidence that would assist in the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Masisak to Gilliard (Aug. 25, 2017), Ex. K, ECF No. 52-11. Asserting that she had \"endured ... more than 4 years of [Mr.] Mento 'trumping' up charges against [her],\" Ms. Gillard declined to turn over any evidence in her\n   possession, but noted that she would hand over her recordings for purposes of entering a settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Gilliard to Masisak (Aug. 25, 2017), Ex. K, ECF No. 2-11. In response, Mr. Masisak repeated his request, explaining that the FDIC's Anti-Harassment Program requires employees to cooperate in fact-finding inquiries concerning allegations of harassment, that Ms. Gilliard's email to Ms. Sweeney suggested that she possessed audio recordings that revealed Mr. Mento's harassment, and that the tapes would assist the investigators in coming to the most appropriate outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Masisak to Gilliard (Aug. 30, 2017), Ex. L, ECF No. 52-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because, in Ms. Gilliard's view, \"it was clear that the [FDIC] was only concerned with protecting itself,\" instead of immediately submitting her audio tapes to Mr. Masisak, she filed a workers' compensation claim with the Department of Labor's Officer of Workers' Compensation Programs. Reply to Def.'s Combined Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Protective Order &amp; Mot. for Temp. Restraining Order &amp; Prelim. Injunction (\"Pl.'s Reply\") at 4, ECF No. 55;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Notice of Occupational Disease and Claim for Compensation (\"Workers' Comp. Claim\") at 1 (Sept. 1, 2017), Ex. O, ECF No. 52-15. In her claim, Ms. Gilliard alleged, among other things, that in 2013, Mr. Mento had \"disparaged\" her and had \"verbally abused and assaulted\" her, causing her to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. Workers' Comp. Claim at 1. Ms. Gilliard wrote that because she feared that no one would believe her assertions, she had recorded conversations with Mr. Mento.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Workers' Compl. Claim at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before the Department of Labor resolved Ms. Gilliard's workers' compensation claim, Ms. Gilliard supplied Mr. Masisak and others with a few audio recordings that captured meetings between Ms. Gilliard and Mr. Mento.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Gilliard to Masisak,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   (Oct. 17, 2017), Ex. M, ECF No. 52-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Email from Masisak to Gilliard (Oct. 18, 2017) (requesting any additional audio recordings that might support Ms. Gilliard's claims), Ex. N, ECF No. 52-14. According to emails accompanying the audio recordings, they were captured at meetings that took place in early 2017.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Email from Gilliard to Masisak,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   (Oct. 17, 2017), Ex. M at 1. Thereafter, Ms. Gilliard received notice denying her workers' compensation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Decision, Ex. BB, ECF No. 52-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nearly two months after the denial of Ms. Gilliard's workers' compensation claim, Benjamin Vaughn, the Acting Associate Director of SPBR, sent Ms. Gilliard a memorandum ordering her to attend an investigatory interview about the allegations that she had made in her claim about Mr. Mento.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order to Participate in Investigatory Interview, Ex. U, ECF No. 52-21. The memorandum warned that \"[f]ailure to fully cooperate and respond truthfully could lead to a disciplinary action up to and including removal from federal service.\" Order to Participate in Investigatory Interview, Ex. U. Though Ms. Gilliard regarded the request as curious because her claim had already been denied, she nonetheless attended the meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order at 6; Admin. Inquiry (Feb. 21, 2018) at 1, Ex. V, ECF No. 52-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the meeting, an employee from FDIC's Labor and Employees Relations section first asked Ms. Gilliard several questions about her allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. Inquiry (Feb. 21, 2018), at 1-3, Ex. V. Then, Mr. Vaughn ordered Ms. Gilliard to provide copies of all audio recordings featuring any FDIC employees that she had made after October 29, 2014, without obtaining permission to record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. Inquiry (Feb. 21, 2018) at 1-4, Ex. V;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Order to Provide Audio Files, Ex. W, ECF No. 52-23. Mr. Vaughn offered Ms. Gilliard three options for providing the audio recordings: (1) she could email a complete, unedited copy of each audio file; (2) she could provide her phone to the FDIC's Division of Internet Technology (\"DIT\"), and DIT would make a copy of each audio file; or (3) she could provide her phone to a mutually acceptable transcription service, which would provide a transcript of each audio recording at the FDIC's expense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. Inquiry (Feb. 21, 2018) at 4, Ex. V;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Order to Provide Audio Files, Ex. W. Mr. Vaughn ordered Ms. Gilliard to elect one of the three options by close of business on the day after the meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order to Provide Audio Files, Ex. W. And he directed her to provide the audio files no later than one day after she selected an option.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order to Provide Audio Files, Ex. W. At the meeting, Ms. Gilliard asserted that she would not comply with the order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. Inquiry (Feb. 21, 2018) at 4, Ex. V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When Ms. Gilliard failed to comply with the deadlines that Mr. Vaughn had established, he sent her another order once again demanding that she produce the recordings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Second Order to Produce Recordings, Ex. X, ECF No. 52-24. Mr. Vaughn's memorandum stated that Ms. Gilliard's refusals constituted \"insubordination\" and that her \"misconduct will result in a proposal for disciplinary action.\" Second Order to Produce Recordings, Ex. X. The memorandum addressed a host of concerns that Ms. Gilliard had voiced about the order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Order to Produce Recordings, Ex. X. In addition, it provided three reasons for the FDIC's request: (1) to obtain information necessary to perform a complete investigation of Ms. Gilliard's allegations against Mr. Mento, (2) because the audio recordings showed that Ms. Gilliard had violated the October 2014 order directing her not to surreptitiously record her conversations with FDIC employees, and (3) because the recordings might contain confidential information about FDIC employees. Second Order to Produce Recordings at 2, Ex. X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Gilliard again declined to comply with Mr. Vaughn's order. Instead, she filed a Motion for a Protective Order and a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, both of which are presently before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order; Mot. for PI. Ms. Gilliard asks this Court to \"prevent [the FDIC] from compelling [her] to give [it] copies of audio tape recordings of conversations between her and FDIC employees\" and to \"protect[ ]\" her from disciplinary action related to her refusal to turn over the recordings. Mot. for Protective Order at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mot. for PI at 1. Ms. Gilliard's motions are now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Plaintiff's Motion for a Protective Order is Denied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ms. Gilliard asks this Court to enter a protective order forbidding the FDIC from compelling her to turn over copies of audio tapes containing conversations between her and her supervisors that she recorded surreptitiously while at work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order at 1. Ms. Gillard also requests \"protect[ion] ... from the Defendant taking disciplinary action against her for making the recordings and/or refusing to allow Defendant access to them.\" Mot. for Protective Order at 1.

Cir. 1999) (\"The 'good cause' standard in the Rule is a flexible one that requires an individualized balancing of the many interests that may be present in a particular case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Assuming that the FDIC's order constituted a discovery request,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds that Ms. Gilliard has not shown the good cause necessary for entry of a protective order. Ms. Gilliard first urges that a protective order is warranted because she\n   \"had a right to make the recordings.\" Mot. for Protective Order at 1. She apparently bases this argument on the fact that District of Columbia law does not criminalize the surreptitious recording of a conversation by a party to that conversation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Gilliard to Polley (Oct. 30, 2014) (making such an argument in response to an order directing her to cease surreptitiously recording), Ex. F, ECF No. 52-6. However, the Court sees no reason why the legality of recording in the District of Columbia might preclude an employer from restricting its employees from recording or might suffice as a basis for barring an employer from demanding recordings made in defiance of a direction not to record without permission. Furthermore, Ms. Gilliard neglects to explain why the legality of her conduct might make turning over the tapes annoying, embarrassing, oppressive, expensive, or might cause undue burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, Ms. Gilliard asserts that a protective order is warranted because the FDIC is not entitled to the recordings outside of the normal course of discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order at 1, 7-11. According to Ms. Gilliard, the FDIC seeks to jump the gun on accessing the tapes in order to \"know exactly what other damaging evidence\" Ms. Gilliard has to support her claims. Mot. for Protective Order at 7. As a threshold matter, the parties have now begun discovery, diminishing any force behind the argument that a protective order delaying the FDIC's access to the tapes is warranted at this point. Furthermore, it is not at all clear how the purportedly premature look at relevant evidence might prejudice Ms. Gilliard. The Court is not persuaded that the FDIC's demand might cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, expense, or undue burden to Ms. Gilliard of the sort that would justify entry of a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ms. Gilliard next contends that the timeline that the FDIC offered her for submitting the tapes was \"ridiculous\" and \"definitely oppressive\" and that the options for submitting them were \"impracticable, unworkable, and unenforceable.\" Mot. for Protective Order at 8-9. But it appears to this Court that the FDIC offered significant flexibility with respect to options for turning over the tapes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 20-22. Though Ms. Gilliard declares that the agency unreasonably asked her to turn over more than three years' worth of recordings in a matter of days and ordered her to do so using methods that might expose her other communications-including privileged communications with her attorney-she neglects to even clarify how many tapes she recorded over that time period, how long it might reasonably take her to produce the tapes, and whether she could have offered other methods for producing the tapes that would have been unobjectionable to her and to the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order at 9, 12. Thus, the Court has no basis for saying that the request was unreasonable or unworkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Perhaps more importantly, though, Ms. Gilliard fails to explain why the purported \"impracticabil[ity]\" of the FDIC's timeline might justify an order entirely barring it from demanding the tapes and prohibiting it from pursuing disciplinary action against her for refusing to provide the tapes. To\n   the extent that Ms. Gilliard could not comply with the February 2018 order to submit the tapes in a matter of days, she has now had substantial notice that her employer expects her to turn over the tapes and plenty of opportunity to devise a plan for submitting them. The Court disagrees with Ms. Gilliard that any deviation from a court-imposed discovery schedule might warrant her requested protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Ms. Gilliard contends that the FDIC only requested the tapes to harass her and to retaliate against her for bringing claims against the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order at 2; Pl.'s Reply at 2-3. However, this bald assertion does not justify the entry of a protective order. For one thing, Ms. Gilliard does not appear to contest that the audio tapes are relevant to this matter, and she has not shown that the discovery request is overbroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order at 4, 7. Indeed, Ms. Gilliard contends that she recorded the tapes with an eye toward using them to support her claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Protective Order at 4, 7.

First, with respect to the agency's October 2014 order that Ms. Gilliard cease recording her colleagues, the agency explained to Ms. Gilliard\n   that it issued the order because \"[t]he FDIC has an interest in fostering trust and maintaining communication channels required for effective workplace relationships and for accomplishing the work of the FDIC.\" Email from Polley to Gilliard (Nov. 6, 2014), Ex. F, ECF No. 52-6. The agency gave Ms. Gilliard the instruction as soon as it became aware that she had been recording FDIC meetings without the consent of other parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Polley to Gilliard (Nov. 6, 2014), Ex. F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ms. Gilliard confirms that she recorded conversations with her colleagues and explains that she did so in an effort to gather evidence to support her Title VII claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for PI at 5. She disputes the agency's rationale for ordering her to cease recording. According to Ms. Gilliard, the FDIC's proffered explanation is \"a farce and without merit\" because \"[c]learly, there is no trust between the Plaintiff and Mr. Mento and other FDIC employees.\" Mot. for PI at 9. She notes that the FDIC has no agency-wide policy barring recording, and that her conduct was not unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for PI at 9-11. Ms. Gilliard also appears to argue that the agency's true reason for giving the order was to prevent her from gathering evidence to support her EEO claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for PI at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Email from Gilliard to Polley (Oct. 30, 2014), Ex. F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. Gilliard relies solely on speculation, and fails to offer any evidence to rebut the agency's nonretalitory explanation for its order. Ms. Gilliard's contention that the work environment lacked trusting relationships seems to support-not undermine-the FDIC's position that it ordered her to stop recording her colleagues to build trust in the workplace. And Ms. Gilliard's other assertions are equally unavailing. First, Ms. Gilliard fails to explain why the mere fact that her conduct is not legally barred might preclude her employer from nonetheless barring the conduct in the workplace for legitimate, nonretalitory reasons. Second, that the FDIC has no agency-wide policy barring recording does not show that it ordered Ms. Gilliard to stop recording as retaliation for her protected EEO activity. The agency issued this order shortly after discovering that Ms. Gilliard had been recording meetings with her colleagues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Butler to Gilliard (Oct. 29, 2014), Ex. F, ECF No. 52-6. Ms. Gilliard points to no other employee who was also found to be recording, let alone identifies anyone else who the agency permitted to record. Third, Ms. Gilliard does little more than speculate about alternative motivations for the agency's direction. This does not satisfy her burden of showing that the agency's explanation was pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to the agency's February 2018 order directing Ms. Gilliard to turn over any audio tapes that she recorded after October 2014 without her colleagues' permission, the agency offered Ms. Gilliard three reasons why it issued the order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order to Provide Audio Files, Ex. W; Second Order to Produce Recordings, Ex. X. The FDIC explained that it had demanded the tapes (1) to obtain information necessary to perform a complete investigation of Ms. Gilliard's allegations against Mr. Mento, (2) because the audio recordings showed that Ms. Gilliard had violated the October 2014 order directing her not to surreptitiously record her conversations with FDIC employees, and (3) because the recordings might contain confidential information about FDIC employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Order to Produce Recordings at 2, Ex. X;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 30, 32-35. Ms. Gilliard has failed to supply evidence refuting these reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ms. Gilliard contends that these explanations are pretext because the agency never before expressed concern about or initiated an investigation into her earlier\n   allegations of harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 2-4. She offers that, instead of pursuing an investigation into the claims against Mr. Mento that she mentioned in her workers' compensation claim, the agency sought the audio recordings to \"obtain in advance what [it] believe[s] might be damaging evidence in the case at bar.\" Pl.'s Reply at 4. Ms. Gilliard fails to supply evidence to support her contentions. First, Ms. Gilliard contends that she asserted other harassment allegations, but they were not similarly investigated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 3-4. The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. While the FDIC's Anti-Harassment Program requires supervisors and managers to \"take immediate action to assess whether or not the alleged harassment occurred,\" the Program does not require any specific action or mandate a fact-finding inquiry or investigation into every allegation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Anti-Harassment Program at 4-5, Ex. I, ECF No. 52-9. Without more information about the nature of Ms. Gilliard's prior complaints and what steps the agency took with respect to those allegations, the Court cannot conclude that the agency approached these allegations differently or that any difference in the way that the agency approached these allegations suggests that the investigation into the claims that were asserted in Ms. Gilliard's workers' compensation claim was pretextual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Ms. Gilliard fails to support her contention that the real reason for the agency's request was to procure evidence relevant to this case sooner than discovery would otherwise allow. Ms. Gilliard offers no indication, for example, why the agency might have sought this evidence outside of the normal course of discovery or how she might be at all prejudiced if the agency received the audio tapes in advance of a court-imposed discovery schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ms. Gilliard next argues that the agency's order to turn over the tapes constituted a \"fishing expedition.\" Pl.'s Reply at 10. She complains that the methods and timeline that the agency designed for her to submit the recordings were \"impracticable\" and \"unfathomable,\" in part because the plan could have resulted in the exposure of privileged communications between Ms. Gilliard and her attorney that are kept on the same device on which Ms. Gilliard keeps the requested audio recordings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for PI at 9-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 2-3, 9-13. Ms. Gilliard also asserts that she has already turned over any audio recordings in her possession that might be relevant to the allegations that she included in her workers' compensation claim about Mr. Mento, and thus, the FDIC has no legitimate reason for requesting any other recordings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 9-10, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, as noted above, Ms. Gilliard criticizes the methods and timeline that the agency designed for her to submit the tapes, but she fails to moor this criticism to any concrete information about, for example, how many tapes she might have to produce; how difficult it would be to produce\n   them; and whether she might be able to produce the recordings on a timeline and using a method that is aggregable to both her and to the agency. She likewise fails to demonstrate why she would not have been able to produce the requested recordings without exposing communications between her and her counsel. For one thing, if Ms. Gilliard agreed to email each audio recording to the FDIC-one of the options offered for submitting the tapes-presumably none of her protected communications would be revealed in the transfer. Second, Ms. Gilliard's assertion that she has already produced the audio tapes that she believes relate to her allegations against Mr. Mento does not suggest that the agency's explanations for its demand are pretext. The agency is not obligated to accept Ms. Gilliard's view of which tapes constitute relevant evidence. Furthermore, the agency supplied other reasons for seeking the tapes-namely, that the recordings appear to reveal that Ms. Gilliard defied an order directing her not to surreptitiously tape and that they might contain confidential information concerning other FDIC employees. These issues have not been resolved by Ms. Gilliard's submission of a handful of tapes that she believes relate to her allegations against Mr. Mento.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the agency explains that it would have a legitimate, nonretalitory reason for proposing disciplinary action for Ms. Gilliard's refusal to submit the audio recordings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 33-34. Specifically, Ms. Gilliard's refusal to turn over the tapes would defy two reasonable agency orders, constituting insubordination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 33-35. Ms. Gilliard appears to argue that this reason for proposing disciplinary action would be pretextual because she has already handed over all audio recordings that support her claim of harassment against Mr. Mento.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 14-15. Ms. Gilliard has not, however, undercut the agency's reasons for suggesting that it might propose disciplinary action. It ordered her to turn over\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   recordings that she made of her colleagues after October 2014, not just recordings that she deemed relevant to the allegations that she asserted in her September 2017 workers' compensation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order to Provide Audio Files, Ex. W; Second Order to Produce Recordings, Ex. X. That Ms. Gilliard turned over a portion of her audio recordings does not mean that the agency could not wish to initiate disciplinary action for nonretalitory reasons based on her failure to fully comply with its orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In sum, Ms. Gilliard has not demonstrated that she is likely to succeed on the merits of her claim that the agency retaliated against her by requesting that she cease surreptitiously recording her colleagues and demanding that she turn over audio recordings that she made in defiance of that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff Has Not Shown That She Would Suffer Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court next considers whether Ms. Gilliard has met her burden of showing irreparable harm. Ms. Gilliard argues that, in the absence of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, she would suffer irreparable harm because (1) she might face disciplinary action, including firing; (2) her refusal to provide the recordings might be labeled insubordination, and such a label might render her more susceptible to firing in the future; and (3) by having access to the audio recordings, the FDIC \"would gain from being allowed to circumvent the discovery rules in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for PI at 11-12; Pl.'s Reply at 21.

Third, the Court finds unpersuasive Ms. Gilliard's bald contention that declining to grant her relief might have a chilling effect on employees' efforts to seek evidence supporting their Title VII claims.

The timing of the FDIC's access to the disputed tapes appears to this Court to be such an issue.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The FDIC ordered Ms. Gilliard not to surreptitiously tape record other FDIC employees. It appears that she has defied that order. As a result, the FDIC appears to be considering whether to discipline Ms. Gilliard for her disobedience. To the extent that Ms. Gilliard wishes to challenge any proposed discipline that results from her defiance, she must do so using the normal channels that she has available to her. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Protective Order and Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Court has since resolved the FDIC's motion, dismissing some of Ms. Gilliard's claims and denying summary judgment as premature.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gilliard v.
