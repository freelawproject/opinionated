(\"Kinder Morgan\") (collectively \"Defendants\") alleging various state-law tort claims as well as claims under the citizen-suit provisions of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\") and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"). The Court has before it Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (doc. 54), as well as Defendants' Motion to Exclude Testimony of Barry Sulkin (doc. 56) and Second Motion to Exclude Testimony of Barry Sulkin (doc. 81). For the reasons stated more fully herein, Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is due to be granted; their Motion to Exclude Testimony of Barry Sulkin is due to be granted; and their Second Motion to Exclude Testimony of Barry Sulkin is due to be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants own a pipeline system that runs from Louisiana to Washington, D.C. which transports refined petroleum products such as diesel and gasoline. In 1979, Plantation discovered a dent in the pipeline in Shelby County, Alabama near the crest of Double Mountain. Plantation determined that if the dent was not repaired, that section of the pipeline stood a higher chance of failure. Plantation undertook to repair the dent by the installation of a \"B-sleeve,\" a full-encirclement, pressure-containing sleeve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before it is installed, a B-sleeve is composed of two separate half-pipe pieces that fit together to form a slightly larger pipe section. The B-sleeve is cut along the length of the pipe, so that if one was to look at the cross-section of a B-sleeve there would be two half-circles of equal circumference. In order to install the B-sleeve as Plantation did in 1979, an operator lays the two sections of the B-sleeve over the affected area, welds along the seams connecting the two parts of the B-sleeve to form what is essentially a larger pipe-sleeve that wraps around the full circumference of the pipe, and the affected area. The circumferential ends of the B-sleeve are then welded so that they close the ends of the sleeve. A B-sleeve is pressure containing, so that even if the affected area leaks, the leaking fluid cannot normally escape past the B-sleeve. (Wright Depo at 51-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20195.452\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 195.452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Defendants were required to create so-called Integrity Management Programs (\"IMPs\") for pipeline segments in \"high consequence areas.\" IMPs are written frameworks that operators\n   use to prevent pipeline accidents and implement where an accident occurs. Defendants' current IMP requires that the B-sleeve used to \"patch\" a dent would require an epoxy filler be placed between the dent and the B-sleeve. (Doc. 83-6 at 1; Caligiuri Depo. at 98-99.) However, at the time of the repair in 1979 Plantation's maintenance standards did not require any filler, and there in fact was no filler placed between the dent and the B-sleeve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1989, Plantation excavated the dented portion of the pipeline to determine whether the use of a non-low-hydrogen weld around the B-sleeve had led to any hydrogen embrittlement, which could compromise the integrity of the seal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-112.) Defendants conducted a nondestructive examination technique called a \"dye penetrant inspection\" to test for defects along the weld of the B-sleeve. (Caligiuri Report at 13.) The technique did not expose any issues in the 1979 repair's integrity, and after additional visual inspection, Defendants reburied the pipe section. Following the 1989 test, there appears to have been no further excavations of the pipeline until the leak in 2014. In 2000, Kinder Morgan began to operate Plantation and the pipeline, employing a number of sophisticated techniques and operations to monitor the operation of the pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs own in total approximately 250 acres of land adjacent and contiguous to Defendants' right of way for the pipeline. The property is used for commercial and recreational hunting and fishing. Plaintiff Upton also resides on the property. On August 21, 2014, Grant Upton, who is Plaintiff Upton's son, called his father to tell him that there was a strong smell of gasoline in the valley and that he observed gasoline pooling in a stream in the valley floor of Double Mountain on Plaintiff Upton's property. Plaintiff Upton came to the property and then called Plantation to report what he believed to be a gasoline leak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plantation mobilized employees and third-party contractors, and by that evening had assembled approximately one hundred persons at the site. Plantation also contacted the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (\"ADEM\") and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") about the release. Three days later on August 24, 2014, Plantation had traced the source of the leak to the section of the pipeline that was repaired in 1979 with the B-sleeve. It completed repairs of the pipeline on that same day. A later laboratory analysis of the B-sleeve and underlying pipeline section showed that a crack had developed within the dent that had been sleeved in 1979.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plantation and its contractors continued their emergency response and cleanup based on written plans for product recovery and monitoring local surface water bodies. By September 2, 2014, Plantation had completed its emergency response actions and had transitioned to long-term site management. ADEM and EPA representatives completed a site walk on September 10, 2014, and agreed that all measures up to that point were completed satisfactorily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the initial emergency response and into the long-term site management phase, one of Plantation's contractors, CH2M Hill Engineers, Inc. (\"CH2M\") prepared a number of reports on behalf of Plantation to submit to state and federal regulators. After submitting a summary report of emergency response actions, CH2M submitted a Site Assessment Work Plan (the \"Work Plan\") which laid out a number of tasks to find the extent of the damage, continue monitoring risk areas, and remediate the site. ADEM approved the Work Plan on October 6, 2014. Throughout 2015, CH2M submitted multiple reports to ADEM that kept the regulator\n   abreast of the remediation and testing work CH2M was performing, and allowed ADEM to continue to monitor and propose additional clean-up measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Sulkin stated in his expert report and testified during his deposition that there was a continuing leak in the pipeline. Defendants argue that Sulkin's testimony to such should be struck because (1) he is not qualified to testify on whether the pipeline is continuing to leak based on pipeline design and site geology and (2) the methodology Sulkin uses to testify to the pipeline leakage is not based on reliable principles or methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Sulkin is an environmental consultant with over forty years of experience studying the impacts of a variety of pollutants on surface waters, ground waters, and wetlands. He has worked as an environmental regulator for what is now the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and for the EPA. (Doc. 74 at 4.) Sulkin has visited the contamination site on two different occasions, in February 2017 and April 2017, and in both occasions he observed, smelled and performed sampling of ongoing gasoline contamination. He took samples of water and sediment during those visits and sent those samples to laboratories for analysis which confirmed the presence of gasoline. Sulkin also based the conclusions contained in his expert report on the documents submitted by Defendants to ADEM as part of the ongoing reporting requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants asked Sulkin during his deposition how he came to the conclusion that there was an ongoing release of gasoline from Defendants' pipeline. He first identified that the gasoline smell was a \"fresh\" smell as opposed to a smell of gasoline that has decayed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: ... I want to make sure I understand what you're saying about the possibility that there's an ongoing release of the pipeline, okay? Are you saying to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that's your opinion that there's an ongoing release there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q: Have you done any testing to determine that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A: Only the testing for the BTEX constituents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q: Right\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A: And what I saw and smelled at the site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q: Okay\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: Smells way too fresh for being two years old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Doc. 67-1 at 207-08.) Sulkin then goes on to describe in another case how he had suspected an ongoing leak based on the smell of \"fresh gasoline, even after the source storage tank was tested by a pressurizing device and showed there was no leak. Eventually, according to Sulkin, after digging around the tank a hole was spotted in the tank, showing that the \"fresh\" smell of gasoline correctly indicated an ongoing leak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 211-12.) However, Sulkin does not explain this methodology in greater detail other than stating that the smell of fresh gasoline is different than stale gasoline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Sulkin additionally stated that the high elevation at which he saw gasoline led him to conclude there is an ongoing release:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q: ... So do you have any other basis for your belief that there's an ongoing release?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q: Tell me what.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A: As I described earlier, the elevation, to me, makes it incomprehensible that all the free product hasn't always moved down into the valley. It's just too steep, too long a time since the release that if it wasn't free product it would be gone by now, and what would be coming out of the ground would be very faint and diluted. It wouldn't still be enough to grow the orange material, wouldn't have that strong presence of gasoline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 211.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   There are significant problems with Sulkin's competency to render the opinion that there is an ongoing leak based on the two methods stated above, i.e., the \"smell-test\" and the geology of the site. Sulkin admits he is not a geologist and he has not studied the geology of the release site. (Sulkin Depo. at 44, 216.) While he has worked with other gasoline spills before, he has never worked with sites that are in mountainous terrain like the Plantation pipeline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 216.)

While Sulkin states that he is relying on his experience as a chemical spill remediation expert, he has failed to show how his experience is sufficient for the opinions he has rendered in this case, i.e., concerning the effect of gravity on the movement of gasoline away from the pipeline. Sulkin does not account for the other explanation offered by Defendants for why he smelled \"fresh\" gasoline-that the leaked gasoline could be trapped below the soil surface in a non-porous pocket. During his deposition, Sulkin admits that gasoline could be continuing to leak from a non-porous pocket, but says he has not studied the geology of the site and is not competent to render an opinion on that explanation.

Plaintiffs read a requirement into the applicable regulations and standards for Defendants to continuously update past, permanent repairs to their pipeline according to the newest standards. But no statute, regulation, or internal procedure manual requires the Defendants to do so. The parties agree that the standards for pipeline repair in a High Consequence Area (\"HCA\") are controlled by the current version of 49 C.F.R. 195.452, the Defendants' IMP, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (\"ASME\") Code\n   B31.4. ASME B31.4, titled \"Pipeline Transportation Systems for Liquid Hydrocarbons and Other Liquids,\" is explicitly incorporated into the standards of 49 C.F.R. 195.452.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20195.3\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 195.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither the current version of ASME B31.4, nor the applicable version in 1979, require that a dent, such as the dent discovered in Defendants' pipeline in 1979, would be filled with epoxy filler before the application of a B-sleeve. The current version of ASME B31.4 additionally provides that, \"This Code shall not be retroactive, or construed as applying to piping systems installed before date of issuance shown on document title page.\" (Caligiuri Report at 16.) On the other hand, the Defendants' current IMP requires that a dent repaired with a B-sleeve have the hardened epoxy filler placed in the dent before the B-sleeve is welded on. No such requirement existed in 1979.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants' expert Caligiuri states that the 1974 version of ASME B31.4, which was applicable when Plantation discovered the dent in 1979, would not require the use of epoxy filler between the dent and the B-sleeve. Plaintiffs suggest that because Defendants did not re-repair the 1979 B-sleeve according to the newest standards, that it was\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unsafe. Defendants have offered testimony that the B-sleeve repair made in 1979 is classified as a \"permanent\" repair, which means that \"once it's in, ... you don't need to be concerned about it anymore, ... as opposed to a temporary repair where you need to go back and investigate it continuously.\" (Caligiuri Depo. at 160.) As the Defendants understood it, there was no need to re-repair the B-sleeve because it was meant as a permanent fix. It could be that the new repair methods were introduced because they were cheaper, or easier to perform, and not necessarily because they are safer. Simply arguing that the 1979 B-sleeve repair is not the method that Defendants would use now does not show wanton behavior, without showing that the Defendants knew that the 1979 B-sleeve repair was unsafe. While newer repairs may not use the same method of repair, Plaintiffs have not shown any law, regulation, standard, or guideline that requires Defendants to retroactively alter a B-sleeve repair. Plaintiffs' wantonness claim is therefore due to be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

But, as stated in the Court's analysis of Plaintiff's wantonness claims\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , such a theory is unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The only additional argument raised against summary judgment for trespass is the rather unremarkable statement that \"[p]ipeline ruptures happen every day around the State of Alabama\" and that Defendant Plantation has had previous spills in the same county where the spill on Plaintiff's property occurred. Plaintiffs present no evidence that these spills were in any way similar to the spill that affected their property, or that would show knowledge that the Court could impute \"intentionality\" to the Defendants' omission.

During his deposition, Plaintiff Upton stated that his son was halfway up to Plaintiff Day's valley when he smelled gas. (K. Upton Depo. at 219.)The son\n   called Plaintiff Upton at work, and he then left work to go to the spot where the son had smelled gasoline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 220.) Both Plaintiff Upton and his son saw gasoline floating in a creek, and because of the current's direction determined it was coming from Defendants' pipeline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff Upton then called Defendant Plantation to alert it of the possibility of the leak and then returned to complete his shift at work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 221-22.) Plaintiff Upton presents additional testimony that he has seen oil sheens in the creeks and riverbeds, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 289-90), and that he was subsequently irritated by the noise and smell from the repairs by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 261-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Simply seeing gasoline and the awareness of possible gasoline contamination is not enough to put Plaintiff in the zone of danger caused by Defendants' negligence. Although there was a gasoline smell and visible gasoline in the creek when Plaintiff first went to the part of the property near the pipeline, these physical signs of a leak are not enough for him to be in \"immediate risk of physical harm.\" Indeed, after seeing the gasoline in the creek, Plaintiff called Defendants and returned to his work. If Plaintiff had truly been placed in \"immediate risk of physical harm\" and suffered resultant emotional damages therefrom, one would expect something more than his seemingly lax response to the leak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Without specifying exactly whether Plaintiff Upton was\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   injured by exposure to gasoline vapors or was simply exposed to the immediate risk of physical harm under the emotional damages test, Plaintiff Upton also argues that he is entitled to emotional distress damages because gasoline contains known carcinogens and the current contamination levels in certain parts of Upton's property were above residential risk levels.

Conversely, looking at the so-called \"physical impact\" requirement under FELA,\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   held that physical contact alone does not necessarily support emotional damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   in particular, [the cited common law cases] do not include a contact that amounts to no more than an exposure-an exposure, such as that before us, to a substance that poses some future risk of disease and which contact causes emotional distress only because the worker learns that he may become ill after a substantial period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916138\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/424/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916138\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/424/\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although it addressed the recovery of emotional damages under FELA, rather than Alabama common law,\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   shows that exposure to a substance, be it gasoline or asbestos, that has a \"latent\" effect, cannot support a claim for emotional damages because the plaintiff is not subject to immediate and traumatic harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiffs additionally state Plaintiff Upton was in the zone of danger because David Chung (\"Chung\") said that he and other responders had \"risked their lives\" when they went to the site to investigate and clean up the leak on behalf of Defendants. However, Plaintiffs omit Chung's subsequent clarification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q: Okay. Tell me how your team risked their lives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A: It's-you don't know what you're-when you're first walking into the woods, you don't know-it's a figure-you know, were they in danger, no, but when you're first walking in, you don't know what you're dealing with at a release; that's what I mean.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Chung Depo. at 26.) It appears thus that Chung meant to say that before going to the affected area there was a possibility that they would be risking their lives, but did not in fact \"risk their lives.\" Even if Chung testified that he and his team \"risked their lives\" in investigating the leak, Plaintiff Upton was not with or near Chung during the time Chung first came to the site. Because Plaintiff Upton has not shown any physical injury nor has he shown any evidence that he was placed in immediate risk of physical harm by the Defendants' negligence, he cannot recover for emotional damages for negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs additionally argue they are entitled for emotional damages in relation to the nuisance and wantonness claims. As stated above, Plaintiffs' wantonness claims are without merit, but the Court addresses Plaintiffs' emotional damages claims nonetheless as the same standard applies to their nuisance claims, which are not subject to summary judgment. A plaintiff is entitled to emotional damages for nuisance and wantonness under Alabama law \"if the mental suffering inflicted is accompanied by malice, insult, inhumanity, or contumely.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

He points to a single exchange during Plaintiff Upton's deposition as supporting such claims for emotional damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q: In your dealing with [Defendant Plantation] since the release, have you ever had any unpleasant dealings with anybody?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A: I would say, yes-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Q: Tell me about that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   A: I really can't remember what it was.

Upton Depo. at 248-49.) This exchange does not show that \"a Plantation pipeline\n   employee ... accused [Plaintiff Upton] of pouring gasoline on his own land\" as Plaintiff Upton's deposition testimony itself states the employee said \"somebody\" without any direct accusation. It goes without saying that the above interaction that Plaintiff Upton did not have any direct effect on him since he states that he \"can't remember what [the interaction] was.\" Even taking the above evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, they cannot recover emotional damages simply because Defendants were at time unprofessional or Plaintiff Upton was \"ticked off.\" Thus, Plaintiffs' claims for emotional damages are due to be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

From this clear and unexceptionable language of the statute, one of two further inferences can be made: (1) The inference the Court chooses, that the requirement for commencing a suit is the same as the requirement for maintaining it, or (2) the inference that, in order to maintain a suit the allegations that are required to commence it must, if contested, be proved. It seems to me that to favor the first inference over the second is to prefer the eccentric to the routine. It is well ingrained in the law that subject-matter jurisdiction can be called into question either by challenging the sufficiency of the allegation or by challenging the accuracy of the jurisdictional facts alleged.

Chung performed exploration excavations at the Shelby County water pipeline to determine whether it was in contact with gasoline, (Chung Depo. at 83), as gasoline could damage the seals between pipe sections if they were improperly installed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84.) However, Chung did not testify to the presence of any gasoline in the exploratory excavation sites. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 83-85.) Plaintiffs' argument, reduced to its barest form, invites the Court to find an RCRA violation where there is a mere possibility that if the seals between water lines were improperly installed\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   gasoline was shown to be present, there would be an imminent and substantial threat. Given that Plaintiffs have not offered proof of either of these conditions, both of which are necessary to disrupt the integrity of the water line, this theory does not satisfy \u00a7 6972(a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Plaintiffs next offer deposition testimony of Chung, Sulkin, and Grant Upton concerning the noxious fumes created by the gasoline after its release. Plaintiffs again cite to Chung's statement about \"risking his life,\" and that the workers \"needed to wear respirators\"; however, these statements appear to be in reference to the time during the initial release, not at the time of the suit two years later. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chung Depo. at 26-27.) Grant Upton testified that on the day the release was discovered his \"eyes were dry.\" (G. Upton Depo. at 44.) Such a minor reaction does not show substantial endangerment, and certainly not at the time of suit. Finally, Sulkin testified that inhalation of gasoline fumes can cause \"drowsiness, headaches, and even unconsciousness,\" but had done no testing of the air quality on the Plaintiffs' property. Instead, he stated that he smelled a stronger gasoline smell than at a gasoline station, and believed that the smell would indicate high enough concentrations to cause harm to human health. (Sulkin Depo. at 177-78.) Sulkin based his statements on the adverse effects of gasoline inhalation on \"EPA documentation,\" but admitted that he does not know at what levels such adverse effects manifest. His \"smell test\" methodology is in no way tied to the EPA documentation that he refers to, but instead is his speculation that a strong gasoline smell will cause those effects. Sulkin's testimony does not show an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   While Plaintiffs have failed to show that the pipeline's release may cause an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health, whether the release poses such a risk to the \"environment\" is a closer question. No binding precedent has adequately discussed whether the presence of certain levels of gasoline presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Plaintiffs present as additional evidence deposition testimony to show that the Defendants' pipeline's leak \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to ... the environment.\" They first state that \"it remains undisputed the soil, surface water, groundwater, and wetlands on the Upton's property is contaminated with petroleum, toluene, benzene, and BTEX. (Doc. 62 at 29.) They cite as support statements made by Chung during his deposition on his initial findings during the discovery of the leak in 2014-obviously this testimony has no bearing on what the situation in Plaintiffs' property was in 2016 at the time of the suit after significant efforts by Defendants to remediate the property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chung Depo at 9, 25.) Plaintiffs also quote Defendants' expert Steven C. Hart (\"Hart\")'s deposition, where he was asked about his expert report \"concerning the presence of groundwater (including seeps/springs) and surface water conditions associated with a release of gasoline from [Defendants'] pipeline.\" (Doc. 55-37 at 3.) Hart concludes that there is \"[A] small area of groundwater impact ... present in the northeastern corner of the Defendants' property from the [Defendants'] release.\" (Doc. 55-37 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hart Depo. at 100.) Hart explained that \"groundwater impact\" means \"groundwater with dissolved phase or it could be free phase contamination from the [Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   ] release that is above the MCL [EPA maximum contaminant levels].\" (Hart Depo. at 100.) CH2M likewise has concluded in their Comprehensive Site Assessment that as of February 2016, \"at least one BTEX constituent concentration exceeded the EPA Region 4 freshwater ecological screening level for chronic exposure at nine locations.\" (Doc. 55-11 at 27.) Plaintiffs, however, never attempt to explain what the applicable standards mean or how they apply to the RCRA, and the Court declines to make Plaintiffs' arguments for them. Nor do Plaintiffs elaborate or show how groundwater impacts creates substantial endangerment to health or the environment. They cite to the deposition of Defendants' expert Jerry Aycock (\"Aycock\") for the proposition that \"[p]etroleum and its constituent parts are known to be harmful to the environment.\" (Doc. 62 at 29.) However, the cited portion of Aycock's deposition has no bearing on Hart's conclusion that the groundwater impact was above the MCL in part of Plaintiffs' property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Q: ... Generally speaking, when you have a release of gasoline into the environment, it has a harmful effect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   A: Typically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Q: And leaking gasoline can represent a health risk to the public?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   Q: It can harm property? Leaking gasoline\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   A: Depends on the situation. I don't know how you harm property. It contaminates soil and groundwater and potentially surface water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   So it may have an effect on the-on the use of the property. So, therefore, that would be the case. But just because you put gasoline into soil doesn't harm the property. It just contaminates the soil.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   Q: So contaminated soil is not the same as harm to property?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   A: There-there are literally millions, if not billions, of properties that are contaminated that are actually bought at a premium price, developed, and used without harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   So I would have to say, as an environmental professional, that even though that property is contaminated, it's not harmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   (Aycock Depo. at 40-41.) Plaintiffs additionally cite to the presence of \"red orange flocculent\" in the Defendants' properties, but do not explain how that is harmful. In fact, in Harm's expert report, he explains that \"iron precipitate\" can occur in areas near a release and then migrate to other areas not necessarily impacted by a release. (Doc. 55-37 at 15-16.) In any case, the presence of red orange flocculent does not show substantial endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Plaintiffs then state that \"[p]etroleum continues to seep out of the earth from at least 23 different locations on the [Plaintiffs'] property.\" They cite to Sulkin's deposition for this statement, but Sulkin does not make any findings or conclusions to such at the cited page number, and after thorough search the Court is unsure on what Plaintiffs base this statement. At one point during his deposition, Sulkin refers to \"23 seeps,\" but from the context he did not mean that petroleum was seeping out of the ground. (Sulkin Depo. 390:5-6 \"I don't know where the 23 seeps are they plan to monitor.\"). Rather a seep is just a point where groundwater reaches the surface. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 55-11 at 27 (\"[Petroleum] produce has not been observed in springs or seeps since late March 2015.\"). Plaintiffs additionally cite to Chung's deposition for their proposition, but the page number they cite does not support their argument that there is an active petroleum leak or there are twenty-three different locations identified that have active leaks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 62 at 25 (citing Chung Depo. at 155).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs refer to deposition testimony by Grant Upton and Sulkin concerning dead wildlife they saw on the Plaintiffs' property. However, Grant Upton's statement that he saw 2-3 dead frogs, a dead lizard, and some dead fish on the day that he discovered the release is hardly helpful to whether the status of the release when Plaintiffs filed suit in 2016 may have presented an imminent and substantial endangerment. The additionally cited testimony by Grant Upton and Sulkin are all hearsay statements concerning what Grant was told about the lack of woodland ducks that formerly inhabited the property by his father or what Sulkin was told about the presence of different animals to include in his expert report. The supposed impacts to wildlife is contradicted by Grant Upton's additional testimony that he continues to hunt deer and turkey on the property, and takes third parties to hunt there as well. (G. Upton Depo. at 91-93; 113.) Plaintiffs have presented no other evidence sufficient to show an RCRA violation, and this claim is due to be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is granted; their Motion to Exclude Testimony of Barry Sulkin is due to be granted; and their Second Motion to Exclude is due to be denied as moot. Plaintiffs' negligence and nuisance claims remain pending as Defendants have made no argument in regard to either claim.

(Doc. 81.) As the conclusions Defendants seek to exclude from Barry Sulkin's expert report have not been relied upon by Plaintiffs in their Opposition to Summary Judgment, Defendants' Second Motion to Exclude is DENIED as MOOT.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    Because Plaintiffs' only claim for punitive damages necessarily relies on the survival of their wantonness claim, which is due to be dismissed, their claim for punitive damages is also due to be dismissed. Plaintiffs point out that in\n    <em>\n     Lewis v. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P.\n    </em>\n    , which dealt with a similar suit against Defendants for a leak in their pipeline, the district court recently denied summary judgment for plaintiffs' punitive damages claim.

In fact,\n    <em>\n     Lewis\n    </em>\n    merely states in regards to punitive damages:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n    Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, there is sufficient evidence on which a jury could find that the Defendants acted willfully, wantonly, or recklessly with respect to the 1990 sleeve repair and maintenance and management of the Pipeline.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201541857\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lewis\n    </em>\n    contains no analysis additional to the quotation above, nor does it identify what evidence allowed it to make its conclusion that summary judgment should be denied in regards to the punitive damages claim.

In this action, even construing the term \"point source\" \"broadly,\" there is no point source discharge following the initial leak in the Defendants' pipeline. While the Eleventh Circuit has not squarely addressed whether the migration of pollutants through soil and groundwater is a point source discharge, other circuits have.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sierra Club v.
