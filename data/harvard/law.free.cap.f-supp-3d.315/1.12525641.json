BATES, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   It's a dangerous business, reading the fine print. Nearly every website we visit features Terms of Service (\"ToS\"), those\n   endless lists of dos and don'ts conjured up by lawyers to govern our conduct in cyberspace. They normally remain a perpetual click away at the bottom of every web page, or quickly scrolled past as we check the box stating that we agree to them. But to knowingly violate some of those terms, the Department of Justice tells us, could get one thrown in jail. This reading of federal law is a boon to prosecutors hoping to deter cybercrime. Yet it also creates a dilemma for those with more benign intentions. Plaintiffs in this case, for instance, are researchers who wish to find out whether websites engage in discrimination, but who have to violate certain ToS to do so. They have challenged the statute that they allege criminalizes their conduct, saying that it violates their free speech, petition, and due process rights. First, however, they must show that they have a sufficient injury to make it through the courthouse door, and that their suit is plausible enough to continue. For the following reasons, the Court finds that plaintiffs have standing, and that they can bring one (but not the rest) of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case centers on a few sections of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a law dedicated to \"deterring the criminal element from abusing computer technology.\" H.R. Rep. No. 98-894, at 4 (1984). Plaintiffs directly challenge one section, referred to here as the Access Provision, which sweeps in the greatest amount of conduct. The Access Provision states that \"[w]hoever ... intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains ... information from any protected computer ... shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C). The CFAA defines \"protected computer\" to mean, among other things, \"a computer ...which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1030(e)(2)(B). This definition encompasses just about all computers hooked up to the Internet-including computers that house website servers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nosal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756996\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/854/#p859\">\n    676 F.3d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 859 (9th Cir. 2012). The statute also defines \"exceeds authorized access\" as \"to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(6). Thus, the Access Provision applies to anyone who purposely accesses an Internet-connected computer without authorization, or uses a legitimate authorization to receive or change information that they are not supposed to, and thereby obtains information from the computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The CFAA provides for a fine and/or imprisonment for up to one year upon a first violation of the Access Provision, or up to ten years for any further offenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1030(c)(2)(A), (C). However, the punishment for an initial violation rises to a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment if the offense (1) \"was committed for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain,\" (2) was \"in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution\" or state or federal law, or (3) involved obtaining information valued at more than $5,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1030(c)(2)(B). Thus, meeting one of these three conditions makes a first violation a felony; if none are met, the first violation is a misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are four professors and a media organization: Christian W.

By shutting the food in a truck, perhaps along with her cooking instructions, the owner has placed a barrier between that property and the public forum outside. Thus, while the police could not arrest a customer for telling others in line that the food tastes terrible, or for reading the menu on the truck's exterior, they\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   arrest that customer for breaking into the boarded-up truck seeking confidential culinary information. This is true even if the customer claimed she was doing so in order to broadcast to the world the truck's substandard ingredients and ill-conceived recipes. While the First Amendment has free rein on the Mall generally, it does not protect those who circumvent barriers that demarcate private areas, even if those private areas are surrounded by an otherwise public forum.

Congress thus viewed exceeding authorized access as the digital equivalent of being allowed into a house but entering a room within it that the owner has declared to be off-limits.

The initial language of the CFAA applied to anyone who, knowingly \"having accessed a computer with authorization, uses the opportunity such access provides for\n   <em>\n    purposes\n   </em>\n   to which such authorization does not extend, and thereby obtains information.\" Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984, Pub.

In 1986, however, in a section entitled \"Modification of Authorized Access Aspect of Offenses,\" Congress replaced this language with the phrase \"exceeds authorized access,\" and, in a section entitled \"Conforming Amendments to Definitions Provision,\" added the current definition of that phrase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, Pub.

Rec. 28,821 (1986) (statement of Rep. Hughes) (stating, as the chairman of the drafting subcommittee just before final passage, that \"the basic thrust of this bill remains its three new offenses with some minor changes in the existing law\"). Yet it is notable that Congress did not simply transpose the existing, purpose-oriented language into the definition section-which still would have simplified the language of \u00a7 1030(a), as desired-but instead replaced it with new language that focuses on authorization to access particular information. Indeed, if Congress did not think it was making a substantive change, the legislative history suggests that this was because Congress thought the initial language also was limited to access, since \"when Congress referenced the user's 'purposes,' it spoke in terms of the particular computer files or data to which the user's access rights extended.\"\n   <em>\n    Valle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362594\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/508/#p523\">\n    807 F.3d at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs raise numerous First and Fifth Amendment concerns with the Access Provision that would arise out of reading \"exceeds authorized access\" to include the purpose or use restrictions that appear in many ToS.

Plaintiffs' reading is the more natural one, and better reflects the constitutional avoidance concerns that support the Court's interpretation of the statute. Therefore, the Court must make an objective inquiry into the conduct alleged to violate websites' ToS. The focus is on\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   information plaintiffs plan to access, not on why they wish to access it, the manner in which they use their authorization to access it, or what they hope to do with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Applying this standard, it becomes clear that most of plaintiffs' proposed activities fall outside the CFAA's reach. Scraping or otherwise recording data from a site that is accessible to the public is merely a particular use of information\n   that plaintiffs are entitled to see. The same goes for speaking about, or publishing documents using, publicly available data on the targeted websites. The use of bots or sock puppets is a more context-specific activity, but it is not covered in this case. Employing a bot to crawl a website or apply for jobs may run afoul of a website's ToS, but it does not constitute an\n   <em>\n    access\n   </em>\n   violation when the human who creates the bot is otherwise allowed to read and interact with that site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kerr,\n   <em>\n    Norms of Computer Trespass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1170.

Plaintiffs assert that the Access Provision provides a limitless, standardless delegation of power to individual websites to define crimes. But that assertion is based on a reading of the provision that sweeps in use, purpose, or manner restrictions on obtaining or altering information. Properly read as applying only to access restrictions, websites can write whatever ToS they please, but a congressionally-imposed standard limits which ToS can lead to liability or prosecution. Nor do websites have the power to impose formal rules on an industry or otherwise exercise regulatory authority in the manner that courts have found constitutionally impermissible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Yakus v.

Plaintiffs have cited no case-nor has the Court found one-in which a court struck down on private nondelegation grounds a statute that incorporated private parties' chosen restrictions, which are only binding on those who interact\n   with those parties' individual businesses. It is thus difficult to argue that the Access Provision improperly delegates legislative or regulatory authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Indeed, when read narrowly, the Access Provision looks similar to many criminal laws that are rendered operative by a private party's decision whether to authorize certain conduct.

In none of these instances does a private party's control over the law's operation render it a nondelegation problem. Rather, \"a legislative delegation to private citizens\" is constitutional so long as \"[1] the underlying exercise of authority [is] a reasonable regulation within the power of the government .... and [2] the legislature's restriction [is] in the form of a general prohibition, and the delegation [is] in the form of permitting private citizens to waive the protection of that prohibition.\"\n   <em>\n    Silverman v.

Since the Access Provision creates a blanket prohibition on accessing information in protected computers, which owners of those computers can waive through permission, plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that the provision unconstitutionally delegates legislative power. Hence, the nondelegation claim will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   This case raises important questions about the government's ability to criminalize vast swaths of everyday activity on the Internet. However, the Court need not answer all of them today, because it concludes that the CFAA prohibits far less than the parties claim (or fear) it does. For the reasons explained above, plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that they have standing to sue, and that the Access Provision violates the Free Speech and Free Press Clauses of the First Amendment as applied to them. The government's motion to dismiss for lack of standing and on this single as-applied claim will therefore be denied. But the Access Provision, as the Court reads it, does not sweep widely enough to render plausible plaintiffs' First Amendment overbreadth and petition claims, or their Fifth Amendment vagueness and nondelegation claims. The government's motion to dismiss those claims, therefore, will be granted.

Social media sites like Facebook, for instance, grant access for any username and password combination, but they still allow those with accounts to access data that those who merely visit the site without signing up cannot. Hence, conditions placed on account creation can still be access restrictions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Courts normally subject free speech and free press claims to the same level of scrutiny.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Citizens United\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p340\">\n     558 U.S. at 352\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"404\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p340\">\n     130 S.Ct. 876\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     McConnell v.
