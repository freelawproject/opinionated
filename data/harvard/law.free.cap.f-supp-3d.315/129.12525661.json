MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case represents one piece of the litigation resulting from the 2008 financial\n   crisis. The Plaintiff, Long Beach Securities Corporation, previously settled a suit with the National Credit Union Administration Board over certain residential mortgage-backed securities. Long Beach now argues that the settlement agreement requires the Board to relieve Long Beach of its liability for a third-party indemnity claim based on those same securities, or, alternatively, that unjust enrichment principles require the same result. I conclude that one of Long Beach's two contract arguments, and the unjust enrichment count, survive the Board's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The National Credit Union Administration is an independent federal agency that charters and regulates federal credit unions \"under the management of a National Credit Union Administration Board.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1752a ; Compl. 1. Beginning in 2008, some credit unions under the Board's authority were decimated by failed investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, and the Board stepped in to act first as the credit unions' conservator, and ultimately as their liquidating agent. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 2-3. In this liquidating agent capacity, the Board filed civil cases against various entities that had been involved in selling the securities to the credit unions-suits that led to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Board Settles with JPMorgan and Long Beach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2011-2013, the Board filed four suits against entities owned directly or indirectly by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPMorgan), \"relating to the purchase of residential mortgage-backed securities\" by credit unions then in liquidation. Compl. \u00b6 1. Long Beach Securities Corporation (Long Beach) was included in that suit as \"a subsidiary of non-party JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA., which, in turn, is a wholly owned bank subsidiary of JPMorgan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8. JPMorgan entered into a global settlement of all four cases, paying the Board over $1.4 billion under a Settlement Agreement signed in November 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, Ex. A, ECF No. 1-1 (Settlement Agreement). The agreement included two paragraphs dealing with the Board's suits against third parties-sections 8(a) and 8(b)-that Long Beach now attempts to enforce in this action. Settlement Agreement 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Board Accepts an Offer of Judgment Against Credit Suisse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the Board settled with JPMorgan, it was also in active litigation against Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Securities Corp. Compl. \u00b6 3. That suit alleged, among other things, that Credit Suisse USA had made \"misstatements concerning the standards applied in originating the mortgage loans\" associated with two securities transactions covered by the JPMorgan Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The Credit Suisse defendants made an offer of judgment \"that involved paying the [ ] Board the full amount of damages it was claiming ... while otherwise limiting the judgment to one that would have no precedential or\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect and treating it as though it were a settlement of disputed matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The Board had 14 days to accept the offer or it would lapse, and the Board would have to pay the defendants' \"costs incurred after the offer was made\" unless they later obtained a more favorable judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 68. The Board accepted the offer one day before the deadline, and the court in April 2016 entered a Stipulated Judgment for over $50 million, including amounts for pre-judgment interest and attorney's fees that the parties had negotiated. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. \"During the negotiations it had with [the Credit Suisse defendants], the [ ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Board ... made no effort to obtain ... a release\" \"from contribution or indemnity for [Long Beach] or any other JPMorgan entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. The Board also did not reduce the Stipulated Judgment \"to account for [Credit Suisse USA's] alleged indemnification rights against [Long Beach].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Long Beach Settles an Indemnity Claim With Credit Suisse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In two securities transactions with federal credit unions that caused the Board suits, Credit Suisse USA had acted as the underwriter, and Long Beach as the depositor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 23 (the Long Beach Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-1 transaction, and the Long Beach Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-6 transaction). Each transaction had an Underwriting Agreement, under which Long Beach \"agreed to indemnify and hold harmless [Credit Suisse] USA against various matters arising out of the [pertinent] Transaction, including liability for alleged misstatements as to matters other than information relating to the underwriters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26. After the Stipulated Judgment with the Board, Credit Suisse USA \"demanded indemnity\" from Long Beach in the amount of $19.62 million, invoking these Underwriting Agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Long Beach, in turn, demanded that the Board \"reduce the Stipulated Judgment it obtained against [Credit Suisse USA] and/or otherwise take steps to protect [Long Beach] from [the] indemnification claim. The [ ] Board steadfastly refused to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. When told by the Board that it should file an administrative proof of claim, Long Beach did so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse USA \"continued to threaten litigation against [Long Beach] in order to seek recovery on its claim for indemnification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Long Beach and Credit Suisse USA agreed to enter \"non-binding mediation and, in the event the mediation was unsuccessful, arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Their agreement to this effect was \"drafted ... to allow the [ ] Board to participate in the mediation discussions and/or arbitration should it choose to do so,\" and Long Beach informed the Board of this option in December 2016, ahead of the mediation scheduled for January 10, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board did not respond until February 2017-after the mediation session had occurred-stating that \"it would not participate in any future mediation or arbitration proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although the initial mediation session in January 2017 was unsuccessful, Long Beach and Credit Suisse USA \"continued to participate in follow-up discussions with the mediator,\" eventually agreeing to settle the \"$19.62 million claim for $10 million.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. In April 2017, the two parties entered into an agreement that fully released Credit Suisse USA's claims against Long Beach, and Long Beach paid Credit Suisse USA the $10 million in settlement funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In June 2017, the Board denied Long Beach's administrative claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Long Beach Sues the Board\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In July 2017, Long Beach filed this case against the Board. In Count I of the Complaint, Long Beach argues that the Board has breached the Settlement Agreement by (1) \"failing to use its 'good faith and best efforts' to obtain for [Long Beach] a release from [Credit Suisse] USA of claims on the basis of contribution[ ] [or] indemnification,\" and by (2) \"refusing to reduce the Stipulated Judgment it obtained in the Credit Suisse Action in an amount sufficient to hold [Long Beach] harmless against [Credit Suisse] USA's claim for indemnification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. In Count II, Long Beach claims that by benefiting from the $1.4 billion JPMorgan settlement, without reducing that amount or the $50\n   million Credit Suisse Stipulated Judgment to offset the Credit Suisse USA indemnification claim against Long Beach, the \"Board has been unjustly enriched in an amount to be determined at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Where It Relies on Section 8(a), the Complaint Fails to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The first contractual provision at issue reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    Judgment Reduction and Release of Claims\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (a) In the event any Liquidating Agent obtains a judgment against any other party or parties relating to the Securities identified in Exhibit A or Exhibit B (a \"Third Party Judgment\"), and such other party or parties, in turn, successfully assert(s) a claim against any of the Released Defendant Persons relating to the Securities on the basis of contribution, indemnity or any other similar legal theory or claim (a \"Claim Over\"), the Liquidating Agents agree they will reduce the judgment or award they obtain or have obtained against the party asserting the Claim Over in a percentage calculated using the pro tanto rule, the proportionate rule or the pro rata rule, or such other rules as may apply in the relevant jurisdiction, whichever percentage is sufficient to cover fully or otherwise hold the Released Defendant Persons harmless in all respects from the other party's or parties' Claim Over against the Released Defendant Persons.

Def.'s Mem. In Support of Def.'s Mot. Dismiss at 22 (Mot. Dismiss). Instead of challenging this point, the Board argues that Credit Suisse USA did not \"successfully assert[ ] a claim\" against Long Beach, because Long Beach voluntarily settled the claim, and no court ever decided to accept it. Mot. Dismiss 22-27. Long Beach counters by pointing to the plain language of the contract, and contending that Credit Suisse USA settling an indemnification demand satisfies the dictionary definitions of the words \"successfully\" and \"assert.\" Opp. 18-19. After examining the full contract between the parties, I conclude that the plain language of Section 8(a) does not apply to the voluntary settlement here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[S]uccessfully assert\" is not a term of art, at least as used in this contract. The Settlement Agreement does not explicitly define the term, and New York courts often use the word \"assert\" to describe the attempted enforcement of an indemnification claim by email or letter.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Uncas Int'l LLC v.

Section 8(a) only applies if the Board \"obtains a judgment\" against a third party, who \"in turn, successfully assert(s) a claim against any of the Released Defendant.\" Settlement Agreement \u00a7 8(a). In contemplation of related \"proceedings,\" the Board also promises-in Section 8(a)'s only other sentence-to \"join in\" or at least \"consent to\" \"any motion by the Released Defendant Persons seeking a determination that this Agreement constitutes a release or settlement ... of any Claim Over in any such\n   <em>\n    litigation\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651489,3505682\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/626/933/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The entire paragraph assumes a litigation context. It would be incongruous to say that Credit Suisse USA has \"successfully assert[ed] a claim\" against Long Beach, under this section, just because the parties voluntarily settled a claim after non-binding mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The conclusion that \"successfully assert\" contemplates litigation draws more support from Section 8(a)'s specific definition of \"Claim Over.\" Not every legal theory will suffice. Instead, the \"successfully assert[ed] claim\" must \"relat[e] to the Securities\" at issue and arise \"on the basis of contribution, indemnity or any other similar legal theory or claim.\" Settlement Agreement \u00a7 8(a). Both contribution and indemnity are legal theories that, in this context, would ordinarily require filing with a court for enforcement.

Ill. 1986) (\"An Offer of Judgment is in the nature of an offer to contract for settlement, and the requirement that an acceptance mirror an offer is fundamental to the Law of Contract.\"). This argument receives additional support from Section 8(b)'s final provision, which says that \"in no event shall the [Board] be required to decline a settlement they otherwise deem acceptable because such third party refuses to release the Released Defendant Persons.\" Settlement Agreement \u00a7 8(b). In other words, I take the Board's argument that the Credit Suisse USA offer of judgment created unique constraints on its bargaining power, and that Section 8(b) means what it says about not forcing the Board \"to decline a settlement ... because [a] third party refuses to [include a] release.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"425252\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/110/108/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Yet that does not settle the matter, particularly since the Board apparently never asked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Without the benefit of discovery, I cannot conclude that the Board's obligation to exert \"good faith and best efforts to include in the Third Party Settlement a [qualifying] release\" conferred no obligations at all in the context of the Credit Suisse litigation. Perhaps the Board was in active settlement negotiations leading up to the offer of judgment, and could have asked for a release during those discussions. Perhaps the Board could have placed a phone call to Credit Suisse USA, with the offer of judgment on the table, and asked for a new offer of judgment containing a release. After all, Rule 68 says that \"[a]n unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn, but it does not preclude a later offer.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 68(b). Although\n   <em>\n    acceptance\n   </em>\n   must mirror the offer,\n   <em>\n    Bentley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"425252\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/110/108/#p113\">\n    110 F.R.D. at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nowhere does the Rule prohibit requests for a new or different offer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   And though a \"best efforts\" clause can be enforced under New York law only in specific circumstances, it-is at least plausible that this Settlement Agreement provides enough specificity for the task.\n   <em>\n    Ashokan Water Servs., Inc. v. New Start, LLC\n   </em>\n   provides a good overview of the applicable case law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   There is authority in the Second Department that \"[w]here ... a clause in an agreement provides that a party must use its best efforts, it is essential that the agreement also contain clear guidelines against which to measure such efforts in order for such efforts to be enforced.\" ... [C]ourts will refuse to enforce an express \"best efforts\" provision, or to imply one where it is not expressed, in those situations in which it amounts to a dreaded \"agreement to agree.\" But numerous courts, including the New York Court of Appeals and the Second Department, have applied an express \"best efforts\" provision without articulated objective criteria, or implied one where it was not expressed. On a doctrinal level, at least, the cases can be reconciled by recognizing that there is no\n   <em>\n    a priori\n   </em>\n   rule precluding enforcement of a \"best efforts\" obligation even in the absence of articulated criteria, and that\n   the obligation will be enforced where sufficient content may otherwise be read into it against which the promisor's performance may be measured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5812227\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/11/686/\">\n    11 Misc.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5812227\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/11/686/\">\n    807 N.Y.S.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553 (Civ.

The Board agreed to \"use their good faith and best efforts to include in the Third Party Settlement a release from such other party in favor of the [Long Beach] (in a form equivalent to the releases contained herein) of any claims relating to the Securities.\" Settlement Agreement \u00a7 8(b). The specific claims at issue are \"claims ... on the basis of contribution, indemnity or any similar legal theory or claim under which the Released Defendant Persons would be liable to pay any part of such Third Party Settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5812227\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/11/686/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Of particular interest is the requirement that the release should be \"in a form equivalent to the releases contained herein,\" referring to the universal language of the releases in the Settlement Agreement itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 1(h) (\"Released Plaintiff Claims\"), 1(i) (\"Released Defendant Claims\"), 5 (\"Release by the Plaintiff Releasing Persons\"), and 7 (\"Release by the Releasing Defendant Persons\"). This provision gave the Board concrete language for a release request. In other words, the Board knew fairly precisely what it needed to request. The question is whether it tried, and that is a factual question not resolvable at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In the context of a motion to dismiss, where I must \"draw all reasonable inferences from [the Complaint's] allegations in the plaintiff's favor,\"\n   <em>\n    Banneker Ventures, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332876,6772423\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1119/\">\n    798 F.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , I cannot conclude that Long Beach could prove no set of facts entitling it to relief here.

The Unjust Enrichment Alternative Count States a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Long Beach's unjust enrichment claim also meets those minimum standards. \"Unjust enrichment occurs when: (1) the plaintiff conferred a benefit on the defendant; (2) the defendant retains the benefit; and (3) under the circumstances, the defendant's retention of the benefit is unjust.\"\n   <em>\n    In re APA Assessment Fee Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110184,4201284\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/39/\">\n    766 F.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45-46 (D.C.

Instead, the Board contends that as a matter of both District of Columbia and New York law, \"a plaintiff may only bring a claim for unjust enrichment where the parties have no express agreement that covers the subject matter at issue.\" Mot. Dismiss 28-29, n. 20 (citing cases). Because Long Beach has asserted that the Settlement Agreement\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   cover the conduct at issue, the Board argues that the unjust enrichment claim must fail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29. But there is no rule against pleading in the alternative. In fact, the caselaw reveals that unjust enrichment claims often properly arise in the liminal space just outside a contract's enforceable scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re APA Assessment Fee Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110184,4201284\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/39/\">\n    766 F.3d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"plaintiffs' decision to pay the special assessment had no bearing on plaintiffs' rights or obligations as [American Psychological Association] members under the bylaws and rules ...

Such a ruling is not warranted on the current record, and is certainly not something that the Board would want.
