PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sandran Waran (\"Waran\") brings this diversity action for fraud against Christie's Inc. (\"Christie's\") in connection with Christie's sale of two Asian antiquities. Christie's moves for summary judgment, claiming that Waran fails to establish a misstatement, scienter, or damages. Christie's also asserts that Waran's claim is time-barred. For the reasons that follow, Christie's motion for summary judgment is granted, and this action is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2005, Waran purchased a sculpture titled \"Blackstone Stele of Vishnu on Garuda\" (the \"Blackstone Stele\") for $40,704 at auction from Christie's. (Affirmation of R. Zachary Gelber, Esq. in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 78 (\"Gelber Affirm.\"), Ex. 4 (\"Blackstone Invoice\").) In its March 2005 Indian and Southeast Asian Art Catalog, Christie's represented that the Blackstone Stele was created in twelfth century northeastern India, and that its provenance was \"of a Boston Collection,\" which had \"[a]cquired [it] in 1993.\" (Gelber Affirm., Ex. 3 (\"2005 Catalog\"), at 37.) Before Waran's purchase, Christie's policy was to accept information regarding provenance from consignors at face value. (Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Counter-Statement Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1, ECF No. 91 (\"Def.'s Response\"), \u00b6\u00b6 32A, 38A;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gelber Affirm., Ex. 2 (\"Robinson Dep.\"), at 12:23-13:3 (providing that \"a verbal response was generally sufficient unless it flagged anything that caused worry\"); Robinson Dep., at 40:18-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sometime around March 2005, Christie's began implementing a stricter policy for\n   authentication. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Sandra L. Cobden, Esq. in Support of Christie's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF Nos. 66, 69, and 70 (\"Cobden Aff.\"), Ex. 3.) Christie's started requiring consignors to provide a signed \"Provenance and Country of Origin Declaration\" form, or \"PCOO.\" (Cobden Aff., Ex. 4 (\"Christie's Interrogatory Responses\"), at 3.) The PCOO required a consignor to certify \"that the property left its source country prior to the earlier of: (i) January 1, 2000, (ii) the date of an applicable bilateral agreement restriction between the United States and the source country, or (iii) the date the source country went into conflict or war.\" (Christie's Interrogatory Responses, at 3.) \"Consignors were also asked to provide any and all available supporting documentation ....\" (Christie's Interrogatory Responses, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Christie's did not obtain a PCOO from the consignor of the Blackstone Stele. (Gelber Affirm., Ex. 1 (\"Cobden Dep.\"), at 71:13-19; 82:14-83:7.) Waran contends that the PCOO policy was in place at the time he purchased the Blackstone Stele. In an interrogatory response, Christie's stated that the PCOO policy began in 2005. (Christie's Interrogatory Responses, at 3.) In its statement of material facts, Christie's clarifies that it established the PCOO requirement in March 2005, and that it had acquired the Blackstone Stele prior to that time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Response \u00b6 38A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2007, Waran purchased a sculpture titled \"Sandstone Figure of Uma\" (the \"Sandstone Figure,\" and together with the Blackstone Stele, the \"Works\") for $70,620 at auction from Christie's. (Gelber Affirm. Ex. 7 (\"Sandstone Invoice\"); Def.'s Response \u00b6 29.) In its March 2007 Indian and Southeast Asian Art Catalog, Christie's represented that the Sandstone Figure was created in eleventh century Khmer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that its provenance was \"of a private English collection, before 1975.\" (Gelber Affirm. Ex. 8 (\"2007 Catalog\").) Christie's obtained a PCOO from the consignor of this sculpture in December 2006. (Cobden Aff., Ex. 5 (\"Sandstone PCOO\").) The PCOO certified that the Sandstone Figure had been located in \"Surrey, UK, before 1962.\" (Sandstone PCOO.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2012, Christie's amended its provenance policy. \"[I]n addition to the PCOO form,\" consignors were required to submit \"verifiable documentation to substantiate\" the representations in the PCOO. (Christie's Interrogatory Responses, at 5; Cobden Dep., at 194:8-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gelber Affirm., Ex. 17.) Verifiable documentation could include receipts, invoices, inheritance documents, insurance listings, photographs, letters, \"or any other source that the clients can provide above and beyond their own testimony.\" (Christie's Interrogatory Responses, at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In mid-2013, Waran began discussions with Christie's regarding consigning 24 works in his collection for auction. (Cobden Aff., Ex. 7, at 4-5; Gelber Affirm., Ex. 19.) In January 2014, Waran delivered those works to Christie's. (Cobden Aff., Ex. 8, at 1-2.) In February 2014, Christie's informed Waran that due to a lack of provenance verification, Christie's was unable to offer eight of his works in its March 2014 auction. (Cobden Aff., Ex. 11, at 6.) Christie's assured Waran that it would continue to investigate each of those works with a view to including them in a future auction. (Cobden Aff., Ex. 11, at 6.) Waran questioned Christie's inability to authenticate works that it had sold to him. (Cobden Aff., Ex. 11, at 5-6.) Christie's explained\n   that since Waran's purchases, \"the market for Indian antiquities ha[d] come under greater scrutiny,\" causing its \"Legal Department [to] instill[ ] new requirements for substantiation of provenance prior to sale.\" (Cobden Aff., Ex. 11, at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As part of its investigation, Christie's reached out to the Works' consignors, seeking the documentation required under its more rigorous policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cobden Aff., Exs. 9 &amp; 10.) Neither consignor could fulfill this request. The Sandstone Figure's consignor reported that his \"uncle and aunt who might have [the] information passed away some years ago.\" (Cobden Aff., Ex. 9, at 2.) The Blackstone Stele's consignor had \"no memory of [the] sculpture,\" and believed that it had been sold by \"someone else.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Cobden Aff., Ex. 10, at *2.) More than a year later, Christie's followed up with both consignors, but still could not obtain additional documentation. (Gelber Affirm., Ex. 22, at 1; Cobden Aff., Ex. 9, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Simultaneously, executives within Christie's debated whether the firm could make an exception to its stricter provenance policy because Waran had purchased the works from Christie's. (Cobden Aff., Ex. 13, at 2.) Ultimately, Christie's determined that it could not make an exception for the Sandstone Figure and Blackstone Stele. (Cobden Aff., Ex. 15, at 1-3.) Christie's resolved the provenance issues for all of Waran's consigned works except for those two. (See Cobden Aff., Ex. 16, at 2; March 2, 2018 Hearing Transcript, ECF No. 109 (\"Mar. Hr'g Tr.\"), at 2:22-23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Nor did Christie's contradict its earlier representations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mar. Hr'g Tr. at 4:20-25.) Rather, Christie's informed Waran that because its internal procedures had tightened, the Works no longer had sufficient documentation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cobden Aff., Ex. 11, at 1 (informing Waran that Christie's continues to \"stand behind the works [it] sells,\" but had \"instilled new requirements for substantiation of provenance prior to sale\" meaning \"in a few instances, works sold by Christie's years before no longer comply with [its] vetting practices\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Waran's attempt to proffer evidence that the catalogs' descriptions of provenance were false is insufficient. All he points to is that the Works' consignors could not provide additional documentation\n   to Christie's.
