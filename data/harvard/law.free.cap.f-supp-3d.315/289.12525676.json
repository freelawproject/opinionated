Specifically, the Plaintiffs dispute excluding a variety of documents from the administrative record, claim that some attachments to emails otherwise included in the administrative record are missing, and seek to unredact header information (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , authors, recipients, transmission time, subject) of emails in the record. The Plaintiffs also argue that the Department improperly \"predetermined the outcome\" of the Wilton Rancheria's application and that this, coupled with other indicia of bad faith-a rushed review process, culminating\n   in a decision issued on the eve of the change in Presidential Administrations; pressure from the Senate Minority Leader; and the Department's representation to another judge of this District that the timing of any decision was uncertain yet issuing a decision days later-warrants the production of a privilege log.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court finds that none of the three narrow \"unusual circumstances\" apply here to require supplementing the administrative record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dist.

If it is true, as the Plaintiffs allege, that multiple commenters raised the issue of water supplies during the comment period, it is important that the Department's alleged failure to address adequately these comments be based on information before the agency when it made its decision. Holding the agency accountable for information unavailable to it at the time of its decision-when the Plaintiffs have not alleged that the Department in fact had notice of this document-would be incongruous with the fundamental tenets of judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Plaintiffs fault the Department for \"appear[ing]\" to exclude certain procedural documents, such as publication notices for scoping, the availability of the DEIS, and various notices of intent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. To the Plaintiffs, these supposed documents are relevant and important to \"confirm that an agency has complied with various procedural requirements, as well as internal review requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the Department has included in the record \"[a]ll such documents that can be located.\" Fed. Defs.' Response 11. The Department is entitled to a presumption that it properly compiled the record, and the Plaintiffs' speculation that other documents may exist\n   is not an \"unusual circumstance[ ]\" warranting supplementing the record. In any event, the Department avers that it has no further documents of this type to include.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Plaintiffs also complain that some emails in the record are missing their attachment or that some documents in the record are missing their cover email. Mot. to Supplement 9-11. In response to the Plaintiffs' concerns, the Department provided a list of the emails with their corresponding produced attachments and Bates numbers. Fed. Defs.' Response 9. The Department explains that the \"missing\" emails fall into four categories: (1) there was no attachment in the first place; (2) the attachment has been produced; (3) the attachment was withheld or is not part of the record; or (4) some combination thereof.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. The Plaintiffs have not alleged circumstances suggesting that these explanations are insufficient as to require supplementing the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Last, the Plaintiffs argue that the administrative record is incomplete because it does not include certain documents, like conference call invitations for each Department employee who received one, and that the Department therefore must not have searched all relevant fileholders for documents. Mot. to Supplement 13-16. The Plaintiffs also claim that it is \"highly implausible\" that other documents (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , agendas, notes, minutes) were not created relating to these conference calls, and their absence means that the record is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. But these claims are speculative and do not overcome the presumption that the agency properly compiled the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Courts in this District routinely deny requests for privilege logs of documents withheld from the record absent a showing of bad faith or improper behavior.\n   <em>\n    Stand Up for California! v.

And though the production of a privilege log in an APA case is \" 'the exception, not the rule,' \" the unique and likely rare combination of circumstances leading to the January 19, 2017 Record of Decision warrant it in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211719\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/109/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211719\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/109/#p122\">\n    at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These circumstances-each of which is not dispositive standing alone, but all together establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case-include the clearly hurried review process, the documented effort to issue the decision before the change in Presidential Administrations, the disparity between the Department's representation to the District Judge at the January 13, 2017 hearing about \"uncertainty\" in the timeline contrasted against issuing the decision not even a week later, and political pressure from the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The overall timeline of events, culminating in the January 19, 2017 decision, exemplifies the rushed review process. The Tribe applied for land in 2013, which remained pending for nearly three years before the Department began procedures to take into trust the current disputed land in Elk Grove. During those three years, the Department held public meetings and performed an environmental analysis on the land in Galt, California as identified by the Tribe in its initial application. It was not until November 2016-after the Presidential election and after it became clear that\n   a different political party would control the Executive Branch-that the Department \"shifted into warp speed\" to approve the application for the Elk Grove site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 3. Within two months, the Department completed the decision-making process for taking the Elk Grove land into trust-a process that was incomplete after three years for the Galt site-and issued the decision on the last day of the outgoing Presidential Administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Though the Department responds that these \"hectic\" events do not indicate a pre-judged or bad faith decision, the Department does not dispute that it sought to issue a decision before the change in Administration and calculated a timeframe to achieve that desired outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Defs.' Response 18-19 (noting that, to make the January 19, 2017 cut-off, the Department had to \"publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register in time to allow for a thirty-day public comment period to run.\"); TRO Hr'g Tr., Jan. 13, 2017, 37:13-15 (counsel for the Department stating that the comment period closes January 17, 2017). Throughout the two-month period, the Department was under continuous pressure-from the Tribe and the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs-to ensure that the decision issued before the Administration change.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   WR_AR0005814 (email on December 7, 2016 to Lawrence Roberts stating that the Chairman of the Tribe called about his concern that \"i[t] may not be complete by 1/19/17.\"). Emails on December 6 and December 7, 2016 show that the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs was keeping a close eye on the timeline, including that \"Senator Reid will need to get involved soon\" if they did not receive an update that day. WR_AR0005636. At the time, Senator Reid was the Senate Minority Leader, wielding significant influence over the Administration in general and the Department in particular. A committee staff-person stressed that \"this matter is extremely time sensitive and we urge Interior to endeavor to get this under [the] wire before the new administration comes in.\" WR_AR0005634-WR_AR0005637. The Department responded that \"we are aware of the deadline and have every intention of meeting it.\" WR_AR0005634. While expressing an intent to meet a deadline-even an accelerated one-does not exhibit bad faith\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , it does evidence, along with the pressure from the Tribe and the relevant Senate Committee, a strong indication that the agency had an \"unalterably closed mind[ ]\" to approve a decision taking the Elk Grove land into trust for the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Air Transp. Ass'n of Am, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768016,5878948\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/476/\">\n    663 F.3d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Department also arguably acted inconsistently with its obligation to keep an open mind about the decision. In the weeks leading up to the decision, the Plaintiffs repeatedly requested a delay in acquisition, both informally to the Department, through the judicial system via a motion for a temporary restraining order, and through a formal request to the Department for a stay. Despite the compressed timeline it had to complete proceedings before issuing a decision, the Department used no additional time to consider the information before it and denied the formal\n   request after the decision was already made. The Department also represented, on January 13, 2017, to a judge in this District that the timing of the decision-making process was \"uncertain[ ]\" and in part contingent on the number of public comments received. TRO Hr'g Tr., Jan. 13, 2017, 37:21-25. Yet just two days after the public comment period closed,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not even a week after the hearing, the Department issued its decision approving the acquisition of the land. These actions-in tandem with the other circumstances already discussed-establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that the Department acted improperly in making its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Department counters that the political pressure was not improper because there was no threat of funding cuts or other sanctions if the agency did not reach the desired outcome. Fed. Defs.' Response 21. Nor are there public statements by a public official that could have improperly influenced the decision.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Cir. 1981) (holding that, in the context of a rulemaking, there was not improper Congressional pressure because the public official's comments related to a relevant factor to the decision and the agency's decision was not affected by extraneous considerations). But in a case factually similar to this one, the Western District of Wisconsin found that limited discovery was warranted in a challenge to a Department decision denying three tribes' application for a fee-to-trust land acquisition.\n   <em>\n    Sokaogon Chippewa Cmty. v.

It is plausible that the agency's actions are consistent with meeting a deadline and not further delaying the Tribe's application. It could also be that the compressed timeframe, the agency's stated desire to issue the decision before the change in Administrations-not only of the President, but also of the political party of that office-holder-and political pressure led to blinders being put on the agency and an \"unalterably closed mind[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Air Transp.

A push to \"clear the decks\" before the end of a Presidential Administration is not alone sufficient to make the requisite showing of bad faith. But this combination of circumstances, though likely rare, establishes a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case to warrant ordering the production of a privilege log.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As for the Plaintiffs' objection to the redaction of header information (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , authors, recipients, transmission time, subject) from emails in the administrative record, since that information will be contained in a privilege log, this issue is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
