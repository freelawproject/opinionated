FAC, Dkt. 53 \u00b6\u00b6 105-06. It alleged that once Defendants became aware of the alleged fraud, they knew or should have known that \"eventually, the stock price would be corrected, because no fraud can last forever\" and \"the longer Edison's fraud persisted ... the worse the correction of its stock price would be.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-07. It alleged that there were two alternative actions Defendants could have taken consistent with the federal securities laws that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances could not have viewed as ones that were more likely to harm than help the fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the first alternative, Defendant Boada could have made corrective disclosures to the public, or have caused such disclosures by providing the necessary information to the executives at Edison with the authority to do so. Such disclosures would have allowed market forces to cause the price of Edison stock to decline to its true value. In describing this alternative, the FAC alleges that Defendant Boada \"could have sought to tell the public the truth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. As to the second alternative, the FAC alleged that Defendants could have prevented new investments in the Stock Fund by discontinuing both the purchase and sale of the stock until the value of the Stock Fund was no longer inflated,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after the market became aware of the actual, lower value of Edison stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sum, the FAC alleged that Defendants could not reasonably have concluded that taking action would have done more harm than good. The basis for this allegation was that disclosure of the fraud would have resulted in the price of the stock falling to its true value. Plaintiffs contend that this could not be considered a harm to those who were already participants in the\n   Stock Fund because it was inevitable that the stock price would fall once the fraud was disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As noted in the Prior Order, the allegations in the FAC did not satisfy the ERISA pleading standard. The allegations regarding the efficient-markets theory and Defendants' alleged knowledge of it did not meet the pleading standard of\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third\n   </em>\n   or account for the possibility of harm to other Plan members. The FAC also failed to account for the risk that the market might overact to the proposed public disclosure. This would have resulted in an undue decline in the price of the stock. Dkt. 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The prior Order stated that more specific factual allegations would be required to meet the standard of\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [T]he factual allegations in the FAC about the efficient-markets theory are not specifically tailored to this action.\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The new allegations in the SAC as to whether the Defendants could have concluded that disclosing the alleged fraud or freezing stock purchases would do more harm than good to the Stock Fund are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   On March 27, 2014, Edison announced the SONGS Settlement. Defendant Boada knew or should have known at that time about the Company's undisclosed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications with the CPUC. The public did not know about these communications or the risk they posed to the Settlement, so Edison's stock price began to trade at a higher value as a result. Defendant Boada, recognizing this disparity between what he knew as a senior corporate insider and what the public knew, should have understood that this disparity would result in the artificial inflation of Edison's stock price. Boada, after all, was a highly sophisticated, experienced executive with decades of experience in corporate finance, and the premise that false perception by the public regarding a publicly-traded company causes the company's stock to inflate artificially is a rather basic one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Boada could have approached Craver and possibly others and entreated them to disclose the undisclosed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications to correct the public's misapprehension of Edison's value. As of March 31, 2014, Edison's adjusted stock price close was $52.18, not even a full three dollars higher than it had been on March 27, the first day of the Class Period. In other words, very little artificial inflation of Edison's stock had yet taken place. Very few Plan participants had yet had the opportunity to purchase Stock Fund shares at artificially high prices. Corrective disclosure at this time, under basic efficient-market theory, would only have reduced Edison's stock price back to its pre-inflation level-about $49 a share-and the damage to Plan participant purchasers would have almost been completely avoided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Boada would have had no reason at that time to fear an overcorrection of Edison's stock price, particularly because\n   the fraud had only been extant for a very short period of time. If anything, the public would have been more likely to view the misrepresentation as a forgivable error than as part of a reputation-harming fraud perpetrated on investors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Boada also could have chosen to do nothing at that time (in fact, that is exactly what he did). As time passed, however, he would have noticed that Edison's stock price was rising higher and higher while its improper\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications remained undisclosed. As of June 19, 2014, the adjusted closing price of Edison's stock was $53.31; on August 29, 2014, it was $54.85; on November 20, 2014, it had climbed to $58.10; in December 2014, it passed $60 a share, peaking in the mid-60s in January and early February 2015. During this time, the public believed the SONGS Settlement was secure and that Edison's problems in connection with it were in the rearview mirror getting smaller and smaller.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   But the higher Edison's stock price climbed without any of the truth about the Company's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications emerging, the more concerned Boada should have been. After all, the higher the stock price was, the further it would have to fall when the truth came out. Whereas on March 31, 2014, corrective disclosure would have resulted in, at worst, a $3 price correction, on January 30, 2015, the same corrective disclosure would have resulted in a potential\n   <em>\n    $15\n   </em>\n   price correction because Edison's stock was trading at $64.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendant Boada was not required to see the future, but as a prudent fiduciary, he should have been able to pay attention to the recent past. And, seeing that Edison's stock was continually rising over the first 10 months of the Class Period, he should have recognized that a sooner disclosure at a lower stock price would result in a softer correction, and therefore less harm to Plan participants, than would a later disclosure at a higher stock price.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Starting February 9, 2015, the truth about Edison's misconduct began to emerge, albeit in dribs and drabs instead of all at once. Each of these mini-revelations resulted in a partial correction of Edison's stock price. Boada should have recognized, as a prudent fiduciary, that allowing the stock to be corrected in piecemeal fashion was worse for Plan participants than a single, fulsome correction earlier on would have been, because the more prolonged the fraud was, the greater the damage to Edison's reputation for trustworthiness, and thus the harsher a correction that occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Other factors should have compelled Boada to support earlier disclosure as well. Price is not the only way of measuring the risk of a publicly-traded stock. As an experienced financial executive, not to mention a CFA, Boada should have understood that there are relevant proxies one can look at if one wants to understand the underlying volatility and risk of a stock that one is supposed to be monitoring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   For example, the implied volatility of Edison options is a good indicator of how the market viewed the overall risk of Edison. The greater the implied volatility as reflected in the performance and trading of Edison options, the more risky the market could be said to have viewed Edison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Throughout the Class Period, the implied volatility of Edison options steadily increased. At the beginning of the Class Period, it hovered around 16; through the fall of 2014, it rose modestly to 17 or 18. Then the implied volatility began to climb higher, hitting (and surpassing) 20 in October 2014. After the truth about\n   Edison's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications began to emerge in February 2015, the implied volatility for Edison shot above 20 and stayed there, hitting 20.85 on February 9, 2015, rising above 21 in March and April 2015, and hitting a peak of 24.44 on May 7, 2015, and remaining above 20 for the remainder of the Class Period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendant Boada should have understood the significance of this steady increase in implied volatility-the greater the increase, the more volatile and risky Edison common stock was, and thus the more likely a stock-price correction would be harsher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Had the overall trend in Edison's implied volatility during the Class Period been in the opposite direction, defendant Boada might have been able to make a reasonable argument that holding off corrective disclosure was the better option-the one likely to cause less harm to Plan participants-because the harshness of the stock-price correction was likely softening. But the trend of increasing implied volatility was a clear signal to Boada that acting sooner to correct Edison's fraud was likely to cause less harm than acting later would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Similarly, Edison's bonds decreased in price over the course of the Class Period, beginning at a price of around 106 and decreasing to about 104 by the end of the Class Period. The Corporate Bond Index, which rose, and comparable maturity Treasury Note remained relatively constant, and thus did not experience similar declines during that period, meaning that Edison's decline was not part of some industry-wide or other larger general economic trend; it was specific to Edison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Edison's declining bond price was another indicator of growing underlying corporate risk at Edison. This trend, combined with the trend of increasing implied volatility, was a clear indication to any prudent fiduciary that any stock-price correction that Edison experienced was going to be more severe as the bond price dropped and the implied volatility rose. These factors should also have caused defendant Boada to seek to make an earlier corrective disclosure in order to cause Plan participants the least amount of harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendant Boada, as an experienced executive with a deep background in finance, should also have understood that, the longer Edison's fraud went on, the more damage would be done to the Company's reputation when the truth emerged. Here, that is exactly what happened-for a good six months after the truth about Edison's misconduct had fully emerged in late June 2015, Edison's stock price remained flat (or declined even further). Analysts at the time suggested that this stock price drop was an \"overcorrection,\" that it was disproportionate to the loss in company value that should have been reflected in Edison's stock price. For example, on June 25, 2015, the day after the end of the Class Period, an analyst report issued by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey stated, \"We believe EIX's 3% stock decline yesterday (in response to the consumer group, TURN's, decision to support a petition to reopen the SONGS settlement) is an overreaction.\" The same report noted that \"EIX is currently trading at a 2% discount to the peer group (based on our 2017 estimates).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A June 25, 2015 analyst report from UBS, responding to the stock drop, stated that a \"positive view\" of Edison was still appropriate. The stock drop was \"about public perception\" of Edison and the SONGS Settlement, and not about the fundamental value of the Company. A July 1, 2015 report from RBC Capital Markets was similarly bullish on Edison, calling the Company \"one of the best\n   ways to play the 'grid of the future' story.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   That Edison was still largely viewed as a solid company with a bright future, but whose stock price nevertheless declined or remained flat for at least six months after the revelation of its fraud, is strong evidence that the hit Edison took in the stock market was largely about damage to its credibility and reputation. Had defendant Boada tried to effectuate corrective disclosure at an earlier date, some, or perhaps all, of that reputational damage could have been mitigated or avoided altogether.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   No prudent fiduciary, armed with all of the above information-all of which was knowable by defendants at the time-could possibly have concluded that Plan participants would be better served by a delayed disclosure and a prolonged fraud. Earlier corrective disclosure based on these specific facts would not-could not-have done \"more harm than good\" to the Plan or its participants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 118-135.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   These arguments apply with equal force to the secondary option of closing the Stock Fund to new investments until the artificial inflation ended. Given the increasing implied volatility and decreasing bond prices, as well as the reputational damage that a longer fraud would cause, a cessation of trading at an earlier time, even if it necessitated some public disclosure about the fact of the cessation, could not reasonably be believed to be likely to cause \"more harm than good\" to Plan participants. The rising inflation of Edison's stock price, coupled with the increasing risk as reflected in options and bond trading, should have made it clear that earlier action was better than no action; any stock-price drop that might have resulted from the temporary closing of the Stock Fund would be less than the stock-price drop that ultimately occurred after an unnecessarily prolonged and reputation-damaging fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   SAC \u00b6 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiff contends that these allegations are specific as to the claim that Defendants knew or should have known of certain facts that would have led a prudent fiduciary in the same position to conclude that \"earlier disclosure of Edison's fraud would do less harm than later disclosure.\" Dkt. 93 at 9. Plaintiff adds that the SAC plausibly alleges two alternatives that were available to Defendants. It is alleged that each would have been consistent with the securities laws, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed either as more likely to harm the fund than to help it.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Boada could have brought the alleged fraud to the attention of Edison executives who had reporting responsibilities under the federal laws or could have made the corrective disclosure himself if Edison executives failed to do so in response to his notification. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28, 50, 119.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Boada could have closed the Stock Fund to new investments until the stock price returned to a level no longer a product of the artificial inflation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiff cites certain of the new allegations in the SAC in support of her position that these options satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third\n   </em>\n   pleading standard. They are as follows: (i) if Boada had disclosed the alleged fraud near the beginning of the Class Period, nearly all of the harm could have been avoided because little artificial inflation in Edison's stock price had occurred at that time, and there would have been no further inflation, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 119-20; (ii) as long as the fraud continued, Edison's stock price would continue to rise and \"the further it would have to fall\" when the fraud was disclosed and the stock price corrected,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 121-22; (iii) if Boada had corrected the fraud through a one-time, comprehensive\n   disclosure instead of piecemeal disclosures, it would have mitigated the harm to plan members,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124; (iv) because the implied volatility of Edison's stock increased over the Class Period, Boada should have been aware of that fact and that a later, corrective disclosure would cause greater harm,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 126-27, 129; (v) the decrease in Edison's bond prices over the Class Period, when coupled with the increased volatility in Edison's stock, would have led a prudent fiduciary to conclude that the longer he or she waited to make a corrective disclosure, the more harm such a disclosure would cause,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-31, and (vi) Boada should have recognized that market overreaction to corrective disclosures tends to become more likely the longer the fraud is prolonged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 132-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As noted in the Prior Order, the analytical framework established in\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third\n   </em>\n   recognized that the decrease in value of a stock-even if a result of an improperly inflated price-was a harm that a prudent fiduciary could properly weigh in making an investment decision.\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a prudent fiduciary might conclude that \"stopping purchases ... or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund\").
