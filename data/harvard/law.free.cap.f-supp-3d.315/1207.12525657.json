The Court denies the motion to suppress the intercepted calls, but grants in part the motion to suppress Mr. Gaines's statements from the excerpts of recorded calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 6, 2015, law enforcement agents submitted to the Superior Court of New Jersey an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   application for a wiretap order. The agents wanted to surveil Anthony \"Monte\" Gaines and \"other identified and unidentified individuals\" for evidence of potential drug law violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant, Robert Arellano, was not mentioned in the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although the affidavit explained that \"extrinsic minimization\" is the \"cutting back [of] the hours of interception, during the period of wire and electronic interception,\" the affidavit did not explain when or how extrinsic minimization would be used. (Doc. 25, Ex. 1 (First wiretap affidavit) at 101.) The affidavit also mentioned \"intrinsic minimization,\" but only to say that intrinsic minimization is not feasible for intercepted electronic communications like text messages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.) There was no explanation of what intrinsic minimization entailed, nor was there a description of when or how the agents would use intrinsic minimization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The New Jersey Superior Court entered the order that same day, finding probable cause to believe that the individuals listed in the affidavit had violated the specified drug laws. In its order, the New Jersey Court stated that \"the interception shall end as soon as practical and be conducted in such a way as to minimize or eliminate the interception of communications other than the type described herein by making reasonable efforts, whenever possible, to reduce the hours of interception authorized by this Order....\" (Doc. 25, Ex. 2 (Wiretap Order) at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 8, 2015, agents intercepted a call between Mr. Gaines and Mr. Arellano. According to Mr. Arellano, the call lasted about 42 minutes and did not involve the drug offenses justifying the wiretap. The call did, however, involve discussion that implicated dog fighting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On notice that agents may have captured \"other crime evidence,\" a prosecutor with the state of New Jersey wrote a letter to the judge supervising the wiretap. The letter, dated October 13, 2015, contains the following information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Law enforcement intercepted calls that apparently relate to dog fighting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 The calls are between Mr. Gaines and \"an unknown individual who appears to be from New Mexico.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 \"There have been other calls containing what [law enforcement] believe[d] to be CDS\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Distribution pertinent conversations which include references to dog fighting.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 New Jersey has no statute barring dog fighting, except for perhaps cruelty to animals, which law enforcement cannot investigate with a wiretap.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The New Jersey prosecutor \"had instructed\" monitors to \"minimize calls related to dog fighting unless there is also a CDS pertinent reason to monitor the call.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 But \"upon further consideration,\" the prosecutor noted that \"dog fighting is customarily associated with gambling,\" which law enforcement may investigate with a wiretap.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The prosecutor notified the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 The prosecutor promised to notify the Court if there was \"a change in circumstances necessitating an amendment to the [wiretap order].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25, Ex. 4 (Letter to Judge).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The prosecutor never sought an amendment to add gambling as an offense under investigation. Following the letter, and before the 30-day wiretap period ended, the government intercepted at least some parts of four more calls, on October 19, 23, 25, and 30, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25, Ex. 3 at 1-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 4, 2015, law enforcement sought to extend the wiretap for another\n   30 days, submitting an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   application for an extension order. The affidavit did not mention Mr. Arellano, dog fighting, or gambling. The Superior Court of New Jersey entered an extension order, which contained the same minimization language as the previous order authorizing the wiretap. That same day, the government intercepted another call between Mr. Arellano and Mr. Gaines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 19, 2015, state prosecutors asked the judge supervising the wiretap for an order to disclose, which would allow them to share other crime evidence obtained from the wiretap with other law enforcement agencies. Specifically, state prosecutors wanted to share with federal agents and prosecutors all orders, affidavits, and \" 'contents of conversations and data intercepted throughout the course of the investigation' for the purpose of investigating and presenting to a grand jury\" evidence of certain crimes, including violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202156\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which prohibits animal fighting ventures. (Doc. 29 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The supervising judge authorized the requested disclosure. Although the supervising judge said that she \"made findings of fact and conclusions of law,\" she did not specify her findings and conclusions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29, Ex. 2 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following disclosure, federal agents investigated Mr. Arellano, culminating in a May 20, 2016 application for a search warrant to search Mr. Arellano's house. The application stated that there was probable cause to believe that there would be evidence of dog fighting in Mr. Arellano's house. (Doc. 29, Ex. 7 (Search warrant application) at 17.) This conclusion relied heavily on what the government claimed to be lawfully-intercepted calls between Mr. Arellano and Mr. Gaines. But contrary to Mr. Arellano's belief, the application also relied on evidence apart from the intercepted calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On \"Peds Online,\" a website that dog fighters use to post breeding information to prove and verify dog lineage, the government found about 80 dog pedigrees for fighting dogs that identify Mr. Arellano as either the breeder or owner. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202156\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202156\">\n    at 12-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Eleven of the 80 pedigrees contained pictures of dogs, and scars or injuries are visible in 6 of the photographs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Some photographs also have handwritten notations, such as \"2xW,\" \"5xw,\" \"CH,\" or \"GR CH.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Steve Romero, Special Agent with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General, swore that these notes refer to the dogs having won multiple dog fights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Several pedigrees from Peds Online that identified Mr. Arellano as the owner or breeder \"contained the dog 'CH Wood's Miss Pool Hall Red 5xW ROM' in the bloodline.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) In an intercepted call between Mr. Gaines and \"Person # 1,\" Mr. Gaines references his \"Arellano dog ... my little Pool Hall bitch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In another intercepted call, between Mr. Gaines and \"Person # 2,\" Mr. Gaines told Person # 2 that \"he has 'Pool Hall stuff' from the man he gets his dogs from in New Mexico.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In yet another intercepted call, between Mr. Gaines and \"Person # 3,\" Mr. Gaines tells Person # 3 that he was \"in possession of a female dog he got from [Mr. Arellano].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Gaines also \"described the pedigree of one of his dogs to an unknown male and said she came from [Mr. Arellano].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And Mr. Gaines told \"Person # 5\" that \"he pays [Mr. Arellano] several hundred dollars per dog.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Gaines told \"another dog fighter on October 20, 2015[,]\" that Mr. Arellano \"just put ... one through the air.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) On the basis of intercepted communications, Special Agent Romero sought and obtained air waybills that show Mr. Arellano\n   shipped dogs through Delta Air Lines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Agents also conducted ground and aerial surveillance of Mr. Arellano's house. They saw \"nine small square chain-link fence dog enclosures, each separated from the other by at least several feet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) They saw dogs in four of the enclosures, as well as dog houses in three of the enclosures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) The ground in the area was worn in an arc pattern, which Special Agent Romero said was indicative of a \"chain spot,\" or a radius-like disruption to the ground resulting from a dog dragging on a chain to which it is tethered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After viewing the evidence presented in the warrant application, a magistrate judge approved the search warrant, and law enforcement searched Mr. Arellano's house on May 20, 2016. The agents seized all manner of evidence in Mr. Arellano's house, including photographs, videos, hard drives, and dogs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Arellano was arrested on June 1, 2016, on a complaint issued out of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Mr. Arellano conspired with others to violate federal dog fighting prohibitions. (Doc. 25 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 9, 2017, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of New Mexico filed another indictment against Mr. Arellano, charging him with the possession of 13 dogs for purposes of having the dogs participate in an animal fighting venture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On June 21, 2016, New Jersey prosecutors applied to the supervising wiretap judge for disclosure of the intercepted communication \"to any attorney assigned to represent any defendant[ ] charged as a result of this investigation\" or \"for any other purposes pursuant to the prosecution of this matter.\" (Doc. 29, Ex. C at 6.) The New Jersey court granted the application. (Doc. 29, Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At trial, the government wants to introduce excerpts of the October 8, October 19, and October 30 calls between Mr. Arellano and Mr. Gaines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Tenth Circuit affirmed the constitutionality of \u00a7 2517(5) in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"799273\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/449/679/#p686\">\n    449 F.2d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686-87 (10th Cir. 1971).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Depending on the circumstances, \"other crime evidence\"\n   <em>\n    sometimes\n   </em>\n   can be used even if the crime is not enumerated in \u00a7 2516 (the section that lists crimes for which a wiretap is a valid investigative tool).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This means that the government is flatly wrong when it contends that other crime evidence need never be minimized, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 98 at 2), or when it asserted at oral argument that the subjective intent of law enforcement agents does not matter. As the Court explains below, if there is no good faith basis to believe that a communication would produce evidence of the target crime, then the government must follow standard minimization procedures. And if law enforcement agents are only listening to a conversation to catch a crime that is not the target of the wire, then the other crime evidence is anticipated\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   is not incidental.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929625\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/852/#p865\">\n    726 F.2d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining the illegality of using \"a warrant authorizing seizure of one type of evidence as a license to collect evidence of an offense not covered by the authorization\");\n   <em>\n    McKinnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1908822\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/721/19/#p23\">\n    721 F.2d at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the difference between something being unanticipated and something being incidental).

Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 1968 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 66 at 162:3-8 (explaining the government's view that there is pretext when the wiretap was a \"total sham\" from the beginning); Doc 98 at 2 (\"minimization of other crimes evidence is not required in the first place\").) Basically, the government believes minimization is unnecessary even if, during the course of a valid wiretap, agents lose their good-faith belief that the conversation will produce evidence of the target crime. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 66 at 162:3-8; Doc 98 at 2.) That reading is too broad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Taking into account the\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   Court's presumption that law enforcement complied with all provisions of the wiretap statute, and the\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   Court's concern about the imprecise nature of electronic surveillance, a fairer interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   is that if the government anticipates intercepting evidence of the target crime, and incidentally captures evidence of another crime, then it simply cannot be helped. But if the government ignores the minimization provision of the wiretap act when it is clear that a communication would not yield evidence of the target crime, then any other crime evidence would not be incidental, and such evidence would not be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Turning to the calls the government plans to introduce, the October 8 call was reasonably minimized. At the very beginning of the call, the parties discussed \"pills.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 98, Ex. B (Tr. of Oct. 8 Call) at 2.) Since the wire was established to target drug crimes, the reference to pills could have triggered red flags that justified further listening. Additionally, there is scattered language throughout the call that reasonably could be coded drug references, such as talk of \"Jeep Rascal Stuff,\" (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:12-13), and talk of \"some Chinaman type of stuff,\" (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:22). And the monitors did minimally minimize the call. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:4, 13:2.) Since this call was intercepted during the early stages of the wiretap investigation-when it is difficult to determine the relevancy of conversations-and since the law does not demand perfect differentiation of innocent and criminal conversations, the Court finds that the October 8 call was reasonably minimized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Killingsworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11976226\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/1159/#p1165\">\n    117 F.3d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Likewise, the October 19 call was reasonably minimized. In that call, the monitor appears to have utilized good-faith spot-checking: after listening to just over two minutes of the initial conversation, the monitor apparently alternated between minimizing for about 20-30 seconds and listening to about 20-30 seconds of conversation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 98, Ex. C (Tr. of Oct. 19 Call).) The conversation was minimized a total of 27 times, and the fact that the monitor adhered to the minimization pattern even when it caused some minimizations to occur in the middle of inculpatory dog-fighting conversations signals the monitor's good faith. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Oct. 19 Call.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The October 30 call also appears to be reasonably minimized. That call is peculiar in that, although Mr. Gaines and Mr. Arellano already had two conversations that did not involve drugs, the government minimized less than it did during the October 19 call. Still, the monitor appears to have followed a general spot-checking pattern during the October 30 call-including minimizing in the middle of inculpatory exchanges-and Mr. Arellano has not shown that the spot-checking for this call was inadequate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11976226\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/1159/#p1165\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In sum, the October 8, 19, and 30 calls were reasonably minimized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Good faith and pretext analysis.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The government was wrong when it asserted at oral argument that the subjective intent of agents in capturing a call does not matter. Other crime evidence is only lawfully intercepted if it is incidental to a good faith investigation into the crime that justified the wiretap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929625\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/852/#p865\">\n    726 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   865 ;\n   <em>\n    McKinnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1908822\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/721/19/#p23\">\n    721 F.2d at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the investigation into the target crime is just pretext for the government to listen to the other crime evidence, then the interception is unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929625\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/852/#p865\">\n    726 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   865 ;\n   <em>\n    McKinnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1908822\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/721/19/#p23\">\n    721 F.2d at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, there is insufficient evidence to find that the government acted in bad faith when obtaining the communications between Mr. Arellano and Mr. Gaines. The first call was early into the wiretap and contained possible references to drugs throughout. The next two calls appear to have been spot-checked, with the monitors adhering fairly strictly to a minimization pattern that cut out inculpatory dog-fighting evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court notes, however, that the New Jersey prosecutor's letter to the supervising wiretap judge raises concerns. The letter reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Please accept this letter as notification concerning other crimes evidence, involving the above referenced matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   We have intercepted calls which appear to be related to dog fighting between the\n   target of this Order and an unknown individual who appears to be from New Mexico. There have been other calls containing what we believe to be CDS Distribution pertinent conversations which include references to dog fighting. New Jersey has no statute on point other than cruelty to animals, which is not an enumerated offense under the Wire Tap Act. In an abundance of caution I had instructed that our monitors be told to minimize calls related to dog fighting unless there is also a CDS pertinent reason to monitor the call.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Upon further consideration, dog fighting is customarily associated with gambling, which is an enumerated offense. The United States Attorney's Office has been advised and is looking into the matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   I will contact the Court should there be a change in circumstances necessitating an amendment to the Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Letter to Judge.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, the prosecutor represented to the New Jersey judge that his office had intercepted \"calls\" (plural) involving an individual from New Mexico. When the letter was mailed on October 13, 2015, however, the government had intercepted only one of Mr. Arellano's calls-the October 8, 2015 call. The government attributed this misstatement, which could have colored the New Jersey court's perception of the situation, to a typographical error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, the placement of the statement \"[t]here have been other calls containing ... CDS Distribution pertinent conversations\"-which the Court understands to refer to calls between Mr. Gaines and other individuals-could have been misleading since one could easily make the mistake, given the preceding sentence and lack of clarification, of thinking that the letter was referring to conversations between Mr. Arellano and Mr. Gaines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Third, the prosecutor says \"I had instructed that our monitors be told to minimize calls related to dog fighting unless there is also a CDS pertinent reason to monitor the call.\" Does the \"had instructed\" signify that this minimization instruction is moot? Or does it mean that he already instructed the monitors to minimize accordingly?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Fourth, \"[u]pon further consideration, dog fighting is customarily associated with gambling, which is an enumerated offense.\" Was this a half-hearted pass at pretext? If law enforcement had sought a wiretap for gambling, and all they could offer was one dog-fighting conversation and the allegation that \"dog fighting is customarily associated with gambling,\" they would be hard-pressed to find any judge willing to approve the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The prosecutor's letter to the New Jersey judge is no model of clarity, and it raises inferences of bad faith. But in light of the fact that the October 8, 19, and 30 calls look to be adequately and non-discriminately minimized, the Court narrowly finds that the other crime evidence in the calls was not acquired through pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because the calls in question were adequately minimized and the government acted without pretext, the calls will not be suppressed. The evidence from those calls, along with the government's independent investigative efforts discussed above-the air waybills, Peds Online, physical and aerial surveillance, etc.-provide probable cause for the search warrant for Mr. Arellano's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mr. Gaines's statements in the October 8, 19, and 30 calls\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Having ruled that the October 8, 19, and 30 calls will not be suppressed, the Court must determine what portions of those calls are admissible. The government does not seek to introduce the entire calls, but only excerpts of the October 8 call (Doc. 67, Ex. A), the October 19 call (Doc. 67,\n   Ex. B), and the October 30 call (Doc. 67, Ex. C). In those excerpts, Mr. Arellano's statements are admissible as statements of a party opponent, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), but Mr. Gaines's statements would have to clear the hearsay hurdle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To introduce Mr. Gaines's statements in its exhibits A-C, the government argues that those statements only provide \"little more than context and filler\" and are not offered for truth. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Although the government's rationale for admitting Mr. Gaines's statements is to provide context, the government does not invoke Fed. R. Evid. 106 (the Rule of Completeness), which provides that \"[i]f a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part-or any other writing or recorded statement-that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time.\" Fed. R. Evid. 106. Instead, the government relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n    575 F.3d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2009) for the proposition that statements that merely provide context and are not offered for truth are admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n    at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the government misreads\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , the district court admitted the entire audio recording of an interview between two law enforcement officers and the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n    at 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, the government argued that the recording's admission did not violate the hearsay rule because \"an interviewer's statements are offered to provide context for the interviewee's answers, rather than for the truth of the matter asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n    at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tenth Circuit derided this rationale as a \"malleable notion,\" and added that it was \"skeptical of the government's argument that all of [the law enforcement agents'] statements ... provide meaningful context.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n    at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Circuit went on to say that \"[i]nvoking the word 'context' does not permit an end-run around the hearsay rules such that the government may smuggle into evidence all interviewer statements. We view such evidence with a particularly jaundiced eye when, as here, the officers' statements regularly overwhelm the defendant's.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n    at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the end, the Circuit did not decide whether the government's rationale had merit: \"[b]ut we need not decide whether it was error to admit the entire recording because we conclude that if it was error, the error was harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034714\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1069/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   At oral argument, the government described\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   as showing the \"outer limits\" of the context argument. But if\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   had delineated an outer limit, then it would have held that the district court did not err in admitting the entire recording.\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   did not do so, instead ruling that even if the district court overstepped the outer limits of the context rationale, that error would be harmless given the weight of the evidence against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   So\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   does not help the government. What\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   does, however, is provide guidance on how to evaluate a \"context\" argument: the context has to be \"meaningful\" and courts should be especially doubtful of the context rationale when the proffered statements overwhelm legitimate statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In addition, if Mr. Gaines's statements really provide \"little more than context and filler,\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 67 at 3), then the Court should be wary of allowing their potential prejudice to substantially outweigh their small probative value,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed.
