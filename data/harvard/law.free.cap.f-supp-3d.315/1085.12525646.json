Chang, United States District Judge\n   This case arises out of the unfortunate spoilage of over 53,000 pounds of frozen pork. The pork thawed in transit when its refrigeration temperature was improperly set to a spring-like temperature of +18\u00b0 C (64\u00b0 F) instead of -18\u00b0 C (0\u00b0 F). R. 39, Am.

The seller, Tomex Foods, and its insurer, Codan Forsikring, brought suit against ConGlobal Industries, City Haul Inc., and Summit Cold Storage Corp., alleging various violations of the Carmack Amendment, as well as alternative breach of contract and negligence claims, in an effort to recover nearly $70,000 in damages.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am.

Tomex, a Danish food corporation, hired Summit Cold Storage to store its frozen pork as Tomex looked for a buyer. Am. Compl. \u00b6 20. In March 2016, Tomex sold the product to a supermarket chain in the Dominican Republic, so Tomex had to arrange for overseas transportation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. It hired City Haul to carry the cargo by truck from Summit's cold storage facility to the Landers Rail Terminal in Chicago.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22. From there, non-party Mitsui O.S.K. Lines would take it by train to Virginia and then by ship to the Dominican Republic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was Mitsui that allegedly contracted with ConGlobal to provide a refrigerated shipping container for the product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Tomex instructed each of its vendors-Summit, City Haul, and Mitsui-that the cargo's temperature had to be maintained at -18\u00b0 C (0\u00b0 F), so that it would not thaw and spoil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Mitsui allegedly passed this instruction on to ConGlobal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the end of March, the cargo began its journey when City Haul picked up the empty refrigerated container from ConGlobal, which had allegedly set the container's thermostat to +18\u00b0 C (instead of -18\u00b0 C), and brought it to Summit's cold storage facility to be loaded. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. Summit employees packed the frozen pork into the container-without adjusting it to the required -18\u00b0 C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. At that point, the container's thermostat was still set to +18\u00b0 C, presumably the temperature since the container's pick-up and where it remained the entire time that the container held the product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Once loaded, City Haul picked up the cargo, issued or accepted a bill of lading to cover the shipment, and agreed to carry it to Landers Rail Terminal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. City Haul never adjusted the temperature, even though it too had been instructed to keep the cargo at -18\u00b0 C.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. For reasons unexplained in the complaint, City Haul brought the container to ConGlobal rather than to the Landers Rail Terminal (as it was contracted to do).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. At that point, ConGlobal apparently too did not adjust the temperature from its setting of +18\u00b0 C.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Then, it was allegedly ConGlobal that \"transferred it to Landers Rail Terminal,\" where the container was ramped onto the rail carrier for its trip to Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the container arrived in Virginia in early April 2016, Mitsui discovered that the pork had thawed during its travel. Am. Compl. \u00b6 33. The thermostat on the container was still set to +18\u00b0 C.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The thawed meat was (not surprisingly) a total loss, and Tomex suffered losses totaling $69,356.55.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Tomex submitted a claim to its insurer, Codan, which paid the claim minus a deductible, and Codan became subrogated to the rights of Tomex to sue for damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Even though Plaintiffs did not specifically plead that Mistui or Tomex performed under the contract (namely, paying consideration for the container), that specific allegation is not needed to avoid dismissal.

The point of apparent agency is that it binds the\n    <em>\n     principal\n    </em>\n    to a contract, based on an apparent agent's actions. But ConGlobal is not the principal in the alleged contract; rather, it is the contracting party who supposedly dealt with Tomex's agent, Mitsui. It is unnecessary to plead that Mitsui acted with apparent agency-the principal, Tomex, is not trying to argue its way out of its obligations to the contract. Quite the opposite, it is affirming that Mitsui could contract on its behalf to get the product to its destination.
