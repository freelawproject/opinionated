Before me are two Motions to Dismiss: one from the Government and one from Defendant-Intervenors (collectively, Defendants), each raising jurisdictional and pleading arguments.

In the first, the Plaintiffs contend that the Government violated the Regulatory Flexibility Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20601\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 612 (RFA), by issuing proposed and final critical habitat designations (the Proposed and Final Rule) under the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S. \u00a7 1531\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , without conducting regulatory flexibility analyses of the impact of the designation on small entities. Compl. 12-13. In the second, the Plaintiffs argue that violating the RFA in turn violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the Government is restricting land use on 1.8 million acres, citing potentially inappropriate grazing.

And even when consultations allow grazing permits to continue, associated delays and requirements impose economic costs. Wilbur Decl. 2-5; Leinassar Decl. 2-6. Existing protections for these species may have been extensive, but common sense tells me that a 1.8 million acre land use rule will have some impact on ranchers and farmers who utilize the land. I find a \"substantial probability\" (1) that this action will at least marginally decrease the supply of feed, (2) that the Plaintiffs obtain feed from these lands, and (3) that the Plaintiffs will suffer at least one dollar of economic harm as a result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenters Indus.

The Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs are not \"directly regulated\" because the Final Rule requires consultation between federal agencies, and nothing more.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   Gov. Mot. Dismiss 3-4, 23. But that argument understates the Final Rule's impact. The Rule requires not just consultation, but consultation so that federal agencies \"insure\" that federally-authorized actions are not \"likely to ... result in the destruction of adverse modification of [critical] habitat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

Rather, this is a Final Rule that requires one federal agency to consult with another federal agency about the Final Rule's impact on land use, although the ultimate impact of these consultations will be felt by small entities like the Plaintiffs and their members. Indeed, the Final Rule was promulgated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under statutory authority granted to Interior Secretary Zinke, who also oversees the National Park Service, one of the agencies ordered to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service about implementation of the Final Rule on parkland. Defendant Zinke may not avoid the requirements of the RFA by passing the conductor's baton from his right hand to his left. The D.C. Circuit has never held that the involvement of multiple federal agencies breaks the chain of RFA causation, and indeed it would run contrary to the RFA's design if one component of the Department of the Interior could escape the requirement that \"the agency ... prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis\" for a \"final rule,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20604\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by simply ordering a sister agency to implement the rule on its behalf.
