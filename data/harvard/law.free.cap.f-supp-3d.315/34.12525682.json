All of the statutory clues confirm this deduction. Read as a whole, the exchange visitor program preserves family unity by allowing J-2 visa holders to remain with J-1 visa holders as they \"temporarily\" travel to the United States, and return to practice medicine in their country of origin with fresh abilities. When section 1182(e) tells us that anyone \"admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(J) of this title ... who came to the United States or acquired such status in order to receive graduate medical education or training\" must return to their last foreign residence before applying for a Green Card, the most natural reading of the statute is that derivative visa holders-\"nonimmigrant[s],\" the statute reminds us-must do the same, because their continued residence in the United States is tied to the J-1 person's status.
