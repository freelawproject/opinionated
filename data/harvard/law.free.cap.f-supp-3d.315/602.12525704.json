This time, the witness seeks to quash the grand jury subpoenas on the grounds that the Special Counsel lacks authority to issue the subpoenas as his appointment is unconstitutional, in violation of the Appointments Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[T]he Appointments Clause was designed to ensure public accountability for both the making of a bad appointment\n   and the rejection of a good one.\"\n   <em>\n    Edmond v.

The exercise of prosecutorial power, just like the exercise of other forms of government authority, is ultimately accountable to elected officials. Federal prosecutors are granted broad authority under our laws to choose their targets and pursue their investigations. As former Attorney General Robert H. Jackson stated, \"[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous.\" Robert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, Address at Conference of United States Attorneys (Apr. 1, 1940). Such power, left unchecked, is susceptible to abuse. \"Under our system of government, the primary check against prosecutorial abuse is a political one.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison v. Olson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/#p728\">\n    487 U.S. 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/#p728\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/#p728\">\n    101 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Prosecutors must wield broad powers to investigate effectively criminal activity, but elected officials must exercise sufficient control over prosecutors, principally by setting boundaries in law, to enable the public to know who to credit or blame for exercises of prosecutorial authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, the witness essentially argues that the Special Counsel wields too much power with too little accountability. Specifically, the witness contends that the Special Counsel was appointed unlawfully, under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, U.S. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, because (1) the Special Counsel is a principal rather than inferior officer, and thus was required to be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate; (2) no statute authorized the Special Counsel's appointment, as the Constitution requires; and (3) the Department of Justice official who appointed the Special Counsel lacked authority to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The witness raises legitimate questions, but his concerns are not legally sustainable. The scope of the Special Counsel's power falls well within the boundaries the Constitution permits, as the Special Counsel is supervised by an official who is himself accountable to the elected President. The witness's remaining arguments fare no better. Multiple statutes authorize the Special Counsel's appointment, and the official who appointed the Special Counsel had power to do so. For these reasons, explained in further detail below, the witness's motion to quash the grand jury subpoenas is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Consideration of the constitutional and statutory issues the witness raises benefits from review of the historical development of the Attorney General's authority to direct and supervise the federal government's law enforcement responsibilities, and to appoint attorneys to assist him in this task. Following this is an overview of relevant statutes and the internal Department of Justice Special Counsel regulations. Finally, the circumstances surrounding the Special Counsel's appointment, as well as the events giving rise to the instant dispute, are recounted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Historical Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Attorney General did not always possess the centralized authority he enjoys today to direct the United States's law enforcement and litigation responsibilities. Rather, such authority developed and expanded over time. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the office of Attorney General, who was authorized-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   to prosecute and conduct all suits in the Supreme Court in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the President of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments, touching any matters that may concern their departments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States (\"Judiciary Act\"), ch. 20, \u00a7 35,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%2073\">\n    1 Stat. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93 (1789).

L. REV. 165, 176 (1939).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Judiciary Act also provided for the appointment in each district of a district attorney, later to be known as U.S. Attorney, \"learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States in such district ... whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil actions in which the United States shall be concerned, except before the supreme court in the district in which that court shall be holden.\" Judiciary Act \u00a7 35. The Act gave the Attorney General \"no supervisory control over\" the district attorneys, who \"functioned independently\" and could be directed only by the President.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This provision ensures that the Attorney General will be held accountable to Congress for interfering in a Special Counsel's work, incentivizing the Attorney General to refrain from interfering unnecessarily. To read Section 600.7 to give the Attorney General no ability to countermand a Special Counsel, through the implied threat of removal for taking an action the Attorney General disapproves, would mean the Attorney General's sole recourse when a Special Counsel pursues a disapproved action would be to notify Congress, but not until the Special Counsel's investigation has ended. By that time, however, a Special Counsel will be out of office, and thus largely unaccountable to Congress for actions he took despite the Attorney General's objections. A Special Counsel, knowing Congress will not learn of his defiance until he already has left office, thus would have little incentive to heed the Attorney General's advice not to pursue an action. The witness's interpretation of Section 600.7(b) thus would misalign (1) the authority to decide whether to proceed with an action and (2) accountability to Congress for the decision made, training the focus of Congress's oversight on an officer who no longer holds office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   A comparison of the regulations at issue to those that governed the Watergate Special Prosecutor and to the statutory provisions that governed the Independent Counsel reinforces that the Attorney General may countermand a Special Counsel through the threat of removal. The Watergate Special Prosecutor regulations, while in many other respects similar to the instant regulations, contained several provisions wholly missing in the instant regulations, including that (1) \"the Special Prosecutor will have the greatest degree of independence that is consistent with the Attorney General's statutory accountability for all matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice,\" (2) \"[t]he Attorney General will not countermand or interfere with the Special Prosecutor's decisions or actions,\" and (3) \"the Special Prosecutor will not be removed from his duties except for extraordinary improprieties on his part and without the President's first consulting the Majority and the Minority Leaders and Chairmen and ranking Minority Members of the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and ascertaining that their consensus is in accord with his proposed action.\" Establishing the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C738\">\n    38 Fed.

Likewise, the EIGA's Independent Counsel provisions required \"the Attorney General, and all other officers and employees of the Department of Justice [to] suspend all investigations and proceedings regarding\" matters the Independent Counsel was investigating, except as necessary to assist the Independent Counsel.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20597\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (expired). The Special Counsel regulations contain no language of this sort. Neither the Watergate Special Prosecutor regulations nor the EIGA's Independent Counsel provisions, moreover, allowed the Attorney General to \"conclude that [an] action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued,\" or to remove for \"violation of Departmental policies.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.7\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), (d).

For these reasons, Section 600.7(b) properly is read to allow the Attorney General to countermand, through an implicit threat of removal or else through actual removal, a Special Counsel's actions.

At most, the witness could argue that the Special Counsel has made policy without authorization. This argument would fail, however, as it mistakenly conflates setting policy with merely raising a new legal theory. The witness also asserts, as to the Special Counsel's indictment of Russians alleged to have interfered with the 2016 presidential election, that the Special Counsel \"has also ignored Department of\n   Justice guidance requiring willfulness for a charge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   of conspiracy to violate election laws based on alleged interference with the FEC.\" Concord Mem. at 37.

The witness's assertion that the Special Counsel's duties are greater than those of U.S. Attorneys rests on the claim that the Special Counsel (1) \"has nationwide jurisdiction\" and (2) \"can seek indictments of foreign citizens and corporations,\" which \"can have a major effect on U.S. foreign policy.\" Witness's Mot. at 15.

Witness's Mot. at 14. Adopting the witness's proposed test would make no difference here, as the degree of power the Special Counsel enjoys is entirely consistent with inferior officer status, for the reasons explained above. The witness's proposed test should not be adopted, however, as that test runs contrary to binding precedent, is historically unsound, and supplies no determinate, judicially-manageable rule of decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   As an initial matter, binding Supreme Court precedent squarely forecloses the witness's argument.\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   stated unequivocally that \" 'inferior officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652680\" index=\"386\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/651/#p660\">\n    520 U.S. at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652680\" index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/651/#p660\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Seizing upon the phrase \"Generally speaking,\" the witness argues that an officer who wields sufficiently great power might be a principal officer despite having a superior. Witness's Reply at 23-24. However,\n   <em>\n    PCAOB\n   </em>\n   later omitted the term \"Generally speaking\" altogether in characterizing\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   to have \"held\" that \"whether one is an 'inferior' officer depends on whether he has a superior.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    561 U.S. at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations omitted). Thus, even if\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   suggested possible exceptions to the \"direction and supervision\" test,\n   <em>\n    PCAOB\n   </em>\n   clarified otherwise. The witness notes that Justice Souter's\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   concurrence asserted that \"[i]t does not follow, [ ] that if one is subject to some supervision and control, one is an inferior officer,\" and that \"[h]aving a superior officer is necessary for inferior officer status, but not sufficient to establish it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652680\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/651/#p660\">\n    520 U.S. at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652680\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/651/#p660\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).

The witness raises several historical arguments, but none have merit. First, the witness notes that when the Excepting Clause was proposed at the Constitutional Convention, James Madison objected that \"[i]t does not go far enough if it be necessary at all-\n   <em>\n    Superior Officers below Heads of Departments\n   </em>\n   ought in some cases to have the appointment of the lesser offices.\" 2 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787, at 627 (Max Farrand ed., rev. ed. 1966) (\" RECORDS \") (emphasis added).

The witness's logic rests on the assumption that \"Superior Officers\" and inferior officers are mutually exclusive groups, such that a superior officer necessarily is not an inferior officer and vice versa.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/#p728\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (describing Madison's reference to \"Superior Officers\" as an \"apparent contrast to the 'inferior officers' covered by the provision\").

For example, suppose Ms. A directs and supervises Ms. B, who directs and supervises Mr. C.

For any chain of command, everyone but the person at the very top and the person at the very bottom can be both superior and inferior, with only the person at the very top being a solely superior officer (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a principal officer) and only the person at the very bottom being a solely inferior officer. Madison's words thus provide no basis to conclude that the degree of power an officer wields, rather than where an officer falls in the chain of command, determines principal or inferior office status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Second, the witness argues that during the Founding Era, English and state courts often were labeled \"Supreme\" or \"Inferior\" based on the scope of their geographic or subject-matter jurisdictions, without regard to whether they reviewed or were reviewed by other courts. Witness's\n   Reply at 18 (citing David E. Engdahl,\n   <em>\n    What's in a Name? The Constitutionality of Multiple \"Supreme\" Courts\n   </em>\n   , 66 IND. L.J. 457, 466-72 (1991) ). The Constitution, however, uses the terms \"Supreme\" and \"inferior\" in a hierarchical sense in describing the federal judiciary, \"plainly connot[ing] a relationship of subordination.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"409\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/#p728\">\n    487 U.S. at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/#p728\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scalia, J., dissenting). The Constitution vests \"[t]he judicial power of the United States\" in \"one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,\" with the Supreme Court being primarily a body of \"appellate jurisdiction.\" U.S. CONST. art. III, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, cl. 2. While Congress might create \"exceptions\" to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/#p728\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2, cl. 2, such exceptions are, by definition, exceptional rather than the rule. In Federalist No. 81, Alexander Hamilton described Article III's \"inferior\" courts as \"subordinate tribunals,\" and then as \"subordinate to the Supreme\" Court. THE FEDERALIST NO. 81, at 485 n.*, 486 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). In Federalist No. 82, meanwhile, Hamilton variously referred to the inferior federal courts as \"subordinate courts of the Union,\" \"subordinate courts,\" \"subordinate federal courts,\" \"subordinate federal judicatories,\" and \"subordinate national tribunals.\" THE FEDERALIST NO. 82, at 492, 494-95 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). The witness observes that \"an early draft of Article III at the Constitutional Convention proposed creating 'one\n   <em>\n    or more\n   </em>\n   supreme tribunals.' \" Witness's Reply at 18 (quoting 1 RECORDS ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 21 (emphasis added) ). Putting aside that the Convention rejected this language in favor of \"one Supreme Court,\" U.S. CONST. art. III, \u00a7 1, having multiple \"supreme tribunals\" is no less consistent with hierarchy and subordination than is having multiple \"Heads of Departments,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. Multiple courts each can be \"supreme\" if each has appellate jurisdiction over other \"inferior\" courts and none have appellate jurisdiction over one another.

Section 515(b) thus plainly contemplates that the Attorney General has power to appoint special assistants to the Attorney General and special attorneys, as the term \"retain,\" being commonly used in reference to an attorney's hiring, is synonymous in this context with the term \"appoint.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   That Section 515(b) uses the past participle form \"specially retained\" rather than active voice phrasing, such as \"may specially retain,\" does not limit the statute's application to attorneys who already have been retained under a separate statute, as the witness argues,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Witness Reply at 4. \"Past participles ... are routinely used as adjectives to describe the present state of a thing.\"\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1722.

The Attorney General could appoint attorneys \"to assist the district-attorneys in the discharge of their duties,\" DA Act \u00a7 2, but not to assist himself. The DOJ Act greatly expanded the Attorney General's power to direct the government's law enforcement and litigation responsibilities, consolidating these responsibilities underneath the Department of Justice's umbrella and placing the Attorney General at the Department's head.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DOJ Act. The Act created the position of Solicitor General, transferred various law officers from other departments into the Department of Justice, assigned the Department law-related responsibilities other departments previously had exercised, authorized the Department to conduct all litigation in which the government is interested in any federal court, and charged the Department with providing legal advice and counsel to all the other departments, which were prohibited from themselves employing attorneys at the government's expense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2-7, 14, 17. The Act also gave the Attorney General broad powers to manage the Department and to supervise the Department's officers and employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 4-6, 8, 11, 14. Section 17, using language that remains in Section 515(b) almost unchanged, contemplated that the Attorney General would \"specially retain[ ]\" attorneys \"under the authority of the Department of Justice, to assist in the trial of any case in which the government is interested\" and \"commission\" those attorneys as \"special assistant[s] to the Attorney-General.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 17. In this context, Section 17 most naturally is read as a source of authority to appoint attorneys to serve under the Attorney General's immediate control. Indeed, no other statute then in existence authorized the Attorney General to appoint his own assistants. Failing to read Section 17 to provide such authority thus would render the statute superfluous and yield nonsensical results, allowing the Attorney General to \"commission\" attorneys the Department had \"specially retained,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but denying the Attorney General any\n   authority to appoint those attorneys in the first place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Post-DOJ Act statutory history further confirms that Section 515(b) authorizes the Attorney General to appoint attorneys under his immediate control.

II, \u00a7 4. To be sure, whether the term \"all civil Officers,\" as used in Section 4 of Article II, and \"Officers,\" as used in Sections 2 and 3, are coextensive is an unsettled question. Joseph Story, writing in\n    <em>\n     Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States\n    </em>\n    , believed that \"all civil Officers\" include \"[a]ll officers of the United States ... who hold their appointments under the national government, ... in the highest or in the lowest departments of the government, with the exception of officers in the army and navy.\" 1 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the constitution of the United States \u00a7 792, at 558 (Thomas M. Cooley ed., 4th ed. 1873) (1827). Likewise, early American lawyer William Rawle asserted that those subject to impeachment include \"[a]ll executive ... officers, from the president downwards.\" William Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America 213 (2d ed. 1829) (1825). The view that impeachment extended to all officers of the United States was not unanimous, however. At the North Carolina Ratification Convention, for example, Archibald Maclaine asserted that \"impeachments cannot extend to inferior officers of the United States,\" describing the notion \"that every officer, however trifling his office, is to be impeached for every petty offense\" as \"the most horrid ignorance.\" 4 Jonathan Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 43-44 (2d ed. 1836) (1827). How widely Maclaine's view was shared, however, is unclear, and beside which, Story and Rawle's understanding better accords with Section 4's plain text.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-262\">\n    To be sure, the \"significant authority\" prong of the officer-employee test is itself \"framed in general terms.\"\n    <em>\n     Lucia\n    </em>\n    , 138 S.Ct. at 2051.

II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. The witness's proposed principal-inferior officer test would generate confusion as to whom the Opinion Clause covers, although such confusion would be less problematic than that which would arise in the Twenty-Fifth Amendment context, as the President could always obtain an inferior officer's opinion by directing the relevant principal officer to procure an opinion from her subordinate, or else by directing the relevant principal officer to direct her subordinate to procure the opinion from the subordinate's subordinate, however far down the chain of command is necessary.
