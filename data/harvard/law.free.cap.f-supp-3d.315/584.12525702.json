Mr. Jordan filed a \"Motion to Disqualify Judge Contreras\" (ECF No. 9), arguing that this judge should be disqualified for holding purported bias or prejudice toward Mr. Jordan. The DOJ filed a \"Motion for Extension of Time to Answer or Otherwise Respond to Complaint\" (ECF No. 6) to extend its deadline to respond to Mr. Jordan's complaint. The DOJ also filed a \"Motion for Protective Order\" (ECF No. 14) to bar discovery in this action. For the following reasons, this Court denies Mr. Jordan's motion to disqualify, grants the DOJ's motion for an extension of time to answer or otherwise respond to the complaint, and denies without prejudice the DOJ's motion for a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Motion to Disqualify\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Jordan requests that this judge recuse himself from the present case on grounds such as bias, partiality, threatening behavior, and criminal conduct.
