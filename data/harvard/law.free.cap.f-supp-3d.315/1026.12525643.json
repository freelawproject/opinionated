Shah, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs Armando Serrano and Jose Montanez each spent over two decades in prison for a murder they did not commit. Now, they both bring suit against the City of Chicago-and former police officers Reynaldo Guevara, Ernest Halvorsen, and Edward Mingey-as well as Cook County-and former prosecutors Matthew Coghlan and John Dillion. Their suits include claims for constitutional violations and torts they allege were committed during the investigation and prosecution of the case against them. The City and County defendants now move to dismiss portions of the complaints for the failure to state a claim.

Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Armando Serrano and Jose Montanez were wrongly convicted for the murder of Rodrigo Vargas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1993, Vargas was shot to death in a van outside his\n   home. Vargas's wife, Wilda, had no idea why anyone would kill her husband. One of Vargas's neighbors heard the gunshots, but she did not see anything. Another neighbor reported seeing an older, light-brown sedan, possibly with two doors, drive away. For four months, the police had no leads and the murder went unsolved. Then Detectives Guevara and Halvorsen took over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wilda Vargas told the detectives about a trip that she and her husband took to the gas station the night before he was murdered. Wilda said that her husband had just gone to the bank, so he had a roll of cash on him when he went inside to pay. Cash was found on Vargas's dead body the next day. Wilda also remembered that her husband honked at three Latino men in a tan-colored car that blocked his way at the gas station. With this information, the detectives invented a theory in which Vargas's murder was an armed robbery gone wrong, and they decided to frame three Latino men with histories of armed robberies to close the case. They settled on Serrano, Montanez, and Jorge Pacheco. The detectives showed Wilda photos of the three men, telling her that they were the Latino men she remembered from the tan car. The detectives drove Wilda to Montanez's house to show her his car (which she agreed was similar to the tan one she saw), and the detectives told her lies about the car being linked to her husband's shooting by ballistics evidence and witness statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Then the detectives decided to use a resource they had recently stumbled across-Francisco Vicente. Vicente was a heroin addict who was arrested and charged with several armed robberies, suffering in jail from the effects of heroin withdrawal and facing up to 97 or 100 years in prison for his pending charges. The detectives told two prosecutors-Assistant State's Attorneys Coghlan and Dillion-that \"the street\" was saying plaintiffs and Pacheco were responsible for the Vargas murder, but they needed more evidence to bring them in. So the detectives proposed that they use Vicente to drum up evidence against plaintiffs and Pacheco in addition to suspects in two other murders. The prosecutors agreed and arranged to transport Vicente to their offices. By the time Vicente met with the prosecutors and detectives to discuss the Vargas murder, the detectives had already used violence (including hitting him with a phonebook) to coerce Vicente into giving false testimony against a suspect in a different murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With the prosecutors and Halvorsen present, Guevara handed Vicente crime scene photos and fed him a narrative in which Vicente would say he was an eyewitness to plaintiffs' attempted robbery of Vargas. Everyone in the room knew that narrative was false. Vicente refused to say he was an eyewitness or that the suspects gave him the murder weapon, so Halvorsen suggested that Vicente say Montanez confessed to him and implicated Serrano and Pacheco along the way. The prosecutors promised Vicente they would protect him by getting him moved to special witness quarters at the jail and secure him a lower sentence. Vicente agreed to give the false testimony. After the meeting, the detectives prepared a supplemental police report stating that a confidential informant told them that Montanez confessed to his involvement in the Vargas murder and that Montanez had also implicated Serrano and Pacheco. The detectives used the false\n   report as a basis to arrest Serrano. But after about 24 hours of physical and psychological abuse, Serrano refused to make an inculpatory statement and was released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   So the detectives turned to Timothy Rankins, a 19-year-old facing charges for robbery. Rankins had experience serving as an informant for the detectives' supervisor, Sergeant Edward Mingey. The officers (Mingey, Guevara, and Halvorsen) knew that Rankins did not know anything about the Vargas murder, but they told Rankins that they wanted him to say he was an eyewitness. When Rankins initially refused, Guevara beat him, including by putting a phonebook against his head and striking it. Guevara showed Rankins photos of plaintiffs and Pacheco while feeding him the narrative he wanted Rankins to give. After more abuse, Rankins agreed to say that he saw plaintiffs and Pacheco shoot and kill Vargas and signed a statement saying so. Now armed with (faulty) probable cause, the detectives immediately arrested Serrano and, sometime later, Montanez and Pacheco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Not long after the officers met with Rankins, the prosecutors brought Vicente back to their offices to sign his false witness statement. The statement, written by Halvorsen, said that Vicente was hanging out on a street corner when plaintiffs and Pacheco drove up in a tan car. The statement went on to say that Montanez told Vicente that he, Serrano, and Pacheco saw a Mexican man at a gas station with a wad of cash, attempted to rob him, and then shot him. Vicente signed the statement in the presence of a different prosecutor (one who was not present for the previous discussions with Vicente).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A grand jury was convened. Both Rankins and Vicente testified consistent with their written statements, and the grand jury returned an indictment against plaintiffs and Pacheco. Nine months later, Rankins recanted his testimony and fled Chicago. Vicente was transferred to the special witness quarters he was promised and received other benefits, like cash, drugs, and conjugal visits. Vicente continued to be shuttled to the prosecutors' offices to be coached by the prosecutors on his testimony for the three murder prosecutions he was a witness in, including plaintiffs' prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   About two years later, in 1995, plaintiffs were convicted in a bench trial. Their co-defendant, Pacheco, was acquitted. Guevara and Halvorsen testified for the prosecution, and so did Vicente, who largely kept to his written statement and grand jury testimony. The prosecutors, who had helped form Vicente's false testimony, knew it was a lie. Before trial, the prosecutors had helped get Vicente additional pre-trial custody credit to reduce his sentence, a fact that was not disclosed to plaintiffs' lawyers. Wilda could not credibly testify that plaintiffs were the men in the tan car at the gas station, so her identification testimony was rejected. Plaintiffs were each sentenced to 55 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At post-conviction evidentiary hearings over a decade later, plaintiffs presented an affidavit from Vicente, admitting that his entire testimony was false. Although relief was initially denied, the Illinois Appellate Court reversed those decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state moved to vacate plaintiffs' convictions and dismiss the murder charges. In 2016, plaintiffs were released from the Illinois Department of Corrections. Both were issued certificates of innocence. Before plaintiffs' exoneration, the City also commissioned an independent investigation into plaintiffs' case (and others), which concluded that plaintiffs were more likely innocent than not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Although dismissal on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion on qualified immunity grounds is often premature, qualified immunity issues should be resolved as soon as possible, which is sometimes at the pleadings stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Evidence Fabrication\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the prosecutors, along with Officers Guevara and Halvorsen, fabricated evidence by coercing Vicente to falsely implicate plaintiffs in the Vargas murder. The County argues that the prosecutors are protected by absolute immunity because their interview of Vicente was within the scope of their prosecutorial responsibilities. The County is right that interviewing witnesses to decide whether charges should be filed can be protected by absolute immunity under some circumstances,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bianchi v. McQueen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304609\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/917/822/#p832\">\n    917 F.Supp.2d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (N.D. Ill. 2013), but not where the prosecutors act before there is any probable cause to arrest anyone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckley III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p273\">\n    509 U.S. at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p273\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A prosecutor neither is, nor should consider himself to be, an advocate before he has probable cause to have anyone arrested.\"). The complaints allege that the prosecutors met with Vicente (and the defendant officers) before any evidence pointed to plaintiffs as suspects, and plaintiffs were not charged until after the initial Vicente interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As plaintiffs put it, prior to the interview \"not a shred of evidence suggested that Plaintiffs\n   were involved in the murder of Vargas.\" [71] at 8. The County apparently does not contest this conclusion, because it does not point to any facts suggesting that probable cause did exist at the time of the first Vicente interview. \"There is a difference between the advocate's role in evaluating evidence and interviewing witnesses as he prepares for trial, on the one hand, and the detective's role in searching for the clues and corroboration that might give him probable cause to recommend that a suspect be arrested, on the other hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Buckley III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p273\">\n    509 U.S. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p273\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the prosecutors were in the latter role, so the prosecutors are not entitled to absolute immunity on the fabrication claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The County also argues that \"no evidence was actually procured at this alleged meeting that resulted in an arrest for a charge for murder\" and that by the time Vicente signed his sworn statement, Rankins had provided the authorities with independent probable cause. [60] at 17. I take the County's point to be that the evidence used to prosecute plaintiffs came after probable cause and after the prosecutors' immunity attached. But Vicente's testimony was the evidence that convicted plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S. Compl. \u00b6 64; M. Compl. \u00b6 1, and that testimony derived from the fabricated evidence that the prosecutors obtained as investigators. They are not absolutely immune from the deprivation of liberty caused by that fabricated evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avery v. City of Milwaukee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186548\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/433/#p441\">\n    847 F.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441-42 (7th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Nor does qualified immunity protect the prosecutors from the evidence fabrication claims. The County asserts that the complaints only allege that the prosecutors \"promised to protect Vicente and give him special privileges in exchange for his testimony,\" which the County says constitutes coercion, not fabrication. [60] at 19. But this characterization ignores the context of the prosecutors' conduct. Plaintiffs allege that the prosecutors were sitting in a room with Detectives Guevara and Halvorsen as they proposed multiple false narratives to Vicente until one stuck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-43; S. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-42. So the prosecutors did not just offer Vicente protection and rewards to coerce him to testify-they offered those things to coerce him to testify to what they knew were falsehoods. That conduct is not just coercion; it is also fabrication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fields II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826229\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/1107/#p1110\">\n    740 F.3d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Coerced testimony is testimony that a witness is forced by improper means to give; the testimony may be true or false.

Failure to Intervene\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The County also invokes qualified immunity to shield the prosecutors from plaintiffs' failure to intervene claims. I agree with plaintiffs that \"a prosecutor acting as an investigator can be held liable for failing to intervene.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   , No. 15 CV 3859,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205445012\">\n    2015 WL 5445012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2015). But again, the qualified immunity analysis focuses on the defendant's conduct, not the remedies available for the conduct. Whatever the state of the law now, it was not clearly established in 1993 that prosecutors acting as investigators had a duty to intervene when their fellow officers committed constitutional wrongs. Plaintiffs argue that the alleged due process violations-evidence fabrication and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations-were clearly established at the time. True as that may be, \"a defendant cannot be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right's contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant's shoes would have understood that he was violating it.\"\n   <em>\n    Plumhoff v.

So the issue is not just whether the plaintiffs' rights were clearly established, but also whether any reasonable official standing in the prosecutors' shoes in 1993 would have known that their actions-or inaction, as it were-would violate plaintiffs' rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 1993,\n   <em>\n    Byrd v. Brishke\n   </em>\n   , which stated that \"one who is given the badge of authority\n   of a police officer may not ignore the duty imposed by his office and fail to stop other officers[']\" wrongdoing, had been on the books for twenty years.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"719496\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/466/6/#p11\">\n    466 F.2d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (7th Cir. 1972). The reference to police officers is clear, but it is not clear that prosecutors acting as investigators would also be subject to the duty. Plaintiffs, and the cases they cite, make a good argument for why prosecutors should have such a duty, but they have not pointed to any pre-1993 cases to show that prosecutors had that duty in 1993. Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   to argue that prosecutors who act as investigators are subject to the same standards as officers, but\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   was not decided until 2012, so it had no impact on the notice available to prosecutors in 1993.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890847\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/567/#p581\">\n    682 F.3d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The County's motion to dismiss the failure to intervene claims against the prosecutors is granted.

It is true that a prosecutor who is absolutely immune from liability because her conduct was within the scope of her prosecutorial duties does not lose that absolute immunity when engaged in an alleged conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    French v.

But here, the prosecutors' alleged misconduct includes acts taken outside the scope of their prosecutorial duties. Just as inclusion in a conspiracy does not strip a prosecutor of immunity, nor does it automatically confer immunity. The conspiracy claims against the prosecutors survive to the extent they are based on conduct not subject to immunity, like investigative evidence fabrication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The County's motion to dismiss the conspiracy claims against the prosecutors is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    6.

Evidence fabrication only violates due process if it results in a deprivation of liberty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bianchi\n   </em>\n   , 818 F.3d at 319.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The deprivation of liberty in evidence fabrication claims is often post-conviction incarceration resulting from the use of fabricated evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , 786 F.3d at 551. The City argues that since Rankins never testified at trial, any alleged fabrication of his statement cannot violate due process. Plaintiffs respond that although Rankins himself did not testify at trial, Rankins's statement was introduced through Halvorsen's trial testimony. Plaintiffs attached a transcript of Halvorsen's trial testimony to their response brief, which includes testimony that Rankins made a statement saying he was an eyewitness to the Vargas murder. [72] at 43-46. Even if I take judicial notice of the transcript, the transcript shows that Halvorsen's testimony about Rankins was not admitted substantively. The trial judge repeatedly clarified that testimony about what Rankins said was only admitted \"to show course of conduct, of investigation.\" [72] at 43.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   [72] at 45-46 (\"If the witness is going to say that Timothy Rankins said A, B and C, he did the crime, I saw it, that's hearsay it doesn't come in.

I agree. Plaintiffs \"seek[ ] to charge the officers with a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation for keeping quiet about their wrongdoing, not for failing to disclose any existing piece of evidence to the prosecution,\" but Seventh Circuit case law \"makes clear that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   does not require the creation of exculpatory evidence, nor does it compel police officers to accurately disclose the circumstances of their investigations to the prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Saunders-El v.

Plaintiffs point to\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Burge\n   </em>\n   , in which the plaintiff based his\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation claim against officers not on the failure to disclose their unlawful interrogation tactics, but rather their suppression of \"implements of their torture\" (bloody clothes, nightstick, and plastic bag) and evidence of systemic torture.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271001\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/669/\">\n    222 F.Supp.3d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 681. The\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   plaintiff also alleged that defendants obstructed investigations into the systemic torture and discredited the findings of the investigations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271001\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/669/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Montanez\n   </em>\n   complaint does include allegations that defendants suppressed evidence that \"a jailhouse witness\" was coerced and that defendants \"intentionally secret[ed] discoverable reports, memos and other information.\" M. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82, 84. But these general allegations are not specific to Rankins, the focus of the City's motion to dismiss on these claims. And anyway, those allegations are too general for me to determine materiality-who is the \"jailhouse witness\" and what did the concealed documents say?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs also ask me to make a \"fair inference\" that Mingey suppressed the \"bloody phonebook\" with which he allegedly beat Rankins. The\n   <em>\n    Montanez\n   </em>\n   complaint does allege that defendants \"put a phone book against Rankins's head and struck the phone book,\" but it does not say anything about hiding or suppressing the phone book (nor does the complaint describe the phonebook as \"bloody,\" instead indicating that the type of abuse did not leave physical marks). M. Compl. \u00b6 64. The Serrano complaint does not even mention a phonebook. To find that the complaint alleges suppression of the phonebook would not be a \"fair inference\"-it would be reading in an absent allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because I find that plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation claims are impermissible recasts of the evidence fabrication claims and do not allege the suppression of then-existing exculpatory evidence, I need not address the City's other arguments. But for the sake of completeness, I am not persuaded by the City's argument that evidence regarding the abuse or coercion of Rankins was not\n   material. Even though Rankins did not testify at trial, it is plausible that evidence that the officers used coercive tactics when conducting their investigation could give rise to a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different. Surely, it could have impacted the credibility of the officers and the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kyles v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs seeking to recover damages for an \"allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\" must prove that the conviction or sentence was invalidated or overturned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So their prolonged detention claims must be dismissed\n   against the officers too. But if plaintiffs amend their complaints to adequately state prolonged detention claims, the claims would not be time-barred. When Fourth Amendment prolonged detention claims begin to accrue is a question currently before the Seventh Circuit on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/#p920\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without the benefit of that decision, I continue to reason that \"since there can be no \u00a7 1983 claim that depends on questioning the validity of detention authorized by legal process until that detention is terminated in the accused's favor, it makes sense to hold that a Fourth Amendment claim of this sort does not accrue until favorable termination.\"\n   <em>\n    Bolden\n   </em>\n   , 293 F.Supp.3d at 782 (citing\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

Plaintiffs' IIED claims are alleged generally and, in the context of the complaints, appear to be based on their wrongful convictions. The IIED claims are subject to a one-year statute of limitations, 745 ILCS 10/8-101(a), and both complaints were filed within one year of the date the convictions were overturned. However, the City correctly points out that if the IIED claims are based on conduct related to Rankins, accrual does not wait for the convictions to be overturned. That is because no substantive evidence related to Rankins was used against plaintiffs at trial or used to convict plaintiffs. So\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   would not have barred plaintiffs from bringing their IIED claims based on the defendants' Rankins conduct back in 1993, and that is when the clock began to run. To the extent the IIED claims are based on Rankins-related conduct, they are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The City's motion to dismiss the prolonged detention claims against the officers is granted.

Here, the chain of causation is broken by the alleged knowing involvement of the prosecutors in the officers' misconduct. The complaints do not contain any allegations that the officers pressured or influenced the prosecutors to prosecute plaintiffs-rather, the allegations are that the prosecutors knowingly and actively participated in the misconduct. Because plaintiffs did not adequately plead causation, their malicious prosecution claims against the officers are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The City also moves to dismiss the federal conspiracy and failure to intervene claims because they are derivative claims that must be dismissed if the underlying federal claims are dismissed. Although the federal claims based on Rankins-related\n   conduct have been dismissed, federal claims remain on the non-Rankins conduct that the City has not moved to dismiss (for example, Vicente-related conduct). Since those claims survive, so do the derivative conspiracy and failure to intervene claims. Similarly, the City argues that the state civil conspiracy, respondeat superior, and indemnification claims must be dismissed if the other state-law claims are dismissed, but the IIED claims survive in part, so the other state-law claims survive too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The City's motion to dismiss the malicious prosecution claims against the officers is granted.

From the City's perspective, Mingey is only alleged to have been involved in conduct related to Rankins. But plaintiffs say that Mingey, a supervisor of the other defendant officers, is alleged to be involved in much more than that, including fabricating evidence from Vicente and Wilda Vargas; suppressing evidence of systemic abuse; and \"aiding, facilitating, and failing to intervene during the constitutional violations of the others.\" [72] at 25. The citations to the complaints provided by plaintiffs in support of their assertion are not convincing. Many of the citations are to allegations about the other (specifically named) defendants. Others are to generic references to \"defendants\" in the\n    <em>\n     Montanez\n    </em>\n    complaint that, when compared to the\n    <em>\n     Serrano\n    </em>\n    complaint's allegations on the same topic, actually do not appear to include Mingey.\n    <em>\n     Compare, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    M. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-31,\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    S. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-30. The fact that Mingey was the other officers' supervisor does not automatically implicate him in their constitutional violations, absent adequately pleaded personal involvement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Doyle v. Camelot Care Centers, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11389590\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/603/#p614\">\n     305 F.3d 603\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 614-15 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"[U]nder \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff may not rely on the doctrine of respondeat superior to hold supervisory officials liable for the misconduct of their subordinates. Rather, the supervisory officials also must have had some personal involvement in the constitutional deprivation, essentially directing or consenting to the challenged conduct.\"). But the complaints do not allege that Mingey directed or consented to the non-Rankins challenged conduct. The closest they come is the conclusory statement that Mingey \"facilitated, condoned and approved the constitutional violations.\" S. Compl. \u00b6 17; M. Compl. \u00b6 18. So I agree with the City that the complaints implicate Mingey primarily in Rankins-related conduct. But this does not excuse Mingey from all claims not specific to Rankins. For example, if plaintiffs' prolonged detention claims are amended to adequately state a claim, Mingey may be implicated. Mingey would then also be implicated in the derivative claims based on the prolonged detention-the conspiracy and failure to intervene claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
