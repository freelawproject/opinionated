This Court ordered the Government to respond to Mr. Jones' Motion by December 6, 2017. Apparently disinclined to do so, the Government did not file a response. Undeterred, Mr. Jones filed a Reply to Defendants Failure to Respond to Judge Collyer's\n   11/8/2017 Minute Order on December 20, 2017 (Def.'s Reply), which the Court will construe as a reply in support of Mr. Jones' Motion for Reconsideration.

LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Jones filed a Motion to Reopen Based on Change in Law, or in the Alternative, Based on Oversight, which is terminology unknown to this Court.

However, the Rules provide three pathways for those seeking reconsideration of judicial decisions. Rule 54(b) permits reconsideration of interlocutory judgments. Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Rule 59(e) permits a party to seek reconsideration of a final judgment within 28 days of that judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). Rule 60 permits a party to seek reconsideration of a final judgment either (a) to correct a mistake arising from an oversight or omission or (b) to seek relief from a judgment or order due to: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence; (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct; (4) void judgment; (5) satisfied, released, or discharged judgment; or (6) \"any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\" Fed.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Jones moves this Court to reconsider its order granting Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative for Summary Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/1/15 Order [Dkt. 34]. Because that order adjudicated all of Mr. Jones' claims in this case, he is foreclosed from relief under Rule 54(b), which permits reconsideration and revision of orders or decisions adjudicating fewer than all the claims at issue in a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Having filed his motion for reconsideration more than 28 days after the entry of the dismissal order, the relief Mr. Jones seeks is also prohibited by Rule 59(e) and must be considered solely under Rule 60.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), 60.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillian v.

Nor does he argue that this Court's judgment is void, has been satisfied, released, discharged, or was based on an earlier judgment that was reversed or vacated. Instead, Mr. Jones bases his motion on \"change in law\" or \"oversight.\" Mr. Jones does not move under an established rule, but his motion suggests arguments similar to those often raised under Rule 60(b)(6), which permits reconsideration for \"other\" reasons. The Court therefore will assess his motion for reconsideration under that Rule, in keeping with the well-recognized principle that\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants are \"allowed more latitude than litigants represented by counsel,\" which includes applying less stringent standards to\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Change in Controlling Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Jones argues that the four cases cited in his motion and accompanying reply necessitate reconsideration of this Court's prior dismissal of the case without prejudice. The Court interprets this as an argument for reconsideration under Rule 60(b)(6) based on a change in controlling law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637568,3691597\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/1205/\">\n    76 F.3d at 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In that case, the Federal Circuit treated an appellant's prematurely filed notice of appeal from a non-final Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) decision as \"effectively stayed until the underlying agency order bec[ame] final.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055776\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/1361/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055776\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/1361/\">\n    at 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the D.C. Circuit, which issues decisions binding on this Court, has limited its interpretation of \"judicially reviewable action\" to an action that is subject to judicial review as of the time the plaintiff files suit.\n   <em>\n    Butler v.
