INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In January 2017, Dan and Liz Sokolov filed an administrative due process complaint against Mundo Verde Public Charter School and the District of Columbia Office of the State Superintendent of Education, alleging, among other things, that their minor child, A.S., had been denied a free and appropriate public education (\"FAPE\") in violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   After an administrative hearing, the Hearing Officer ruled in the Sokolovs' favor and ordered Mundo Verde to reimburse the Sokolovs for costs associated with A.S.'s enrollment in a private school for the 2016-2017 school year. Mundo Verde filed this lawsuit under the IDEA to appeal the Hearing Officer's adverse decision. And, because the Hearing Officer found Mundo Verde solely responsible for the FAPE denial, Mundo Verde named not only the Sokolovs but also the District of Columbia Office of the State Superintendent of Education as defendants in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After Mundo Verde filed its Complaint, however, the District of Columbia reimbursed the Sokolovs for all costs, including tuition, for the 2016-2017 school year, and continued to fund A.S.'s private-school placement during the 2017-2018 school year. Defendants now move to dismiss the Complaint or, in the alternative, for entry of summary judgment, primarily on the ground that the case is now moot. The court agrees that, as a result of the District's payment of A.S.'s tuition, this matter no longer presents a live case or controversy. Accordingly, the court grants Defendants' Motions to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

According to the Hearing Officer, it was Mundo Verde's responsibility to maintain A.S.'s enrollment \"rather than obtain[ ] his withdrawal as it did,\" and any lapses by OSSE during the withdrawal process \"were not the direct or proximate cause of [A.S.] ... no longer appearing in the [school database] to permit the IEP and Change in Placement meetings to proceed.\" HOD at 18.

On August 21, 2017, the day before initiating this action, Mundo Verde issued a \"Prior Written Notice\" to the Sokolovs proposing to continue placement of A.S. at the Lab School for the 2017-2018 school year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Points &amp; Authorities in Opp'n to Defs.'

Finally, the District of Columbia separately asserts that OSSE must be dismissed as a defendant because it is\n   <em>\n    non sui juris\n   </em>\n   , that is, it does not have the capacity to be sued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.C.

The issue in this case-the denial of a FAPE-is inherently fact-dependent, particularly where, as here, the denial is based on the inappropriateness of a student's IEP and school placement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. ex rel.

In other words, Plaintiff may be asked to defend its capacity to provide a FAPE to some student in future administrative proceedings, but the court cannot say that there is a reasonable expectation that Plaintiff will be aggrieved by a similar application of the IDEA in such proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For its part, Plaintiff relies on two cases,\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , but they do not dictate a different result.

Plaintiff frames the second issue broadly as \"whether Mundo Verde is responsible for tuition reimbursement for a unilateral private placement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 6. If by framing the question in that way, Plaintiff means to suggest that it may be held liable for a unilateral private placement in similar circumstances in the future, then the question posed is too fact-bound and therefore unlikely to be duplicated in the future. As the HOD makes clear, the Hearing Officer found Mundo Verde solely responsible to the Sokolovs based on the particular facts of the case, not on a generally applicable legal principle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HOD at 18 (finding that the \"lapses by OSSE were not the direct or proximate cause of [A.S.] being withdrawn from [Mundo Verde]\" and thus were insufficient \"to hold OSSE directly liable to [the Sokolovs] for denial of a FAPE\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On the other hand, if what Mundo Verde means to say is that the HOD establishes, as a matter of law, that it will be held responsible for the costs of a unilateral private placement in\n   <em>\n    all future similar cases\n   </em>\n   , then Mundo Verde misreads the HOD. Although Mundo Verde argued at the hearing that \"tuition payments for a nonpublic school are not the responsibility of the [local education agency] Charter and thus reimbursement can only be required from OSSE,\" the Hearing Officer expressly found \"the funding mechanisms and relationship between [a state and local education agency] to be well beyond the scope of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436802,9034998\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/416/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 18 n.116. Stated differently, the Hearing Officer did not address the pure legal question of whether OSSE can\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   be liable, whether directly or vicariously, for the costs of a unilateral private placement. The decision to hold Mundo Verde solely responsible rested on the facts of the case; an abstract legal question that the Hearing Officer did not reach therefore cannot sustain this action as a live case or controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Collateral consequences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Having concluded that the issues raised in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint are not \"capable of repetition, yet evading review,\" the court turns to the \"collateral consequences\" exception to the mootness doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 3.

For example, Plaintiff notes that as the state education agency, OSSE is required by regulation to \"monitor the implementation of the IDEA Part B, make annual determinations about the performance of each [local education agency ('LEA') ], enforce compliance with IDEA Part B, and report annually on the performance of ... each LEA.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 6-7 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.600\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Pl.'s Opp'n at 7 (citing Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 4, DC Public Charter School Board Monitoring &amp; Compliance Policy, ECF No. 12-4).

On the one hand, Plaintiff took no voluntary action to moot its appeal.

It is the District, not the Sokolovs, whose actions have largely mooted Plaintiff's appeal, and yet it is the Sokolovs who could\n   potentially stand to lose if the court grants Plaintiff's request to vacate the HOD. Because the result of vacatur is that \"the slate is wiped clean,\" leaving the parties \"in the same position they were in before the [HOD] was issued,\"\n   <em>\n    Mars I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206134116\">\n    2015 WL 6134116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7, vacatur could, in theory, impact the Sokolovs' right under the IDEA to seek attorneys' fees and costs incurred during the administrative proceedings below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

In\n   <em>\n    Mars I\n   </em>\n   , a Pennsylvania district court determined that the hearing officer's decision should be vacated based on mootness, but nevertheless allowed the plaintiff to file a motion for attorneys' fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(B)(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206134116\">\n    2015 WL 6134116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8. The court reasoned that if the hearing officer's decision made the plaintiff the \"prevailing party\" in the administrative proceedings prior to the intervening act of mootness, then the plaintiff would continue to be a prevailing party for purposes of attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The same court later affirmed its earlier decision, when ruling on the fees' motion, stating that \"by obtaining an enforceable order against the School District that changed the legal relationship between the parties,\" the plaintiff \"did indeed prevail at the hearing before the intervening act of mootness.\"\n   <em>\n    Mars Area Sch. Dist. v. C.L.

Pa. Dec. 7, 2015). Thus, the court held that the plaintiff was entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs under the IDEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In light of the foregoing case law, the court finds that vacatur almost certainly would not necessarily deprive the Sokolovs of their right to seek attorneys' fees incurred during the administrative due process proceedings below. If the Sokolovs can establish themselves to be \"prevailing parties\"-as they appear to be\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   -vacatur of the HOD based on mootness cannot \"reverse[ ]\" the relief awarded to the Sokolovs in the HOD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

If they were prevailing parties before the District made the tuition payments, they remain so afterwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, the court grants Plaintiff's request to vacate the HOD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court hereby dismisses this case as moot and vacates the Hearing Officer's Determination.

Because the Hearing Officer concluded that (a) OSSE could not have held a change in placement meeting for A.S. because he was no longer enrolled in a local education agency as a result of his withdrawal from Mundo Verde,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    HOD at 19, and (b) OSSE was not directly liable to the Sokolovs for the FAPE denial,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    , the Hearing Officer found in favor of OSSE on this second issue,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Am.

Mot.,\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Parents' Mot. at 1-2 (seeking dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) on mootness grounds as well).
