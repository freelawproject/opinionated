DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiff's Amended Complaint should be dismissed because binding contracts, the CSAs, exist between the parties and therefore (1) Count I, unjust enrichment, is barred as a matter of law; and (2) Count II, breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, is barred because of applicable provisions in the CSAs. Def's Br. at 1-6. Alternatively, Defendants contend that, if the CSAs are not valid, Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim fails because the entire basis of that claim-that customers were charged fees different than those in the CSAs-is based on the CSAs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Under this theory, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs were not bound by any contract, voluntarily paid the fees, and were free to \"walk away at any time without penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Validity of the Contracts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs admit to signing the contracts, but argue these contracts were never binding because Defendants did not sign them. Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss Am. Class Action Compl. (\"Pls.' Br.\") [Doc. 31] at 7-9. Plaintiffs point to Section 24 of the Terms and Conditions, entitled \"Effective Date\" which states: \"This Card Services Agreement shall become effective only upon acceptance by Global Direct, Member, and PAI, or upon delivery of indebtedness at such locations as designated by Global Direct for purchase, whichever event shall first occur.\" Terms and Conditions \u00a7 24. Under the plain language of this section, there are two ways for the contracts to become effective; the Court will examine each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Effective Upon Acceptance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Terms and Conditions state that the CSAs may become effective upon \"acceptance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs state, without citation, that \"the only prescribed method for 'acceptance' is signature.\" Pls.' Br. at 8. They point to (1) the signature blocks on the Merchant Agreements, (2) the clause in the Merchant Agreements stating that \"[t]he Bank must be a principal (signer) to the Merchant Agreement,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) provisions in the Merchant Agreements incorporating card network rules, which explicitly require a bank to sign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to the first contention, the mere fact that a contract contains signature blocks does not mean that signature is required to make the contract effective. \"Georgia law has long recognized that '[a]ssent to the terms of a contract may be given other than by signatures.' \"\n   <em>\n    Weinberg, Wheeler, Hudgins, Gunn &amp; Dial, LLC v.

There appear to be two slightly different versions of the Merchant Agreement. In the Euless Merchant Agreement, the above clause is part of a section entitled \"Important Member Bank (Acquirer) Responsibilities.\" Euless Merchant Agreement at 9. Below that section it states \"[t]he responsibilities above\n   <em>\n    do not replace the terms\n   </em>\n   of the Merchant Agreement and are provided to ensure the Merchant understands some important obligations of each party and that the Bank is the ultimate authority should the Merchant experience any problems.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"70337\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/267/320/70337/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). With respect to Euless it is clear this clause does not in any way modify Section 24 of the Terms and Conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to the Merchant Agreements for KA and Cobra, both agreements state \"[a] Visa Member must be a principal (signer) to the Merchant Agreement.\" Cobra Merchant Agreement at 2, 3, 14, 15; KA Merchant Agreement at 2. This clause appears to be in conflict with Section 24 of the Terms and Conditions, which allows the agreement to become binding without signatures. Under Plaintiffs' reading, the validity of the CSAs entered into by Cobra and KA is conditioned upon the signature requirement of this clause and since the signature was not obtained, the agreements never became binding. But under Georgia law, it must be \"\n   <em>\n    manifest\n   </em>\n   that the contract is to be executed by others than those who actually signed it\" in order for a contract to be considered incomplete and non-binding.\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235099\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/273/409/#p410\">\n    273 Ga.

In other words, the contract must explicitly state that it requires signature by both parties to become effective. Placing this clause separate from Section 24, in a section entitled \"Important Member Bank Responsibilities\" does not make it \"manifest\" that this clause overrides Section 24 as to prevent the contracts from taking effect. In addition, if the clause is analyzed as a condition precedent to the formation of the contracts, the outcome is the same.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Conditions precedent, which are not favored in interpreting contracts, are created by language such as \"on condition that,\" \"if,\" and \"provided,\" or by explicit statements that certain events are to be construed as conditions precedent. In determining whether a contract contains a condition precedent, we look to the language of the agreement itself. If the language is plain and unambiguous and the intent may be clearly gathered therefrom, we need look no further.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235158\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/273/811/#p813\">\n    273 Ga.

There is no language in the clause indicating that the signature is a condition precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to the third contention, that the Member Agreements \"incorporate the card network rules, which explicitly require the banks to sign\" (Pls.' Br. at 8), this argument fails for the same reasons-it is not clear that the CSAs were drafted to make the signature a requirement, nor is it clear from the language of the agreement that it is a condition precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Beginnings Healthcare for Women,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC v. EVO Payments Int'l, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17-cv-950-RWS (N.D. Ga. June 16, 2017) (interpreting similar language). While Plaintiffs may have a cause of action for damages for failure of the VISA Merchant to sign or failure of Defendants to follow the card merchant rules, the failure does not prevent the contracts' formation. Therefore, there is no requirement that the CSAs must be signed to be accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Effective Upon Delivery of Indebtedness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The second way the contracts can become effective is through \"delivery of indebtedness at such locations as designated by Global Direct for purchase....\" Terms and Conditions \u00a7 24. Plaintiffs do not dispute that they delivered indebtedness, but contend that \"there is no proof of where such indebtedness was delivered.\" Pls.' Br. at 9. Under the CSAs, PAI and Global Direct provided imprinters, authorization terminals, printers, software and other equipment to the Merchant. Terms and Conditions \u00a7 6. The Court reads the language \"at such locations as designated by Global Direct for purchase\" to mean that when the Merchant uses the equipment provided by Global Direct and/or PAI to deliver indebtedness, the contracts become effective. Indeed, Terms and Conditions Section 1 states \"A MERCHANT'S SUBMISSION OF A TRANSACTION TO GLOBAL DIRECT SHALL BE DEEMED TO SIGNIFY MERCHANT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD SERVICES AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS HEREIN.\" The entire basis of Plaintiffs' lawsuit is that the indebtedness was sent to Global Direct and processed, but that they were charged higher fees than they agreed to.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6 81 (stating Defendants \"began to perform payment processing services on their behalf.\"). There are no allegations in the Amended Complaint that would support an inference that the debt was not delivered under the contractual terms. Accordingly, the contracts became effective when Plaintiffs began delivering debt to Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Where a valid contract exists, unjust enrichment claims are barred as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Donchi, Inc. v.
