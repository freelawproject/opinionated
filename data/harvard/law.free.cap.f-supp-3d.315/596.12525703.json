First, Mr. Linder's complaint only pertains to the \"evidence used against [him]\" at trial and seeks release of \"trial exhibits\" contained within an \"evidence book.\" Compl. 1-3. As previously described, only two of the requests for which the EOUSA seeks summary judgment pertains to an \"evidence book\": requests 2014-03816 and 2015-02765.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 12-16, 46-54. His other FOIA requests on which the EOUSA seeks summary judgment pertain to, among others, drug analyses by the Drug Enforcement Administration, a particular CD, witness fees, correspondence between him and the presiding judge in his criminal case, and documents in other criminal cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 17, 41, 55, 58, 64. These other requests are not part of his current claim pending before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, contrary to Mr. Linder's assertion that he \"pre-paid\" $70 for the release of the \"evidence book,\" it does not appear that the EOUSA charged him for duplication of the 502 pages released to him\n   through request 2015-02765. Francis Decl. \u00b6 56 n.7 (explaining that requestors are entitled to their first 100 pages free and that the Department of Justice does not assess fees for amounts $25 or less; as the remaining 402 pages, at five cents a page, did not meet the minimum fee amount, all 502 pages were provided free of charge). While it is undisputed that Mr. Linder previously paid a $70 fee, it was not for request 2015-02765.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to Mr. Linder's request 2014-03816 for \"the cost to copy the evidence book with all of the entered exhibits,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, the Court finds this request moot in light of the EOUSA's response to request 2015-02765 and the Government's assertion that its production of 502 pages were provided to Mr. Linder free of charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to request 2015-02765, the EOUSA has not met its burden to demonstrate that it conducted an adequate search for responsive records, or to explain why its redactions are proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weisberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505425,1287775\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/627/365/\">\n    627 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   368 ;\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1185401,3686196\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/662/784/\">\n    662 F.2d at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Francis Declaration merely recounts that the Eastern District of Virginia initially \"found approximately 1,500 pages of records that may be responsive to [Mr. Linder's] request\" and then \"provided EOUSA with 502 pages of records to review.\" Francis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 56. A declaration by the FOIA point of contact for the Norfolk branch office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia similarly recounts, in summary fashion, that the office conducted a search and identified approximately 1,500 pages potentially responsive to Mr. Linder's request, after which the office provided the EOUSA with 502 pages of responsive records. Declaration of Cheryl Root \u00b6\u00b6 25-29, ECF No. 21-7. The declarations do not \"set[ ] forth the search terms and the type of search performed, [or] aver[ ] that all files likely to contain responsive materials [to plaintiff's request] were searched.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The declaration also does not specify why the district's initial estimate of 1,500 pages potentially responsive to Mr. Linder's request resulted in providing 502 pages-a third of the initial estimate-to the EOUSA (which were subsequently provided to Mr. Linder). The declaration's lack of \"specificity\" is insufficient to merit summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reporters Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264644\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/399/#p403\">\n    877 F.3d at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Similarly, the EOUSA offers no explanation as to why its redactions are proper under exemptions 6 and 7(C). Although the EOUSA dedicates several pages to describing the exemptions generally, Def.'s Mot. for Summary J. 14-18, it does not justify why the exemptions are relevant and warranted as to the 49 pages released with redactions. Indeed, the agency's entire explanation consists of, \"[o]n February 13, 2017, EOUSA, by way of a letter, informed the Plaintiff of the disposition of his FOIA request and fully released 453 pages and partially released 49 pages to the Plaintiff pursuant to Exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) of the FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl. \u00b6 57 (containing identical language).
