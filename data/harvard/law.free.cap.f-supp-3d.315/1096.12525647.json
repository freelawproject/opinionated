Travelers alleges that it has standing because, pursuant to certain surety and indemnity agreements, it is the equitable subrogee of (a) the account holder, (b) the entities that paid the funds in question to the account holder, and (c) entities that the account holder had an obligation to pay using the funds.

Krahl &amp; Travelers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Krahl was a general contractor in the business of providing general contracting services for construction projects. R. 185 \u00b6 6. The owners of some of the projects Krahl undertook required Krahl to obtain performance surety bonds to guarantee Krahl's performance, including payment of subcontractors, and required the subcontractors to submit lien waivers in order to receive payment from the project owners through Krahl as general contractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Travelers issued such surety bonds for Krahl.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10. To receive surety bonds from Travelers, Krahl also had to enter into a indemnity agreement with Travelers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. According to the indemnity agreements, Krahl was required to hold the funds it received from project owners in trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. But the agreement does not specifically require Krahl to segregate the funds or otherwise identify them as funds held in trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At Krahl's request, Travelers issued surety bonds for the following seven projects in Illinois and Colorado relevant to this case: Northwestern Memorial Hospital (Bond 105150320); Rush University Medical Center (Bonds 105150332, 105200157, 105200155, 105268775); Trammell Crow Co. (Bond 105268769); City and County of Denver (Bond 105268766).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. These seven bonds covered a \"combined penal sum\" of about $40 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The subcontractors on these projects submitted lien waivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94, 101, 108, 115, 122, 129, 135.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Krahl &amp; Fifth Third\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Krahl borrowed $6 million from Fifth Third over a period of about five years pursuant to a revolving line of credit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The loan documents provided Fifth Third a security interest in all of Krahl's accounts receivable and proceeds thereof, and in all of Krahl's deposit accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The loan documents also defined \"Right of Setoff\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   To the extent permitted under applicable law, [Fifth Third] reserves a right of setoff in all [Krahl's] accounts with [Fifth Third] (whether checking, savings, or some other account) ....

The account was not designated as a trust account, and included no other similar restriction or designation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20N.E.2d%201345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Krahl regularly made deposits into and withdrawals from this account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Fifth Third's Knowledge of Krahl's Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fifth Third considered its loans to Krahl to be \"high quality, high performing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Because of the quality of the loans made to Krahl, Krahl was only required to submit \"gross numbers and balances on its various projects-the details of each project, information about accounts receivable [and payable]\" were not required by Fifth Third.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Fifth Third admits that it had documents in its possession showing that some of Krahl's projects required Krahl to obtain surety bonds, and that Travelers had issued such bonds for some of Krahl's projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. For example, Krahl submitted to Fifth Third a document titled, \"Request for Credit Commitment,\" describing Krahl's business and noting that it sometimes was required to obtain surety bonds for its projects, and that the number of projects requiring such bonds was \"growing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Fifth Third's analysis also noted that all five of Krahl's largest accounts were bonded projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. Additionally, Fifth Third's analysis of Krahl's finances distinguished between bonded and non-bonded accounts receivable, because bonded accounts receivable had \"diminished collateral value.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40-42, 58-59. Fifth Third received monthly reports from Krahl regarding its accounts receivable and payable. These reports identified which accounts were bonded and unbonded. These reports were the basis for Krahl to demonstrate a new collateral borrowing base that would enable Krahl to continue to borrow from Fifth Third.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Matthew Doucet was part of Fifth Third's relationship management team for the Krahl account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Prior to becoming employed by Fifth Third, Doucet worked for surety companies underwriting construction projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. At his deposition, he testified that he has general knowledge of the business of surety companies and that they obtain indemnity agreements from the principals on the bonds, such as Krahl.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-54. He also testified that he knows that the \"intent\" of a surety bond is that the general contractor is to \"treat\" bonded funds as \"trust funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Doucet testified Fifth Third had quarterly meetings with Krahl, and at those meetings Fifth Third obtained financial statements, account receivable reports, and work in progress reports from Krahl.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49. Doucet also testified that he would ask Krahl about its surety relationships, and he knew that Krahl had a surety relationship with Travelers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. He testified further, however, that he did not know which projects Travelers had bonded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. He testified further that \"[i]n the eyes of the bank, we view bonded accounts to be the collateral of the surety company,\" and that \"[i]n the case of those particular surety bonded projects, the surety company has a priority to those funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Krahl in Default\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The FBI executed a search warrant on Krahl's offices on January 6, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. When Fifth Third inquired about the situation, Krahl informed Fifth Third that as a result of the FBI investigation it would not be pursuing collection of accounts receivable worth approximately $5 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. The next day, on January 7, Krahl and Fifth Third held a meeting at which Fifth Third asked Krahl to provide a business plan showing that it could maintain profitability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Fifth Third placed a hold on Krahl's accounts in the meantime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Doucet was involved in the meetings with Fifth Third during this time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   He testified that Fifth Third knew that Krahl had pending payments to subcontractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. Krahl did not present a business plan on January 8, leaving it in default on its loans from Fifth Third.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. That day, Fifth Third took the $3,086,931.05 in Krahl's account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. Doucet also testified that, at the time Fifth Third swept Krahl's accounts, he had no knowledge of what deposits in Krahl's account were bonded or not, and he does not believe anyone else at Fifth Third had such knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Of $3,086,931.05 that was in Krahl's account, $1,829,250.60 were bonded funds received on November 19 and 30, 2009; December 4 and 16, 2009; and January 4 and 6, 2010, from the owners of the seven projects referenced above.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87, 91-135. Six of these deposits were checks, and one-the November 19, 2009 deposit-was an Automated Clearing House electronic transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Travelers alleges that it has a right to the $1,829,250.60 in bonded funds that were in Krahl's account when Fifth Third swept the account, because Travelers is the subrogee of the beneficiaries of trusts protecting those funds created pursuant to the Illinois Mechanics Lien Act and the Colorado Bond Act. Travelers alleges that claims based on the trusts have priority over Fifth Third's claims based on Krahl's debt. Fifth Third makes several arguments in opposition: (I) Fifth Third is a \"holder in due course,\" under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code (as codified under Illinois law), and that status \"gives Fifth Third priority even over trust funds,\" R. 188 at 26; (II) Article 4 of the UCC gives Fifth Third the right to take the funds transferred electronically; and (III) the Illinois and Colorado statutes allegedly imposing a trust on Krahl's bonded funds do not \"impose liability on lenders,\" and do not create \"express\" trusts such that Fifth Third can be said to have \"knowledge\" giving the trusts priority over Fifth Third as a lender. R. 188 at 22\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Holder In Due Course\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Illinois has adopted Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which provides that in general, \"[a] person taking an instrument ... is subject to a claim of a property or possessory right in the instrument or its proceeds, including a claim ... to recover the instrument or its proceeds.\" 810 ILCS 5/3-306. By contrast, \"a holder in due course takes free of the claim to the instrument.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fifth Third argues that it took the six checks at issue in this case as a holder in due course such that it \"is not liable to a beneficiary that is otherwise entitled to the proceeds from such instrument[s],\" R. 188 at 1, because to the extent any claim on the check proceeds existed when it took hold of the checks, Fifth Third had no actual knowledge of those claims. Travelers argues to the contrary that only constructive knowledge is required to destroy purported holder in due course status, and that Fifth Third had constructive knowledge of the trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court will address this debate shortly, but the Court first notes that Fifth Third's argument fails at a much more basic level. The only instruments at issue here are the checks that Krahl received from its project owners drawing on their bank accounts and deposited with Fifth Third. The holder in due course doctrine protects a\n   <em>\n    holder\n   </em>\n   of such instruments from claims to the instrument itself or to the right to payment of the proceeds of the instrument (in other words, the right to exchange the instrument for money). But there is no question here that Fifth Third received payment on the checks from the project owners' banks and then credited Krahl's account with the funds it received, such that it no longer held the checks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5A Anderson U.C.C. \u00a7 3-302:20 (3d ed.) (\"When a bank has paid a check and returned it to the depositor, the bank cannot claim to be a holder in due course of the check because it is no longer a holder.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Fed.

(\"[T]he bank no longer had the check in its possession, and the prime requisite for holder-in-due-course status is that you be a holder, that is, a person who is in possession.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Schnitger v.

In fact, all parties in this case intended for Fifth Third to take title to the proceeds of the checks. The question here is once the checks cleared and Fifth Third credited Krahl's account, did Fifth Third have the right to take those funds to satisfy Krahl's debts to Fifth Third. This is not an argument over the right to the account funds as proceeds of the checks (to which the holder in due course doctrine would be relevant), but the right to the account funds as between Krahl and Fifth Third each as creditor and debtor (Krahl as creditor of its account and debtor on its loan, and Fifth Third as debtor on the account and creditor on the loan). The holder in due course doctrine is not relevant to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even if the holder in due course doctrine was relevant here (which it is not) it would not serve the purpose Fifth Third hopes. Fifth Third argues that as a holder is due course, its claims to the funds in Krahl's account would take priority over all claims except those of which it had\n   <em>\n    actual knowledge.\n   </em>\n   But the statute provides otherwise. The holder of an instrument is a holder in due course if the holder took the instrument \"without\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   of any claim to the instrument.\" 810 ILCS 5/3-302(a)(2)(v). The term \"notice\" as used in Article 3 is defined according to the general definition provided in Article 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   810 ILCS 5/3-103(d) (\"Article 1 contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this Article [3].\"). Accordingly, \"a person has 'notice' of a fact if the person: (1) has actual knowledge of it; (2) has received a notice or notification of it;\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   (3) from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason to know that it exists.\" 810 ILCS 5/1-202(a) (emphasis added). Since this definition is stated in the disjunctive, subpart (3) provides that a person with \"reason to know\" a fact exists has \"notice\" of that fact. Thus, contrary to Fifth Third's argument, something less than actual knowledge can suffice for notice that destroys holder in due course status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Despite the clear statutory definition that notice includes constructive knowledge, Fifth Third cites 810 ILCS 5/3-307 in support of its argument that it had to have actual notice of any claim to take priority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 188 at 13. That provision applies when\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (i) an instrument is taken from a fiduciary for payment or collection or for value, (ii) the taker has knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary, and (iii) the\n   represented person makes a claim to the instrument or its proceeds on the basis that the transaction of the fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This provision sets forth circumstances when a \"represented person\" can make a claim on an instrument or proceeds a fiduciary has transferred to a holder. Fifth Third seizes on the provision's requirement of \"knowledge\" as opposed to \"notice,\" and argues that since it did not have actual knowledge of the statutory trusts, and trusts are a form of fiduciary relationships, Travelers has no right to the funds in Krahl's account pursuant to section 3-307. The problem with this argument is that section 3-307 only applies in circumstances where the person to whom a fiduciary duty is owed (i.e., the \"represented person\") alleges that the\n   <em>\n    fiduciary\n   </em>\n   breached a duty, and the bank had knowledge of that breach. To the extent that Krahl breached a duty by failing to pay its subcontractors, Travelers's claim in this case is not based on that breach. Rather, it is based on Fifth Third taking funds that would otherwise have been available to Krahl to satisfy its duties. Fifth Third's taking of the account funds does not satisfy the elements of section 3-307, so it is irrelevant here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Electronic Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Of the seven project fund transfers to Krahl at issue, one was an electronic funds transfer. Fifth Third argues that it was permitted to take the funds transferred electronically because under 810 ILCS 5/4A-502(c)(1), \"[i]f a beneficiary's bank had received a payment order for payment to the beneficiary's account in the bank ... [t]he amount credited may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank.\" This statute also permits the bank to \"credit the beneficiary's account,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=519%20P.2d%201315\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , or to satisfy a \"levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien sequestration, or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant.\" 810 ILCS 5/4A502(a).

Fifth Third contends, however, that (1) these statutory trusts do not take priority over its claim to the funds in Krahl's account because the statutes creating the trusts do \"not ... impose liability on lenders\" for failing to \"hold funds ... in trust,\" R. 188 at 22; and (2) the statutes do \"not create an express statutory trust that would support Travelers'[s] theory of Fifth Third's 'knowledge' as to the fiduciary nature of the funds,\" R. 194 at 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Hivon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20687124\">\n    2015 WL 687124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (Bankr.

Thus, Fifth Third's apparent lack of liability under the relevant Illinois and Colorado statutes is irrelevant to whether the trust relationship created by those statutes affects Fifth Third's right to take the account funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Fifth Third's second argument is based on an interpretation of the\n   <em>\n    Hivon\n   </em>\n   bankruptcy case.

Fifth Third argues that the undisputed evidence in this case does not rise to that level. The Court agrees with that assessment, but disagrees that such specific knowledge is required to impose liability on a bank in these circumstances. Rather, as discussed, constructive knowledge-i.e., facts sufficient for a reasonably diligent person to have gained actual knowledge-is sufficient. And the Court holds that no reasonable jury could find that Fifth Third did not have constructive knowledge that there were equitable trust claims to the funds in Krahl's account. There is no dispute that Fifth Third knew that much of Krahl's business required surety bonds. It is also undisputed that Fifth Third was aware which of Krahl's projects were bonded because that fact was relevant to Fifth Third's determination of the collateral base for Krahl's credit with the bank. Fifth Third met with the Krahl quarterly, and received monthly reports from Krahl to enable Fifth Third to monitor Krahl's credit-worthiness and to adjust its credit limit. It is possible that when Fifth Third took the funds in Krahl's account it did not know specifically how much of those funds were bonded. But Krahl knew that some of the funds were bonded because it received monthly reports with this information, and it used this information to adjust Krahl's credit. To the extent Fifth Third did not have knowledge at the level of specificity of the banks in\n   <em>\n    Tonyan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gluth\n   </em>\n   , that was only because Fifth Third chose not to appreciate the information that was readily available to it. The undisputed facts show that Fifth Third knew that Krahl's account almost certainly contained trust funds, and that Fifth Third could have identified the trust funds with reasonable diligence.

Additionally, the Court finds that the evidence showing that Fifth Third had constructive knowledge that Krahl's account contained trust funds is clear and convincing such that imposition of a constructive trust is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suttles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20Ill.%20Dec.%20819\">\n    127 Ill.Dec. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20N.E.2d%20901\">\n    533 N.E.2d at 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he grounds for imposing a constructive trust must be so clear, convincing, strong and unequivocal as to lead to but one conclusion\");\n   <em>\n    Gluth Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Ill.%20Dec.%20365\">\n    116 Ill.Dec. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20N.E.2d%201345\">\n    518 N.E.2d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because the gravamen of the complaint in the present case is that defendant wrongfully appropriated\n   money in which plaintiffs had an interest, imposition of a constructive trust would be the proper remedy.
