The court need not determine this issue, however, to conclude that removal is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant notes Plaintiffs never explicitly reference \u00a7 408.001 in their Original Petition; instead, they merely allege a claim for exemplary damages based on Defendant's alleged gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Original Pet., at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. to Remand, at 3 (arguing that \"because this case involves exemplary damages\n   <em>\n    for wrongful death only\n   </em>\n   and those\n   damages fall under [but are not created by]\" the TWCA (emphasis added) ). Defendant further observes that under the \"Damages for Wrongful Death\" section of their Petition, Plaintiffs state that they are bringing \"this action pursuant to \u00a7 71.001,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, commonly referred to as the 'Wrongful Death Act.' \" Pls.' Original Pet., at 3. Defendant's argument and construction of Plaintiffs' allegations would clearly support the conclusion that, as pleaded, Plaintiffs' Petition seeks to recover under a cause of action (exemplary damages for gross negligence, i.e., wrongful death) preserved by \u00a7 408.001(b) of the TWCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Applying Plaintiffs' interpretation of their Petition requires no different result. As Plaintiffs admit, their pleading could have been worded more clearly. Even assuming, however, that a fair reading of the Petition coincides with Plaintiffs' explanation set forth in their reply, i.e., \"the only possible claim that can be brought, and the only claim that Plaintiffs have asserted in their petition, is for gross negligence and the recovery of exemplary damages under Section 408.001(b) of the Texas Labor Code,\" such claim is nevertheless removable. For the reasons set forth in part A. above, the court finds that even where a plaintiff explicitly pleads a claim under \u00a7 408.001(b), seeking to recover exemplary damages for the alleged gross negligence of an employer, such a claim would nevertheless \"arise under\" a statutory source other than the TWCA, thereby rendering \u00a7 1445(c) inapplicable and qualifying the case for removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Given the plain language and history of Texas Labor Code \u00a7 408.001(b), the fact that qualified family members possessed a right to sue for the wrongful death of an employee long before passage of the TWCA, the reality that \u00a7 408.001(b) does not advance the purpose of the TWCA, and that various other courts have concluded that \u00a7 408.001(b) preserves a wrongful death cause of action, this court finds that Plaintiffs' claim does not arise under Texas workers' compensation laws. Accordingly, there is no statutory basis for remand under \u00a7 1445(c), and Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand should be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Recommendation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the undersigned\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDS\n   </strong>\n   that the United States District Court\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand (ECF No. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Right to Object\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   A copy of these findings, conclusions, and recommendation shall be served on all parties in the manner provided by law.
