Walker, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court is not the Vote-Restoration Czar. It does not pick and choose who may receive the right to vote and who may not. Nor does it write the rules and regulations for the Executive Clemency Board. Instead, this Court possesses the well-known and unsurprising \"province and duty ... to say what the law is.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury v. Madison\n   </em>\n   , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n    2 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1803). And this Court possesses the unremarkable discretion to find a means for the Board to comply with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In its Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, this Court applied longstanding precedent from the Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit that invalidated unfettered-discretion schemes to a novel context; namely, that of felon re-enfranchisement.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 144. And, as it has done in the past, this Court invited the parties to recommend appropriate remedial action. Defendants essentially repackage the current scheme into proposed remedies permitting the Governor and Board to do, as the Governor described, \"whatever we want\" in denying voting rights to hundreds of thousands of their constituents. ECF No. 144, at 2 (citation omitted). This will not do. And Defendants' proposed remedy to abandon the whole vote-restoration scheme does not pass constitutional muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   If binding precedent spanning decades is to guide this Court-as it must-then an injunction must ensue to prevent further infringement. Florida's vote-restoration scheme can no longer violate Plaintiffs' fundamental First Amendment rights. Accordingly, as even Defendants acknowledge, \"this Court may direct the Board 'to find a means of bringing the [State's] scheme into compliance with federal law.' \" ECF No. 149, at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strahan v.

ECF No. 147, at 2-3. But such relief is beyond the scope of this Court's authority. The people of Florida-either through ballot initiatives or through their legislative acts-may cure any perceived policy weaknesses with Florida's restoration scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court's task today is to remedy Florida's\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   scheme\n   by cabining government officials' unfettered discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While Defendants oppose any relief and claim the current scheme is all sunshine and rainbows, they agree with Plaintiffs that this Court may provide declaratory relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 157, Ex.

Defendants need only redraft rules that align the vote-restoration scheme within the boundaries of the law by cabining official discretion and providing meaningful time constraints for the Board's decision-making. Plaintiffs, meanwhile, are deprived of a voice in directly choosing their elected leaders. They are also deprived of associating with the political party, if any, of their choice. Both are essential First Amendment rights, as this Court described in its prior order. ECF No. 144, at 9-17. Balancing the hardships between protecting First Amendment rights and having a government board that meets four times a year redraft their rules to conform with the United States Constitution weighs unsurprisingly in favor of the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs easily satisfy the fourth factor. \"[T]he public interest is always served in promoting First Amendment values.\"\n   <em>\n    Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1950039\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/268/1257/#p1276\">\n    268 F.3d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1276 (11th Cir. 2001). There are few greater interests than free association and free expression to choose public officials to lead, to represent all people in their jurisdictions, and to advance policy for the common good. These interests are why Americans launched a revolution against perceived unfettered discretion in the hands of one high-ranking official, King George III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The question turns to the nature and extent of a permanent injunction. \"Injunctive relief against a state agency or official must be no broader than necessary to remedy the constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Knop v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517501\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/996/#p1008\">\n    977 F.2d 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1008 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Toussaint v.

This Court does not re-enfranchise otherwise eligible citizens. This Court does not operate as a legislature.
