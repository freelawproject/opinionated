DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants challenge the admissibility of Clover's testimony on four grounds. First, the defendants argue that Clover is unqualified to provide his proposed expert testimony and relies on unsound methodology. Second, the defendants argue that Clover failed to submit a report compliant with Rule 26(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, requiring his testimony's exclusion. Third, the defendants argue that the testimony Clover proposes to provide goes to matters that do not call for expert opinion and thus is not relevant. Finally, the defendants argue that Clover's proposed testimony is unduly prejudicial in light of its probative value and thus merits exclusion. Each of these arguments is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. CLOVER'S QUALIFICATIONS AND RELIABILITY OF HIS METHODOLOGY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants challenge Clover's credentials and methodology as a basis for excluding his proposed expert testimony. For the reasons that follow, Clover's qualifications are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rules 702 and 703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise\" only if four conditions are met: (1) \"the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\" (2) \"the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data,\" (3) \"the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,\" and (4) \"the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\" FED.

The defendants point out that \"Clover did not graduate from college and has never held any real estate or investment banking licenses,\" and \"has absolutely no background in investment banking.\" Defs.' Mot. at 21. This view of Clover's lack of qualifications is bolstered by the fact that \"Clover in his reports frequently interchanges the terms investment 'banker' and 'broker,' \" which the defendants assert \"are distinct professions and subject to different standards, licensing requirements, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9029761\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/398/426/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"This conflation of such a basic principle,\" the defendants argue, \"highlights Clover's inadequacies when it comes to investment banking.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9029761\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/398/426/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the defendants complain that Clover identified his industry in his deposition as \"[f]inance, development, consulting, marketing,\" rather than investment banking services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (quoting Williston H. Clover Dep. (\"Clover Dep.\") at 5:22-25, ECF No. 66-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants' criticism misses the mark because Clover does not hold himself out as an investment banker. Instead, Clover's Report states that he \"ha[s] owned or been a board member of companies involved in United States and international real estate development, finance, consulting,\n   and marketing for more than 50 years,\" and \"ha[s] extensive firsthand experience in virtually every aspect of the industry, including finance, brokerage, consulting, development, and property ownership.\" Defs.'

The Agreement entitles the plaintiff, \"[u]pon settlement of binding loan and/or guarantee commitments for the Project obtained directly or indirectly by Bazarian International,\" to a \"debt fee will be based on a flat two-percent (2%) of the gross amount of the debt financing provided to the Project,\" net of certain amounts not at issue here. Agreement \u00a7 2.C. Clover asserts that \"a 2% fee is lower than the industry standard internationally, especially if it includes structuring and the creative funding process,\" and that he, if \"asked to undertake such an assignment,\" would require a fee of \"3% of the actual amounts funded,\" as well as \"a retainer, and an agreement stating that all fees due would be paid from closing proceeds at closing by the closing attorney.\" Clover's Rpt. \u00b6 4.1. Clover concludes that \"[t]he fee for this transaction is certainly not excessive in this business\" and \"if anything, somewhat lower than the industry standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Clover elaborates on this testimony in his rebuttal report.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.'

The issue here is not whether\n   the fee amount is reasonable but rather whether the plaintiff satisfied the contract's terms so as to be entitled to the fee. The contract at issue is the product of negotiation between the parties and clearly provides that the debt fee is to \"be based on a flat two-percent (2%) of the gross amount of the debt financing to the Project.\" Agreement \u00a7 2.C.

Whether a Debt Commission Typically is Calculated Based on the Full Amount Loaned or Only the Amount the Lead Arranger Lends\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The second matter on which Clover proposes to opine is \"whether it is commonly understood in the industry that a commission for arranging debt\" such as the commission to which the plaintiff claims he is entitled \"is calculated based on the full amount lent by a lending consortium or whether the fee is calculated based only on the amount actually lent by the lead arranger for the consortium.\" Clover's Rpt. \u00b6 4.2. The Agreement provides that the debt fee is to be calculated \"based on a flat two percent (2%)\n   <em>\n    of the gross amount of the debt financing provided to the Project\n   </em>\n   .\" Agreement \u00a7 2.C (emphasis added). Clover asserts that \"it is commonly understood in the industry that the brokerage/consulting fee is charged to and paid by the borrower based on the full amount of the loan syndicated and committed to by the syndicating manager,\" that \"the lead arranger/syndicator/manager\" commonly\n   \"act[s] as managing partner in the consortium, ... spread[ing] risk and charges among participating lenders, much like the insurance business,\" that \"[t]he fee or commission is usually paid by the borrower,\" and that \"[t]he broker and borrower depend on the lender [the] submit[ ] the transaction to, and often do[ ] not know of other participants as the commitment generally is issued in the lead lender/syndicator/manager's name.\" Clover's Rpt. \u00b6 4.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As with testimony regarding the industry standard fee amount, the plaintiff has failed to explain how the basis on which fees of the sort at issue here typically are calculated is relevant in any way to whether the plaintiff is entitled to the fee. The Agreement unambiguously specifies that the debt fee is to be calculated based on \"the gross amount of the debt financing provided to the Project,\" Agreement \u00a7 2.C, not any particular lender's contribution to the project. Whether fees such as that at issue here typically are calculated based on the full amount that a lending consortium loans or only the amount that the consortium's lead arranger loans is irrelevant to the amount of the fee the plaintiff asserts it is due under the Agreement. Once again, to the extent this issue would be relevant to a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim, no\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim remains in this case.
