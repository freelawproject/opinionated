No. 34). On September 12, 2017, Google filed a Renewed Motion to Dismiss (\"Second Motion to Dismiss\"), again under Rule 12(b)(3). In response, along with its opposition to the Second Motion to Dismiss, SEVEN filed a Contingent Motion for Leave to Conduct Venue Discovery. (Dkt. No. 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 22, 2017, the Court entered a Venue Discovery Order, which directed the parties to conduct discovery on Google's venue motions by February 22, 2018, and directed Google to refile its venue motions no later than two weeks after the close of venue discovery. (Dkt. No. 107). The Court then granted the Parties'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   motion to extend venue discovery to March 1, 2018. (Dkt. No. 115). Following the close of venue discovery, Google filed the instant Motion and a related Motion to Transfer Venue to the Northern District of California. (Dkt. Nos. 125, 126). The Court held a hearing on the instant Motion on June 1, 2018. (Dkt. No. 186).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

More precisely, \"Google is an information company.\" Its vision is \"to provide access to the world's information in one click,\" and its mission is \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\" Making information available to people wherever they are and as quickly as possible is critical to Google's business. As Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, explains, \"We want to make sure that no matter who you are or where you are or how advanced the device you are using-Google works for you.\" To meet this goal, Google developed a content-delivery network that it calls the Edge Network.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Google delivers information through its Edge Network. Google provides web-based services, such as YouTube and Google Play, to users throughout the\n   world. These services are in high demand. Google reports that Google Play reaches more than 1 billion Android users and that YouTube serves over 1.5 billion users per month. Studies show that YouTube alone is responsible for approximately 20% of all internet traffic. Delivering that much data requires lots of bandwidth, and when the data is being transmitted to large numbers of geographically diverse users it must traverse multiple network paths at different times. It also costs money. The larger the data and the farther it has to travel, the greater the cost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Google addresses these challenges with its Edge Network, which has three elements: Core Data Centers, Edge Points of Presence, and Edge Nodes. The Core Data Centers (there are eight in the United States) are used for computation and backend storage. Edge Points of Presence are the middle tier of the Edge Network and connect the Data Centers to the internet. Edge Nodes are the layer of the network closest to users. Popular content, including YouTube videos, video advertising, music, mobile apps, and other digital content from the Google Play store, is cached on the Edge Nodes, which Google refers to as Google Global Cache (GGC).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Google Global Cache is recognized as \"one of Google's most important pieces of infrastructure,\" and Google uses it to conduct the business of providing access to the world's information. GGC servers in the Edge Nodes function as local data warehouses, much like a shoe manufacturer might have warehouses around the country.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Instead of requiring people to obtain information from distant Core Data Centers, which would introduce delay, Google stores information in the local GGC servers to provide quick access to the data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Caching and localization are vital for [Google's] optimization of network resources.\" Because \"hosting all content everywhere is inefficient, it makes sense to cache popular content and serve it locally.\" Doing so brings delivery costs down for Google, network operators, and internet service providers. Storing content locally also allows it to be delivered more quickly, which improves user experience: \"Serving content from the edge of the network closer to the user improves performance [and] user happiness.\" To achieve these benefits, Google has placed Edge Nodes throughout the United States, including in this District. Google describes these nodes as the \"workhorse[s] of video delivery.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Just like brick-and-mortar stores, Google's GGC servers independently determine what content to cache based on local requests.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   The GGC servers in Google's Edge Nodes include software that Google refers to as \"Ustreamer (actually \u03bcstreamer, i.e. micro-streamer).\" Ustreamer is \"responsible for serving video content from YouTube and other Google services, along with other large content such as Google Play applications and Chrome downloads.\" It operates on a content-delivery platform \"at the edge of Google's network\" called \"bandaid\"; it \"does not run in the core (except for some internal testing purposes), unlike the majority of the Google services, such as search or gmail.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Using ustreamer and bandaid, a GGC server \"handles requests directly from its clients, predominantly YouTube's video\n   players.\" When such a request is received, if the content is stored in the node's local cache, \"the node will serve [it] ... to the end user, improving the user experience and saving bandwidth.\" If cache-eligible content is not already stored on the node, and the content is cache-eligible, \"the node will retrieve it from Google, serve it to the user, and store it for future requests.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Ustreamer is largely \"autonomous,\" \"in the sense that almost all decisions related to serving a particular request are made locally, without coordinating with other servers.\" Like a brick-and-mortar store sells directly to customers from inventory and stocks that inventory based on local customer demand, ustreamer in each GGC node decides-independently from other nodes in Google's Edge Network- whether to serve requested content, whether to cache content, and whether to send requests to other servers.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Google's GGC servers are housed in spaces in the District leased by Google.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Google's GGC servers are housed in spaces leased\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   by Google from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) whose networks \"have substantial traffic to Google and are interested in saving [bandwidth].\" Hosting Google servers allows ISPs to save both bandwidth and costs, as they \"do not incur the expense of carrying ... traffic across their peering and/or transit links.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   When an ISP agrees to host a GGC server, the parties enter into a Global Cache Service Agreement, under which Google provides hardware and software- including GGC servers and software-to be housed in the host's facilities; technical support; service management of the hardware and software; and content distribution services, including content caching and video streaming. In exchange, the host provides, among other things, a physical building, rack space where Google's computer hardware is mounted, power, and network interfaces. \"All ownership rights, title, and intellectual property rights in and to the Equipment [i.e., the hardware and software provided by Google] ... remain in Google and/or its licensors.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Google GGC servers located in this District cache Google's products and deliver them to residents of this District.

Physical Place\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Google argues that \"GGC servers are not 'physical places of business.' \" (Dkt.

No. 148 at 2). \"Even people (employees) are physical objects that enclose space, which alone cannot establish venue. SEVEN's definition directly contradicts Section 1400(b) and\n   <em>\n    Cray\n   </em>\n   , both of which require a 'place' to establish venue, not objects or physical things.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Google relies on a sister court's ruling from this District considering these GGC servers to support its contention. \"The GGC servers are not 'places' under the meaning of the statute and therefore cannot establish a regular and established place of business in this [D]istrict.\"\n   <em>\n    Personal Audio, LLC v.

A revisiting of the ultimate decision of\n   <em>\n    Personal Audio\n   </em>\n   on this issue is not only possible but compelled by the facts of this case. Additionally, in this Court's opinion, neither the statute nor the Federal Circuit's guidance in\n   <em>\n    In re Cray\n   </em>\n   permit the result reached by that court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Specifically, the Court recalls the conclusion it noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Section 1400(b) of Title 28, United States Code lays proper venue where \"the defendant ... has a regular and established place of business.\" As the Federal Circuit instructed in\n   <em>\n    In re Cray\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he statute [ ] cannot be read to refer\n   <em>\n    merely\n   </em>\n   to a virtual space or to electronic communications from one person to another.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

This is precisely the situation here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Of course, it would run counter to the statutory requirements to find proper venue in a district where there was\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   physical presence of a given defendant. A defendant who does not establish or permit a physical presence within a district\n   <em>\n    of its own volition\n   </em>\n   may not be brought into a district pursuant to the venue statute by the acts of another. To hold otherwise contravenes the language of the statute, requiring the defendant to \"[have] a regular and established place of business\" within the district.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is true even where there may be citizens of that district who, at\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   places (homes, for example) connect to that defendant's website and engage that defendant in business or where a defendant's employees have\n   <em>\n    their own\n   </em>\n   places in which they perform their employment.\n   <em>\n    In re Cray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t must be a place of the defendant, not solely a place of the defendant's employee.\") (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Here, however, there is more than \"merely\" \"a virtual space or [ ] electronic communications from one person to another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"place\" is specifically localized: a physical server occupying a physical space.

No. 141-23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   It reveals that Google exacts far more control than may\n   be suspected from a general lease arrangement. Google\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   ISPs such as Suddenlink to provide \"[r]ack space, power, network interfaces, and IP addresses, as specified in the following table [omitted], in consultation with Google\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[r]emote assistance and installation services described in SCHEDULE 'A' \"; \"[n]etwork access between the Equipment and Host network subscribers\"; and \"[r]emote high bandwidth access, sufficient for Google to download upgrade images of GGC to the Equipment, unless separate arrangements are agreed with Google.\" (Dkt. No. 141-23 at 1). The Suddenlink Agreement makes it clear that the ISP\n   <em>\n    does not own\n   </em>\n   the server(s);\n   <em>\n    Google owns the servers.\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 141-23 at 2 (In the event of termination of the Agreement: \"Host will\n   <em>\n    remove, package and ship\n   </em>\n   (shipping charges will be pre-paid directly by Google to the carrier, and Host will undertake such removal and packaging to be undertaken in a commercially reasonable manner) all Equipment back to Google within fifteen (15) calendar days of effective date of termination. If Host fails to do so,\n   <em>\n    Google will have the right to: (a) charge Host and Host will pay the fair market value of the Equipment; or (b) recover and take possession of such Equipment\n   </em>\n   , and for this purpose may enter any premises of Host where such equipment is located during normal working hours to remove Equipment. Host will promptly surrender the Equipment to Google in as good order and condition as originally delivered, reasonable wear and tear excepted.\") (emphasis added) ). Google is not even required to replace faulty servers under the Suddenlink Agreement. (Dkt. No. 141-23 at 7 (\"Google Services: Google will provide the following services in beta: ... 3. replace faulty Equipment (at Google's cost and sole discretion)\") ). This Agreement is not a mere lease of digital space or computing power; it is the installation of Google's own servers in a physical space\n   <em>\n    that becomes Google's.\n   </em>\n   Following installation of the GGC server, the ISP is required to provide Google explicit details regarding Google's server's installation location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (\"Contact &amp; Location Details: As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the parties will advise each other in writing (which may be sent electronically) of the following: ... (c) Equipment location (address/floor/rack)\") ). Once installed, it is considered a permanent fixture. There is no dispute that the Suddenlink Agreement requires that, in order for an ISP to move a previously installed GGC from one location to a new location, it must secure Google's permission,\n   <em>\n    which Google may not permit \"at its sole discretion.\"\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 141-23 at 2 (\"Change Notification:\n   <em>\n    Host will provide Google no less than thirty (30) days' written notice of any proposed relocation of the Equipment or change of IP address.\n   </em>\n   Host may propose relocation at any time.\n   <em>\n    Google, at its sole discretion, may elect not to accept the proposed relocation\n   </em>\n   but will reasonably consider any such relocation and discuss all reasonable options with Host.\") (emphasis added) ). Google's ownership of the server and its contents is absolute, as is Google's control over the server's location once it is installed. (Dkt. No. 141-24 at 2 (\"Restriction on Use of Equipment:\n   <em>\n    All ownership rights,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    title, and intellectual property rights in and to the Equipment shall remain in Google and/or its licensors.\n   </em>\n   THE EQUIPMENT OR ANY PORTION THEREOF MAY NOT BE USED, COPIED, TRANSFERRED, REVERSE-ENGINEERED, OR MODIFIED EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY THIS AGREEMENT. Host must not, without the prior written consent of Google (which may be withheld in its sole discretion), access, use, or dispose of the Equipment, in whole or in part.\") (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This is not a partnership, wherein an ISP may independently act on Google's behalf in administering the GGC. To the contrary, the Suddenlink Agreement expressly disclaims any such relationship. (Dkt. No. 141-24 at 2 (\"No Partnership, No Exclusivity: The parties are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create an agency, partnership or joint venture. This Agreement is not intended to, nor does it create, any agency, partnership, joint venture or other profit-sharing arrangement, nor does it create an exclusive relationship between the parties. This Agreement places no restrictions of any type on either party's ability to freely compete or to enter into agreements with other entities or individuals.\") ). Indeed, Google's total control over the GGC server's physical presence within the ISP may be best illustrated by the Suddenlink Agreement's requirement that tasks such as the \"physical switching of a toggle switch;\" \"power cycling equipment (turning power on and/or off);\" and \"\n   <em>\n    tightening screws\n   </em>\n   , cable ties, or securing cabling to mechanical connections, plug;\" may be performed \"only with specific and direct step-by-step instructions from Google.\" (Dkt. No. 141-23 at 6) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   This level of control in the physical world exemplifies how the physical presence of the GGC server within this District constitutes more than \"merely\" \"a virtual space or [ ] electronic communications from one person to another.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, such control in the physical realm over a specific physical space establishes that, irrespective of the determinations related to the other \u00a7 1400(b) requirements, there is a physical place which this Court may examine to determine if it is a regular and established place of business and whether it is a place of the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that, in this case, the GGC server itself and the place of the GGC server, both independently and together, meet the statutory requirement of a \"physical place.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   SEVEN has met its burden to demonstrate satisfaction of this statutory requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

SEVEN fails to provide a basis to conclude that these servers are 'places of businesses,' let alone regular and established places of business of Google.\" (Dkt. No. 125 at 10). The Court will address the \"of Google\" argument in Part III.B.iv.,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , but as to whether the GGC servers and the place where the servers are lawfully housed are \"places of business\" within the meaning of the statute, the Court reaches the opposite conclusion--they undoubtedly are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Google's shotgun arguments point in many directions, each intended to persuade that the GGC servers are not places of business within the meaning of the statute: \"[t]he GGC servers are standard machines manufactured by a third-party and used to cache static Google content\"; \"[s]ervers are pieces of equipment, like slot machines or vending machines, and do not rise to the level of being places of business\"; \"there would be little to no impact to the performance of Google's Edge Network or to Google users if there were no GGC servers in this District,\" as the \"GGC servers in this District are 'a fraction of a fraction' of 1 percent of the total serving capacity of Google's peering and GGC server network.\" These arguments must be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In arguing that slot and vending machines are not places of business, Google cites\n   <em>\n    HomeBingo Network, Inc. v.

It does nothing to demonstrate that the GGC server should not be considered a regular and established place of business as to Google.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As to\n   <em>\n    Magee\n   </em>\n   , the Court first notes that the Fifth Circuit was not considering whether a vending machine was a regular and established place of business but, rather, a \"sales establishment\" under the ADA such that it constituted a place of \"public accommodation\" subject to Title III compliance.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351227\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/530/#p534\">\n    833 F.3d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is not a beneficial comparison. Further, there are opinions by numerous courts squarely holding that vending machines or similar objects\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   places of business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of this\n   aside, it is not the machine alone (be it a server, slot machine, or vending machine) that moves the Court to its ultimate conclusion in this case. It is the server, its physical location within this District, the control exerted over both the server and its location under the GGC agreements (like the Suddenlink Agreement), and the other circumstances here present that lead this Court to conclude these facts meet the strict statutory application laid out by the Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Cray.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Google's argument relating to the impact of the GGC servers in this District on its Edge Network or on Google users is similarly rejected. The statute does not require \"substantial\" business or \"large\" impact from the business being done at the place of business--in order to lay proper venue in a judicial district, the statute simply requires that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   regular and established place of business be present. The Court refuses to read into the statute extra-statutory requirements at the behest of Defendants who have, through their own volition, secured and established multiple places of business within this District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Google argues that it does not need the GGC servers in this District, and that their contribution to Google's business mission is so small as to be immaterial. However, even the\n   <em>\n    Personal Audio\n   </em>\n   court explicitly found that GGC servers may be found in \"at least Tyler, Sherman, Plano, and Texarkana,\" that \"[t]he GGC servers carry out a useful role in Google's business, in that they appear to more efficiently connect internet service customers, i.e., customers of Suddenlink or CableOne, to Google content,\" and that \"Google evidently values the contribution of the GGC system.\"\n   <em>\n    Personal Audio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278032\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/922/#p934\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). That the machines are manufactured by third parties is of no moment as places of business are frequently manufactured by third parties. Indeed providing business services, such as office space, logistics, telecommunications, retail and commercial locations, and customer facing automated points-of-sale,\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   businesses is not only common but is a business model unto itself. These servers actively service a distinct business need of Google's, as described in the Background section,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 947-48. Thus, they are places of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Further, the Court has previously seen this \"impact\" argument in a similar context; it reveals how such a reading of the statute undermines the clear statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Word to Info, Inc. v. Apple Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 2:17-cv-592-JRG, Apple's Motion to Dismiss for Improper Venue (Redacted Version), Dkt. No. 23 at 4-5\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   (arguing that \"Apple's stores do not constitute a regular and established place of business for venue purposes because they account for only a trivial part of Apple's overall business.... Apple's two retail\n   stores are not a substantial part of its ordinary business. Apple has approximately 270 retail stores in the United States. The two stores in this district account for less than 1% of Apple's total retail establishments .... Likewise, the two stores in this district account for only small part of Apple's sales. Because the two stores in the Eastern District represent such a small part of Apple's overall operations, if Apple closed those stores, its established business ... would not be appreciably or substantially affected.\"), at 5 (\"Subjecting a company with 80,000 employees and 270 stores across the United States to venue in the Eastern District because of the presence of two retail outlets accounting for only [redacted] of Apple's revenues would allow the tail to wag the dog, especially when those stores do not represent the totality of Apple's business operations.\"). Examining the \"effect\" on a company's business which a particular place or places of business have is not in keeping with a strict statutory application. In fact, it undermines it. Reading a non-statutory requirement that the place of business for \u00a7 1400(b) requires the place of business to be a substantial part of a defendant's ordinary business or have a material effect on a business's provisioning of goods or services does violence to the language of the statute and is precisely the kind of statutory deviation the Federal Circuit cautioned against in\n   <em>\n    In re Cray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We stress that the analysis must be closely tied to the language of the statute.\"), 1364, 1364 n. 1 (noting that any \"relative comparison\" of \"the nature and activity of the alleged place of business of the defendant in the district in comparison with that of other places of business of the defendant in other venues\" should not include \"value judgments on the different types of business activity conducted therein.\") (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Google additionally argues that \"the servers are also not 'regular and established' because under the agreements between Google and the ISPs, either party can terminate at any time and for any reason.\" (Dkt. No. 125 at 11 (citing the Suddenlink Agreement) ). The Court disagrees. A business which has a five-year agreement is certainly no less established with a month remaining on the lease than it is in the first year of the lease. A month-to-month agreement which has endured for years is clearly \"regular and established.\" There is little question that Google intends the GGC servers to be a \"[s]calable long term solution for edge content distribution,\" and it is undisputed that they have been such a solution in this District for years. (Dkt. No. 141-18 (Mike Axelrod, The Value of Content Distribution Networks and Google Global Cache) at 10; Dkt. No. 141 at 19). The fact that the Suddenlink Agreement may be terminated is not evidence that Google's presence in this District is somehow less than \"regular and established.\" Few sophisticated transactional documents fail to have one or more escape clauses, but nothing about such provisions makes the commercial targets addressed less than established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As a part of ensuring a proper application of the statutory language, it may be appropriate to consider similar types of places of business to demonstrate the appropriateness of this Court's finding. SEVEN argues that \"GGC servers in the Edge Nodes function as local data warehouses, much like a shoe manufacturer might have warehouses around the country. Instead of requiring people to obtain information from distant Core Data Centers, which would introduce delay, Google stores information in the local GGC servers to provide quick access to the data.\" (Dkt. No. 141 at 4). \"The only relevant difference between a warehouse that stores a company's tangible products and\n   Google's GGC servers is the nature of the products being stored-physical merchandise versus digital content. Regardless of what the products may be, if the physical structure that stores them is 'a physical, geographical location in the district from which the business of the defendant is carried out,' that structure is a place of business under \u00a7 1400(b).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Cray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1362 ) ). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   There is no question that warehouses are properly considered places of business and have been so held, by both legislatures and courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   This recognition makes\n   intuitive sense. The vast majority of business organizations require and utilize some form of storage or logistics. Of course, businesses may store items at\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   business's locations (like, for example, Fulfillment by Amazon\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) wherein goods are stored by third parties at the third parties' discretion and with no control over the location, management, or daily supervision of the products in storage. Such an arrangement can scarcely be considered to render the physical location of the stored items a place of business as to the party whose goods are stored. However, were that same party to integrate the storage arrangement into its own logistical operations (similar to, for example, Amazon and its relationship with its own fulfillment centers), there can be little doubt that the storage warehouses are places of business,\n   <em>\n    even if the public never interacts with the warehouse.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.
