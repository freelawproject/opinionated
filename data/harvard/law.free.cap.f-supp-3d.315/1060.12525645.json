Antoine Williams (\"Antoine\"), Plaintiff's cousin, also had been in the parking lot at the time of the shooting. Antoine is a paraplegic who requires a wheelchair and a specially equipped van for transportation. Williams and another individual, Keith Slugg, a parolee confined to house arrest, were employed by the Illinois Department of Human Services to drive Antoine's van in the summer of 2011. Williams drove the van during the day and Slugg drove the van at night. Slugg had left his home for his driving shift on July\n   1, and he was with Antoine in the parking lot at the time of the shooting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officers Garcia and Hill immediately began to investigate the shooting. Specifically, on July 2, 2011, the two officers interviewed Gladney, who was still in the hospital being treated for his wounds. Gladney, who had been shot from behind while texting, told the officers that he did not know who shot him. The officers recorded their interview of Gladney in a General Progress Report (\"GPR\") that they later provided to Officer Maresso and that Maresso lost or destroyed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 21-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Others present at the scene also were interviewed. One such witness, Jason Jones, gave a description of the shooter that was inconsistent with Williams's appearance; the GPR for the Jones interview did not include any mention of Williams. Another witness, Kenneth McNeal, was interviewed twice, and first explained to Hill and Garcia who he saw at the lot on the night of the shootings. The GPR of this interview was lost or destroyed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Williams contends that Garcia and Hill \"were told\" that Williams was the driver of the van and therefore they immediately suspected that he was a shooter or the shooter. So Garcia and Hill summoned Gladney to review the surveillance footage. According to Williams, even after watching the footage, Gladney continued to tell the officers that he did not see who had shot him. Garcia and Hill allegedly used the recovered Ruger handgun to threaten Gladney (presumably with criminal charges) and \"successfully pressured Gladney to say\" that it was Williams who shot him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, Slugg was detained and questioned extensively about the shootings, but again, the GPR of his interview was lost or destroyed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Shortly thereafter, Slugg was murdered, and, according to Williams, Defendants decided to charge Williams with the crimes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To do so, Garcia and Hill conducted a third interview of Gladney, which began on September 27, 2011; Assistant State's Attorney Goldish was present for this interview. Williams alleges that Garcia, Hill, and Goldish \"made very clear what they wanted Gladney to 'say' in a statement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Gladney allegedly refused to make the requested statement, and his refusal was met with renewed threats concerning his handgun and additional threats to turn him over to federal authorities, since a federal warrant for his arrest for a heroin trafficking offense in Iowa was outstanding. Some 17 hours later, Gladney signed a 17-page statement dated September 28, 2011, that Williams contends was authored by Goldish and Garcia and that contained numerous false statements, including that Gladney saw Williams charge at Oliphant and shoot him at close range, that Gladney had been unarmed, and that he was not drunk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After signing the statement, Gladney was permitted to leave the police station. Mere hours later, Goldish approved felony charges against\n   Williams-who had been arrested the previous day. In addition to Gladney's new statement, Williams contends that Garcia authored (1) a false \"Supplementary Report\" dated September 22, 2011, that identified Williams to match Jones's description of the shooter, and (2) a false GPR dated September 28, 2011, regarding an interview with Antoine stating that Antoine relayed that Williams had been driving his van on the night of July 1 even though Antoine had not said that and Garica already knew that Slugg had been driving the van.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A grand jury hearing was held on October 11, 2011; McNeal was asked 107 questions, which Williams alleges were intentionally selective because none of them regarded whether McNeal saw Williams at the parking lot the night of the shooting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Williams was indicted and before he went to trial, Maresso attempted to link Williams to physical evidence from the crime scene. Specifically, Williams alleges that Garcia authored a January 28, 2012 Supplementary Report that falsely identified the Ruger as belonging to and used by Williams.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The DNA results, which were returned in July 2014, were negative.

He has alleged that Goldish, Garcia, and Hill coerced a statement containing falsehoods from Gladney that was used to procure felony charges against Williams immediately after it was given and used to support his detention and prosecution. In fact, he alleges that Gladney's September statement was the only evidence that Defendants had to support probable cause because the other investigative evidence was deficient. (Dkt. 1) at \u00b6 52. These allegations are sufficient at this time to allege that he was charged and held without probable cause based on Goldish and the Officers' conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kuri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204882338\">\n    2017 WL 4882338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (on summary judgment, finding that defendants could not \"manufacture their own probable cause by fabricating evidence and manipulating eyewitnesses to implicate him in the shooting\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, the Court rejects Goldish's argument that Williams has insufficiently alleged her involvement in this claim so as to adequately allege causation. She acknowledges that the allegations against her involve the Gladney statement, but she argues that the complaint lacks allegations that this statement was used in ways other than authorizing formal felony charges against Williams-such as in the grand jury or at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 32) at 10-11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although Goldish makes a fleeting reference to the intervening cause of a grand-jury indictment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11), this argument is not developed to the extent that could support a dismissal of the Fourth\n   Amendment claim against Goldish. In any event, \"an allegation of pressure or influence exerted by the police officers, or knowing misstatements by the officers to the prosecutor\" can prevent \"the chain of causation\" from being broken by an indictment.\n   <em>\n    Colbert v.

Since Williams includes such allegations of pressure and knowingly false statements, his claim will proceed.

Therefore, the Officers argue that the statute of limitations expired on September 28, 2013 and that this suit is untimely. (Dkt. 47) at 8-9.

(Dkt. 60) at 10. However, the Officers do not dispute that Williams was held for years in pretrial detention, and although \"civil\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims will be viable most often when a defendant has been wrongfully convicted and imprisoned as a result of the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation[ ]...the key to a civil\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim is not a conviction or acquittal but a deprivation of liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    Cairel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258389\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/823/#p832\">\n    821 F.3d at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a situation such as Williams faced here, \"where an accused is held in pretrial custody before acquittal or dismissal, a failure to disclose exculpatory evidence may cause the type of deprivation of liberty required for a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim even if the case ends without a trial or conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258389\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/823/#p832\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bianchi v.

It is evident, therefore, that Williams's circumstances do not preclude a civil\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the elements of the claim, Williams has asserted sufficient allegations to plead the first two elements-that favorable evidence was concealed. Regarding the third element, the Officers contend that Williams's acquittal creates a bar to a showing of prejudice (or materiality as it is sometimes also referred) because an acquittal is \"the same outcome [Williams] claim[s] would have happened if the evidence were timely disclosed.\" (Dkt. 47) at 5-6. This argument is similar to the argument that an acquittal bars a civil\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim in total, and it fails for the same reasons. Further, evaluating the sufficiency of Williams's allegations as to the third element, Williams alleges that the three withheld GPRs could have secured his release before trial because it undermined the charges against him, particularly in light of the allegedly thin evidence to support his detention in the first place. (Dkt. 1) at \u00b6 60. This is especially true regarding the McNeal eyewitness statement that he did not see Williams at the parking lot on the night in question and that he saw Slugg driving Antoine's van that night. Although Williams's allegations regarding the other two undisclosed GPRs are not as strong, altogether, Williams's allegations are sufficient to plead that the undisclosed evidence was material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, with regard to one GPR (the July 2 Gladney interview) the Officers argue that Williams cannot state a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   -violation claim on it because he knew about it before trial, and therefore no Brady violation occurred. (Dkt. 47) at 5. But accepting the allegations of the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in Williams's favor, this is not a viable basis on which to dismiss the claim. Whether Williams can prove his allegations is an issue that cannot be resolved at this stage of the case. In sum, Williams\n   has stated a claim based on the Officers' alleged non-production of exculpatory evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Looking first at the allegations of coerced testimony and false reports, those violations depend on individual Officer actions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Any harm caused by a policy or practice to withhold from discovery or not preserve exculpatory evidence or an alleged street-file policy or practice could only manifest itself through the Officers actually withholding such evidence or maintaining such files, and therefore a finding of municipal liability is predicated on a finding first that the Officers themselves were liable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Andersen v.

Apr. 27, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In response, Williams contends that the Officers' alleged qualified immunity defense creates the possibility that the Officers could be found not liable while the City could be found liable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 35) at 12-13. However, whether the Officers can be found liable is beside the point; rather, the issue is \"whether the individual defendants committed a constitutional violation that is a prerequisite for\" the City's liability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206050492\">\n    2013 WL 6050492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Moreover, the fact that the City has consented to entry of judgment against itself in the event that the Officers are found to have violated Williams's constitutional rights \"even if one or all Defendant Officers is/are further found to be not liable to [Williams] because one or more of the is/are entitled to qualified immunity\" undermines Williams's position.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20316878\">\n    2016 WL 316878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ; (Dkt. 22-1) at 3. The language of the Limited Consent Agreement also serves to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Estate of Loury by Hudson v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201425594\">\n    2017 WL 1425594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. Apr. 20, 2017), on which Williams relies. (Dkt 35) at 12. Specifically, in that case, the court found that bifurcation could create unnecessary complexity and confusion in the situation wherein the individual defendants were found immune. But the consent agreement proposed there failed to contain a provision that provided for this particular situation. The same problem does not exist here. In sum, because there is no way that a jury could consistently find the City liable without first finding the Officers liable, this factor weighs in favor of bifurcation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Litigation or Judicial Efficiency and Economy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The parties also dispute whether bifurcation will best serve the interests of economy and efficiency. As noted above, the City believes that bifurcation will allow the parties to potentially avoid unduly burdensome and unnecessary discovery related to the City's policies and procedures. Williams responds that judicial economy will not be served by bifurcation and stay of discovery on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. First, he\n   argues that the City's estimation of the scope and expense of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   discovery is premature and too speculative, particularly because, in his view, his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim is more limited than in other cases involving excessive force and also because his individual and municipal claims overlap. (Dkt. 35) at 5-6. In addition, Williams argues that bifurcation could require duplicative discovery and trials, and it could create endless discovery disputes regarding whether certain discovery is\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   -related.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   First, the City argues that, based on the broad\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   allegations in Williams's complaint alone, discovery into the alleged unlawful policies and practices would be expansive. At this point, Williams argues that the City's arguments are too speculative and conclusory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 35) at 5. But they are not. Indeed, just regarding the street files kept for investigations of \"serious crimes,\" Williams's complaint cites to an article concerning the practice going back to the 1940s.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 1) at \u00b6 45. Accordingly, the Court cannot find fault with the City's assertion that the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   discovery will be extensive and will require various forms of expert discovery. And although Williams argues that the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   discovery in this case would be \"more narrowly tailored\" than in excess-force cases, Williams's own arguments reflect the breadth of his allegations-City practices and policies regarding various forms of misconduct in the investigation of \"major gun crimes,\" although to be sure, nothing in Williams's complaint limits his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim to \"major gun crimes\" or even defines that term. Even with this amorphous limitation, discovery related to all\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations could very well be incredibly wide-ranging and therefore burdensome for the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Williams further argues that the overlap of discovery essential to the individual claims and the municipal claim both makes bifurcation unnecessary and ultimately will have a less efficient effect, because it will create discovery disputes and require duplicative efforts. On the necessity front, this Court encountered a nearly identical scenario and similar arguments in\n   <em>\n    Andersen v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207240765\">\n    2016 WL 7240765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. Dec. 14, 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that he had been wrongfully charged, tried, convicted, and incarcerated on the basis of fabricated or coerced evidence and that the defendants had kept and failed to disclose its \"street files\"-which led to the plaintiff being denied access to exculpatory information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. The plaintiff there brought both a \u00a7 1983 claim against individual CPD officers and a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the City for the practice of coercing false confessions and keeping street files. Like here, the City moved for bifurcation of the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims against it, arguing in part that bifurcation would best serve the interest of judicial economy and would not affect the plaintiff's eventual recovery of damages because the City, like here, consented to the entry of judgment if the individual officer defendants were found to have violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   There, the plaintiff objected to bifurcation, arguing that the discovery essential to the claims against individual officers and the City overlapped significantly, thereby making bifurcation unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Court rejected this argument. Specifically, the Court found the overlap between the individual claims and the street-file claims specious, noting that the plaintiff had failed \"to explain how discovery related to whether there was a street file in this case overlaps significantly with the much broader issue of whether the City had a policy or practice of allowing street files in all of its criminal investigations and prosecutions. Even assuming that a street file existed in this case-an\n   assumption that the City denies throughout its briefing-the existence of that file would constitute only a small amount of the discovery that would underlie a department-wide\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   is directly applicable to this case, particularly in that Williams has not explain how the individual discovery based on his allegations of misconduct against the Officers involved in his case overlaps in a meaningful way with his contention that the City maintained a coercive investigative practice and maintained street files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, as to Williams's contention that bifurcation will create inefficiency, that argument also fails for many of the reasons already discussed in Section IV(B)(2). In particular, Williams's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims are dependent on his establishing the liability of the Officers and the City has offered a Limited Consent Agreement that awards damages to Williams in the event that the Officers are found to have violated his constitutional rights, regardless of any immunity arguments. Accordingly, first addressing the individual claims may eliminate the need to proceed to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims at all, and bifurcation may also significantly expedite litigation of the individual claims themselves. This is because instead of focusing on street files from decades ago or broad questions about the City's training or disciplinary policy, the parties can focus on establishing what happened to Williams and whether it violated his constitutional rights. As this opinion indicates, that task will already be quite onerous because of the nature, number, and severity of the claims Williams has asserted. \"By limiting the scope of this initial stage of litigation, it is possible to resolve these threshold issues more quickly.\"\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201536447\">\n    2017 WL 1536447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. In addition to these points, as discussed above, Williams's individual claims and his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims do not overlap in a significant manner, such that the discovery disputes Williams anticipates should occur with frequency. And from the Court's view, the parties thus far have appear to be cooperating in the discovery process, so the consideration of a history of disputes does not apply here and the Court remains confident that the parties will work together to resolve their discovery disputes.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Cook Cty.

Ill. July 8, 2010) (denying bifurcation where there \"already are discovery disputes brewing\"). For all of these reasons, efficiency and economy counsel in favor of bifurcation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Having found that the Rule 42(b) criteria are met, bifurcation is appropriate as long as it will not prejudice the non-moving party or violate the Seventh Amendment. On this front, the City argues that allowing the case to move forward as a whole would serve to prejudice the Officers, specifically due to the introduction of alleged acts of misconduct by various non-defendant police officers. (Dkt. 22) at 10-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201536447\">\n    2017 WL 1536447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. In addition, the City argues that Williams will not be prejudiced without\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   discovery because the Limited Consent Agreement provides that the City will agree to judgment against itself if the jury finds any individual Officer liable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15. Based upon the above findings and the fact that numerous courts have found that bifurcation allows parties to bypass burdensome and potentially unnecessary litigation and related costs, bifurcation appears to present benefits to both parties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Andersen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207240765\">\n    2016 WL 7240765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   , 100 F.Supp.2d at 895 ;\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203037121\">\n    2007 WL 3037121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Importantly, Williams argues that bifurcation of his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim will frustrate his efforts to seek relief beyond money damages, such as deterring future official misconduct\n   and initiating reform in the police department. (Dkt. 35) at 8-9. Williams is correct that the Limited Consent Agreement is limited to compensatory damages, but that likely is because Williams's complaint only seeks compensatory relief at this time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 1). And although Williams may seek to deter future official misconduct by way of a substantial judgment against the City, Williams's complaint does not limit any extraordinarily large judgment to his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim; instead, it is entirely possible that Williams could be awarded a large judgment against the Officers, which presumably send the same message to the City and police department. This is particularly so here, where the City has admitted that it will pay whatever compensatory damages are awarded against its employees. (Dkt. 22-1);\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Banner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879199\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/479/827/#p829\">\n    479 F.Supp.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 829 (N.D. Ill. 2007) (because the City will pay for any proven claims, the damages award will send a message either way). This is not to minimize Williams's desired non-economic benefit from bringing suit against the City. But after carefully considering the arguments on both sides, the Court finds bifurcation to be appropriate in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    V. State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Using Illinois law, Williams sets forth claims for\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   against the City (Count IV), indemnification by the City and Cook County (Count V), civil conspiracy (Count VI), and malicious prosecution (Count VII). The Cook County Defendants do not meaningfully argue for dismissal of the state-law claims. Instead, they assert the perfunctory argument in support of dismissal of the state-law claims that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over such claims after dismissing Williams's federal claims. The Officers include even less substance in support of the same argument ( (Dkt. 47) at 10), and the City does not address the state law claims asserted against it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 41);\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20278720\">\n    2018 WL 278720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (where defendants did not challenge certain allegations, they waived their argument and their motions to dismiss those allegations were denied). Because the Court has not dismissed the federal claims, the motions to dismiss the state claims are denied, with one exception: in line with the analysis set forth in Section II above, Williams's Illinois conspiracy claim is deficient because it fails to allege concerted action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fritz v.

As the Officers point out (Dkt. 66), Williams did not follow the correct procedure for introducing supplemental authority.

In other words, the plaintiff's claim was dismissed in\n    <em>\n     Mosley\n    </em>\n    not because he was acquitted at trial, but instead because he failed to show that the defendant police officers withheld any material evidence that, if disclosed, would have led to the termination of his prosecution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The complaint further alleges that Goldish conspired with the Officers to deprive Williams of his constitutional rights by committing\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    violations, which would present a different analysis.

If Williams was properly arrested on account of the shooting\n    <em>\n     prior\n    </em>\n    to the Gladney statement, this could affect the prosecutorial-immunity analysis. However, at this stage, taking all reasonable inferences in Williams's favor, the complaint does not on its face admit all of the ingredients of an impenetrable defense, particularly because it alleges that there was no probable cause at all to support Williams's arrest and detention.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Xechem, Inc. v.
