Under California's Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009 (the \"Act\"), CAL. EDUC.

Because Narez did not meet those requirements, the Act required the School to deny his application. Plaintiffs elected to legally challenge the Act by filing a Complaint in this Court which alleges that the Act abridges the School's and Smith's First Amendment right to teach horseshoeing and Narez's First Amendment right to learn horseshoeing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss.

CAL. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 94801(b). In promulgating the Act, the legislature sought to ensure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) Minimum educational quality standards and opportunities for success for California students attending private postsecondary schools in California.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) Meaningful student protections through essential avenues of recourse for students.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) A regulatory structure that provides for an appropriate level of oversight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (4) A regulatory governance structure that ensures that all stakeholders have a voice and are heard in policymaking by the bureau.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (5) A regulatory governance structure that provides for accountability and oversight by the Legislature through program monitoring and periodic reports.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (6) Prevention of the harm to students and the deception of the public that results from fraudulent or substandard educational programs and degrees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CAL. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 94801(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (the \"Bureau\") regulates private postsecondary educational institutions. CAL. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 94875. The Bureau approves regulated institutions that meet minimum operating standards. CAL. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 94887. Defendant Michael Marion serves as Chief of the Bureau, which is located within California's Department of Consumer Affairs. Compl., ECF No. 1, p. 2 \u00b6 11. Defendant Dean Grafilo is the appointed Director of California's Department of Consumer Affairs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before a regulated institution can execute an enrollment agreement with a student who did not graduate high school or pass an equivalency examination, such as the General Educational Development (GED) test, that student must pass \"an independently administered examination from the list of examinations prescribed by the United States Department of Education\" or a Bureau-approved examination relevant to the intended occupational training.

Compl. at 2 \u00b6 16. A person who shoes horses is called a farrier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. In California, farriering does not require a license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Smith founded the School in 1991.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. Five times each year, the School offers a full-time eight-week curriculum to about 12 to 14 students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 32. That curriculum includes classroom session and practice removing, shaping, and applying horseshoes to horses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Classroom sessions focus on horseshoeing theory; horse anatomy, movement,\n   and lameness; and business advice on client management, self-employment, and interaction with barns, trainers, and veterinarians.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. The School evaluates students by written or oral examinations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. As of this year, the School's tuition costs $6,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The School qualifies as a regulated institution under the Act because it (1) is a private entity located in California that (2) offers a curriculum to the public for a vocational purpose and (3) charges tuition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6\u00b6 34-36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CAL. EDUC. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 94857, 94858. The Act thus requires the School only enroll students who have high school diplomas or recognized equivalents, or have passed ability-to-benefit examinations. CAL. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 94904.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that earning a passing score on an ability-to-benefit examination is unnecessary for horseshoeing. Compl. at 5 \u00b6 46. The School, which previously did not impose educational prerequisites to admission, does not accept state or federal student loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. Smith does not charge students who are unable to benefit from the School's curriculum because he refunds all but $250 of tuition paid if continuing the course is not in the student's best interest after the first week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The School was first inspected by the Bureau in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. The Bureau determined that the School's admissions requirements did not comply with the Act because it lacked admission prerequisites.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Smith inquired whether the Bureau would recognize his practice of partially refunding tuition after the first week to non-benefiting students as an alternative to having students pass an ability-to-benefit examination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7 \u00b6 57. The Bureau did not accept Smith's proposal as an alternative to the Act's requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, in 2017, Smith modified the School's admissions standards to call for a high school diploma, its equivalent, or passage of an ability-to-benefit examination, as required for Bureau approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 \u00b6\u00b6 58-59. Because of this change, the School has since rejected otherwise qualified students who did not meet these academic qualifications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   One such student turned away due to admissions standards changes is Plaintiff Esteban Narez. Narez dropped out of high school and has not subsequently earned his high school diploma or GED. Compl. at 7-8 \u00b6\u00b6 63-64, 75. Jobs in the equine field sparked Narez's passion for horses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68. After working alongside a farrier, Narez sought to become a farrier himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 \u00b6\u00b6 70-73. Narez believes studying for and taking the GED or an ability-to-benefit examination would conflict with his work schedule and would not substantially advance his career.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 \u00b6\u00b6 78-79. Although the School wanted to admit Narez, it rejected his application because he did not meet the Act's ability-to-benefit requirements for enrollment at a private postsecondary educational institution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint seeks a judicial declaration that the ability-to-benefit requirement is unconstitutional and injunctive relief to this effect.

OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that California's ability-to-benefit requirement as applied violates their First Amendment rights by restricting Smith and the School from teaching their horseshoeing curriculum and preventing the enrollment of Narez, who has not proven his ability to benefit under the Act. Compl. at 9-11 \u00b6\u00b6 89-101. Defendants move to dismiss because they assert the Act regulates non-expressive conduct and survives rational basis review. Mot. at 3-7.
