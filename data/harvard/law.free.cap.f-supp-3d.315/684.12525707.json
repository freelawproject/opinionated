He has been in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") custody since January 31, 2018, when he reported to Chelsea District Court for a pretrial hearing on misdemeanor criminal charges. ICE was waiting at the courthouse and detained him. Pensamiento filed a habeas petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claiming that ICE was refusing to transport him to his criminal proceedings in state court and that his detention was unlawful because he had not received a constitutionally adequate bond hearing in immigration court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 15, 2018, the judge on emergency duty (Burroughs, J.) entered a temporary restraining order and ordered ICE to deliver Pensamiento to his next hearing on the misdemeanor charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 17 at 1-2. The order disposed of Counts I and II in Pensamiento's habeas petition. The only remaining claim for relief is Count III, in which Petitioner seeks release from detention, or, at the least, a detention hearing before this Court at which the government is required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is a danger to others or a flight risk. Respondents have moved to dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), and Petitioner opposed on April 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the hearing on April 25, 2018, on the motion to dismiss and the merits of the habeas petition, the government agreed to release Pensamiento for 30 days so that he\n   could be present for the birth of his child. However, the parties agreed he would be placed back in detention unless the Court allowed his habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a review of the briefs, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Respondents' motion to dismiss (Docket No. 12). The Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   the habeas petition, and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDERS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   that Petitioner not be detained again unless the immigration court holds a bond hearing where the government bears the burden of proving that Pensamiento must be detained because he is dangerous or a flight risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pensamiento is a 26-year-old Guatemalan national who arrived in the United States in 2013 after fleeing persecution in his home country. Pet. (Docket No. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. He was apprehended, began asylum proceedings, and was released on bond in September 2013. Pet. \u00b6 13. Petitioner was authorized to work during the pendency of his removal proceedings and received a Massachusetts driver's license. Pet. \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   He met Yaritza Moreno, a United States citizen, while they were working in the same restaurant and while his asylum application was pending. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 15. Pensamiento and Moreno married in August 2016. Pet. \u00b6 15. Moreno filed a Form I-130 petition to sponsor Pensamiento to become a lawful permanent resident, which was approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\") on March 9, 2017. Pet. \u00b6 16. Based on that approval, which provides a pathway to becoming a permanent resident, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") administratively closed Pensamiento's removal proceedings on September 20, 2017. Pet. \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Chelsea police arrested Petitioner on December 17, 2017, after a car accident and charged him with two misdemeanor counts: (1) leaving the scene of an accident resulting in property damage, and (2) leaving the scene of an accident resulting in personal injury. Pet. \u00b6 20. He was arraigned on December 18, 2017, and released on personal recognizance. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Pensamiento had a pretrial hearing scheduled for January 31, 2018. Pet. \u00b6 22. After the hearing, he was arrested by ICE at the courthouse and detained. Pet. \u00b6 22. Pensamiento's removal proceedings have been re-calendared since his arrest. Pet. \u00b6 23. They remain pending, and no final order of removal has been entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioner's initial custody redetermination hearing was held on February 13, 2018. Pet. \u00b6 24. The IJ required Pensamiento to prove that he was not dangerous or a flight risk by clear and convincing evidence. Pet. \u00b6 24. Based on the police report of the then-pending misdemeanor charges, the IJ found that Petitioner had not carried his burden on the dangerousness inquiry and denied him bond. Pet. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 19, 2018, Petitioner pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident resulting in property damage and was ordered to pay a $200 fine. Docket No. 26-1 at 8. Other than the guilty plea for this misdemeanor, Pensamiento has no criminal record anywhere in the world.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. \u00b6 11. The Commonwealth dismissed the charge of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in personal injury. Docket No. 26-1 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pensamiento had a second bond hearing on April 3, 2018, after the charges were resolved. Docket No. 26-2 \u00b6 5. Again, the IJ placed the clear-and-convincing burden on Petitioner and denied his request for release. Docket No. 26-2 \u00b6 7. There is no evidence that Pensamiento has appealed either of the IJ's bond decisions to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 26 at 6 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the hearing on April 25, 2018, the parties reached an agreement to temporarily\n   release Pensamiento on a GPS tracking device for 30 days so that he could be present for the birth of his child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33. It is the Court's understanding that he has been released on these conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
