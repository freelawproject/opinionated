Dkt. 18. At the hearing, Brookens clarified that his \"only claim in this case\" is that AFGE \"did not follow the proper procedures in placing [AFGE] [L]ocal [12] in trusteeship,\" and, in particular, that it did not \"satisfy\" \"the factors set forth in Article IX, Section 5(a)(1) through (4)\" of AFGE's constitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n    at 38, 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oral Arg.

The Court, ruling from the bench, denied Brookens's motion for a temporary restraining order and held the motion for a preliminary injunction in abeyance to afford Brookens the opportunity to retain counsel. Minute Entry (Jan. 5, 2018). The Court also offered Brookens the opportunity to supplement his motion for a preliminary injunction, regardless of whether he was able to retain an attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18 at 30 (Oral Arg.

Although Brookens's response was not entirely clear, he appeared to argue that imposition of the trusteeship led to the cancellation of the Local 12 elections and thus deprived him of the opportunity to run for office. To avoid any uncertainty on this issue, and to help determine whether it has jurisdiction over Brookens's claims, the Court instructed Brookens to \"submit evidence\" establishing that he has \"standing under Article III of the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n    at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oral Arg.

The Court also denied AFGE's motion to dismiss without prejudice but granted AFGE leave to file a renewed motion to dismiss in combination with its opposition to Brookens's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n    at 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oral Arg.

Brookens, in turn, filed a combined reply and opposition, Dkt. 28, and AFGE filed a reply, Dkt. 30. The Court, then, heard oral argument on Brookens's motion for a preliminary injunction and AFGE's motion to dismiss on March 16, 2018. Dkt. 33. Ruling from the bench, the Court denied Brookens's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that Brookens had not carried his burden of establishing a likelihood of success on the merits; that \"standing [presents] a substantial hurdle in this case;\" and that Brookens had failed to show that a preliminary injunction was necessary to avoid an irreparable injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n    at 63-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oral Arg. Tr. 63:24-64:11). The Court explained, in particular, that it was likely that a decision setting aside the trusteeship would actually delay, rather than advance, the date on which the Local 12 elections would take place.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n    at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oral Arg. Tr. 64:13-16). In short, because the elections planned under the trusteeship were imminent, while removal of the trustee and reinstatement of the prior officers would require the rescheduling of the elections, granting the requested relief would likely have delayed the elections. For a plaintiff whose only identified injury was the delay in conducting elections, setting aside the trusteeship would have had the unfortunate effect of \"snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n    at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oral Arg. Tr. 65:1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Concluding that it needed additional information to address the question of standing, the Court took AFGE's motion to dismiss under advisement at the conclusion of the hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n    at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oral Arg. Tr. 66:2-5). After the parties submitted supplemental briefs, the Court issued a further order directing AFGE to \"update[ ] the Court on the timeline for the ... Local 12[ ] ... election[s]\" and to address Brookens's showing that he was qualified to participate in the upcoming elections. Minute Order (May 18, 2018). AFGE complied with that order on May 23, 2018. Dkt. 40. In doing so, it conceded that Local 12 had determined that Brookens was qualified to participate in the elections, and it provided the Court with a copy of a notice to the Local 12 membership stating that the elections\n   will take place on June 7, 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 40-1 (2018 Election Notice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Sensibly, it means that, if a favorable judicial decision is unlikely to correct the alleged wrong, there is no case or controversy within the meaning of Article III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This is such a case. According to Brookens, the principal injury that he has sustained-and is sustaining-is the inability to run for election to various union posts. When asked at oral argument whether the entire injury he is \"asserting comes back to the question of whether [he was] allowed [to run for office in October 2017] and since then,\" Brookens responded, \"Right.\" Dkt. 33 at 37 (Oral Arg. Tr. 37:6-10);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30 (Oral Arg. Tr. 29:17-30:5);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 41 (Oral Arg. Tr. 41:5-18). The Court repeatedly pressed Brookens on this issue and, with the one exception of the injury discussed below, that is all that he identified. Significantly, despite multiple opportunities to do so, Brookens did not identify any monetary or other compensable loss. That omission, moreover, is not surprising. As the Local 12 bylaws make clear, even if the October 2017 elections had proceeded as scheduled, and even if Brookens had been elected to office, he would not have received any compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 35-2 at 5 (\"The [L]ocal shall have no paid officers.\"). Thus, at least for purposes of Brookens's first theory of standing, the sole injury that he asserts is the lost opportunity to run for\n   office in October 2017 and during the intervening months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The relief that he seeks-dissolution of the trusteeship and reinstatement of the previously elected officers-however, would do nothing to redress that injury. Brookens did not hold office at the time the trusteeship was imposed, so reinstating the previously elected officers would not directly benefit him. The undisputed evidence also shows neither dissolution of the trusteeship nor reinstatement of the previously elected officers would remedy the cancellation of the October 2017 elections or accelerate the timing of rescheduled elections. By Brookens's own account, if the Court were to dissolve the trusteeship and reinstate the previously elected officers, it would take several months to \"send out the nominations notice,\" to \"advertise\" the elections, to permit an opportunity for \"campaigning,\" to appoint \"an election[s] committee,\" and to conduct the elections. Dkt. 18 at 15. In contrast, according to Nathaniel Nelson, the trustee who was appointed to oversee Local 12, those currently charged with managing Local 12 intend \"to hold elections for local officers\" and \"elections for delegates to participate in AFGE's 2018 National Convention\" in the very near future. Dkt. 25-2 at 2 (Nelson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-10). In January 2018, Nelson predicted that those elections would take place \"in or about May 2018,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (Nelson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9), and, although the schedule has slipped by about a week, the elections are now scheduled to occur on June 7, 2018, Dkt. 40-1 at 1. That date, moreover, is apparently firm; Local 12 has provided formal notice to its members that voting will occur between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on June 7, 2018 at four locations and by absentee ballots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Of equal importance, Brookens will appear on the ballot for each of the three positions he seeks: head steward, delegate to the AFGE National Convention, and delegate to the AFGE Council. Dkt. 36 at 11-12. Accordingly, absent intervention by the Court, Brookens will soon receive all the relief that he seeks in this case. Moreover, by dissolving the trusteeship and removing the current officers, as Brookens requests, the Court would only cast doubt on the upcoming elections and risk postponing the very elections that Brookens seeks to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although Brookens would have preferred that the elections occur in October, he does not seek any backward-looking relief, and a \"past harm\" cannot, standing alone, justify \"forward-looking relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan Drexen, Inc. v.

The doctrines differ, however, in important respects; most significantly, the courts recognize exceptions to the mootness doctrine that do not extend to standing, most notably the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" and voluntary cessation exceptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    528 U.S. at 190-91, 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, it is difficult to know whether Brookens's claim was redressable at the moment he brought suit. He did not bring suit until October 16, 2017, after the elections were cancelled and just two days before the date on which those elections were to have occurred. Dkt. 1-1. It is possible that, had the Superior Court or this Court immediately dissolved the trusteeship and reinstated the previous officers, those officers might have been able to hold the elections as planned or to reschedule the elections for a date prior to June 7, 2018. But, even if that had occurred, the Court cannot discern any cognizable injury that Brookens would have suffered by virtue of whatever brief gap might have existed between that hypothetical election date and June 7, 2018.

In short, this is not a case that poses the question whether the \"allegedly wrongful behavior [can] be expected to recur,\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    528 U.S. at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That conduct is ongoing, and all that has changed is the effect of that conduct on one of the many affected parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that neither of the \"two [principal] exceptions to mootness,\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Brookens's Representation in Other Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When pressed at oral argument, Brookens identified one additional injury that he allegedly suffered due to the imposition of the trusteeship. Although not mentioned in his complaint, Brookens asserted at oral argument that, as a result of the imposition of the trusteeship, a union lawyer designated to represent him in another case before this Court experienced a delay in obtaining files relating to that case, which were maintained at the offices of Local 12.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 33 at 43 (Oral Arg. Tr. 43:20-22). At oral argument, the Court heard from both Brookens and the union lawyer, Eleanor Jenkins, about the issue. Although both were undoubtedly aggravated by the difficulty of obtaining access to files stored at Local 12's office, neither identified any harm that Brookens had suffered. Accordingly, even if this alternative theory of standing were properly before the Court, it would fail to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The episode at issue arose in the context of a case Brookens brought years ago against the Department of Labor, alleging that he was fired due to his race and age and in retaliation for his union activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brookens v. Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524053\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/40/\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2018). Brookens brought an administrative challenge before the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\"), which concluded that he had failed to substantiate his claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524053\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/40/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524053\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/40/\">\n    at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time the MSPB rejected Brookens's claims, it informed him that he could seek review of his discrimination claims before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or could seek review in federal district court within 30 days of his \"receipt of [the MSPB's] order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524053\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/40/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Brookens, however, did not take either approach and, instead, appealed the MSPB's decision to the Federal Circuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524053\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/40/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the Federal Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred the case to this Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524053\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/40/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524053\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/40/\">\n    at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Department of Labor, then, moved to dismiss on the ground that Brookens failed to timely file.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524053\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/40/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That motion was fully briefed before AFGE placed Local 12 in trusteeship,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brookens v. Acosta\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-1390, Dkt. 16; Dkt. 18; Dkt. 20, and thus Brookens cannot claim that the trusteeship had any effect on the briefing of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   All that happened after the Local was placed in trusteeship is that the Court asked the parties to address one question: when did Brookens \"receive notice\" of the MSPB's decision for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207703\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), the provision that requires an aggrieved party to file suit \"within 30 days after the date the individual filing the case received notice of the judicially reviewable action.\"\n   <em>\n    Brookens v. Acosta\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-1390, Minute Order (Feb. 1, 2018). In response to that narrow question, Brookens's counsel\n   asserted that she \"does not contest (and has never contested) that at the time [the] MSPB rendered its decision, she was an MSPB e-filer\" and thus received \"the decision on the date it was rendered.\"\n   <em>\n    Brookens v. Acosta\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-1390, Dkt. 23 at 1-2. Although Brookens's supplemental brief makes additional arguments, none is responsive to the Court's order. The Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Brookens v. Acosta\n   </em>\n   turned on only one fact-the fact that Brookens did not file suit within 30 days of receiving notice of the MSPB's decision-and that fact was undisputed. 297 F.Supp.3d at 44. Against this background, it is therefore unsurprising that, at oral argument, neither Jenkins nor Brookens could identify any connection between Jenkins's lack of access to the documents held by the union and the Court's decision dismissing Brookens's discrimination and retaliation suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 33 at 49-50 (Oral Arg. Tr. 49:23-50:16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing\" each of the elements of standing, including injury in fact, and that burden varies with the stage of the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the pleading stage, as here, the plaintiff need only allege facts sufficient to establish standing,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and, because Brookens is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the Court will also consider facts he has identified in other pleadings and at oral argument,\n   <em>\n    Greenhill v. Spellings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865555,3561909\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/569/\">\n    482 F.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572 (D.C. Cir. 2007). But, even applying that liberal approach, the Court cannot discern\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   factual allegation or assertion that would satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement. At best, Brookens's claim of injury is unduly speculative,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Attias v. Carefirst, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275635\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/620/#p626\">\n    865 F.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (\"An injury in fact must be concrete, particularized, and most importantly for our purposes, 'actual or imminent' rather than speculative.\"), and, more pointedly, it is wholly unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that Brookens's second theory of standing fails because he has not identified any actual or imminent injury in fact that he has suffered or will suffer due to a lack of access to the litigation documents maintained by Local 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Next Steps\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Having concluded that Brookens has failed to carry his burden of showing that the Court has Article III jurisdiction to consider his claims, the Court must decide whether to dismiss the action or to remand it to the Superior Court. The governing statute-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) -provides a clear answer to this question: \"[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be remanded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Despite this unqualified language, at least one court of appeals has suggested that a district court may dismiss a case when a remand would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boaz Legacy, L.P. v. Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20Fed.%20Appx.%20318\">\n    628 Fed.Appx. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2016) (mem.) (\"[D]ismissal, rather than remand, may be proper if ... the state court in which it was brought also would lack jurisdiction.\"). Most other courts of appeals, however, have concluded that the clear language of the statute is dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Albingia Versicherungs A.G. v.

Moreover, although the D.C. Circuit has not addressed whether \u00a7 1447(c) is subject to a futility exception, it has broadly observed that a district court without subject matter jurisdiction \"must remand the case\" under \u00a7 1447(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Republic of Venezuela v.

The Supreme Court, too, has stressed the mandatory nature of \u00a7 1447(c), even though it ultimately did not decide whether the statute admits of a futility exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Primate Prot.
