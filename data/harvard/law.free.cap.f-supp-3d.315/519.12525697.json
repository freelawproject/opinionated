As far as this Court can tell, agencies often publicly announce their decisions to limit the reach of an adverse circuit court ruling,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Envtl. Dev. Ass'n Clean Air Project v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307702,4280687\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/999/\">\n    752 F.3d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003 (D.C. Cir. 2014), which means that, for the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act (\"the FOIA\"), records that reflect the agency's internal deliberations prior to its nonacquiescence announcement are fairly deemed both predecisional and deliberative,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). Here, the Environmental Protection Agency (\"the EPA\") maintains that it has not yet made a nonacquiescence decision with respect to a certain circuit court ruling that was handed down five years ago-a representation that Plaintiff Hall &amp; Associates LLC (\"H &amp; A\"), an environmental consulting firm, vigorously disputes. Thus, in order to evaluate the propriety of the EPA's invocation of the deliberative-process privilege with respect to H &amp; A's request for records concerning the EPA's purported nonacquiescence, this Court must decide whether the agency has, in fact, made a nonacquiescence decision, and if so,\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   These and other privilege issues arise in the context of the instant FOIA lawsuit, which H &amp; A filed against the EPA in July of 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) Notably, at that point, H &amp; A had been on a crusade against the EPA's regulation of a water treatment practice known as \"blending\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   for at least 6 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Regulatory Reasonableness v.

The details of the EPA's policies with respect to blending are not pertinent to the instant case; it suffices to say that, in 2013, in a case called\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805406\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/844/\">\n    711 F.3d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2013), the Eighth Circuit vacated an EPA rule pertaining to that practice at H &amp; A's behest, on the grounds that the agency had effectively propagated a legislative rule regarding blending practices without engaging in the required notice and comment procedures,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805406\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/844/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805406\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/844/\">\n    at 872-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . H &amp; A believes that the EPA has decided not to apply the Eighth Circuit's decision on a nationwide basis, and the instant action pertains to one of H &amp; A's many attempts to locate internal agency documents that reflect the EPA's decision-making in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As relevant here, in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   , H &amp; A submitted a records request to the EPA under the FOIA, asking for documents relating to the agency's approach to blending\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of the Eighth Circuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) According to H &amp; A, the EPA withheld responsive documents and information on the grounds that the attorney-client and deliberative-process privileges shield these documents from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemption 5. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) And now, in the instant lawsuit, H &amp; A accuses the EPA of improperly withholding those records because it contends that the agency\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   decided not to apply the Eighth Circuit's ruling nationally, and the requested records reflect as much, thereby revealing the \"working law\" of the agency. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37 (asserting that \"[the] EPA has clearly rendered a final decision regarding the national applicability of the\n   <em>\n    ILOC\n   </em>\n   decision\" and that \"H &amp; A's Request [merely] sought the decision documents themselves, and the bases of this decision\" because \"[t]he regulated community has a right to know the Agency's working law\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before this Court at present are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment along with several other procedural motions that H &amp; A has filed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 43; Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Its Cross-Mot. for Summ J., Mot. for Leave to Amend Its Compl., Resp. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Mot. to Conduct Limited Disc. &amp; Strike the Nagle Decl. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 44-1.) In its summary judgment motion, the EPA maintains that, because no nonacquiescence decision has been made to date, the deliberative-process and attorney-client privileges permit the agency to withhold the predecisional deliberations and confidential attorney-client communications contained within the documents H &amp; A requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 17-23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   H &amp; A responds that the EPA made its decision about how it would respond to\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   back in August of 2013, and thus the agency has wrongfully invoked the deliberative-process and attorney-client privileges to shield records that actually constitute the working law of the agency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 20-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 31, 2018, this Court issued an Order that\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   both parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, and that also\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   (as moot or otherwise) H &amp; A's requests to amend its complaint, conduct discovery/strike a declaration that the agency had submitted, and accelerate the Court's consideration of this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 68.) This Memorandum Opinion provides the Court's reasons for that Order. In short, after reviewing the\n   parties' briefs, examining the record, and conducting an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the disputed documents in this case, this Court concludes that the EPA made a nonacquiescence decision with respect to the Eighth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   opinion as of November 19, 2013. Yet, because that decision post-dated the creation of the vast majority of the nine documents that remain in dispute in this case, and also because most of the redactions in these documents shield the authors' subjective opinions, this Court concludes that the EPA's withholdings are largely justified, with a few exceptions. In reaching this conclusion, the Court also rejects the argument that these documents constituted the working law of the agency, or were officially acknowledged by the EPA; again, with one minor exception. The Court has further concluded that the EPA has not acted in bad faith in this litigation or in its handling of H &amp; A's FOIA request, and thus, H &amp; A's motion to strike, motion for discovery, and request for sanctions have been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. H &amp; A's FOIA Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 13, 2014, H &amp; A filed a FOIA request with the EPA (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FOIA Request, Ex. A to Renewed Decl. of Deborah Nagle, ECF No. 43-2), seeking an array of documents that had been prepared for, or were created by, two high level agency officials-Nancy Stoner, the EPA's former Acting Assistant Administrator for Water, and Mark Pollins, the Director of the EPA's Water Enforcement Division. The documents that H &amp; A requested pertained to two national Clean Water Act seminars that occurred in November of 2013 and April of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Specifically, H &amp; A sought\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) [a]ny EPA records which discuss whether or not Ms. Stoner's November 2013 statement was accurately reported in the trade press;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) [a]ny talking points and/or other materials prepared for Ms. Stoner and/or Mr. Pollins in advance of their presentations at either of the above-referenced events or used by them at the events;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (3) [a]ny presentation materials EPA distributed as part of the aforementioned presentations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (4) [a]ny records that either Ms. Stoner or Mr. Pollins created as part of their respective presentations; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (5) [a]ny records that either Ms. Stoner or Mr. Pollins created in preparation for their respective presentations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After speaking with the EPA about the scope of this request, H &amp; A agreed to narrow its FOIA request to the records in the above categories that pertain to the \"EPA's position on the national applicability of the Eighth Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Scope Emails, Ex. B. to Renewed Decl. of Deborah Nagle, ECF No. 43-3, at 3-4.) Then, on January 22, 2015, the EPA issued its response, identifying ten documents that were responsive to H &amp; A's request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA Response, Ex. C to Renewed Decl. of Deborah Nagle, ECF No. 43-4, at 2-3.) Based on the EPA's Vaughn Index (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vaughn Index, Ex. K to Renewed Decl. of Deborah Nagle, ECF No. 43-12, at 2-16), as well as this Court's review of the unredacted versions of these records, those ten documents are generally described as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Document 1 is an email that was transmitted to a number of EPA officials on November 15, 2013, suggesting a meeting, with the subject line \"Iowa League of Cities.\" Document 1(a), also dated November 15, 2013, is an early draft of talking points discussing the implications of the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision and possible approaches\n   that the EPA could take in light of that decision. Document 1(b) is a draft memorandum that further discusses how\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   could impact the EPA's regulations and its future decision-making activities. Document 2 is an email sent from Nancy Stoner to EPA staff members and attorneys on November 14, 2013, discussing the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision, and Document 3 is an email from November 15, 2013 in response. Document 4 is an email exchange between assorted employees at EPA Headquarters, dated November 18, 2013, transmitting certain other documents-(Documents 4(a) and 4(b) )-to supervisors at EPA Headquarters. Document 4(a) is a subsequent version of Document 1(a), while Document 4(b) consists of a draft document that discusses various regulatory approaches that the EPA can take in regulating water quality. Document 5 is a days-long email chain (spanning November 15 through 18) among various EPA employees and attorneys, regarding how the agency's eventual views on\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   should be communicated to the public. Finally, Document 6 is a series of emails, dated November 26, 2013, among staff members of the EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance within the Office of Water, that discusses comments that Nancy Stoner made at a seminar on November 20, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the context of the instant lawsuit, the EPA has asserted that FOIA Exemption 5-and in particular, the attorney-client and deliberative-process privileges-apply to the contents of these ten documents, in whole or in part, and as a result, the agency has released one document in full,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   withheld two documents in full, and produced seven others with partial redactions. (Renewed Decl. of Deborah Nagle, ECF No. 43-1, \u00b6 9.) In response, H &amp; A launched an administrative appeal, where it met with partial success. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appeal Letter, Ex. E to Renewed Decl. of Deborah Nagle, ECF No. 43-6, at 2-8; Appeal Determination, Ex. F to Renewed Decl. of Deborah Nagle, ECF No. 43-7, at 2-4.) Even so, the EPA continued to withhold two documents in full and portions of seven other documents, relying upon the deliberative-process privilege to justify its withholdings in Documents 1(a), 1(b), 2, 3, 4, 4(a), 4(b), 5, and 6, and also the attorney-client privilege to support its withholdings in Documents 1(b), 2, 3, and 5. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Renewed Decl. of Deborah Nagle \u00b6\u00b6 10-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appeal Determination at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   H &amp; A filed the instant lawsuit on July 6, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.) The parties have now filed cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to H &amp; A's claim that the EPA has wrongfully withheld agency records in violation of the FOIA, and these motions ripened on October 21, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply in Supp. of Its Mot. for Summ. J. &amp; Opp'n to Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ J. (\"Def.'s Reply\"), ECF No. 54; Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Its Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. &amp; Mot. for Leave to Amend Its Compl. (\"Pl.'s Reply\"), ECF No. 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the main, as mentioned above, the parties' summary judgment briefs present granular arguments regarding whether or not the EPA correctly invoked Exemption 5's attorney-client and deliberative-process privileges to withhold information contained in nine documents. Significantly, the EPA insists that its withholdings are proper primarily because it has not yet made a decision as to whether or not it\n   will apply the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   on a nationwide basis (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 5; Def.'s Reply at 4, 20), which it says means that most of the withheld information is predecisional and deliberative, for the purposes of the deliberative-process privilege, and the agency further claims that some of the documents also enjoy the protection of the attorney-client privilege, because they contain confidential communications between EPA staff members and agency attorneys (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 17-23; Def.'s Reply at 7-20). For its part, H &amp; A argues that the EPA has, in fact, made a nonacquiescence decision, and according to H &amp; A, the agency did so in August of 2013, when the agency decided not to seek certiorari in the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 27; Pl.'s Reply at 4-7.) Thus, H &amp; A argues that the documents that the EPA has withheld in this case constitute the working law of the agency and cannot be withheld under either the deliberative-process or attorney-client privileges. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 23-29; Pl.'s Reply at 16-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   H &amp; A has also filed a number of ancillary motions, one of which maintains that the EPA conducted an unreasonable search for records in response to H &amp; A's request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Am./Correct Compl., ECF No. 46.) Because H &amp; A seeks to make this allegation now, for the first time in the history of this FOIA dispute, H &amp; A's motion seeks permission to amend the complaint to add a search-related claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) This Court denied that motion in its Order of March 31, 2018; here the Court explains that the motion was denied because H &amp; A's search claim was never raised with the agency and thus is manifestly unexhausted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiBacco v. U.S. Army\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786744,4288809\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/178/\">\n    795 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (D.C.

Cir. 2015) (\"Requiring [the plaintiff] to follow up with the [agency] before filing suit is consistent with, indeed essential to, accomplishing the 'purposes of exhaustion[.]' \"). The Court addresses H &amp; A's other ancillary motions-which, in essence, seek to punish the EPA because H &amp; A believes that the EPA has litigated this case in bad faith (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 38-40; Pl.'s Reply at 19-20)-below. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.D,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   (analyzing H &amp; A's joint motion to strike and motion for discovery (ECF No. 47), and addressing the implicit request for sanctions to be imposed against the EPA's attorneys).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Record Before The Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To substantiate their respective contentions about the EPA's alleged nonacquiescence decision, the parties have produced a plethora of affidavits and exhibits. The documents that have been submitted to the Court-which include unredacted copies of various records responsive to H &amp; A's FOIA requests-demonstrate that, beginning in the summer of 2013, the staff at EPA headquarters actively discussed how the agency should respond to the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision of March 25, 2013, both inside and outside of the Eighth Circuit. The discussion appears to have commenced in earnest in July, when the EPA considered whether or not to seek a writ of certiorari in the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA July 31, 2013, Email, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Mem., ECF No. 44-3, at 12.) The parties here hotly contest when, if at all, the 'what-shall-we-do' period of discussion\n   <em>\n    ended\n   </em>\n   . As for the nature of the discussion, public documents reflect that EPA employees specifically debated, among other things, whether the agency should \"formally or informally non-acquiesce\" or should otherwise undertake to adopt \"any formal position on the 8th Circuit's substantive conclusions[.]\" (EPA's Oct. 29, 2013, \"ILOC Next Steps\" (\"Next Steps\n   Memo\"), Ex. 8 to Pl.'s Mem., ECF No. 44-3, at 42;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   EPA's Oct. 29, 2013, \"Moving Forward\" Action Plan, Ex. 9 to Pl.'s Mem., ECF No. 44-3, at 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Notably, in mid-November of 2013, EPA officials began to make a series of public statements regarding the agency's post-\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   approach to blending. These statements were issued in a variety of contexts: for example, at an EPA-led conference relating to the regulation of clean water practices that took place on November 13, 2013, a member of the EPA's Office of General Counsel stated that the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision will \"only be binding to the Eighth Circuit [s]tates[.]\" (7th Annual 4-State Gov. Affairs Meeting Minutes, Ex. 11 to Pl.'s Mem., ECF No. 44-3, at 80.) Yet, EPA Headquarters staff members at that conference also indicated that it still \"[did not] have everything figured out yet\" with regard to its post-\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   approach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, on November 19, 2013, the EPA released a written \"Desk Statement\" (i.e., a press release) to Bloomberg News in anticipation of the agency's subsequent National Association of Clean Water Act (\"NACWA\") law seminar. That Desk Statement stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [t]he Eighth Circuit's interpretation in [\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   ] ... is legally binding within the Eighth Circuit.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In their summary judgment motions, the parties dispute whether the EPA can withhold information contained in nine documents under Exemption 5's deliberative-process or attorney-client privileges. Broadly speaking, this debate revolves around whether the EPA has ever made a decision to nonacquiesce with respect to the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   , and if the EPA did so,\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   the agency can be said to have made that decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 24-25 (calling this the \"linchpin issue\" in the case).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Given the mix of information and contentions that are presented in this case, this Court's evaluation has proceeded as follows. The Court has, first, evaluated whether or not the EPA can withhold the contested records under Exemption 5's deliberative-process privilege; then, for any documents that are not protected by the deliberative-process privilege but that the EPA maintains are subject to the attorney-client privilege, the Court has proceeded to determine whether the attorney-client privilege applies. After thereby identifying the universe of documents that fall within Exemption 5's ambit, the Court has further assessed whether the EPA must nonetheless disclose the privileged documents and information, either because they constitute the working law of the agency or because the EPA has officially acknowledged the contents of these records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As explained fully below, this multi-step analytical journey has led the Court to conclude as follows: the EPA must disclose Documents 4 and 6 in their entirety as well as isolated statements contained in Documents 1(a) and 1(b), but the agency may continue to withhold all of the redacted material in Documents 2, 3, 4(a), 4(b), and 5 and most of the redacted material within Documents 1(a) and 1(b).

As explained, \"nonacquiescence\" is generally considered to be \"[t]he selective refusal of administrative agencies to conduct their internal proceedings consistently with adverse rulings of the courts of appeals.\" Estreicher &amp; Revesz, 98 Yale L.J. at 681 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 687 (noting that \"intercircuit nonacquiescence\"-the type at issue in the instant case-occurs when an agency \"refuses to follow, in its administrative proceedings, the case law of a court of appeals other than the one that will review the agency's decision\").

On that date, the EPA issued a Desk Statement, which explained that, although the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   opinion was \"legally binding within the Eighth Circuit[,] [o]utside of the Eighth Circuit, [the] EPA will continue to work with States and communities with the goal of finding solutions that protect public health and the environment\" in a manner that is \"\n   <em>\n    consistent with the Agency's existing interpretation of the regulations\n   </em>\n   .\" (Desk Statement at 41 (emphasis added).) This language clearly indicated that the EPA was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   committing to applying the Eighth Circuit's holding nationwide. Instead, outside of the Eighth Circuit, the EPA intended to follow its existing interpretation of its regulations, which the the Eighth Circuit had struck down in\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   . What is more, the EPA effectively authorized Bloomberg News to release the statement to the public at large, and thus represent to the relevant regulated parties that the agency intended to nonacquiesce outside of the Eighth Circuit.

First of all, as noted, the statement differentiating between agency policy inside and outside the Eighth Circuit was publicly released. It also appears that the announced policy had the full approval of Nancy Stoner, who was the EPA's Acting Assistant Administrator for Water, as well as Cynthia Giles, the former Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transmittal Emails at 103.) Both of these high-level EPA officials signed off on the release of the Desk Statement by the agency's Office of Media Relations, after a number of agency attorneys and staffers working on matters relating to the EPA's post-\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   approach proposed the language contained therein. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 103-108.) And during the NACWA conference, which took place the day after the statement\n   was issued, Stoner orally confirmed that the agency will apply the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   ruling on a case-by-case basis outside of the Eighth Circuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bloomberg BNA Article at 43.) All things considered then, as of November 19 and November 20, 2013, it was reasonably clear to all concerned that the EPA did not intend to apply the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision across the board.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Envtl. Dev. Ass'n's Clean Air Project\n   </em>\n   , 752 F.3d at 1010-11 (concluding that a formal announcement of a case-by-case approach constituted a nonacquiescence decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The EPA does not present any non-conclusory evidence to the contrary. The agency has provided a declaration from Deborah Nagle that states that the \"EPA has not, to date, decided whether and to what extent to follow\n   <em>\n    Iowa League\n   </em>\n   outside the Eighth Circuit\" (Suppl. Nagle Decl., ECF No. 54-1, \u00b6 5 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) ), but this bald contention does not follow from the record facts and the plain language of the announcement that the agency made publically regarding its position, which indicate the opposite. The EPA is also mistaken to suggest that an expressed intention to proceed on a \"case-by-case basis\" does not amount to nonacquiescence. (Def.'s Mem. at 28.) To be sure, the agency has left itself room to choose to adopt the Eighth Circuit's ruling in individual cases in the future, in the context of its expressed intention to consider \"solutions that protect public health and the environment\" for communities outside the Eighth Circuit. (Desk Statement at 41.) But\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   requires the EPA to abandon the improperly prescribed rule that the agency now says it may choose to apply nonetheless outside of the Eighth Circuit in appropriate cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805406\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/844/\">\n    711 F.3d at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So the EPA's reservation of the right to proceed \"consistent with the Agency's existing interpretation\" outside of the Eighth Circuit on a case-by-case basis (Desk Statement at 41), necessarily means that the agency has refused to commit to applying\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   as its policy in all jurisdictions, which is all that intercircuit nonacquiescence requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Estreicher &amp; Revesz, 98 Yale L.J. at 687 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taxation With Representation Fund, Taxation With Representation Fund v.

Instead, H &amp; A maintains that the EPA actually demonstrated nonacquiescence when it decided not to seek\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   on August 20, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 27.) But it is well established in this jurisdiction that a\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   decision and a nonacquiescence determination are not one and the same. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has made clear that an agency's decision to seek certiorari stands completely apart from a nonacquiescence determination.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taxation With Representation Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5689104,1217958\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/666/\">\n    646 F.2d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the decision to seek a writ of certiorari and the decision to nonacquiesce are determined separately). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   EPA Options Memo, Ex. 3 to Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 44-3, at 15 (indicating that the EPA knew it had the option to acquiesce or nonacquiesce, even if it did not seek certiorari).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   H &amp; A's contention that, \"in late October [2013], [the] EPA determined specifically how it would nonacquiesce\" (Pl.'s Mem. at 27), is similarly off base. The EPA did not make an announcement that it intended to nonacquiesce at that time, as it did in mid-November,\n   and the evidence H &amp; A points to does not actually indicate that the EPA engaged in a silent effort to implement a nonacquiescence policy with respect to its permitting decisions as of late October. Rather, the record demonstrates that the EPA was still debating whether or not it should nonacquiesce to the Eighth Circuit's decision in late October. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Next Steps Memo at 42 (noting several options available to the EPA, including \"not tak[ing] any formal position on the 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit's substantive conclusions\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The statement that an EPA official made at the Region VII Meeting, on November 13, 2013, also falls short of the nonacquiescence target. To be sure, on that day, one of EPA Headquarters' attorneys stated publicly that the Eighth Circuit's decision \"will only be binding to the Eighth Circuit [s]tates.\" (Region VII Meeting Minutes at 80.) But that statement can reasonably be interpreted as the mere recitation of a known fact: a decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals does not \"bind\" the EPA outside of the Eighth Circuit. The relevant question is whether or not the agency intended to apply the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of the Eight Circuit, and, based on the record, the attorney does not appear to have made a clear proclamation on\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   point during the Region VII meeting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5689104,1217958\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/666/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bergman Decl. in Supp. of Pl.'s Br., Ex. 13 to Pl.'s Mem., ECF No. 44-4, at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) To the contrary, the representation that the EPA \"[did not] have everything figured out yet\" was made, and, at most, the meeting involved \"speculation by non-regulatory attendees that the ruling could [ ] have national implications[.]\" (Region VII Meeting Minutes at 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Therefore, in this Court's view, the record in this case simply does not establish that the EPA made a formal announcement regarding the agency's intentions to acquiesce or nonacquiesce before the issuance of its Desk Statement on November 19, 2013, much less that it deliberately and pervasively disregarded the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision in its permitting decisions outside the Eighth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stieberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7391363\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/738/716/#p728\">\n    738 F.Supp. at 728-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that these are the two ways in which a Plaintiff can establish an agency has made a nonacquiescence decision).

Most of the disputed documents are dated emails or memoranda, and it is obvious that Documents 1(a), 1(b), 2, 3, 4, 4(a), 4(b), and 5 were created before the EPA's nonacquiescence decision of November 19, 2013. Furthermore, based on the Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the disputed records and the EPA's Vaughn Index, each of these documents qualifies as predecisional insofar as each was \"part of a clear process leading to a final decision\" by the EPA regarding whether it would nonacquiesce to the Eighth Circuit's decision.\n   <em>\n    Coastal States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub.

But that fact alone does not render these documents non-deliberative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

In Documents 2 and 3, Stoner and a member of the Office of General Counsel provide advice regarding how staff members at EPA headquarters can focus their discussions with respect to the EPA's post-\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   response. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Unredacted Documents 2, 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Vaughn Index at 6-7.) Meanwhile, the redacted portions of Document 5 mostly discuss how the agency ought to proceed in \"determining the Agency's public messages on [ ] issues\" relating to the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision. (Vaughn Index at 13 (describing the redacted contents of Document 5).) In other words, all three documents entail \"proposals\" or \"suggestions\" as to how the EPA should proceed with respect to discussions and communications about the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision,\n   <em>\n    Coastal States\n   </em>\n   , 617 F.2d at 866, and it is well settled that the deliberative-process privilege protects such \"advisory material[s,]\" because they \"contain[ ] opinions and recommendations\" as to how the agency should handle various matters,\n   <em>\n    Mead Data\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    566 F.2d at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The only document left to be discussed is Document 4, and upon review of an unredacted version of that record, this Court concludes that the deliberative-process privilege does not apply to any part of that document. The lone redacted statement in that document does not reflect a subjective or personal opinion that contributed to the government's deliberations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Unredacted Document 4.) Indeed, as\n   far as the Court can tell, the redaction concerns merely factual and historical information, and thus, the EPA is not entitled to withhold that same information in this context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   , 617 F.2d at 790. Nor does the Court believe that this information is so intertwined with the agency's deliberative process that the release of this information \"would discourage candid discussion within the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Access Reports\n   </em>\n   , 926 F.2d at 1195 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the redaction in Document 4 is not subject to withholding pursuant to the deliberative-process privilege, and because the EPA does not contend that the redacted information is privileged or exempted on any other ground, the EPA must disclose Document 4 in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Attorney-Client Privilege Does Not Apply To Any Portion Of Document 1(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At this point in the analysis, this Court has determined that Documents 4 and 6 and small portions of Documents 1(a) and 1(b) are not protected by the deliberative-process privilege. With respect to these withholdings, the EPA has provided an alternative argument for privilege only as to Document 1(b); therefore, the Court now turns to an analysis of whether the attorney-client privilege shields any portion of Document 1(b) from discovery, as the EPA maintains. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the attorney-client privilege to apply, an agency must demonstrate that the document or statement that the FOIA requester seeks satisfies three criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor Energy Co. v.

First, the information that the agency seeks to withhold must have been \"communicated to or by an attorney as part of a professional relationship[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    566 F.2d at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which means that the attorney \"act[ed] like a lawyer\" and the communication between the lawyer and the client involved securing an \"opinion on law[,] legal services[,] or [ ] assistance in some legal proceeding[,]\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lindsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11678500,2338943\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/1263/\">\n    158 F.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1270 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (citation omitted). Second, the information in the document must also be \"confidential[,]\" and lastly, it must be \"based on confidential information provided by the client[,]\" not by third parties.\n   <em>\n    Mead Data\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    566 F.2d at 253-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Because this Court has already concluded that the deliberative-process privilege shields most of the information in Document 1(b) for which the EPA has invoked the attorney-client privilege, the Court need only evaluate the information\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   covered by the deliberative-process privilege-i.e., the redacted paragraph immediately above the heading \"\n   <strong>\n    1. Background\n   </strong>\n   \" in Document 1(b). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.2,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .) With regard to that redaction, this Court concludes that the attorney-client privilege does not apply for at least two reasons. First of all, although the draft memo that is Document 1(b) was transmitted to at least one attorney at the EPA (along with other staff members) for his review and opinion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vaughn Index at 2, 4-5; Unredacted Document 1), there is no indication that the client-sender ever intended the memoranda that contains the redacted information to be confidential. Second, and similarly, the redaction itself pertains to information regarding the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   case that is readily known to the public at large; thus, it is not itself \"confidential information provided by the client,\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    566 F.2d at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and otherwise public information does not become confidential solely by virtue of its having been communicated to a lawyer as the basis for seeking legal advice. Put another way, it was no secret that EPA officials were evaluating the \"implications\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   of\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   on the agency's programs, and in so doing, were discussing the facts of that case. (Vaughn Index at 5.) And far from revealing any confidential information, the redacted statement reflects nothing more than those discussions. Therefore, neither the deliberative-process privilege nor the attorney-client privilege applies to that redacted statement, and the EPA shall release the contents of that statement to H &amp; A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    C. With One Exception, Neither The Working Law Doctrine Nor The Official Acknowledgment Doctrine Compels Disclosure Of The Privileged Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Having established that the EPA properly invoked the deliberative-process privilege with respect to the vast majority of the documents and statements at issue in this case, this Court must now consider whether or not the information the agency has withheld must nevertheless be disclosed, either because it is the \"working law\" of the agency (Pl.'s Mem. at 21), or because the EPA has already officially acknowledged the information contained in these records (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36). For the reasons that follow, this Court finds that neither doctrine applies, except as to one portion of Document 1(b), which the EPA has officially acknowledged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    None Of The Disputed Documents Constitute The Working Law Of The Agency\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The D.C. Circuit has adopted and regularly applied the \"working law\" doctrine, which, in essence, maintains that there is \"no legitimate policy interest of the government\" in withholding any document that \"in practice represent[s] interpretations of established policy on which the agency relies in discharging its regulatory responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal States\n   </em>\n   , 617 F.2d at 869.

Therefore, at this point, the only remaining question is whether or not the EPA has transformed the documents at issue into the working law of the agency by using them to guide the agency's regulatory actions after its nonacquiescence decision on November 19, 2013. Based on the Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the disputed documents, the EPA's sworn affidavits, and the lack of any evidence contradicting those documents and affidavits, this Court concludes that the EPA has carried its burden in demonstrating that it has not used these predecisional and deliberative documents in adjudicating cases that implicate the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   decision (e.g., in the agency's water permitting decisions),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schlefer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848009,3640715\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/233/\">\n    702 F.2d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nor does it treat these documents as an \"interpretation of [a set of laws] generally\" that \"reflects the agency's considered position on a precise issue,\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699440,9408183\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/71/\">\n    294 F.3d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, and if anything, the EPA's working law with respect to the Eighth Circuit's opinion is reflected in the documents that the EPA has already publicly released. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   February 19, 2014 ILOC Strategy Document, Ex. 27 to Pl.'s Mem, ECF No. 44-4, at 91 (explaining the EPA's case-by-case approach for permitting decisions outside the Eighth Circuit); Desk Statement at 41 (functioning as a general statement of policy as to how the\n   EPA intends to proceed in light of the\n   <em>\n    Iowa League\n   </em>\n   decision).) Furthermore, the Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the disputed documents reveals that these documents do not explain the agency's policy rationale for why it decided to pursue a nonacquiescence policy.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p152\">\n    421 U.S. at 152-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p152\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the reasons which did supply the basis for an agency policy actually adopted\" also constitute the working law of the agency).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   H &amp; A's arguments relating to the \"working law\" doctrine are not to the contrary. As it acknowledges, documents that are properly deemed predecisional and deliberative do not qualify as the working law of the agency, absent some indication that the agency has later adopted these documents in its adjudications or policy statements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 19.) So, the question of whether the EPA is withholding documents that represent the agency's working law with respect to nonacquiescence necessarily turns on the \"linchpin issue\" of\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   the EPA made its nonacquiescence decision (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25), which is the same issue that this Court addressed in Part III.A.1 above. Of course, H &amp; A disagrees with the Court's conclusions as to when the relevant nonacquiescence decision occurred, and thus it disagrees that the records in this case are predecisional as opposed to the working law of the agency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 27.) But H &amp; A does not contend that the Court's working law analysis is wrong on any independent ground, nor does it contend that the EPA so relies upon the information in these records when adjudicating permitting decisions that this otherwise deliberative and predecisional material has lost its privileged status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The EPA Has Officially Acknowledged Some Of The Redacted Portions Of Document 1(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   One other potential avenue for the divestment of privileged records is at issue in this case. As noted above, it is possible for an agency to\n   <em>\n    waive\n   </em>\n   its right to withhold a privileged document by officially and publicly acknowledging the information contained within that record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cottone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563272,3671225\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/550/\">\n    193 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   554 ;\n   <em>\n    Higgins v.

Notably, however, the official acknowledgement doctrine only applies in the relatively unusual circumstance in which an agency has publically disclosed \"the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   information sought by the plaintiff[,]\" and the doctrine does not apply if the information sought is merely similar to the requested document or statement.\n   <em>\n    ACLU v.

Cir. 2011). So, for example, the D.C. Circuit has held that where (1) a FOIA plaintiff sought audiotapes of wiretap recordings that government prosecutors had played at a public trial and had moved into evidence, and (2) the plaintiff identified the name, date, and time for each of these tapes in his FOIA request, the defending agency could not withhold the requested tapes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cottone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563272,3671225\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/550/\">\n    193 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the redacted statements following the \"From\" and \"To\" headings on page one of that document exactly match information that the EPA previously released in response to another of H &amp; A's FOIA requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Partial EPA FOIA Response to Scope of ILOC Request, Ex. 6 to Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 44-3, at 33.) The EPA's prior FOIA response constitutes an official and documented disclosure, because the information was previously \"disclosed and preserved in a permanent public record.\"\n   <em>\n    Students Against Genocide v.

And because it is the same information that was previously disclosed (word-for-word), the redacted information is every bit as specific as the prior disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   By contrast, it is not clear to this court that the EPA has officially acknowledged any of the redacted contents of Document 4(b). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 36.) Although the EPA has previously discussed parts of that document \"during a public workshop ... and with Mr. Mike Tate\" of the \"Kansas Department of Health and Water,\" the agency avers that it has not publicly discussed the redacted information within this document (Vaughn Index at 12), and H &amp; A has not provided any evidence that refutes this account. Indeed, H &amp; A merely asserts that the EPA has previously spoken to Mike Tate about this document on a telephone call. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 36.) But even taken as true, those facts are not sufficient to carry H &amp; A's burden of demonstrating that the information provided to Mike Tate or individuals attending the public workshop is as specific as, or matches, the information that the EPA has redacted from Document 4(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk Int'l, Inc. v.

Therefore, while the previously acknowledged material in Document 1(b) cannot be withheld, H &amp; A's claim that the EPA has officially acknowledged the information within the redacted portions of Document 4(b) fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

But this Court's reading of the record and its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the documents in this case do not indicate that the EPA has acted in bad faith in this case or with respect to the proceedings that underlie it. Instead, it appears that the EPA has simply failed to appreciate that the sentiment conveyed in the Desk Statement that the agency issued on November 19, 2013-i.e., that the EPA will continue to follow its existing interpretation of its regulations in jurisdictions outside the Eighth Circuit-counts as a nonacquiescence determination, and this misunderstanding on the agency's part more than amply explains why the EPA has consistently maintained that its records relating to this decision can be withheld under Exemption 5. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Suppl.

Even more to the point, in this court's view, an earnestly held but mistaken view of the law, or a genuine miscalculation of the strength of one's legal arguments, rarely, if ever, evinces bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moffat v.

Indeed, as a result of various FOIA requests, H &amp; A received many of the records it originally sought, and the EPA's willingness to disclose these responsive non-exempt documents once it found them and identified them belies H &amp; A's claim that the EPA has acted in bad faith. Thus, the agency's own record of general responsiveness supports its contention that it has made a good faith effort to satisfy its obligations under the FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meeropol v.

One of the documents that H &amp; A submitted as an exhibit states that the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") once \"caution[ed]\" the EPA that \"any formal expression of non-acquiescence runs the risk of a challenge.\" (Next Steps Memo at 42.) H &amp; A seizes upon this statement as evidence that the EPA has sought to hide its nonacquiescence decision and to deceive the public and the courts about how it currently administers and enforces water permitting decisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 38-39.) However, any clear-eyed assessment of that particular statement reveals that it is also susceptible to a relatively benign meaning. Far from only making a nefarious suggestion that the EPA should act deliberately to conceal its position regarding\n   <em>\n    Iowa League of Cities\n   </em>\n   , it is certainly plausible that DOJ was merely advising the agency of the real-world consequences that might result from a formal nonacquiescence decision. In other words, the EPA might well have been weighing its options regarding whether or not to pursue nonacquiescence, and not mulling various means to prevent the discovery of a secret nonacquiescence policy. And even if this suggestion \"reflects poorly upon [the] EPA\" and DOJ,\n   <em>\n    Landmark Legal Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269390\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/82/211/#p218\">\n    82 F.Supp.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this ambiguity is enough to keep the Court from reaching the conclusion that they EPA acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In the absence of a clear showing of bad faith, the Court sees no reason to grant the miscellaneous motions that H &amp; A has filed.
