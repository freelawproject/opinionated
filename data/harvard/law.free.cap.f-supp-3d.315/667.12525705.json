(\"CitySide\"). Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (\"the SEC\" or \"the Commission\") contends that defendant Richard Weed (\"Weed\" or \"defendant\"), an attorney, together with two former stockbrokers, Coleman Flaherty (\"Flaherty\") and Thomas Brazil (\"Brazil\"), committed securities fraud in connection with the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court were (1) the SEC's motion for partial summary judgment on the SEC's first, second, fourth, fifth and sixth claims for relief (Docket No. 69) and (2) Weed's motion for partial summary judgment on the SEC's third claim for relief (Docket No. 73). By order of the Court (Docket No. 105) entered on May 10, 2018, the SECs motion was allowed and Weed's motion was denied, with the notation that an explanatory memorandum and order (\"M &amp; O\") would follow. This is that M &amp; O.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brazil and Flaherty are former stockbrokers who ran several iterations of the pump-and-dump scheme with the assistance of Weed. Flaherty controlled a public shell company, UpTurn. In 2009, the owner of CitySide, a sporting event ticket broker, proposed that Flaherty make an investment in CitySide. Flaherty counter-proposed a reverse merger as a result of which CitySide would become a publicly-traded company after a merger with the public shell company, UpTurn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Brazil and Flaherty participated in the reverse merger deal and Weed performed the legal work necessary to complete the merger. As a result of the merger, Flaherty and Brazil held debt in CitySide, in the form of promissory notes, which could be converted into shares of CitySide stock. To facilitate the reverse merger, Weed completed legal work, including 1) a name change application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"), 2) the paperwork for the reverse stock split, 3) the issuing of a controlling share block to CitySide's owner and 4) the conversion of the promissory notes into shares that were freely tradable (\"unrestricted\") securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the merger, Flaherty and Brazil arranged for stock promoters to issue favorable press releases about CitySide in order to inflate the value of CitySide stock. Weed accomplished the conversion of the promissory notes held by Brazil and Flaherty into share certificates that were deposited into brokerage firms for trading and which allowed Flaherty and Brazil to execute sales of the certificates after the value of the stock was inflated. In a conversation that was recorded, Weed told Flaherty (who was cooperating with federal law enforcement agents at the time) \"the deals are all vapor, and they cannot sustain themselves for six weeks\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In order to facilitate the conversion of the notes into freely tradable shares, Weed wrote legal opinion letters to transfer agents of CitySide who were responsible for issuing new securities and recording changes in ownership of securities. In those letters, Weed opined that the transfer agent could lawfully allow the issuance of unrestricted shares of stock under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.144\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He represented to the transfer agents that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [n]one of the persons who have elected to convert [their] notes into common stock are affiliates of the [i]ssuer and none of these persons have been affiliates during the preceding three months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The recipients of the shares were, in fact, Flaherty or nominees of Flaherty and Brazil, all affiliates of the issuing company. Flaherty sold approximately $1.3 million of CitySide stock after his notes were converted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The SEC filed the civil complaint in this action on November 6, 2014 against Weed, Flaherty and Brazil alleging six violations of the securities laws. The following month, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Weed with criminal violations of Section 10(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) &amp; 78ff, and Rule 10b-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 as well as conspiracy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and wire fraud,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That conviction was affirmed in October, 2017 by the First Circuit Court of Appeals (\"the First Circuit\") and Weed's\n   petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court in May, 2018. This Court had previously entered a consent judgment as to Brazil and Flaherty in October, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The SEC and Weed filed motions for partial summary judgment in March, 2018.

SEC's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The SEC contends that Weed is collaterally estopped from disputing the facts that form the basis of his criminal conviction. The Commission asserts that the factual underpinnings of those convictions are sufficient to establish the necessary elements of violations of the securities laws alleged in this civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Weed responds that collateral estoppel is inapplicable here because he did not have a full and fair opportunity to defend himself in the criminal proceeding. He claims that the government failed to produce exculpatory evidence for his trial counsel, rendering his conviction constitutionally infirm. Further, Weed contends that the factual issues that formed the basis of the criminal conviction are not identical to the SEC's claims in this civil action. Finally, he suggests that, with respect the sixth claim, collateral estoppel cannot apply because the factual allegations supporting that claim were not essential to the judgment in the criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Collateral estoppel bars the re-litigation of any factual or legal issue that was actually decided in previous litigation on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case.\n   <em>\n    Keystone Shipping Co. v.

A party seeking to invoke collateral estoppel must establish that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) the issue sought to be precluded in the later action is the same as that involved in the earlier action; (2) the issue was actually litigated; (3) the issue was determined by a valid and binding\n   final judgment; and (4) the determination of the issue was essential to the judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Ramallo Bros.

Full and fair litigation of criminal proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Weed's contention that he did not have a \"full and fair\" opportunity to litigate the issues in his criminal proceeding is unconvincing. He suggests that the government in the criminal proceeding failed to produce certain exculpatory evidence, rendering the trial unfair and he has filed post-trial motions advancing that argument in the criminal proceeding. He maintains that, at the very least, the Court should refrain from applying collateral estoppel until the judicial officer presiding over the criminal proceeding has adjudicated Weed's motion to compel production of the alleged exculpatory evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Since the date of the filing of Weed's memoranda in opposition to the SEC's motion for partial summary judgment, the motion to compel in the criminal proceeding has been denied.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weed\n   </em>\n   , 14-cr-10348-DPW, ECF No. 242 (April 9, 2018).

Section 5 of the Securities Act makes it unlawful for anyone seeking to sell a security to do so without registering that security unless certain exemptions apply. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e. At issue here is the Section 3(a)(9) exemption of\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   any security exchanged by the issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   15 U.C.C. \u00a7 77c(a)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In its third claim, the SEC alleges that Weed, along with Flaherty and Brazil, violated Section 5 by selling or offering to sell CitySide securities that were not registered with the SEC. Weed contends that those securities were exempt from the registration requirement because Section 3(a)(9) should be read to apply to a class of securities rather than to a transaction involving a single security. He suggests that, because the initial conversion of debt into common stock was exempted, that exemption is perpetuated as to any future transactions involving that security. Pursuing that interpretation to its logical conclusion, whenever a promissory note is exchanged for a share of stock, the resulting share would forever be exempt from the registration\n   requirements of Section 5. Unfortunately for Weed and notwithstanding his vehement insistence to the contrary, that is not the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Weed attempts to import the title and preamble of the statute, referencing exemptions to \"classes of securities\", to alter the plain meaning of Section (3)(a)(9). He suggests that, because the exemptions apply to classes of securities, once a security is exempt, it retains its exempt status in a subsequent transaction. The plain text of Section 3(a)(9), however, exempts \"any security exchanged by the issuer with its existing securities holders\" rather than any security that has ever been or once was exchanged by the issuer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Summit Inv. &amp; Dev.

Weed's reading of the exemption would undermine the statutory registration scheme. To avoid the registration requirements under Section 5, a company would simply need to arrange for the exchange of a security for another kind of security, rendering the registration scheme a nullity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burwell\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590981\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2480/#p2489\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2489,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590981\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2480/#p2489\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\"[W]hen deciding whether the language is plain, we must read the words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\") (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Weed makes much of the fact that the Section 3(a)(9) exemption was transferred from Section 4, which explicitly refers to \"transactions\" rather than \"classes of securities\", to Section 3 in 1934.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Section 4(3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%2074\">\n    48 Stat. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c(a)(9). As the SEC clarifies, however, both the conference report to the 1934 amendments and the SEC analysis of the amendments confirm that the purpose of that transfer was to clarify that the registration requirements apply to dealers, a contested issue that had arisen after enactment of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. 73-1838, at 40 (1934);\n   <em>\n    Letters of [SEC] Gen. Counsel Discussing Application of Section 3(a)(9)\n   </em>\n   , Securities Act Release No. 646,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1936%20WL%2031995\">\n    1936 WL 31995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (1936). In conclusion, both the plain language and the statutory purpose lead this Court to reject Weed's novel reading of the Section 3(a)(9) exemption. Accordingly, Weed's motion for partial summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the SEC's motion for partial summary judgment (Docket No. 69) is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED\n   </strong>\n   and Weed's motion for partial summary judgment (Docket No. 73) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    So ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
