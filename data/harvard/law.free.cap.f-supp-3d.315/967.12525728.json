On May 22, 2017, the parties executed their most recent licensing agreement (\"2017 License Agreement\" or \"the Agreement\") for TheBlaze to air Plaintiff's programs. The 2017 License Agreement governs the relationship between Plaintiff and TheBlaze, provides details about airing Plaintiff's programs and advertising, and contains a mandatory arbitration provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that in 2018 Cardon aimed to destroy the relationship between Shipman and TheBlaze, rejected advertisements from Plaintiff's sponsors, and refused to provide Shipman two minutes of commercial airtime. Plaintiff alleges that contrary to its promises TheBlaze never ran banner ads on its website or promoted Plaintiff's shows on television, radio, or social media. Plaintiff and TheBlaze began negotiating a license agreement for 2018, but on February 21, 2018, TheBlaze informed Plaintiff that it would not enter into a 2018 license agreement. On March 5, 2018, Plaintiff sent TheBlaze a notice of termination of the 2017 License Agreement. Plaintiff alleges that \"[d]espite the fact that its license has been terminated, the Blaze is continuing to air Shipman's shows and willfully infringe The Registered Trademarks on television and on digital media.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Cardon has defamed Plaintiff to its sponsors, causing the companies to cancel their sponsorships of Plaintiff's programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action on March 12, 2018, and filed its First Amended Complaint on April 13, 2018, seeking damages, permanent injunctive relief, and other appropriate costs and relief as the court deems appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants have moved to stay this action and to require Plaintiff to arbitrate its claims with Defendants pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and the Texas General Arbitration Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants argue that because the 2017 License Agreement contained a valid arbitration provision and that because Plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of that provision, the court should stay the action and compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff responds that no arbitration agreement exists as to the unexecuted 2018 License Agreement, that the arbitration provision in the 2017 License Agreement is illusory and unconscionable, and that Plaintiff's claims fall outside the scope of the arbitration provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
