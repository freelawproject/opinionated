Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Caryl Quashie is a resident of the State of Georgia. Dkt. 21 at \u00b6 10. She alleges that she suffered a serious bacterial infection because of a defective medical instrument known as a duodenoscope that was used on her during a procedure at Emory Johns Creek Hospital in Johns Creek, Georgia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Plaintiff filed her complaint against Olympus America Inc., Olympus Corporation of the Americas, Olympus Medical Systems Corporation, and Olympus Corporation claiming that each was responsible for the design, testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale, and distribution of the defective duodenoscope.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-43. Defendants Olympus Medical Systems Corporation and Olympus Corporation-both incorporated and headquartered in Japan-move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Dkts. 27, 28). All Defendants move to dismiss the Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim. (Dkts. 29, 30, 31, 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The medical device at issue is the Olympus TJF-Q180V Duodenoscope, an endoscope equipped with a camera and light that a doctor can feed through a patient's\n   mouth, throat, and stomach into the duodenum to view the patient's liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and bile ducts. Dkt. 21 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 46-49. Duodenoscopes are reusable from patient to patient, but must be adequately cleaned to avoid infection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. Earlier versions of the Olympus duodenoscopes were designed with an open channel into which the doctor inserted a guidewire and catheter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 51-52. Olympus enclosed this channel on the Q180V by using an O-ring that allegedly prevents the leakage of tissue and fluids into the channel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-57. Plaintiff contends that Olympus used this design change to market, advertise, and promote the Q180V as safer, with a lower risk of microbial infection.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the closed-channel design was defective in several ways. She claims, for example, that the O-ring allowed contaminants to leak into the channel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. She further claims that the design of the Q180V has crevices that are too small to clean or sanitize, but large enough to trap microbial contaminants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. Finally, Plaintiff claims that Defendants created a reprocessing protocol intended to clean the Q180V between uses that did not, in fact, clean the instrument to prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-63. Plaintiff alleges that, because of these defects, the Q180V put patients at an unreasonable increased risk of infection.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, by at least May 2012, Olympus knew the Q180V was defective and increased a patient's risk of infection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67. And, by late 2012, Defendants knew that the Q180V was linked to outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections in the United States and Europe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68. According to Plaintiff, the FDA eventually became aware of the risks posed by the Q180V and required Defendants to fix the defects and modify the reprocessing protocol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. Defendants did so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff underwent a medical procedure at the Johns Creek hospital on August 7, 2015, during which the doctor allegedly used a Q180V scope.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Seventeen days later, Plaintiff was hospitalized. She was hospitalized again just three days later, this time diagnosed with an antibiotic-resistant infection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Plaintiff claims she got the life-threatening infection from the Q180V that was used during her procedure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff asserts claims of (1) negligence (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-87); (2) strict products liability (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 88-120); (3) failure to warn (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 121-136); (4) fraudulent misrepresentation (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 137-153); (5) fraudulent concealment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 154-169); (6) negligent misrepresentation (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 170-181); and (7) fraud and deceit (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 182-214).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed her Complaint on August 15, 2017 and an Amended Complaint on September 19, 2017. (Dkts. 1, 21). Defendant Olympus Corporation and Olympus Medical Systems Corporation (hereinafter \"Olympus Corp.\" and \"OMSC,\" respectively) filed motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), arguing that they are not subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court. (Dkts. 27, 28). These Defendants-as well as the other two Olympus defendants-also filed motions to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Dkts. 29, 30, 31, 32). Briefing is now complete and, following oral argument, the Court finds the matter is ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Before a federal court sitting in such a case can exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, the Court must determine that it has jurisdiction under (1) the long-arm statute of the state in which it sits and (2) the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Future Tech.

Plaintiff also alleges that these two defendants are in the \"business of creating, designing, researching, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, promoting, selling and distributing medical equipment, including but not limited to duodenoscopes and the subject Q180V Scopes, into the stream of commerce for use by the public, including the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 38. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Olympus Corp and OMSC \"expected or should have\n   expected [their] acts to have consequences within the State of Georgia and derive[ ] substantial revenue from interstate commerce within the United States of America, and the State of Georgia, more particularly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff's Amended Complaint does not contain allegations tailored to each defendant or that set forth each defendant's individual actions that allegedly give rise to personal jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, she makes the very same allegations against both Olympus Corp. and OMSC.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-41. Thereafter, Plaintiff refers only to \"Defendants\" or \"each and every Defendant,\" without any effort to distinguish between the Olympus entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Brazil v.

Ga. 2016), this Court found that the plaintiff failed to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction because she did not allege facts specific to each defendant sufficient to show jurisdiction. In\n   <em>\n    Brazil\n   </em>\n   , however, the jurisdictional allegations merely referred to \"Defendants\" as a single entity, with no allegation that each defendant engaged in specific conduct. The defendant challenging personal jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Brazil\n   </em>\n   also submitted evidence contradicting the plaintiff's allegation that it manufactured and sold the product at issue within the forum, specifically its Form 10-K, which proved that the defendant was a holding company without manufacturing or sales operations.\n   <em>\n    Brazil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274414\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/249/1321/#p1331\">\n    249 F.Supp.3d at 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, therefore, was not obligated to accept the plaintiff's jurisdictional allegations as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff has included jurisdictional allegations against each defendant-they are verbatim, but they allege specific conduct by each defendant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 21 at \u00b6\u00b6 18-41. And neither Olympus Corp. nor OMSC submitted an affidavit challenging Plaintiff's jurisdictional allegations. Thus, the Court must accept Plaintiff's allegations, including the allegation that both Olympus Corp. and OMSC engaged in the same scope of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations in the Amended Complaint establish jurisdiction under the third section of Georgia's long-arm statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that Olympus Corp. and OMSC committed an injury in Georgia (specifically, the injury to Plaintiff) caused by acts outside of Georgia (specifically the defective creation, design, manufacturing, and promotion of the Q180V scope that they put into the stream of commerce for use by Plaintiff and others), that Defendants\n   expected their acts to have consequences with the State of Georgia, and that these Defendants \"derived substantial revenue from products used in the State of Georgia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-41. These allegations track the requirements of section three of Georgia's long-arm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants Olympus Corp. and OMSC argue that these bare-bones allegations are nevertheless insufficient to support jurisdiction and that Plaintiff must provide more factual details. Dkts. 27-1 at 9-13; 28-1 at 9-13. That is not correct. There is no requirement that a plaintiff plead more than the bare minimum required by the long-arm statute. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Betancourt v.

Ga. Dec. 17, 2014) ), the plaintiff alleged that she was injured in Georgia as a result of defective birth-control products that Defendants manufactured outside of Georgia but placed in the stream of commerce (foreseeably leading to Georgia), that the defective pills were used in Georgia, and that Defendants were unjustly enriched as a result of the money they earned from the sale of the pills.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The Court found these allegations sufficient to satisfy Georgia's long-arm statute without additional details.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As explained above, Plaintiff in this case has advanced nearly identical allegations.

In her fraudulent misrepresentation claim, for example, Plaintiff repeatedly alleges that \"each and Defendant falsely and fraudulently represented to the medical and healthcare community\" various aspects of the Q180V scope.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 21 at \u00b6\u00b6 138-44.

Plaintiff does not identify a single statement with specificity-that is, by identifying the time and date of the statement, the specific place of the statement, the defendant who made the statement, or the precise details of the statement. Simply referring to the Defendants' advertisements\n   over an undefined period does not provide the who, what, when, where, and how required by Rule 9(b). In addition, Plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claims do not distinguish in any way between the four defendants, instead lumping them all together in a collective allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The same is true of Plaintiff's other fraud-based claims. Her fraudulent concealment claim amounts to a generalized allegation that \"each and every Defendant fraudulently concealed and intentionally omitted\" information about the dangers of the scope.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 21 at \u00b6\u00b6 157-62. Again, she alleges that the Defendants failed to make the necessary disclosures in \"media advertisements, internet advertisements, press releases, sales literature, advertising campaigns, print ads, magazine ads, and or commercial media ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157. She does not identify any specific statement as to the alleged speaker, the time, the location, or the details of the statement. In addition, Plaintiff makes no attempt to distinguish between the individual defendants. Her negligent misrepresentation and fraud and deceit claims contain the same general allegations of conduct by \"each and every Defendant\" in unidentified press releases, advertising campaigns, print ads, and other media.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 171-77; 183-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   None of these claims satisfy Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement. The Court dismisses Plaintiff's claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud and deceit without prejudice and with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iii.
