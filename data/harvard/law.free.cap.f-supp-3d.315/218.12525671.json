This Court previously resolved one of those cases, which Plaintiff brought against the TSA under the Rehabilitation Act seeking to compel the agency to respond to Plaintiff's complaints of mistreatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sai v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273311\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/149/99/\">\n    149 F.Supp.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2015). Other cases, seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief relating to the alleged mistreatment and the TSA's policies more generally, remain pending before at least two other federal courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sai v. Covenant Aviation Sec.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-1024 (N.D. Cal);\n   <em>\n    Sai v. Pekoske\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-2356 (1st Cir.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this action, Plaintiff alleges that the TSA has failed adequately to respond to six requests under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Privacy Act (\"PA\"), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. The first of these requests sought surveillance video and reports relating to an incident that occurred at Boston's Logan International Airport (\"BOS\"), as well any other complaints against the TSA employees involved in the incident and any similar complaints against the TSA, airport police, or airport agents. Plaintiff subsequently expanded this request also to seek records relating to incidents at New York LaGuardia Airport (\"LGA\") and Chicago O'Hare International Airport (\"ORD\"). The second request sought \"any contract/agreement with other agencies regarding surveillance, or maintenance of surveillance footage, at Logan Airport.\" Dkt. 99-3 at 78 (McCoy Decl. Ex. I). The third request followed an incident at San Francisco International Airport (\"SFO\") and sought records like those Plaintiff sought relating to the BOS incident. The fourth-and by far the most expansive request-sought\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   policies and procedures that the TSA has\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   issued that are not already available in the TSA's \"electronic reading room.\" Finally, the fifth and sixth requests sought any additional records regarding the BOS and SFO incidents created after Plaintiff's original requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After Plaintiff filed suit, the TSA responded to each of the six pending FOIA requests and eventually released almost 4,000 pages of records (some with redactions) and three closed circuit television videos. The TSA has now moved for summary judgment, arguing that it reasonably construed (and, where necessary, narrowed) Plaintiff's requests; that it thoroughly searched for responsive records;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   and that it released all responsive, non-exempt records. Plaintiff opposes the TSA's motion and, with two minor exceptions, challenges virtually every aspect of the TSA's multiple searches and productions. Plaintiff contends that, as to each of the six requests, the TSA failed to conduct an adequate search; failed to produce segregable portions of records; withheld metadata and failed to release records in their \"native,\" electronic format or in \"fully digital, non-\"rasterized\" PDFs; improperly designated records as Sensitive Security Information (\"SSI\"); and improperly invoked FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, and 7. Plaintiff alleges, in addition, that the TSA withheld records that had been previously released; made false or misleading statements in its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   indices; violated the Privacy Act by maintaining records relating to Plaintiff's \"protected First [A]mendment speech,\" Dkt. 111-2 at 33-34; destroyed records in violation of a \"clear[ ] ... evidence preservation demand,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; withheld records so as to commit \"felony obstruction of justice,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and, more generally, \"maintained numerous unlawful policies, practices, and procedures ... and willful violation[s] of the APA, FOIA, Rehabilitation Act, Privacy Act, and SSI statutes.\" Dkt. 111 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As explained below, many of these contentions are not properly before the Court; others are not developed with sufficient clarity to survive summary judgment; and yet others lack legal or factual merit. But there is some wheat among this abundance of chaff. The Court will, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   in part the TSA's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

June 5, 2017) (denying petition for writ of certiorari). For present purposes, the Court need not repeat that history in its entirety, but simply recounts the allegations and procedural history relevant to the pending motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. FOIA Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The subject of this suit are six FOIA and Privacy Act requests for records that Plaintiff, whose full name is Sai\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , sent to the TSA in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sai submitted the first of these requests on January 28, 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   requesting information relating to an incident at a security checkpoint at Boston Logan International Airport (\"BOS Request\"). This request initially sought \"reports,\" \"notes, correspondence,\n   communications, ... relating to the incident,\" \"any and all records related to [Sai];\" \"copies of [Sai's] [travel] documents that were made at the scene;\" \"all history of complaints\" against the TSA agents with whom Sai came into contact and \"similar complaints\" against the TSA; and \"documents and communication related to responding to this request.\" Dkt. 99-3 at 50-51 (McCoy Decl. Ex. A). After the TSA requested additional information regarding the request on February 15, 2013, Sai expanded the request to include \"all records related to\" prior security incidents that occurred at New York LaGuardia Airport on June 27, 2012, and Chicago O'Hare International Airport on December 25, 2010.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (McCoy Decl.

In 1996, Congress enacted the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments to FOIA-or \"E-FOIA\" for short-to \"improve public access to agency records and information\" and to \"maximize the usefulness of agency records and information collected, maintained, used, retained, and disseminated by the Federal Government.\" Pub.

Dkt. 111-2 at 2-3. E-FOIA, however, applies only to records released pursuant to FOIA; it has no bearing on the form or format of declarations, indices, and exhibits filed with the Court, or served on the opposing party, in the course of litigating a FOIA suit.

Accordingly, as to Sai's BOS, SFO, and CCTV Requests, the format of TSA's responses met the requirements of E-FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Turning to Sai's Policies Request, Sai once again did not request that the TSA provide the responsive records in a \"native\" format with embedded metadata. Rather, Sai asked that the TSA release the records \"in an electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well-structured format to the maximum extent possible.\" Dkt. 99-3 at 129 (McCoy Decl. Ex. S). Presumably recognizing the ambiguity of that request, Sai further explained that, \"[t]his means,\" for example: \"individual PDFs per distinct document,\" \"fully digital text PDFs rather than scans or rasterizations,\" \"digital redactions rather than black marker,\" \"lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets,\" and \"scans rather than paper copies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (McCoy Decl. Ex. S).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In opposing the TSA's motion for summary judgment, Sai raises three objections that are arguably relevant to this request: first, that each record was not released in a distinct, \"discretiz[ed]\" file; second, that spreadsheets were not released in a \"useable, machine-processible format;\" and, third, that the records were released as \"rasterized PDF[s].\" Dkt. 111-2 at 2, 4-5. The TSA, for its part, does not directly respond to the first of these objections. Although the agency stresses the limitations imposed by the software that it used to process FOIA requests at the relevant times, Dkt. 118 at 7-10; Dkt. 118-1 at 2-4 (3d Supp. McCoy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-16), it fails to explain whether or why that software would have prevented the agency from generating separate PDF files for each discrete record, and it fails to argue that, as a matter of law, \"discretization\" does not constitute a \"form or format\" for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B). Based on this limited record, the Court cannot determine whether the TSA is entitled to summary judgment with respect to the \"discretization\" of the records released in response to Sai's Policies Request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As to the second objection-that the TSA released spreadsheets in an unusable format-it is Sai that drops the ball. Although Sai asserts, generally, that the TSA FOIA response process is flawed because the agency does not release spreadsheets in a usable format, Dkt. 111-2 at 5, and although Sai contends, specifically, that the TSA's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index was produced in a\n   format that did not permit \"basic operations like copying the spreadsheet into Google Spreadsheets,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Sai fails to assert that the TSA released any spreadsheets in response to the Policies Request. Absent some reason to conclude that Sai's general objection to the manner in which the TSA releases spreadsheets has any bearing on the Policies Request, the Court cannot opine on that question. Simply put, \"[t]he judicial power does not extend to the determination of abstract questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashwander v. Tenn.

Because this decision will require further litigation of a handful of specified issues, however, the Court will provide Sai with the opportunity to demonstrate that the TSA released spreadsheets in response to the Policies Request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Although not crystal clear, Sai does adequately raise the final objection-that the records responsive to the Policies Request were released in a \"rasterized\" format, and not as \"fully digital text PDFs\"-and the TSA at least indirectly responds to that objection. Sai explains that \"[b]y 'rasterized PDF,' [Sai] mean[s] the kind that is produced by scanning paper documents ... or irreversibly rendering text into image format,\" Dkt. 111-2 at 4 n.10, and that understanding comports with the dictionary definition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rasterize, v., Oxford English Dictionary (2018) (\"To convert (an image) into ... points or pixels on a grid\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question, then, is whether Sai was entitled to receive records responsive to the Policies Request in the \"fully digital\" (non-rasterized) text PDF format sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The answer to that question overlaps with the sole question presented by Sai's final set of requests, the BOS and SFO Re-Requests. In those requests, Sai asked that the TSA release the relevant records \"in their original electronic format or as a scan of any documents that are originally paper.\" Dkt. 28-3 at 11-12. The second of these alternatives does not present an issue here; Sai requested scanned copies of original, paper records, and that is what Sai received.

There is no question that the TSA had the technical capacity to format the records in the manner requested; indeed, that is how the records were originally formatted and used by the agency. For obvious reasons, the TSA does not contest this point. Rather, the agency argues that releasing records under FOIA in their original format would be unduly burdensome because its FOIA processing software, and its SSI review process, require reformatting the records as PDF files, and because it lacked the technical sophistication to redact files in their original formats.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   118 at 8-10; Dkt. 118-1 at 3-4 (3d Supp. McCoy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The TSA may be able to show that Sai's request that the agency release the records in their original format posed a burden on the agency of sufficient magnitude to justify its rejection of that request. It may be able to show, for example, that it could not have, at the time, \"readily\" ensured that redactions were not countermanded. It has yet to do so, however, and the TSA's primary contention that the request was incompatible with the agency's then-existing FOIA processing software is in tension with the language and purpose of the E-FOIA amendments. The statute asks whether the record at issue \"is readily reproducible by the agency in\" the requested format,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B), and not whether reproducing the file in that format would complicate the agency's FOIA review process. Even more significantly, the next sentence of the statute demands that agencies \"make reasonable efforts to maintain ... records in forms or formats that are reproducible for purposes of\" E-FOIA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And perhaps most significantly, Congress's goals of \"improv[ing] public access to agency records,\" Pub.

Because the TSA has yet to show that Sai's format request posed a \"significant interference or burden\" beyond increased FOIA-processing costs, and because it has yet to show that administrative costs of that type constitute a legally sufficient basis for rejecting a format request, the TSA is not entitled to summary judgment with respect to the format of the records released in response to Sai's Policies Request and BOS and SFO Re-Requests. TSA has similarly failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that it could not have \"readily\" produced the records responsive to the Policies Request in \"fully digital,\" non-\"rasterized\" \"text PDFs\" as requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Legibility\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Sai argues that the TSA's response to the BOS and SFO Requests were deficient because six pages of records that the agency released were \"completely illegible.\" Dkt. 111-2 at 2 (listing \"2013-TSPA-00368 Bates 003-004, 006-007; 2013-TSFO-01096 Bates 009-010\"). These records include a handwritten \"Incident/Event Reporting Form\" in response to Sai's SFO Request, Dkt. 143-2 at 6-7; scans of Sai's passport and boarding pass in response to the SFO Request,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 57-5 at 3, and a spreadsheet in response to Sai's BOS Request, Dkt. 141-2 at 9-10. Upon review of those documents, the Court agrees that the records are illegible. FOIA requesters are entitled to a legible copies of responsive agency records.\n   <em>\n    Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton v.

With respect to the following objections, however, the Court concludes that the TSA has yet to carry its burden on summary judgment: First, as to the Policies Request, the TSA has failed to explain why it could not \"readily\" have released the records as distinct PDFs or in \"fully digital,\" non-\"rasterized\" \"text PDFs.\" Second, as to the BOS and SFO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Re-Requests, the TSA has failed to explain why it could not have \"readily\" released the records in their original Word, Excel, electronic PDF, or like format. Third, with respect to six pages of records, the agency has failed to explain why it could not have released legible copies. Finally, with respect to the Policies Request, the Court will provide Sai with the opportunity to identify any spreadsheets that Sai received in a format that was not useful. In all other respects, the TSA is entitled to summary judgment on the format issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The TSA also tasked the TSOC, which is part of the OLE/FAMS, with conducting a search,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 18), and OLE/FAMS searched its Logan Airport \"office for responsive records, including those maintained by the Special Agent in Charge[ ] and the TSOC,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 20).

Despite Sai's assertions to the contrary, the uncontroverted record demonstrates that relevant portions of the Logan, LaGuardia, O'Hare, and San Francisco Airport field offices were searched, along with relevant portions of the Office of Security Operations, Office of Civil Rights and Liberties, and the TSA Contact Center. The lone response that Sai offers to McCoy's declaration is that the only email released was from the Disability Branch, Dkt. 111-2 at 6-7, but failure to uncover records does not mean that the search was inadequate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iturralde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n    315 F.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.\");\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

Similarly, Sai contends that the TSA failed to search the Department of Homeland Security or the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Liberties for responsive records, but Sai submitted the FOIA/PA requests only to the TSA, and the DHS FOIA regulations require that a requester \"write directly to the Department component that maintains [the] records\" sought.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.3\">\n    6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2003) (superseded 2016);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.1\">\n    6 C.F.R \u00a7 5.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (defining \"component\" to mean \"each separate bureau, office, division, commission, service, center, or administration\"). \"As a result, only the component to which the FOIA request is directed has an obligation to conduct a search.\"\n   <em>\n    Ewell v.

First, Sai faults the TSA for failing to conduct a search of the agency's FOIA Branch for responsive records. Dkt. 111-2 at 6. The TSA, for its part, offers no relevant response. It merely asserts that Sai's request for all records \"related to [him] held by any relevant parties\" was overly broad, Dkt. 99-3 at 5 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 12), requiring the agency to focus its search on specific offices \"based on the particular subject matters described in correspondence with [Sai] related to [his] request[s],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289416\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/294/#p302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 13), or \"[b]ased on the\n   particular information reasonably described in the request,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 62). The TSA is correct that it was not required to conduct \"an unreasonably burdensome search,\"\n   <em>\n    Goland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1431828,3785037\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/607/339/\">\n    607 F.2d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and was not required to search every TSA office and every TSA file system for records \"related to\" Sai. But the agency seems to concede, as it must, that it was required to conduct a search reasonably calculated to find records \"reasonably described in the request.\" That much seems settled. What the TSA fails to acknowledge, however, is that both the BOS and SFO Requests expressly sought \"all documents and communication[s] related to or responding to\" the requests, \"whether internal or external.\" Dkt. 99-3 at 51 (McCoy Decl. Ex. A) (BOS Request);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59 (McCoy Decl. Ex. D) (interim response confirming request for same);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 67 (final release confirming request for same);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 86 (McCoy Decl. Ex.

N) (interim response confirming request for same);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 99 (McCoy Decl. Ex. P) (final release confirming request for same). Those requests can only reasonably be construed to encompass FOIA processing records, and, as this Court has previously recognized, FOIA is applicable to the FOIA process itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shapiro v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289559\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/253/#p276\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276 (D.D.C. 2016). Because the TSA offers no meaningful explanation for why it did not search its FOIA Branch for records \"related to responding to\" Sai's FOIA requests, the TSA is not entitled to summary judgment with respect to this portion of Sai's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Although less clear, the Court is also unconvinced based on the current record that the TSA correctly declined to search for responsive records held by its Office of Legislative Affairs. To be sure, Sai did not specifically request records from the Office of Legislative Affairs, and that office does not leap to mind when asked where records relating to incidents that occurred at various airport security checkpoints might be found. But correspondence from and to Speaker Pelosi's office relating to the incident evidently came to the TSA's attention in the course of responding to Sai's FOIA requests,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 145-2 at 123, and that correspondence should have caused the agency to inquire whether the Office of Legislative Affairs possessed other, potentially responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

Cir. 1998) (\"An agency ... must revise its assessment of what is [a] \"reasonable\" [search] in a particular case to account for leads that emerge during its inquiry.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, the Court is not convinced that TSA correctly declined to search for responsive records held by its Office of Chief Counsel and Office of the Executive Secretariat. Email correspondence released to Sai indicates that individuals in those offices had some involvement, even if only minimal, in addressing Sai's complaints,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 145-2 at 61, 123, 143; Dkt. 144-3 at 58-62, 73, and the TSA has acknowledged that it did not search those offices for records responsive to Sai's SFO request,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 99-3 at 20-21 (McCoy \u00b6\u00b6 63, 66-68). This correspondence indicates that these offices may have possessed records responsive to the SFO Request, and, on the current record, the Court is unable to conclude that TSA conducted a search \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents\" with respect to those offices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662837,3669414\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/321/\">\n    180 F.3d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In sum: the Court agrees, with the four exceptions described above, that the TSA searched those offices that were likely to have records responsive to Sai's BOS and SFO Requests and Re-Requests. The exceptions are the TSA's FOIA Branch, its\n   Office of Legislative Affairs, its Office of Chief Counsel, and its Office of the Executive Secretariat. For present purposes, the Court holds only that the TSA has yet to carry its burden with respect to those four offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Time Frame for the Search\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Sai also argues that the TSA has failed to demonstrate that it searched for records covering the relevant time frame. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The governing DHS FOIA regulations at the time of Sai's request provided that, \"[i]n determining which records are responsive to a [FOIA/PA] request, a component,\" like the TSA, should \"ordinarily ... include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.4\">\n    6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2003) (superseded 2016) (FOIA);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.22\">\n    6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Privacy Act).

Sai asserts, without contradiction from the TSA, that the most recent e-mail released in response to Sai's FOIA/PA requests was dated July 7, 2014, and that Sai did not receive responses to some of the requests until 2016. Dkt. 111-2 at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 99-3 at 187 (McCoy Decl. Ex. DD). From this and the fact that the TSA continued to review Sai's administrative Rehabilitation Act complaints in the interval between July 7, 2014, and January 6, 2016, when Sai received the final response to the BOS and SFO Re-Requests, Sai infers that the TSA's search could not have encompassed the entire, relevant timeframe. Dkt. 111-2 at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 99-3 at 187 (McCoy Decl. Ex. DD) (final response to BOS and SFO Re-Requests).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In response, the TSA notes that the July 7, 2014 email was dated \"just weeks\" after it issued its \"interim and final releases in the BOS and SFO Requests\" and that \"[i]t is not unreasonable for an agency to take time after the completion of a FOIA search to review and process the responsive records.\" Dkt. 118 at 12. That response, however, ignores the BOS and SFO Re-Requests, which were not processed until much later. Indeed, the TSA acknowledges that it did not initially treat the Re-Requests as distinct FOIA/PA requests and that was not until September 21, 2015 that the agency sent Sai \"an acknowledgement letter\" for those requests. Dkt. 99-3 at 43 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 123-24). Although the TSA correctly observes that Sai's objection is premised on the \"speculat[ion] as to the dates that [the relevant] searches ended,\" Dkt. 118 at 13, that speculation is a product of the fact that the TSA, which has sole access to the relevant information, has not revealed\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   the search occurred and\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   cut-off date that the agency applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, the TSA argues that because the BOS and SFO Re-Requests \"sought records related to two incidents that occurred in 2013, and because the agency had already conducted adequate, reasonable\n   searches for responsive records,\" it is \"unsurprising\" that \"no new records were uncovered\" in response to those requests. Dkt. 118 at 14. That may be so, but there is reason to believe that new records were created after the date of the original requests in the course of the TSA's consideration of Sai's Rehabilitation Act complaints, and, without evidence regarding the temporal scope of the TSA's search, it is impossible to know whether the search was adequate. Under these circumstances, the Court, accordingly, cannot conclude that the TSA has carried its burden on this issue for purposes of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   One last, related issue bears note, however. The TSA is correct that the BOS and SFO Re-Requests required the agency to search only for records relating to the original BOS and SFO incidents, which occurred in early 2013. That is what Sai sought when Sai made the re-requests in November 2013, Dkt. 28-3 at 11-12, and, as the TSA correctly observes, a FOIA requester cannot, years later and after a dispute is in litigation, expand the scope of a request by merely asserting, as Sai did, that \"due to the [the agency's] delay,\" the request \"now also encompasses records relating to\" events that occurred long after the original request.

In response to the BOS and SFO Re-Requests, however, the TSA merely states that the FOIA Branch tasked the SFO, BOS, TCC, and Disability Branch offices to search for responsive records, but does not explain which databases or locations were searched within those offices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46, 47 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 134, 137). Although the Court assumes that the TSA searched the same databases and locations as it did in response to the BOS and SFO Requests, the agency must describe its searches in greater detail to meet its burden on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   With respect to the search terms used, the McCoy declaration provides an accounting of the terms used for the majority of the offices searched. In response to the BOS Request, for example, the McCoy declaration reports that the BOS field office searched electronic records \"using Plaintiff's name as a search term,\" Dkt. 99-3 at 6 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 15); the LGA field office searched \"using Plaintiff's name\" as well as \"the date of the LGA incident,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 16); and the TCC office \"electronically searched its centralized database for records containing Plaintiff's name, phone number, and email address\" as well as \"the date and flight number of Plaintiff's scheduled travel on the day of the BOS incident, for complaints related to the TSA employees involved in the BOS incident, and for complaints referencing the BOS airport agents or police,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 23). Similarly, in response to Sai's SFO Request, the McCoy declaration explains that the TSA searched the TCC office \"for records containing Plaintiff's name, the names and badge numbers of the TSA and CAS employees ..., for complaints using the search terms 'carry-on liquids' and 'San Francisco Airport (SFO).' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 65). As to the McCoy declaration's description of its search of these offices, the Court finds that it has provided \"necessary details ... about the scope or methods of the searches conducted,\"\n   <em>\n    Defs. of Wildlife v. U.S. Border Patrol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4161055\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/623/83/#p91\">\n    623 F.Supp.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91-92 (D.D.C. 2009), and meet its burden of showing that the search was adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The TSA has failed, however, adequately to describe the searches it conducted for records in the following offices: the ORD field office and OLE/FAMS office in response to the BOS Request; the SFO field office and Disability Branch office in response to the SFO Request; and the BOS, SFO, TCC, and Disability Branch offices in response to the Re-Requests. For those offices, the TSA does not identify the search terms it used, instead merely stating that it searched \"for responsive records,\" Dkt. 99-3 at 6-7, 20-21, 46-47 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20, 63, 66, 69, 134, 137), or \"records related to Plaintiff,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 69). Without knowing the search terms the TSA used, the Court cannot determine whether its efforts were \"reasonably calculated\" to locate responsive records in those offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In sum: the Court concludes that the TSA has failed to carry its burden of showing that its searches for the records Sai requested in the BOS and SFO Requests\n   and Re-Requests covered the relevant timeframe-from the date of the relevant incident to the date the search commenced. The Court also concludes that the TSA has failed to carry its burden of showing that it conducted a search \"reasonably calculated\" to recover responsive records with respect to the databases searched in response to the BOS and SFO Re-Requests and with respect to the search terms used to search the ORD and OLE/FAMS offices in response to the BOS Request; the SFO and Disability Branch offices in response to the SFO Request; and the BOS, SFO, TCC, and Disability Branch offices in response to the Re-Requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Policies Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The scope of the TSA's search for records responsive to Sai's Policies Request raises a distinct set of issues. The parties agree about two things: First, Sai requested \"\n   <em>\n    [a]ll\n   </em>\n   TSA policy and/or procedures documents\" that were \"not already\" available through the agency's electronic reading room, \"including both old [and] current versions\" of those documents. Dkt. 99-3 at 125 (McCoy Decl. Ex. S); Dkt. 118 at 15. Second, the TSA did not search for-and, thus, did not release-\"all\" such records. Dkt. 111-2 at 8; Dkt. 118 at 15. At that point, however, the parties' agreement ends. Sai lists dozens of policies that Sai contends the TSA released in response to third-party FOIA requests, that the TSA identified in other litigation, or that \"confidential source(s)\" brought to Sai's attention. Dkt. 111-2 at 8-10, 17; Dkt. 116-1 at 1-3. Those policies, which the TSA failed to release in response to Sai's request, run the gamut from the TSA's \"Checked Baggage,\" \"Advanced Imaging Technology,\" \"Colorimetric,\" \"Expedited Screening,\" \"Travel Document Checkpoint,\" and \"K9\" Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\"), Dkt. 111-2 at 8-10, to various reports relating to the TSA's \"Screening Passengers Through Observations Techniques\" (\"SPOT\") program, Dkt. 116 at 1; Dkt. 116-1 at 1-3. The TSA, for its part, does not engage on whether these records exist, but rather argues that Sai's request for \"all\" TSA policies and procedures-past and present-not already available through the agency's electronic reading room was vastly overbroad and that all that the agency could do was make a reasonable effort to respond to what it perceived to be the core of Sai's request. Dkt. 118 at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court agrees with the TSA. An agency is required to respond to a FOIA request only if the request \"reasonably describes\" the records sought.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A).

Nor did Sai's nine more specific requests, and twenty-seven non-exclusive subparts, add the required specificity. They sought all TSO polices, past and present, dealing with \"screening procedures,\" \"the treatment of passengers with disabilities,\" violations by TSA personnel of policies \"in a way that infringes on the rights of travelers,\" \"cooperation with local airports and police,\" \"when checkpoint video may be released,\" the TSA's \"no fly\" list and \"any similar lists,\" \"legal justification for\" declining to allow passengers to \"revoke consent to administrative search once they have entered a screening area,\" and \"Behavior Detection Officer training materials\" and \"any studies investigating their efficacy.\" Dkt. 99-3 at 125-27 (McCoy Decl.

It is thus both unsurprising and unavailing that Sai has been able to identify \"policy and procedures documents\" that Sai says the TSA failed to release. The TSA represents that complying in full with Sai's request \"would have created an extreme burden on and undue hardship for the entire agency and, in particular, the FOIA Branch.\" Dkt. 118-1 at 6 (3d Supp. McCoy Decl. \u00b6 19).

Dkt. 99-3 at 31, 31-35 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 94-107). The McCoy declaration provides a detailed account of the efforts of each of these offices to locate potentially responsive records, while necessarily construing and limiting Sai's request to avoid the \"unreasonable burden\" that a full response would have entailed.\n   <em>\n    Am.

If that nothing-or-all approach were to prevail, agencies would have a strong incentive to reject wildly overbroad FOIA requests, like Sai's Policies Request, and to refuse to make any effort to provide what they reasonably can.

Although some SSI designations constitute \"orders,\" those that are\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   are not \"orders\" and thus not subject to \u00a7 46110(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That contention, however, suffers from two flaws. First, Sai does not-and cannot-explain why the same logic does not apply to a challenge premised on \u00a7 114(r)(1). An action taken without authority-that is, under circumstances not covered by the grant of authority in \u00a7 114(r)(1) -is every bit as much\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   as an action taken\n   in contravention of a limitation on the agency's authority-that is, under circumstances precluded by \u00a7 114(r)(4). Second, Sai ignores D.C. Circuit precedent holding that the term \"order\" in \u00a7 46110(a)\"should be read expansively\" and includes final agency determinations of \"rights or obligations\" or final agency action giving \"rise to legal consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    Safe Extensions, Inc. v.

As the D.C.

Dkt. 116-1 at 1 (records released to Sai contained \"more SSI redaction[s] than made\" to records released to the ACLU). To the extent Sai intends to invoke the \"official acknowledgement\" doctrine, a three-part showing is required: \"First, the information [Sai] requested must be as specific as the information previously released.

Cir. 1980) (per curiam), in which the court held, \"[w]here the records have already been furnished, it is abusive and a dissipation of agency and court resources to make and process a second claim,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292825,3507310\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/9/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292825,3507310\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/9/\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That case differs from the present case, however, in one critical respect: in\n   <em>\n    Crooker\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff sought the release of records that he had already obtained from another agency,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292825,3507310\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/9/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , while in the present case, Sai contends that the government did not provide the relevant material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-1 at 1 n.1. The fact that the government has released records to a third party, which has then made those records public, does not obviate the government's obligation to respond fully to an otherwise proper FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p144\">\n    492 U.S. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p144\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is one thing to say that an agency need not disclose materials that it has previously released; it is quite another to say that an agency need not disclose materials that some other person or group may have previously released.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The TSA also returns to the theme that Sai's Policies Request was vastly overbroad and that, as a result, it cannot be faulted for failing to find and release every responsive record. The ACLU's request, the TSA contends, was \"comparatively tailored\" in seeking records relating to the \"TSA's behavior detection programs\" and thus, unsurprisingly, resulted in a more complete production of those records. Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   118 at 31. That argument is, as noted above, persuasive as far as it goes. It fails to explain, however, why the TSA redacted SSI from records released to Sai, but, according to Sai, did not in every instance redact the same purported SSI from the records released to the ACLU. Dkt. 116-1 at 1-2. The TSA's excessive burden argument has no application in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This, then, leaves the TSA's final argument, which is more promising but remains incomplete. As the TSA explains, after it released records to Sai in response to the Policies Request in 2015,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 99-3 at 35-37 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 109-11), the ACLU-in pressing its own FOIA request-convinced the TSA to \"withdr[a]w some of the identified redactions\" the agency had previously made, and the TSA \"re-released\" the relevant records. Dkt. 118-1 at 6-7 (3d Supp. McCoy Decl. \u00b6 23). To the extent the TSA revisited its SSI determinations\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   it released the responsive records to Sai, the TSA is correct that it did not have an obligation to \"update or supplement [its] prior response.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James v.

Dkt. 99-3 at 13 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 39). Similarly, in responding to the SFO Request, the TSA once again invoked Exemption 5 to withhold information that was both predecisional-the information pertained to \"prospective agency action\"-and deliberative-it reflected deliberations involving agency counsel regarding how the agency should respond to \"administrative complaints against [the] TSA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 83(c) ).

Cir. 1982) (asking whether the factual information was prepared to \"assist[ ] the [agency official] [in] mak[ing] a complex decision,\" or whether the information \"was prepared only to inform the [agency official] of facts which he in turn would make available\"). On the present record, the Court cannot determine whether or how the TSA applied this test to the information that it gathered in responding to the SFO Request. As a result, the TSA has yet to carry its burden with respect to the assertion of the deliberative privilege regarding this limited set of records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Third, Sai maintains that one document uses the phrase \"we decided,\" demonstrating in Sai's view that the document is post-decisional; that a second document contains a \"post-decisional response and re-training;\" and, more generally, that \"policies, memoranda of law, and similar documents\" are \"post-decisional\" and thus not protected by the privilege. Dkt. 111-2 at 25. Sai's first contention-that the use of past-tense \"we decided\" indicates that the document is post-decisional-has little force. The mere fact that a document uses the past tense does not resolve whether it falls within Exemption 5. The unredacted portions of the document do not indicate that the redacted portions are anything other than what TSA says: \"internal predecisional discussions regarding prospective agency action.\" Dkt. 99-3 at 116\n   (McCoy Decl. Ex. Q). The document in question reads: \"We decided to hold-off on sending Sai and [redacted, citing Exemption 6] to DHS. With Sai, we are [redacted, citing Exemption 5].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 145-2 at 77. Significantly, the TSA disclosed what had been decided-not to \"send[ ] Sai\"-and only redacted\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   information that the TSA attests was predecisional. The same is true with respect to the document Sai characterizes as containing \"post-decisional response and re-training.\" Dkt. 111-2 at 25. Although the redacted record is part of an email chain that discusses training on how to screen medical liquids, Dkt. 144-3 at 197, it is not evident that the redacted information relates to the Disability Branch's review of Sai's Rehabilitation Act complaints,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 197, and there is no reason to question the TSA's representation that its review was ongoing, Dkt. 99-3 at 111 (McCoy Decl. Ex. Q). Finally, with respect to Sai's contention that \"policies, memoranda of law, and similar documents\" are \"post-decisional\" and thus not protected by the deliberative process privilege, this attack is far too amorphous to defeat TSA's motion for summary judgment. Sai does not identify what documents were improperly redacted or withheld, and fails to develop the contention with sufficient detail (or, indeed, any detail) to permit the Court to consider it on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Fourth, Sai contends that the \"TSA made inconsistent redactions of identical information, demonstrating the arbitrary and capricious nature of its\" invocation of Exemption 5. Dkt. 111-2 at 22 (citing \"2013-TSPA-00339 Bates 266 (unredacted) vs[.] 428, 431 (redacted); 106 (unredacted) vs[.] 294, 295, 300 (redacted); 214 (unredacted) vs[.] 287 (redacted)\"). Sai is correct that the TSA redacted slightly more information on three pages of materials than it did on duplicate copies of those same materials. The Court has reviewed those minor inconsistencies and concludes that they do not demonstrate a lack of good faith or a failure of the TSA to release reasonably segregable materials; rather, they reflect nothing more than modest differences regarding the precise line between deliberative and background material. Sai has already received the less-substantially redacted versions, moreover, and thus has no basis to complain about the more substantial redactions made to duplicate copies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crooker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292825,3507310\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/9/\">\n    628 F.2d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Once the records are produced the substance of the controversy disappears and becomes moot since the disclosure which the suit seeks has already been made.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams &amp; Connolly v.

Cir. 2011) (\"Once the documents are released to the requesting party, there no longer is any case or controversy.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, Sai argues that \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of TSA's privilege claims\"-including the deliberative, work product, and attorney-client privilege-\"are void\" because the \"TSA deliberately obstructed the processing of\" Sai's FOIA request and administrative complaints. Dkt. 111-2 at 37, 39-40. For support, Sai cites to email correspondence suggesting that TSA officials decided to \"hold-off\" on processing Sai's Rehabilitation Act complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-41. \"Taken together,\" Sai argues, the email correspondence demonstrates that the TSA was engaged in a \"deliberate cover-up[ ]\" of \"felony obstruction of justice in refusing to process, delaying the processing, and refusing to release the results of two former federal civil rights investigations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. From this, Sai then posits that the crime-fraud exception-or some similar doctrine-precludes the TSA from relying on any common-law privilege.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   This imaginative contention merits only cursory discussion. As the D.C. Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   To establish the [crime-fraud] exception to the attorney-client privilege, the court must consider whether the client \"made or received the otherwise privileged communication with the intent to further an unlawful or fraudulent act,\" and establish that the client actually \"carried out the crime or fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703561,7635133\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/46/\">\n    107 F.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (D.C. Cir. 1997). To establish the exception to the work-product privilege, courts ask a slightly different question, focusing on the client's general purpose in consulting the lawyer rather than on his intent regarding the particular communication: \"Did the client consult the lawyer or use the material for the purpose of committing a crime or fraud?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703561,7635133\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/46/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703561,7635133\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/46/\">\n    at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241907,5870789\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/775/\">\n    223 F.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 778 (D.C.

That conclusion is a far cry from \"felony obstruction of justice,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39, and it is a far cry from the type of serious misconduct necessary to abrogate any of the privileges at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Exemptions 6 &amp; 7(C)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) protect personal privacy.

Second, while Exemption 6 asks whether the disclosure \"would\" constitute such an invasion of privacy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6), Exemption 7(C) merely asks whether the disclosure \"could reasonably be expected\" to do so,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Here, the TSA invoked Exemption 6 in support of each of the redactions that it made on privacy grounds. It also relied on Exemption 7(C) with respect to one narrow subset of redactions-those designed to protect the identities of local law enforcement officers. Because Exemption 7(C) is more protective than Exemption 6, the Court will apply the Exemption 7(C) standard to this one subset of redactions, but will otherwise apply the Exemption 6 standard. Before applying these standards, however, the Court first addresses Sai's threshold contentions that the TSA's privacy redactions were improper because (1) disclosure was required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.311\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 293.311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) the redacted names and contact information were already known to Sai; and (3) \"[i]n other cases,\" similar information was not redacted. Dkt. 111-2 at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Sai's first argument is a nonstarter. Sai is correct that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.311\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 293.311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) provides that information disclosing a federal employee's name and present and past positions is generally \"available to the public.\" That provision, however, applies only to information contained in \"official personnel folder[s],\" \"performance file system folders,\" \"their automated equivalent records,\" and other \"personnel record files ... which are under the control of the Office\" of Personnel Management (\"OPM\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, however, by Sai's own account, \"[t]he files ... from which these names have been redacted are not 'personnel' \" or \"similar files.\" Dkt. 111-2 at 23. Nor are any of the files \"under the control of\" OPM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.311\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 293.311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). But, even putting those difficulties aside, Sai disregards the very next subsection of the regulation. That subsection provides that \"an agency will generally not disclose\" employee information that \"[w]ould otherwise be protected from mandatory disclosure under an exemption of the FOIA.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.311\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 293.311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). The relevant regulation accordingly, by its own terms, does not disarm an otherwise available FOIA exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Sai's second contention-the redacted private information is already known to Sai-is equally unavailing. Agencies releasing records pursuant to FOIA requests must be mindful that \"[d]ocuments released in a FOIA action must be made available to the public as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Stonehill v.

In releasing private information,\n   an agency must operate on the assumption-confirmed in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 99-3 at 14, 28, 41 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 42, 86, 119)-that the recipient will further distribute the information, or that others will seek the same information and reasonably expect similar treatment by the FOIA office.

It is unclear what Sai means by this. To the extent Sai means that the TSA disclosed the names or contact information of agency employees to other FOIA requesters involved in other litigation, that contention does not undercut the TSA's reliance on Exemptions 6 and 7(C) here. The \"standards for invoking the [official-acknowledgement] doctrine are high.\"\n   <em>\n    Shapiro\n   </em>\n   , 153 F.Supp.3d at 285. \"Prior disclosure of similar information does not suffice; instead, the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   information sought by the plaintiff must already be in the public domain by official disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   , 473 F.3d at 378. Nor does a prior disclosure of \"similar\" information suffice to show that the asserted privacy interest is not real. As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, the appropriate balance between \"the privacy interest in non-disclosure [and] the public interest in the release of the records\" necessarily varies from case to case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lepelletier v.

Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). And, to the extent Sai contends that the TSA released precisely the same record to Sai with fewer redactions in response to one of the FOIA requests, Sai has already received the less-substantially redacted record and thus the challenge is moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crooker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292825,3507310\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/9/\">\n    628 F.2d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, Sai contends that \"[t]he official contact information of federal officials has no relation to their 'personal privacy' \" and that \"[t]he disclosure of the identities of officials involved in [Sai's] Rehabilitation Act complaints is not 'clearly unwarranted.' \" Dkt. 111-2 at 23 (emphasis removed). As the TSA's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and the redacted documents show, the TSA redacted the following information, which Sai now seeks: (1) the names and contact information for non-TSA employees, including local law enforcement officers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 99-3 at 74-75 (McCoy Decl.

This concern is a reasonable one, TSA asserts, because \"the personal identifying information in these records would necessarily identify the individual\" as \"having played a particular role in an incident, or complaining about a particular incident\" and would reveal the locations where the individuals work and how to contact them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292825,3507310\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/9/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 42).

The Court must, accordingly, apply the Exemption 7(C) standard to assess whether the TSA has met its burden of showing that the redactions were proper. The D.C. Circuit has \"adopted a categorical rule permitting an agency to withhold information identifying private citizens mentioned in law enforcement records, unless disclosure is 'necessary in order to confirm or refute compelling evidence that the agency is engaged in illegal activity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Schrecker v.

Sai first argues that the TSA improperly failed to release various Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\")-or alternative versions of SOPs-that Sai sought in the Policies Request. But, as discussed above, the request was defectively overbroad, and the fact that the TSA made an effort to answer the request in part did not obligate the agency to release every policy or procedure document that it had ever created, and was not already available in the TSA's electronic reading room.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.2. Sai's assertions learned from \"confidential source(s),\" mistakenly released records, and documents posted by third parties that purport to represent \"authentic\" copies of TSA documents, Dkt. 111-2 at 19-21, does not change that conclusion. Second, Sai contends that inconsistencies in the TSA's redactions under the deliberative process privilege show that the agency has not released certain segregable\n   material.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. But, as also discussed above, those minor inconsistencies do not establish a lack of good faith, and, in any event, Sai has already received copies of the less thoroughly redacted records.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   More generally, Sai fails to identify any evidence that the TSA withheld records in whole based on a valid FOIA exemption, where a portion of those records were reasonably segregable and could have been released without disclosing the exempt information. The Court, moreover, has reviewed the various\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   indices that the TSA has submitted in support of its motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 99-3 at 73-76 (McCoy Decl. Ex. H);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 102-20 (McCoy Decl. Ex. Q);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 160-74 (McCoy Decl. Ex. Y), and those indices demonstrate that the agency redacted the exempt portions of otherwise responsive records where possible. The Court, accordingly, concludes that with respect to records that the TSA released, it has met its obligation to release reasonably segregable portions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Allegations of Bad Faith and Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The remainder of Sai's opposition contains a variety of other accusations that the TSA has engaged in misconduct. Construed liberally, these allegations may present an argument-albeit a flawed one-that the TSA acted in bad faith in responding to the requests and that, in light of this bad faith, Sai should be allowed to conduct discovery regarding the TSA's actions. Among these claims, Sai argues that TSA despoiled CCTV video of the Logan Airport incident. Dkt. 111-2 at 34-36. In support of this contention, Sai posits that (1) TSA policy requires 15 \"[c]amera views\" of each passenger during screening and requires that the surveillance video be maintained for 30 days; (2) Sai submitted a FOIA request seeking the Logan Airport surveillance video within that 30-day window; (3) the TSA released only one video showing Sai's screening at Logan Airport and informed Sai that no other video exists; and (4) \"the only possible conclusion is that TSA and BOS committed spoliation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   That theory, however, cannot be squared with McCoy's declaration, submitted under the penalty of perjury, which recounts that \"BOS searched for responsive records including closed circuit television (CCTV)\" and located \"one CCTV video of the incident.\" Dkt. 99-3 at 6 (McCoy Decl. \u00b6 15). As this Court has explained, agency declarations, like McCoy's, \"are accorded a presumption of good faith,\" and that presumption \"cannot be rebutted by 'purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other documents.' \"\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be sure, TSA policy may have required additional \"views,\" and it may have required that video records be maintained for thirty days. Dkt. 111-2 at 35-36. But that does not mean that the videos Sai sought, in fact, existed at the time Sai filed the FOIA request, and it certainly does not mean that the TSA destroyed some (but not all) of the videos Sai sought in order to avoid its obligation of production. Far more than Sai has offered is necessary to give rise to a disputed issue of fact regarding an agency's good faith; indeed, if a FOIA requester's reasonable belief that other records should have been found were sufficient, discovery would likely be the norm, rather than exception, in FOIA cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole v. Rochford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522962\" index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/73/#p76\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (D.D.C. 2018) (\"[I]n the FOIA context, courts have permitted discovery only in exceptional circumstances where a plaintiff raises a sufficient question as to the agency's good faith in searching for or processing documents.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP\n   </em>\n   , 473 F.3d at 318 (concluding that the district court properly denied discovery request where the plaintiff \"offered\n   no evidence of bad faith to justify additional discovery\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Sai also argues that TSA violated Sai's rights under the Privacy Act by documenting \"protected First Amendment speech\" at checkpoints, including documentation of the \"parody DHS\" t-shirt Sai was wearing while going through the Logan Airport screening and Sai's act of partially disrobing at the O'Hare Airport screening. Dkt. 111-2 at 33-34. For support, Sai cites to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(7), which provides that \"[e]ach agency that maintains a system of records shall ... maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.\" This argument, however, is not properly before the Court because Sai brought this suit to \"challeng[e] the failure of [the TSA] to respond to plaintiff Sai's multiple requests for records,\" Dkt. 5 at 1 (Compl. \u00b6 1), not to challenge the content of those records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Finally, Sai argues that the TSA deliberately delayed processing the Logan and San Francisco Airport Rehabilitation Act complaints. Dkt. 111-2 at 37-40. Those contentions, however, also have nothing to do with the present action. Indeed, this Court has previously resolved Sai's separate lawsuit raising just that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sai\n   </em>\n   , 149 F.Supp.3d at 99. Sai offers no basis to conclude that the TSA's delay in processing the Rehabilitation Act complaints shows that it improperly withheld records responsive to Sai's FOIA requests.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    House v. U.S. Dep't Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178186\" index=\"360\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/192/#p203\">\n    197 F.Supp.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203-04 (D.D.C. 2016) (explaining that allegations of misconduct unrelated to the processing of the plaintiff's FOIA/PA requests or the suit \"failed to rebut the presumption of good faith\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that Sai has failed to rebut the presumption of good faith applicable to the TSA's explication of its search efforts and has failed to show that discovery is warranted in this FOIA/Privacy Act action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   in part and will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   in part the TSA's motion for summary judgment. In particular, the motion is granted, except as to the following issues, which will require further development: (1) Did the TSA fail to comply with E-FOIA notwithstanding its failure to release the electronic records sought in Sai's BOS and SFO Re-Requests in their original format and its failure to release records responsive to the Policies Request in \"discretized,\" \"fully digital,\" non-\"rasterized\" text PDFs; (2) Did the TSA release any spreadsheets in response to Sai's Policies Request; (3) Does the TSA possess legible copies of Dkt. 143-2 at 3, 6-7 (2013-TSPA-00368 Bates 003-004, 006-007); Dkt. 141-2 at 9-10 (2013-TSFO-01096 Bates 009-010); (4) Is the TSA required to search its FOIA Branch, Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Chief Counsel, and Office of the Executive Secretariat for records responsive to Sai's BOS and SFO Requests and Re-Requests; (5) Did the TSA's searches for records responsive to the BOS and SFO Requests and Re-Requests cover the relevant timeframe, that is, from the date of the relevant incident to the date the relevant search commenced; (6) Did the TSA conduct a search reasonably calculated to locate responsive records with respect to\n   the databases searched in response to the BOS and SFO Re-Requests and with respect to the search terms used to search the offices described in Part II.B.2 in response to the BOS and SFO Requests and Re-Requests; (7) Did the TSA redact information pursuant to Exemption 3 that was previously released to the ACLU\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   responding to Sai's Policies Request; (8) Did the TSA properly redact factual information responsive to Sai's SFO Request pursuant to Exemption 5; (9) Does the redacted contact information for TSA contract employees, a DHS Office of Chief Counsel employee, and a TSA Disability Branch employee implicate a \"substantial privacy interest\" under Exemption 6; and (10) Does the redacted contact information of TSA employees contained in policy documents implicate a \"substantial privacy interest\" under Exemption 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Finally, the Court further concludes that Sai has failed to demonstrate that discovery is warranted in this FOIA/PA action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Court will set a briefing schedule in a separate order for the parties to address these (and only these) remaining issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    Sai has indicated a preference not to be referenced using gender pronouns, and, in this amended opinion, the Court has endeavored to respect that request.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    The declaration of Regina McCoy states that Sai's request was executed on January 21, 2013.
