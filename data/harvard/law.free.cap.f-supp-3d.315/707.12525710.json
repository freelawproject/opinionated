(Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 1). Defendants Anthony J. Nedza and Bonita E. Nedza (collectively, \"Defendants\") have not appeared in this action. (Dkt. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for default judgment and for foreclosure and sale of the Property. (Dkt. 9). For the reasons set forth below, the motion is denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about July 2, 2007, Defendants executed and delivered a note under which they promised to pay the sum of $85,000.00 plus interest on the unpaid amount due. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 9). Defendants also executed and delivered a mortgage on the Property in the amount of $85,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). The mortgage was later assigned to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). Defendants failed to make a payment that was due on November 1, 2013, as well as all subsequent payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Defendants owe a principal balance of $76, 898.81 with 7.375% interest accruing from October 1, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Plaintiff claims that Defendants additionally owe \"late charges, monies advanced for taxes, assessments, insurance, maintenance, and preservation of the Property, and the costs, allowances, expenses of sale, and reasonable attorney's fees for the foreclosure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that it complied with the notice provisions of the mortgage and RPAPL \u00a7 1304, and that it filed the information required by RPAPL \u00a7 1306. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed affidavits of service, stating that the summons and complaint, together with a certificate of merit, a debt validation letter, an RPAPL \u00a7 1303 notice, and an RPAPL \u00a7 1320 notice were served on Defendants. (Dkt. 5; Dkt. 6). Anthony J. Nedza's answer was due by July 10, 2017 (Dkt. 6), and Bonita E. Nedza's answer was due by July 11, 2017 (Dkt. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants failed to respond to the complaint or otherwise appear in this action. On July 14, 2017, Plaintiff requested that the Clerk of Court enter default against Defendants pursuant to Rule 55(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Clerk entered default against Defendants on July 17, 2017. (Dkt. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 15, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment and judgment of foreclosure and sale. (Dkt. 9). Plaintiff further requests that the Court appoint a referee to oversee a sale of the Property and disburse the funds from that sale. (Dkt. 9-1 at 1). Plaintiff also filed an affidavit of service for the motion. (Dkt. 9-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the same day, the Court issued a scheduling order requiring Defendants to file any papers in opposition to Plaintiff's motion by December 8, 2017. (Dkt. 10 at \u00b6 1). The Court also ordered Plaintiff to serve Defendants a copy of the Court's scheduling order and Plaintiff's motion papers by November 21, 2017, and to file proof of service of the same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). Although Plaintiff served the scheduling order on November 21, 2017 (Dkt. 11), to date, Defendants have not responded or appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Default Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55 sets forth the procedural steps for entry of a default judgment.

A copy of the complaint must be filed with the notice of pendency, unless the complaint has already been filed in that county. CPLR 6511 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on the record before the Court, Plaintiff appears to have established the common-law elements of a foreclosure action. (Dkt. 9-1 at 27-29 (Note), 31-48 (Mortgage), 78-80 (Pl. Aff.) ). Plaintiff also appears to have complied with the procedural requirements of the RPAPL in most-but not all-respects. Plaintiff has complied with \u00a7 1304 by serving the pre-litigation notice required under that statute (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-82), and with \u00a7 1306 by filing with the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services the information required by that statute (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 107-08). Plaintiff also served the following documents on each Defendant: the summons and complaint, notices pursuant to RPAPL \u00a7\u00a7 1303 and 1320, a debt validation letter, and a certificate of merit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, Plaintiff failed to comply with the procedural requirements regarding the notice of pendency. Although Plaintiff filed a notice of pendency pursuant to RPAPL \u00a7 1331 with the Ontario County Clerk, nothing in the record indicates that Plaintiff filed the complaint with the notice of pendency as required under CPLR 6511(a). (Dkt. 4). Plaintiff attached only the legal description of the Property to the notice of pendency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The affirmation by Plaintiff's counsel states that \"Plaintiff filed a Notice of Pendency in the Ontario County Clerk's Office in accordance with RPAPL \u00a7 1331 and New York Civil Practice Law and Rules ('CPLR') Article 65\" (Dkt. 9-1 at 2), but nothing in the record supports counsel's assertion that Plaintiff has complied with CPLR 6511(a) by filing the complaint with the notice of pendency. The Court notes that the Notice of Pendency states that \"an action has been commenced and is now pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York upon the Complaint of the above named Plaintiff....\" (Dkt. 4 at 1). Nevertheless, this is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of New York law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sterly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207429439\">\n    2016 WL 7429439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (\"The notice states that a foreclosure action has been commenced against [the d]efendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.
