Bilateral Pretrial Stipulation (\"Stipulation\") (ECF No. 266) at 13; Pl.'s 56.1, \u00b6 2. During the relevant time period, each owner was a licensed health care practitioner. Stipulation at 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Calhoun provided various health care services to individuals who suffered injuries in automobile accidents based on letters of protection (\"LOPs\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   LOPs allowed patients to defer payment of medical bills until they favorably settled or prevailed in their bodily injury (\"BI\") claims.

Calhoun physicians obtained privileges at Metropolitan and Metropolitan provided Calhoun physicians with an operating room and all attendant services necessary to perform surgeries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Metropolitan then issued a notice of sale and assignment of the Metropolitan bill to Calhoun.

Resp. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 34; Pl.'s Reply 56.1, \u00b6 34. When Calhoun paid Metropolitan for the bill, the amount they paid was less than the face amount of the bill.

Stipulation at 14; Defs.' 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 23. State Farm's claims handlers prepared a claim file containing information about the injury, damages, strengths and weaknesses for negotiation, and any unusual or aggravating circumstances.

Defs.' 56.1, \u00b6 29; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1, \u00b6 29. Defendants were not involved in the settlement negotiations between the patients' attorneys and State Farm. Defs.' 56.1, \u00b6 30. Calhoun received payments only after a settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. The patients' attorneys made the checks payable to Calhoun and the checks were deposited directly into Calhoun's bank account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Calhoun negotiated with the patients' attorneys on a case-by-case basis regarding what it would accept from the settlement as payment for the Calhoun and Metropolitan bills.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 12, 2013, State Farm's Multi-Claim Investigative Unit (\"MCIU\") learned that Calhoun was listed as the guarantor on the Metropolitan account ledger for a claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1, \u00b6 36.

In November 2013, an initial Alert was distributed within State Farm regarding Project Calhoun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.

Specifically, State Farm argues that Defendants violated the Patient-Brokering, Anti-Kickback, and Anti-Rebate Statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Parties dispute whether the remuneration Calhoun received as its share of settlements constitutes a kickback. A \"kickback\" is a payment made pursuant to an agreement by a provider of health care services of a portion of the charges for services rendered to a referring health care provider as incentive to refer patients for future services.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20456.054\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 456.054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   State Farm argues that Calhoun referred patients to Metropolitan in exchange for receiving a kickback -ability to use the inflated Metropolitan bill to increase the amount that Calhoun received from patients' settlements. State Farm contends that Calhoun received as an unlawful kickback the difference between the settlement proceeds it received and the sum of its professional fees and the amount it paid to Metropolitan. For example, State Farm paid a settlement amount of $50,000 for Claim No. 59-A715-266. From this $50,000, Calhoun received\n   $30,000. State Farm argues that only Calhoun's professional fees in the amount of $6,339.20 and Metropolitan's negotiated reduced bill of $2500 were recoverable. The remaining $21,160.80 represented a kickback. Pl.'s Mot. at 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants argue that issues of fact remain as to whether Calhoun in fact received a kickback because the evidence shows that, in some instances, Calhoun did not receive any sort of kickback as it was not even fully compensated for its own surgical charges. Defs.' Resp. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Indeed, although there are instances where Calhoun received a windfall as a result of the Arrangement, there are also instances where Calhoun did not even recover the amount of its own costs let alone recoup what it paid for a Metropolitan bill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC, Ex. 1. For example, in Claim No. 59325M493, Calhoun's surgical charges were $24,890.40 but the entire claim settled for only $20,000.00. TAC, Ex. 1. In that example, Calhoun did not even recoup its own surgical charges let alone recoup anything on Metropolitan's charges for the use of its surgical facility. Drawing every inference in favor of Defendants, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that Calhoun received a kickback as a result of the Arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   State Farm also argues that Calhoun purchased Metropolitan's account receivables in exchange for illegitimate patient referrals and the Arrangement as a whole was an unlawful split-fee arrangement for the purpose of referrals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that Metropolitan's bill was not provided to Calhoun for the purpose of inducing referrals but was to enable Calhoun to provide treatment to patients who did not have medical insurance or the ability to pay for recommended surgeries that were designated as \"elective.\" Defendants also argue that the Arrangement reflected the risk that Calhoun assumed because it was possible that Calhoun would not be timely paid timely or paid at all following the surgeries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, Calhoun and Metropolitan had an agreement whereby Calhoun physicians would perform surgeries at Metropolitan's facilities. A reasonable jury could find that the purpose of the Arrangement was to enable Calhoun to collect on Metropolitan's bills rather than to induce referrals. A reasonable jury could also find the opposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States. v.

In essence, State Farm argues that violations of these three statutes warrant entry of summary judgment. In opposition, Defendants distinguish the cases cited by State Farm and argue that the statutes do not require Defendants to disgorge portions of the settlement payments Defendants received.

State Farm moves for summary judgment arguing that Calhoun did not qualify for the wholly owned exemption because Calhoun was not properly supervised. Defendants argue that the wholly owned exemption is only contingent upon ownership and not any level of supervision. In relevant part, the HCCA reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A sole proprietorship, group practice, partnership, or corporation that provides health care services by licensed health care practitioners [...] and that is wholly owned by one or more licensed health care practitioners, or the licensed health care practitioners set forth in this paragraph and the spouse, parent, child, or sibling of a licensed health care practitioner\n   <em>\n    if one of the owners who is a licensed health care practitioner is supervising the business activities and is legally responsible for the entity's compliance with all federal and state laws\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20400.9905\">\n    Fla.

The Parties do not dispute that Calhoun was wholly owned by licensed practitioners-the owners were all licensed chiropractors. The dispute here hinges on the interpretation of the HCCA's requirement pertaining to supervision. State Farm argues that Section 400.9905(4)(g) imposes a requirement of supervision upon wholly owned clinics. Defendants argue that the modifying phrase-pertaining to supervision-merely explains that when a practice is \"jointly owned\" with an unlicensed person, it must be the licensed provider who is legally responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court has already decided the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order on Mot. to Dismiss SAC at 14-17.

Fla.
