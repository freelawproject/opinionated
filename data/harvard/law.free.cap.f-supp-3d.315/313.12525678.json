CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that plaintiff has stated no claim for relief under the Privacy Act, the FOIA, or the APA. As a result, the defendants' motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are granted and plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment is denied as moot. A separate order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The venue provisions of both the Privacy Act and the FOIA identify the federal district court in the District of Columbia as a proper venue for such claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(5) (Privacy Act);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4)(B) (FOIA).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    To the extent that plaintiff is challenging part of his sentence, this district court is not a reviewing court and thus lacks jurisdiction over such matters.
