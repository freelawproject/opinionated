So that you can actually stock if you're going to use distributors, you can stock the distributors and also make the product available. So one issue is just that ramping up the commercial supply and inventory to launch. One of the others is the conference sequence and really thinking about when you want to be launching and obviously, between holidays is not ideal.... And the other challenge that we have obviously is commercial scale up. You run the clinical trials with smaller batches of products. That's what the approval is based on. Then as you move to commercialization, you scale that up to support really a commercial product. And so we're doing that with respect to both Galliprant and Entyce....

We have completed the required manufacturing validation work in regards to API for both GALLIPRANT and ENTYCE. We made additional manufacturing filings with the FDA to obtain approvals that are required for commercial launch.

In response to a question regarding the \"actual launch dates\" of GALLIPRANT and ENTYCE, St. Peter gave a detailed response, quoted at length in the AC and reproduced here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   So we're not changing the timing of what we expect .... I think as we've discussed several times over the past few years, there is a lag between the approval and the product launch for these 2 products, because they're new chemical entities, and that takes several months. And so ... while the manufacturing\n   scale for FDA approval is significant, the scale that is required to support what we believe to be [two very] large commercial products is even larger. And our approach had not been to scale up all the way to that commercial scale at risk. And so what that means is significant post-approval work. And that includes, in some cases, transferring the API or active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing. In other cases, moving the formulation of the drug product or packaging and really process improvements. And so when you make those sorts of changes and moves, there's things that require various filings with the FDA to make sure that they understand everything that you're doing, and we need to let those play out before we can actually ship products to the customers. And then, of course, I think some good news, at this point, we believe that we basically made all the necessary filings. It's just a matter of playing those out. And then beyond the regulatory requirements, both Aratana and our collaborators have certain quality standards and procedures that have to be satisfied before product is released to market, and I think that's true for basically all pharmaceuticals. And so that's all what's happening over the next weeks to months to support the time lines we've articulated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   AC \u00b6 100; McDonough Decl.

The vast majority of the challenged statements, however, constitute puffery, statements of opinion, and/or forward-looking statements that cannot serve as the basis of a federal securities claim.

From the start of the Class Period, defendants repeatedly warned that (1) Aratana was dependent on third-party manufacturers,\n   (2) third-party manufacturers require FDA approval, (3) Aratana's third-party manufacturers might need to increase their manufacturing capacities to scale up for commercial release, and (4) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to secure FDA approval might impede the company's ability to bring products to market.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2014 10-K at 38-39; 2015 10-K at 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs do not-and cannot-dispute the foregoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 14, 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, they argue that defendants' statements, although couched as opinions or forward-looking statements, contained embedded assertions of fact that defendants knew to be false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-19. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that even as defendants articulated optimistic timelines for ENTYCE's commercialization, they secretly knew, but failed to disclose, that commercialization would require another round of FDA approval necessitated by Aratana's failure to find a satisfactory manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   This argument badly mischaracterizes defendants' statements. First, read in context, the statements did not \"downplay[ ] the centrality of FDA manufacturing approval\" or conceal \"an entirely separate stage of FDA approval that was essential for commercialization.\" Opp. at 3. To the contrary, from the very start of the Class Period, Aratana disclosed that commercialization of ENTYCE might require additional steps beyond mere NADA approval, including, potentially, a change in manufacturer and CVM approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 10-K at 34 (disclosing that the development of products including ENTYCE depends on \"the ability of us or our third-party manufacturers to manufacture supplies ... and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with [cGMP]\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39 (\"If the CVM ... does not approve our contract manufacturers' facilities used for the manufacture of our product candidates, or if [the CVM] withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would adversely impact our ability to develop and obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39 (\"[T]o manufacture our product candidates in the quantities that we believe would be required to meet anticipated market demand, our third-party manufacturers may need to increase manufacturing capacity, which could involve significant challenges and may require additional regulatory approvals.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Further, once Aratana began to transfer its manufacturing process to a new facility, it informed investors that the transfer had begun,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2015 10-K at 9 (\"We are currently transferring the manufacturing technology process for ... ENTYCE and scale-up required for commercialization.\"), and then updated investors as to its plan to seek regulatory approval,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2016 Q2 10-Q at 28 (\"We intend to make filings to the FDA in the third quarter of 2016, in support of the transfer of API and formulated contract manufacturing to [new manufacturers] for the production of launch inventories. FDA approval of these filings are required for product launch.\"). Once the company had done so, it then informed investors of this.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Q3 10-Q at 25 (\"We made additional manufacturing filings\n   with the FDA to obtain approvals that are required for commercial launch.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendants therefore overtly disclosed not only that ENTYCE would be produced by contract manufacturers, who would typically require FDA approval, but also, more specifically, that Aratana in fact planned to seek (and eventually did seek) such approval for ENTYCE's commercial manufacturer. Given these comprehensive disclosures of this regulatory risk, the mere fact that the risk materialized cannot support a claim under the Exchange Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acito v. IMCERA Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7407470\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/47/#p53\">\n    47 F.3d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"[D]efendants' lack of clairvoyance simply does not constitute securities fraud.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   For the same reasons, defendants cannot be said to have concealed a risk that had already metastasized into reality.\n   <em>\n    Contra\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 11-13 &amp; n.3. First, the AC does not allege that, before February 2, 2017, the CVM had already requested additional information from Aratana. And second, to the extent plaintiffs allege that the risk that had already materialized was Aratana's lack of a suitable manufacturer, defendants disclosed that fact as early as May 8, 2015, when St. Peter explained that Aratana was working to secure a commercial supply of ENTYCE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Q1 2015 Earnings Call at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2015 Q2 Earnings Call at 8 (statement by St. Peter that the company was working to secure a commercial supply agreement with a contract manufacturer). Given that Aratana had already notified investors that a transfer of manufacturing could require CVM approval,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2014 10-K at 39, the company's statements satisfactorily armed investors with all the information necessary to evaluate the risks associated with the anticipated timeline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanofi I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305013\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/510/#p534\">\n    87 F.Supp.3d at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where a \"reasonable investor had reason to know\" that pharmaceutical company's clinical trial methodology was not \"gold standard,\" \"[s]uch an investor could reasonably infer that the study design might impede or delay FDA approval\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In short, because defendants amply disclosed both the need for a new commercial-scale manufacturer and the fact that such a transfer of manufacturing responsibility might require additional regulatory approval, it is clear from the face of the AC and materials cognizable thereunder that defendants did not misrepresent or conceal from stockholders the possibility (or necessity) of a new manufacturer, of additional CVM inquiries, or of any concomitant delays in commercialization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Defendants' opinion and forward-looking statements are not actionable for a second reason. Even if these statements had contained embedded misleading statements, plaintiffs do not adequately allege that defendants at the start of the Class Period\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   the facts that made them so: to wit, that the projected timelines for ENTYCE's commercial release were overly optimistic, or that the CVM eventually would request more information regarding Aratana's commercial manufacturer.

The Remaining Challenged Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   While the foregoing discussion of puffery, opinion statements, and forward-looking statements inters plaintiffs' claims based on the vast majority of statements in the AC, several statements at issue do purport to relate historical facts so as to require a separate analysis. These include defendants' statements that they were \"working to complete the commercial supply agreement [on ENTYCE],\" AC \u00b6 79; that they were \"transferring the manufacturing technology process ... for ENTYCE and scale-up required for commercialization,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87; that they had \"commenced the process of hiring [a] sales organization\" to support ENTYCE's commercial launch,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92; that they were working to \"complete the required manufacturing validation work of formulated product and packaging to produce inventory for commercial availability,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98; and that they had \"completed the required manufacturing validation work in regards to API for ... ENTYCE,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   With respect to these statements, however, the AC contains only generalized, conclusory allegations of falsity. Indeed, apart from the first two statements, which concern the transfer of ENTYCE's manufacturing process, the AC does not directly challenge these statements at all. There is no claim that defendants misled investors as to their failure to hire a sales organization, develop appropriate packaging, or find a suitable manufacturer specifically for their active ingredients (as opposed to formulated product). Plaintiffs' allegation instead is that defendants failed to alert investors to a foreseeable regulatory delay occasioned by a transition to a commercial manufacturer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   As for the statements related to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   alleged failure-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that defendants were working toward a commercial supply agreement and transferring the manufacturing process-the AC does not contain any particularized allegations supporting that defendants' statements were false. It does not allege that defendants, in fact, were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   working to complete a commercial supply agreement, or that defendants had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   begun the transfer process. At most, plaintiffs allege that these statements falsely implied that Aratana already had an FDA-compliant facility in place to produce commercial quantities of ENTYCE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 2. But the statements express precisely the opposite. And defendants repeatedly precluded the false implication that plaintiffs conjure by explaining that Aratana was transferring the manufacturing process specifically because its clinical-trials manufacturer could not scale up to commercial distribution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 88, 100. Accordingly, there is no theory under which defendants may be held liable for these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   To plead scienter, plaintiffs must adequately allege facts showing either\n   that defendants (1) had \"motive and opportunity\" to make false or misleading statements or (2) engaged in \"conscious misbehavior or recklessness\" when they made such statements.\n   <em>\n    ATSI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512868\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/87/#p99\">\n    493 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Sufficient motive allegations 'entail concrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures alleged.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kalnit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9482966\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/131/#p143\">\n    264 F.3d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Novak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209912\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/300/#p308\">\n    216 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   307 ). \"Motives that are generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not suffice; instead, plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from the fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209912\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/300/#p308\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Under this approach, the decisive question in assessing whether an insider's sales are indicative of scienter is how many shares the insider sold during the class period relative to the total number of shares that he or she\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   sold. Such a number appropriately captures not only the fact of sales, but also the extent to which the insider availed himself or herself of, or forwent, the opportunity to turn a profit before disclosure of concealed bad news. Accordingly, the Court will include among defendants' total shareholdings both zero-cost shares of common stock and vested options, but not unvested options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Here, it appears that at least some of the options acquired by the individual defendants vested within the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McDonough Decl. Exs. 41 n.2, 55 n.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the parties have not provided the number of options that vested during the Class Period, that number appears to be slightly more than 40,000 for St. Peter, and slightly more than 14,375 for Tooman. Counting these exercisable options as shares, St. Peter's total shares decreased during the Class Period by approximately 22,600 shares, or approximately 1.9% of the 1,170,716 shares and options with which he entered the Class Period, while Tooman's total shares\n   <em>\n    increased\n   </em>\n   during the class period by approximately 40,549 shares, or approximately 15.8% of the 255,858 shares and options with which he entered the Class Period. St. Peter's minuscule overall reduction in holdings, along with Tooman's significant increase in holdings, undermine an inference that defendants, through their sales, sought to capitalize on the necessarily time-limited artificial inflation of Aratana's stock price.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bristol-Myers Squibb Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9276628\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/312/549/#p561\">\n    312 F.Supp.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (increased holdings are \"wholly inconsistent with fraudulent intent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In any event, the overall circumstances surrounding the individual defendants' sales so clearly do not plausibly support inferring scienter that the choice among these methodologies is ultimately academic. Even assuming that the Court were to disregard all options held by the individual defendants (vested as well as unvested) in calculating the extent of insider sales during the class period, the individual defendants' trading still would not establish motive. That is so for three reasons. First, even on plaintiffs' methodology, St. Peter's holdings declined by a bare 9%, while Tooman's holdings increased by approximately 34%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7407470\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/47/#p53\">\n    47 F.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (sales representing less than 11% of defendant's holdings did not support strong inference of intent to deceive);\n   <em>\n    Glaser\n   </em>\n   , 772 F.Supp.2d at 593 (\"It defies reason that an entity looking to profit on a fraudulently inflated stock price would hold close to ninety percent of its shares as prices fell,\n   <em>\n    while knowing that the information illuminating the fraud was seeping into the market\n   </em>\n   .\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Second, contrary to plaintiffs' claim, the timing of defendants' sales, fairly analyzed, is not suspicious. It does not give rise to an\n   inference of insider knowledge, at the time of the sales, of material undisclosed bad news. For instance, plaintiffs contend that St. Peter sold \"150,000 shares in late 2016, just before the end of the period-'late 2016'-when Defendants had professed that ENTYCE would have a commercial launch.\" Opp. at 20. But St. Peter sold these shares in August and December 2016-\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Aratana had already disclosed (on August 5, 2016) that it intended to file a PAS regarding the transfer of ENTYCE manufacturing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Q2 10-Q at 28. For the same reason, defendants' assertion that \"Tooman sold 30,000 shares less than two months before the Company disclosed the need for a PAS to investors,\" Opp. at 20, is simply wrong: Tooman sold these shares in September 2016, after defendants' August 5, 2016 disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McDonough Decl. Ex. 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Third, as a general matter, \"[t]rades made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lululemon Sec.

The Loan Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiffs' second argument as to motive is that the individual defendants lied about ENTYCE to allow Aratana to defer principal payments on the company's $40 million loan.

The AC falls well short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   First, the AC lacks non-conclusory allegations to support the inference that defendants knowingly withheld or misrepresented information in their possession. For instance, the AC does not cite any internal documents or confidential witness statements tending to suggest that defendants knowingly deceived shareholders. Indeed, the AC lacks any concrete allegations whatsoever regarding defendants' knowledge, apart from the information defendants themselves disclosed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 130-50; Opp. at 24. Absent concrete allegations as to defendants' knowledge, the AC cannot generate a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Second, plaintiffs argue that defendants' repeated delays of ENTYCE's commercial release \"disguise[ed] the fact there was no adequate facility to launch ENTYCE.\" AC \u00b6 130.

Viewed in conjunction with the absence of any direct evidence of defendants' guilty knowledge, these facts cast grave doubt on plaintiffs' allegations that defendants knew all along that a February 2017 release date was impossible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AstraZeneca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666825\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/559/453/#p470\">\n    559 F.Supp.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no inference of scienter where complaint alleged no \"red flag\" indicating management's knowledge and other\n   facts, such as regulatory approval of drug for other uses, made it reasonable for management to believe in their product).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   In the end, although the facts alleged in the AC do not preclude an inference of fraudulent intent, the far more compelling inference from the facts pled is that defendants believed in good faith that they would obtain regulatory approval and commercialize on the anticipated timelines, but, upon encountering setbacks and changes in marketing strategy, timely updated the market.

Dkt. 22. For the purpose of resolving the motion to dismiss, the Court assumes all well-pled facts to be true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Koch v.

The Court has also considered the documents attached to the declaration of Kevin M. McDonough in support of the motion to dismiss, Dkt. 30 (\"McDonough Decl.\"), and the document attached to the declaration of Shannon L. Hopkins in opposition to the motion to dismiss, Dkt. 32 (\"Hopkins Decl.\"). Because these documents were incorporated into the AC by reference, or are matters of public record, they are properly considered on a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of Pontiac Policemen's &amp; Firemen's Ret.
