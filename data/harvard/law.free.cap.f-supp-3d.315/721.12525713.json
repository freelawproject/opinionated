Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Neurotrope is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's Disease (\"AD\" or \"Alzheimer's\"). Bryostatin-1 (\"Bryostatin\") is Neutrotrope's lead drug candidate for AD treatment. Neurotrope claims that Bryostatin promotes protein kinase C isozyme epilson (\"PKC protein\"), which may have a role in growing synapses and in preventing synaptic loss that may correlate with the cognitive impairments associated with AD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At all relevant times, Neurotrope has employed only about five individuals, including Defendant Wilke, its Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), and Defendant Alkon, who has been Chief Scientific Officer (\"CSO\") since August 2013 and President since September 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before presenting a new drug to the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\"), pharmaceutical companies are required to engage in three phases of clinical trials, each phase growing in sample size and complexity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.21\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   The FDA's Drug Review Process: Ensuring Drugs are Safe and Effective, https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm143534.htm (last visited April 24, 2018).

Events Prior to the Class Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 17, 2015, Neurotrope issued a press release announcing that it had completed its Phase 2a study that preliminarily evaluated Bryostatin's safety, tolerability, and efficacy, as reflected by the correlation between PKC protein levels and Bryostatin plasma levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 7, 2016, Neurotrope issued a press release announcing that it had initiated its Phase 2b study to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Bryostatin. The press release stated that the study would evaluate two different doses of Bryostatin (20 or 40 \u00b5g) versus placebo, with two efficacy end points: the primary efficacy endpoint based on Severe Impairment Battery (\"SIB\") scale, a benchmark used in severe Alzheimer's drug trials; and the secondary efficacy endpoints based on Activities of Daily Living (\"ADL\"), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (\"NPI\") and Mini-Mental State Exam (\"MMSE\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 22, 2016, Neurotrope issued a press release announcing that it had completed the enrollment for the Phase 2b study. Shortly thereafter, Neurotrope received the clinical results from the study. The clinical results showed that, compared to the placebo group, patients on the 40 \u00b5g dose did not show a statistically significant increase on SIB, neither at p &lt; 0.1 nor at p &lt; 0.05. Those on the 20 \u00b5g dose, in contrast, showed a mean increase on SIB of 1.5, compared to a decrease in the placebo group of -1.1. This improvement was statistically significant at p &lt; 0.1, but not at p &lt; 0.05. The Phase 2b study was a one-sided test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Alleged Material Omissions and Misrepresentations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the period from January 30, 2017 to July 18, 2017 (the \"Class Period\"), Plaintiffs acquired Neurotrope's securities. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made material omissions and misrepresentations on five occasions during the Class Period: (1) at the Noble Financial Capital Markets' 13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Annual NobleCON Conference for investors on January 30, 2017; (2) at the 2017 BIO CEO &amp; Investor Conference on February 13, 2017; (3) in a March 24, 2017, press release and (4) in a May 1, 2017, press release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Complaint's allegations of material omissions and misstatements fall into three categories. The first category-which makes up the majority of the alleged misleading statements-consists of instances where Defendants failed to disclose that the Phase 2b study used a one-tailed test with p &lt; 0.1 for statistical analysis, instead of the alleged industry norm of two-tailed test with p &lt; 0.05. The Complaint alleges that this nondisclosure rendered misleading Defendants' statements touting positive results based on a showing of \"statistically significant\" efficacy in the Phase 2b study. For example, on January 30, 2017, the beginning of the Class Period, at the Noble Financial Capital Markets' 13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Annual NobleCON Conference for investors, Defendant Wilke announced that the Company had preliminary clinical and compassionate use patient data from the Phase 2b study, and that they saw \"remarkable results in the reversal of [AD].\" Similarly, on February 13, 2017, at the 2017 BIO CEO &amp; Investor Conference, Neurotrope announced that: \"[w]e have extensive preclinical data, clinical data, and compassionate use data that leads us to believe that our mechanism of action can be very effective in reversing [AD].\" And on May 1, 2017, Neurotrope's press release stated, \"The results of this relatively small randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of Bryostatin-1 shows that Bryostatin-1 has the potential to positively impact the lives of these severely debilitated patients with moderate to severe AD.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The second category of alleged misstatements and omissions consists of Defendants' failure to disclose until November 22, 2016, that the Phase 2b study using a 40 \u00b5g dose did not show a statistically significant result. The Complaint alleges that the May 1, 2017, press release about the result of the Phase 2b study was misleading as a result of this omission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The third category consists of instances where Defendants allegedly misrepresented Bryostatin's ability to reverse AD. For example, on March 24, 2017, Neurotrope issued a press release stating that \"Bryostatin-1 has demonstrated the potential to prevent neuronal death as well as the well-known brain pathologies, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles\" and touted \"Bryostatin's multiple efficacies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Reliance and Loss Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following the January 30, 2017, statement, Neurotrope's share price increased from $9.75 per share on January 27, 2017, to $11.58 per share on January 30, 2017, on unusually heavy trading volume. And following the February 13, 2017, statement, the stock price increased from $13.35 per share on February 10, 2017, to $15.00 per share on February 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The May 1, 2017, press release disclosed, for the first time, that the study was one-sided and that \"[a]mong the patients who completed the protocol (n = 113), the patients on the 20 \u00b5g dose at 13 weeks showed a mean increase on the SIB of 1.5 vs. a decrease in the placebo group of -1.1 (improvement of 2.6) (p &lt; 0.07) (n = 80).\" On this news, Neutrotrope's share price fell from $11.84 to $6.97, or approximately 63%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 17, 2017, Neurotrope issued a press release disclosing that the Phase 2b study at 40 \u00b5g Bryostatin showed \"no therapeutic signal.\" On this news, Neurotrope's share price fell approximately 24%, to close at $5.80 on July 20, 2017. The alleged Class period ends July 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Complaint alleges scienter based on inferences from the facts summarized above. In addition, the Complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants knew all material information about Bryostatin, by\n   virtue of their senior executive positions at Neurotrope, which had only five employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Complaint also relies on two articles. On May 3, 2017, an article was published in\n   <em>\n    Seeking Alpha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   titled \"A Neurotrope Stock Promotion Scheme is Underway, but Who's Paying for It?\" The Complaint speculates that \"Neurotrope insiders\" were responsible for the article's report that unknown persons paid to have articles by a sell-side analyst turned into paid promotional press releases distributed over a newswire service. On May 4, 2017, an analyst who goes by a pseudonym published an article in\n   <em>\n    Seeking Alpha\n   </em>\n   titled \"Behind Neurotrope, Clear and Overwhelming Links to Fraudsters,\" which further describes how Neurotrope promoted its own stock price. The articles are not attached to the Complaint and no longer appear to be available on the\n   <em>\n    Seeking Alpha\n   </em>\n   website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Second, the articles as summarized in the Complaint do not mention the Individual Defendants. Third, the articles are vague and speculative.

No. 16 Civ. 4323,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20902266\">\n     2018 WL 902266\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.N.J. Feb. 15, 2018). The case is not binding precedent and is factually distinguishable because it deals with alleged omissions regarding the design and structure of a Phase 2 trial, and not the methodology used to interpret its results. To the extent those issues are comparable, the case is consistent with Defendant's position and this Opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
