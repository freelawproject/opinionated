INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the court on a motion for preliminary injunction by Plaintiff Robert Half International Inc., which seeks to enforce restrictive covenants contained within the employment contract of a former employee, Defendant Nicholas Billingham.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 6 [hereinafter Pl.'s Mot.]. Plaintiff, a professional staffing firm, seeks to enjoin Billingham from continuing to work in the District of Columbia office of his new employer, rival staffing firm Defendant Beacon Hill Staffing, until February 2019; soliciting Plaintiff's customers; and disclosing Plaintiff's confidential information-all of which the employment contract prohibited Billingham from doing after his employment with Plaintiff ended. Plaintiff also seeks to enjoin Beacon Hill from interfering with Billingham's compliance with the restrictive covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although it gives the court no pleasure to do so because it means a young person must be separated from his employment, for the reasons set forth below, the court grants Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Billingham began working at Plaintiff's Boston office on May 27, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. It was his first job out of college.

He was hired as a Staffing Manager for Plaintiff's \"OfficeTeam\" division, which places administrative support employees, and in November 2015 was promoted to a Division Director. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. In December 2016, Billingham became a Senior Staffing Manager in the \"Accountemps\" division, which places accounting, finance, and bookkeeping employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The following year, in July 2017, Billingham transferred to Plaintiff's Washington, D.C., office, where he continued to work as an Accountemps Senior Staffing Manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. In this role, Billingham's job duties included \"developing ... business from new and existing [Robert Half] Customers,\" which he did, in part, by meeting with hiring managers and other key personnel to learn about a customer's needs and by recommending potential hires.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. He also met with\n   individuals seeking employment to assess their skills and preferences, and attempted to match these candidates to job openings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To fulfill his responsibilities at Robert Half, Billingham had access to information that Plaintiff considers and treats as \"confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information.\" Pl.'s Mot., Mem. in Supp., ECF No. 6-1 [hereinafter Pl.'s Mem.], at 6-7. Such information includes the names of existing and potential customers and candidates, as well as contact persons for those customers and candidates; the specific needs of customers and candidates; the terms of Plaintiff's agreements with customers and candidates; and the strengths and weaknesses of Plaintiff's business model.

Billingham's Employment Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a condition of his employment, Billingham was required to sign Plaintiff's standard Employment Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 26.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A., ECF No. 1-1 [hereinafter Agreement]. The Agreement imposes numerous restrictions on Billingham following the end of his employment with Robert Half, several of which are relevant to this case. First, the Agreement bars Billingham for a period of one year from working for a competitor located within 50 miles of any office of Plaintiff at which Billingham worked in the year preceding his termination or resignation. Agreement \u00a7 9;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7. Second, it restricts Billingham from disclosing Plaintiff's \"confidential information,\" including \"the name, address, contact persons or requirements of any existing or prospective customer, client, applicant, candidate or employee\" during or after his tenure at the staffing firm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8. The Agreement imposes the same limitations on information concerning Robert Half's procedures, organization, and strategies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third, the Agreement prohibits Billingham from soliciting any \"Customer,\" which the Agreement defines as \"any person, firm, entity, business or organization for whom any of the Applicable Offices performs or has performed services in the course of its business within the twelve months preceding the [employee's] [t]ermination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 7, 10. Finally, under the Agreement, Billingham is prohibited from soliciting Plaintiff's employees to leave the staffing firm, whether to work for Billingham personally or to work for another company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Agreement also contains a provision titled \"Injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14. That clause states that Billingham agrees that, \"in the event of his actual or threatened breach\" of the foregoing restrictions, \"temporary and permanent injunctive relief would be appropriate remedies against such breach,\" because Plaintiff \"would be irreparably harmed and the full extent of injury resulting therefrom would be impossible to calculate and [Plaintiff] therefore will not have an adequate remedy at law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14. That provision also recites that the employee \"expressly acknowledges\" that the aforementioned restrictions \"are reasonable and necessary in order to protect and maintain the proprietary and other legitimate interests of [Robert Half] ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   and that the enforcement thereof would not prevent [Billingham] from earning a livelihood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Billingham signed the Agreement,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, and during the ensuing four years at Robert Half he never signed a different or new version of the Agreement.

Billingham's Resignation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 23, 2018, Billingham resigned from Robert Half. Compl. \u00b6 40. He did not disclose his future professional plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Three days later, Plaintiff presented Billingham with a notice titled \"Reminder of Post-Termination Obligations,\" which reminded Billingham that he had signed the Agreement and summarized its key terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. B., ECF No. 1-2. Toward the top of the notice appears the text \"Non-Competition Covenant\" followed by \"Yes\" and \"No\" check boxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"Yes\" box is checked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 7, 2018, Billingham started his employment as a Division Manager at Defendant Beacon Hill for the company's Financial division at its newly opened District of Columbia office.

The announcement quoted Billingham as stating: \"I look forward to adding to my team quickly, and taking market share from our competitors.\" Press Release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It was through this press release that Plaintiff first learned of Billingham's new job. Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 29, at 13-14. The announcement prompted Robert Half to send Billingham a second notice, this time a letter dated March 21, 2018, that enclosed a copy of the Agreement and once more reminded him of its terms. Compl. \u00b6 47, Ex. D, ECF No. 1-4 [hereinafter March 21 Letter];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 13-14. Plaintiff sent a copy of the letter to Beacon Hill's CEO, Andrew Wang, along with the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 21 Letter at 2. In the letter, Plaintiff sought from Billingham \"written assurances\" that he understood the Agreement and would abide by its restrictions.

To be precise, Billingham has contacted at least 56 of Plaintiff's customers while in his new position. Billingham Dep. at 200 (acknowledging that he contacted 56 Robert Half \"customers\" while working at Beacon Hill). Billingham directly communicated with these contacts through LinkedIn messages, \"email blasts,\" and telephone calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. to File Suppl. Mem., Ex.

Notably, many of the businesses that Billingham contacted were already customers of Beacon Hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, during his time with Beacon Hill, Billingham has shared and has attempted to put to use information that he learned about Robert Half's customers. For instance, Beacon Hill, like other staffing firms, uses a database to track communications and information about potential and current customers. Billingham has input into Beacon Hill's database specific information that he acquired while at Robert Half about certain customers, such as one company's dissatisfaction with Robert Half's services, other companies' past use of Robert Half, and key contact information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. to File Suppl.

Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief is a non-starter unless the Agreement's restrictive covenants are enforceable. Defendants have called the Agreement's validity into question on two bases, arguing that: (1) the Agreement is void under Massachusetts law because the parties did not enter into a new contract after Billingham's employment materially changed, through internal promotions and the transfer to Washington, D.C.; and (2) the terms of the Agreement are overbroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n to Pl.'s App. For Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 19-1 [hereinafter Defs.' Opp'n], at 27-33. The court begins by addressing what law governs this dispute, and then proceeds to analyze whether the Agreement is likely valid under the applicable law and, if so, whether Plaintiff likely can show Billingham is in breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Whether Massachusetts or District of Columbia Law Governs the Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The parties disagree as to the law that governs the Agreement. Defendants contend that Massachusetts law applies until \"at least\" July 2017, when Billingham transferred to the District of Columbia office, because Massachusetts is the place where the parties entered into the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 27-28 &amp; n. 20. Under Massachusetts law, Defendants contend, \"material\" changes to an employment relationship-such as Billingham's promotions-\"void[ ]\" a restrictive covenant such as this one unless the contract is re-signed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622208,7411764\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/738/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 28-29 (citing\n   <em>\n    Iron Mountain Info.

Rather than identifying a single state law to govern all disputes, the controlling law \"floats\" depending on when and where the contract is sought to be enforced. The clause states that, in the event of a breach, \"the law[ ] of the state in which an activity occurred or threatens to occur and with respect to which legal and equitable relief is sought\" will apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Agreement \u00a7 21. The court has not found any case from this Circuit or the D.C. Court of Appeals that addresses the validity of a \"floating\" choice-of-law clause under District of Columbia law, and the parties have not cited any. But for present purposes the court need not evaluate the conscionability or public policy rationale for such a clause, as Defendants do not challenge it on such grounds. Accordingly, consistent with District of Columbia law, the court gives effect to the Agreement's choice-of-law clause because, as applied here, it bears a reasonable relationship to this jurisdiction (i.e., Billingham worked in Robert Half's District of Columbia office).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A plain reading of the text makes clear that District of Columbia is controlling.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Booker v.

[and] business and operating methods.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7353026\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/615/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3. Beacon Hill's contract shows that Plaintiff's Agreement is in line with industry standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Before moving on, the court turns briefly to Defendants' contention that the Agreement's restrictive covenants are overbroad because, for example, they would prevent Billingham from taking a job with Beacon Hill as a janitor or from contacting a company that became a customer of Plaintiff's Boston office only after Billingham's transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 31-32. The court need not indulge in this thought experiment because these hypotheticals do not resemble the instant case. The facts here raise concerns that are central to the Agreement's restrictive covenants. Billingham has taken a position at a direct competitor in the very city in which he worked for Robert Half and is performing the same type of work he did at Robert Half. The court therefore need not consider whether, in different circumstances, the Agreement's covenants would be too restrictive to be upheld.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Whether Billingham Is in Breach of the Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The last step in this part of the court's inquiry is whether Plaintiff is likely to succeed in showing that Billingham is in breach. It is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   First, Billingham's mere employment at Beacon Hill's District of Columbia office violates Section 9 of the Agreement, which prohibits him from working for a competitor that is located within 50 miles of Plaintiff's District of Columbia office for one year following his departure from Robert Half.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement \u00a7 9. Defendants do not dispute that Beacon Hill's District of Columbia office is a \"Competitor,\" as that term is defined in the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7353026\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/615/#p621\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7 (defining a \"Competitor\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 8 (noting that, when hiring for the D.C. Beacon Hill Financial Office, \"Beacon Hill did not ... ask its recruiter to target any competitors\"). Thus, from the moment Billingham began working at Beacon Hill, he was in breach of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff also is likely to succeed in proving that Billingham has violated Section 10 of the Agreement, which bars Billingham from soliciting Robert Half's customers. The evidence shows that Billingham has messaged and called dozens of Plaintiff's customers during his four months at Beacon Hill, using the connections that he developed at Robert Half, with the goal of generating business for Beacon Hill. Defendants' attempt to downplay this evidence on grounds that customers do not have exclusive relationships with staffing firms, that these contacts were existing Beacon Hill customers, or that Billingham had not yet succeeding in converting contacts into Beacon Hill customers, misses the point. The non-solicitation provision\n   bars Billingham from \"[s]olicit[ing] the trade or patronage of any Customer or perform services for any Customer,\" for a 12-month period after separating from Robert Half. Agreement \u00a7 10. The Agreement defines \"Solicit\" broadly to mean \"soliciting, inducing, attempting to induce or assist any other person ... in any such solicitation, inducement or attempted inducement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7353026\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/615/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7. And \"Customer\" is defined \"any person, firm, entity, business or organization for whom any of the Applicable Offices performs services in the course of its business within the twelve months preceding the Termination Date.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7353026\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/615/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Reading these terms together, Billingham has violated the non-solicitation provision of the Agreement by communicating with Robert Half customers for the purpose of creating business opportunities for his new employer, even if the solicitations have not yet proved successful. To Billingham's credit, he candidly admitted that his communications with the contacts developed at Robert Half were for the purpose of soliciting business. His conduct plainly violates the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, Billingham has used Robert Half's confidential business information while employed by Beacon Hill in violation of Section 8 of the Agreement. The clearest examples of this breach are the entries that Billingham made into Beacon Hill's internal database that contain client information that he learned at Robert Half, such as the contact information of a key staffer of a client of Plaintiff, a report of a client's dissatisfaction with Robert Half's services (\"used [Accountemps], not happy-spoken with her a bunch, use[s] temps\"), a client's staffing history (\"intro for BH [Beacon Hill]-placed 2 people with her while at [Robert] Half\"), and a client's current staffing needs (\"met with-might need a part time accounting [sic] next month [ ] worked with them at Half-catch up\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Database Overlap Log at 1-4. Even if some of the information Billingham entered-such as contact information of Plaintiff's customers-is not confidential in the traditional sense of the word, it nevertheless falls under the proscribed information set forth in the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement \u00a7 8. And, even if the Agreement appears overbroad in what it considers confidential information, the collection of even publicly available contact information can constitute legally protected information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan Stanley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11082924\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/150/67/#p74\">\n    150 F.Supp.2d at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"customer lists of a financial-services firm deserve trade-secret status\" under District of Columbia law). Billingham signed a contract agreeing not to disclose and use such information, yet he did so almost immediately upon arriving at Beacon Hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on its breach-of-contract claim against Billingham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Defendants, on the other hand, challenge the immediacy of any harm-pointing out that Plaintiff has not identified a single customer lost to Beacon Hill or any tangible harm caused by Billingham's communications-and argue that, in any event, money damages would fully compensate Plaintiff for its injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 23-26. For the reasons that follow, the court concludes that Plaintiff has shown that it will suffer irreparable harm if Billingham is allowed to continue work at Beacon Hill's District of Columbia office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff first points to Billingham's acknowledgment in the Agreement that a breach will cause Plaintiff irreparable harm and that injunctive relief is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 2-3, 27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Agreement \u00a7 14. Such a concession, standing alone, is not sufficient to carry the movant's burden. As the D.C. Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    Smith, Bucklin &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Sonntag\n   </em>\n   : \"Although there is a contractual provision that states that the company has suffered irreparable harm if the employee breaches the covenant and that the employee agrees to be preliminarily enjoined, this by itself is an insufficient prop.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643371,3692692\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/476/\">\n    83 F.3d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 481 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citing\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7353026\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/615/#p621\">\n    565 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   619 n.14 ). Thus, evidence of irreparable harm must come from more than the contractual agreement itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   One factor in the harm calculus is\n   <em>\n    Beacon Hill's\n   </em>\n   tacit admission that, within the personnel staffing industry, the breach of a restrictive covenant is viewed as causing irreparable harm to the former employer. As Plaintiff notes, Beacon Hill requires its own employees to sign an agreement acknowledging that a breach or attempted breach by the employee \"will cause irreparable damage to the Company.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beacon Hill Agreement \u00a7 5. Additionally, employees must \"agree[ ] that the Company shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction\" against further violations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7353026\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/615/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That both companies require near identical concessions from their employees is compelling evidence that, within the staffing industry, monetary damages cannot adequately compensate an employer for violations of its restrictive covenants. Put another way, Plaintiff's anticipation that a violation of its non-compete agreement will cause irreparable harm is a view shared by other staffing firms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff also has shown irreparable harm by virtue of Billingham's use and disclosure of Plaintiff's confidential business information. Courts in this District have recognized that the disclosure of confidential information is, by its very nature, irreparable \"because such information, once disclosed, loses its confidential nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Hospitality Staffing Sols., LLC v. Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4217492\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/736/192/#p200\">\n    736 F.Supp.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing\n   <em>\n    Council on Am.-Islamic Relations v.

Once Plaintiff's \"information is disclosed to [ ] competitors in the market,\" Plaintiff to some extent will lose\n   a competitive advantage over competitors, and \"that loss would be hard to quantify through money damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Hospitality Staffing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4217492\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/736/192/#p200\">\n    736 F.Supp.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Billingham's use and disclosure of confidential information to his new employer, therefore, cannot be cured through money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At the same time, Billingham's continued employment at Beacon Hill provides Beacon Hill a competitive advantage that it otherwise would not enjoy in the District of Columbia market. In Billingham, Beacon Hill hired someone who could hit the ground running in this geographic area, thereby allowing Beacon Hill \"to essentially skip much of the expensive, time-intensive\" investment that Robert Half made in Billingham.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reg Seneca, LLC v. Harden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3908745\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/938/852/#p860\">\n    938 F.Supp.2d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (S.D. Iowa 2013) (acknowledging that this \"would be an irreparable harm\"). The very character of the staffing industry drives home this point. This is a service industry in which relationships and information are the coin of the realm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Billingham Dep. at 194 (explaining that by \"reaching out to these contacts\" through an e-mail blast, Billingham was trying \"to build relationships to try to work with them if they ever had any needs\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37 (noting that creating matches between recruiters, candidates, and clients took \"time and effort\"). Because Billingham imported to Beacon Hill the relationships and customer knowledge that he developed at Robert Half, Beacon Hill is positioned to capitalize on Billingham's presence immediately, without having to invest resources of its own to develop him into a productive asset. The resulting competitive disadvantage suffered by Robert Half cannot be quantified or ascertained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff's need for injunctive relief is immediate. The restrictive covenant in Billingham's Agreement lasts for only another eight months, expiring in late February 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case, however, is not likely to conclude on the merits within that time. Thus, \"injunctive relief is the only means of effective enforcement\" of the restrictive covenant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compass Bank v. Hartley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5488748\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/430/973/#p983\">\n    430 F.Supp.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 983 (D. Ariz. 2006). Additionally, the record suggests that in the staffing industry, information \"goes stale.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billingham Dep. at 38. Thus, the value of Plaintiff's confidential information, which Billingham is sharing with Beacon Hill, is at its zenith now; its value will decrease with time. This too supports the need for timely injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, the court is unmoved by Defendants' contention that Plaintiff cannot establish irreparable harm because it slumbered on its rights. Defendants point out that \"43 days elapsed\" from the time Beacon Hill issued its Press Release announcing Billingham's hire to the filing of the Complaint and, after initiating suit, it took Plaintiff another two weeks to seek an injunction. Defs.' Opp'n at 23. But Plaintiff's explanation for the passage of time is reasonable. Not long after Beacon Hill publicly announced Billingham's hiring, Plaintiff sent Billingham and his new employer a letter that summarized the Agreement's restrictive covenants, enclosed the Agreement itself, and warned of potential legal consequences for violating the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 21 Letter. Then, shortly after discovering information that suggested Billingham was trading on Plaintiff's confidential information, Plaintiff filed suit. That timetable does not undermine Plaintiff's claim of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    3. Whether the Balance of Equities Favors Injunctive Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The balancing of equities also weighs in favor of granting injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As explained above, Plaintiff has shown that it will suffer irreparable harm should Billingham continue to work for Beacon Hill. The need for timely injunctive relief to minimize or prevent such harm is apparent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   An injunction preventing Billingham from working in the industry and markets he knows best will no doubt harm him and his employer. That harm, however, is mitigated by two factors. First, the restraint is temporary. At most, it will run eight months, until the one-year anniversary of his resignation from Plaintiff, and it will not prevent him from working in the staffing services industry more than 50 miles from Plaintiff's District of Columbia and Boston offices (although the court recognizes the challenges associated with doing so). Moreover, Billingham and Beacon Hill brought this harm upon themselves. Billingham, of course, knew about the Agreement's restrictive covenants and Beacon Hill, at a minimum, learned about them soon after hiring Billingham, but before he began work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. to File Suppl. Mem., Ex. D, ECF No. 18-6 [hereinafter Mulhern Dep.], at 188 (Beacon Hill's corporate representative acknowledging that on February 28, 2018, Billingham e-mailed him Robert Half's reminder of the Agreement). Yet, the evidence shows that Defendants disregarded Billingham's commitments under the Agreement. Billingham testified that,\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he started work, on February 28, 2018, he forwarded a copy of the \"Reminder of Post-Termination Obligation,\" Compl., Ex. B, ECF No. 1-2, to Bryan Mulhern, Beacon Hill's regional director and Billingham's future supervisor. Mulhern advised him \"not to give it any thought.\" Billingham Dep. at 268. Mulhern's testimony corroborates this account: He admitted receiving the Reminder of Post-Termination Obligation from Billingham, and he advised Billingham via e-mail: \"I wouldn't give it much thought. If they want to they may send a threat when they learn where you have gone. If they do that, then we will decide if and how we want to respond.\" Mulhern Dep. at 191-92. Mulhern further testified that, after Billingham and Beacon Hill received the \"threat letter,\" he forwarded it to legal counsel, but did nothing else to ensure that Billingham did not run afoul of the restrictive covenants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196-98. Beacon Hill's cavalier approach is the reason Defendants find themselves where they are today. Accordingly, the court finds that the balance of the equities supports the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    4. Whether an Injunction Is in the Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   That leaves the question whether Plaintiff's requested injunction is in the public interest. The court concludes that it is. The public has an interest in enforcing contractual agreements and ensuring the confidentiality of a private business's information and trade secrets, \"which is necessary for free and fair competition.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hospitality Staffing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4217492\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/736/192/#p200\">\n    736 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   201 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan Stanley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11082924\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/150/67/#p74\">\n    150 F.Supp.2d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting injunctive relief and finding that \"the court serves the public interest in protecting trade-secret client lists and other confidential information\"). Defendants' argument to the contrary-that \"[t]he public has a strong interest in allowing a person to employ his talents in a useful manner in the field of his choosing,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 42-ignores the fact that Billingham voluntarily agreed to the work for a company that subjected him to restrictive covenants and that Beacon Hill, too, uses non-compete agreements to protect its interests. Accordingly, this final factor weighs in favor of issuing preliminary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Injunctive Relief as to Beacon Hill\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Because the injunction against Billingham will accomplish the same result\n   as Plaintiff's requested injunction against Beacon Hill, the court only briefly addresses Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief as to Beacon Hill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 25-27. And, because the harm and equitable considerations are the same as discussed above, the court need focus only on whether Plaintiff's claim against Beacon Hill, tortious interference with contract, is likely to succeed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Beacon Hill tortiously interfered with its contractual relationship with Billingham, specifically the Agreement's restrictive covenants. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 84-96. To prove such a claim, Plaintiff must show: (1) the existence of a valid contractual or other business relationship; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the relationship; (3) the defendant's intentional interference with that relationship; and (4) resulting damages.\n   <em>\n    Newmyer v. Sidwell Friends Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769513\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/1023/#p1038\">\n    128 A.3d 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038-39 (D.C. 2015). These elements, if established, make out a prima facie case of tortious interference, whereupon the burden shifts to the defendant to show that its conduct was justified or privileged.\n   <em>\n    Onyeoziri v. Spivok\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7313528\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/44/279/#p286\">\n    44 A.3d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 286-87 (D.C. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The court already has determined that elements one, two, and four are supported by record evidence. As to the third element, the record shows intentional interference by Beacon Hill. As discussed above, Billingham made Beacon Hill aware of both the Agreement and Robert Half's admonitions to comply with its restrictive covenants. Yet, Beacon Hill continued to employ Billingham. Furthermore, according to Mulhern's testimony, despite having received the Agreement, Beacon Hill did not undertake any steps to prevent Billingham from sharing information he had learned through his former employment or from contacting Plaintiff's customers, especially customers with whom Billingham worked and developed relationships.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mulhern Dep. at 197-98. Plaintiff thus has made out a prima facie case of tortious interference with contract. Beacon Hill, in response, offers no justification or privilege for its role in Billingham's violations of the Agreement's restrictive covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, the court finds that Robert Half is likely to succeed on its tortious interference claim against Beacon Hill. Accordingly, Plaintiff also is entitled to injunctive relief as to Beacon Hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 6, is granted. Plaintiff will be required to post a cash bond with the Clerk of the Court in the amount of Billingham's base salary from the date of this Memorandum Opinion until February 23, 2019. A separate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Oddly, the Agreement does not expressly list the prohibition on non-disclosure of confidential information as one of the restrictions that is reasonable and necessary to protect Plaintiff's business interests and the breach of which would result in irreparable harm.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7313528\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/44/279/#p286\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 14. That said, the \"Injunction\" clause does begin by stating that, \"In view of Employee's access to confidential information and trade secrets and in consideration of the value of such property to Employer and other RHI Companies,\" Billingham agrees to injunctive remedies in the event of a breach.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7313528\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/44/279/#p286\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Beacon Hill disputes that staffing companies have \"customers\" in the proprietary or exclusive sense, as it is common in the industry for companies seeking to hire or for individuals seeking a job to work with more than one staffing agency. Plaintiff does not dispute this characterization. It is within this context that the court uses the term \"customer\" in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    While the parties were conducting discovery, Defendants responded to Plaintiff's Complaint with a Motion to Dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss Verified Compl., ECF No. 15. The court does not address that motion in this Memorandum Opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Boston office is covered by the non-compete because it qualifies as an \"Applicable Office,\" as defined by the Agreement, because he worked there within a year of his resignation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 7, 9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Plaintiff also alleges that Billingham has facilitated, either directly or indirectly, the solicitation of at least one of its employees to work for Beacon Hill, which would constitute a violation of Section 11 of the Agreement. Compl. \u00b6 67;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Agreement \u00a7 11. Plaintiff has not, however, substantiated this allegation with actual evidence at this juncture.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Mot. to File Suppl. Mem., Mem. in Supp., ECF No. 18-2, at 7 n. 4. Therefore, the court does not discuss this alleged violation as a ground for injunctive relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The choice-of-law provision states, in its entirety:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n    21.\n    <em>\n     Governing Law\n    </em>\n    . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which an activity occurred or threatens to occur and with respect to which legal and equitable relief is sought, without reference to such state's choice of law rules.

In\n    <em>\n     Iron Mountain\n    </em>\n    , the court characterized the changed work condition as \"a material, negative change\" because a new compensation system would result in a reduction in pay.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5170391\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/455/124/#p132\">\n     455 F.Supp.2d at 132\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
