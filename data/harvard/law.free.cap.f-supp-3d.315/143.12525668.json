INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 10, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") published a final rule \"deeming\" cigars, pipe tobacco, and certain other products (e.g., e-cigarettes) subject to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FD &amp; C Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (\"TCA\"). Known as the \"Deeming Rule,\" the FDA's action subjects these newly \"deemed\" products to comparable statutory and regulatory requirements already imposed on cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco. At the same time, the FDA promulgated a separate rule, referred to as the \"User Fee Rule,\" which assesses \"user fees\" on manufacturers and importers of cigars and pipe tobacco, but not other newly deemed products, like e-cigarettes. The FDA is statutorily authorized\n   to collect user fees for the purpose of funding the FDA's regulation of tobacco products under the FD &amp; C Act and the TCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are three non-profit associations that represent cigar manufacturers, importers, distributors, suppliers, and consumers, as well as premium cigar and tobacco retail shops. They brought this action in July 2016 against the FDA and its Commissioner, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and its Secretary (collectively, \"Defendants\"), challenging the Deeming Rule and the User Fee Rule on a host of grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For reasons explained later in this opinion, not all of Plaintiffs' challenges to the Rules are presently before the court. Instead, the court addresses only the following subset of challenges: (1) the imposition of health warning requirements for cigar packaging and advertisements; (2) the assessment of user fees on cigar and pipe tobacco products, but not on another newly deemed product, e-cigarettes; (3) the treatment of retailers who blend pipe tobacco in-store as \"manufacturers\" subject to the regulatory requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387e ; and (4) the classification of pipes as \"components\" of tobacco products, thereby subjecting pipe makers to regulation. Plaintiffs also have moved to preliminarily enjoin implementation and enforcement of the Deeming Rule's health warning requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the court grants in part and denies in part the parties' cross-motions for partial summary judgment and denies Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction as moot. The Deeming Rule's health warning requirements are upheld in all respects, as is the User Fee Rule in its entirety. The court also affirms the agency's classification of pipes as \"components or parts\" of tobacco products under the TCA. The court, however, concludes that Defendants' rationale for subjecting retailers who blend pipe tobacco in-store to the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387e is arbitrary and capricious and therefore remands that issue to the FDA for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2009, Congress enacted the TCA to \"provide authority to the [FDA] to regulate tobacco products under the [FD &amp; C Act] by recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products,\" and \"to authorize the [FDA] to set national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of ingredients used in such products,\" among other purposes. Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-31, \u00a7 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Stat.%201776\">\n    123 Stat. 1776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1781-82 (2009). Congress made 49 legislative findings in the Act, in which it acknowledged the \"inherent dangerous[ness]\" of tobacco products and nicotine and the strong public interest in regulating tobacco products and their advertising and promotion, and discussed Congress's interest in reducing youth tobacco use, in light of judicial findings that major U.S. tobacco companies specifically targeted and marketed their products to youth. TCA \u00a7 2. Congress further recognized that no other federal agency except the FDA \"possesses\n   the scientific expertise needed to implement effectively all provisions of the [TCA].\" TCA \u00a7 2(45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In light of those findings, the TCA authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products. TCA \u00a7 901, codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387a (entitled \"FDA authority over tobacco products\"). The legislation immediately subjected \"all cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco\" to a panoply of statutory and regulatory requirements, and also reserved future application of the TCA to \"any other tobacco products that the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] by regulation\n   <em>\n    deems\n   </em>\n   to be subject to this chapter.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387a(b) (emphasis added). Congress defined \"tobacco product\" to mean \"any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product (except for raw materials other than tobacco used in manufacturing a component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20321\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rr)(1).

Proposed Rule\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the years following Congress's enactment of the TCA, cigar products were free from FDA regulation because cigars were not expressly listed in the Act's definition of \"tobacco product.\" A harbinger of change arrived in the spring of 2014. On April 25, 2014, the FDA issued a Proposed Rule that would make, or \"deem,\" cigars, pipe tobacco, and e-cigarettes subject to the TCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. 23,142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Apr. 25, 2014) (\"Proposed Deeming Rule\"). In the Proposed Deeming Rule, the FDA announced for consideration two options which \"would provide two alternatives for the scope of the deeming provisions and, consequently, the application of the additional specific provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n    at 23,143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Health Warning Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs' primary challenge is to the Deeming Rule's health warning requirements, which they assert violate the First Amendment, the TCA, and the APA. The court first assesses whether the Deeming Rule's health warning requirements run afoul of the TCA and the APA, and then turns to consider their constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    1. TCA and APA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs' TCA and APA challenges to the Deeming Rule's health warning requirements are two-fold. First, they assert that the agency failed to make the findings required by the TCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f(d)(1), to justify the warning requirements. And second, Plaintiffs contend that the agency violated the APA because it failed to explain why the existing FTC warning scheme was inadequate, opting instead to crowd out and restrict manufacturers' ability to communicate with consumers by imposing a requirement to cover 30 percent of two panels of a cigar box and 20 percent of any advertisement with warnings. The court rejects these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As to their first argument, Plaintiffs claim that the FDA made \"no determination at all about the warnings' effect on decreasing cigar or pipe tobacco use,\" and thus failed to adhere to the statutory mandate provided by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f(d)(1). Pls.' Mot. at 34. In pertinent part, that section of the TCA authorizes the FDA to \"impose restrictions on the advertising and promotion of a tobacco product\" \"if the [agency] determines that such regulation would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f(d)(1). The agency's finding\n   \"shall be determined with respect to the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product,\" and must take into account: \"(A) the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products; and (B) the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361231\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/106/196/#p206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, the agency did not assess whether the warnings would have any effect on decreasing cigar and pipe tobacco use, and even conceded that it could not make the statutorily-mandated finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

The FDA first connected the Deeming Rule as a whole to the public health standard, stating that it \"believes that the sale and distribution restrictions the Agency is proposing,\" including the \"health warning requirements,\" \"meet the public health standard set forth in\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f(d)(1).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. at 23,146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FDA specifically \"concluded that the restrictions would be appropriate for the protection of the public health with respect to the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including the increased likelihood that existing users will quit using tobacco products and the decreased likelihood that new users will initiate tobacco product use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The agency made this statutory determination based on a the following factors: \"available data on the addictiveness of nicotine\" and nicotine's corresponding deleterious effects on the developing adolescent brain; the fact that newly deemed \"combustible products like cigars, pipes, and waterpipes, are known causes of adverse health effects, including certain cancers and heart disease\"; and evidence of the potential that users of the newly deemed products would migrate to cigarettes or other regulated products.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The agency explained that once finalized, the Deeming Rule's provisions \"may lead to a decline in youth initiation for covered products\" and \"avert cigarette usage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Failure to act and promulgate the Deeming Rule, according to the FDA, created the risk that such inaction would \"reinforce consumers' existing confusion and misinformation about these products' safety or lack of harmfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the agency made express findings connecting the Deeming Rule generally to the cessation and prevention of cigar and pipe tobacco use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The FDA also made findings specific to the importance and efficacy of the health warnings. Under sections titled \"Effectiveness of Warnings\" and \"Proposed Addictiveness Warning\" in the Proposed Deeming Rule, the agency observed: (1) \"The use of tobacco packages to help consumers better understand and appreciate tobacco-related health risks has a number of advantages\"; (2) \"Requiring health warnings in advertisements similarly is an important means of helping consumers better understand and appreciate the health consequences of tobacco use\"; (3) \"FDA believes that the proposed warnings will be effective in helping consumers better understand and appreciate critical information\"; (4) \"Research has shown that using the largest possible lettering can increase warning effectiveness and increasing font size aids communication\"; (5) \"The content of the proposed messages also indicates that they should help consumers understand and appreciate the health risks\"; and (6) \"The absence of a health warning requirement\n   for other tobacco products could reinforce the existing false sense of security that youth have about the safety of those products.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,164 -65.

The FDA reiterated and incorporated these findings in the final Deeming Rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 81 Fed.

First, Plaintiffs fault the FDA for making the statutorily required findings only in the Proposed Deeming Rule, and not the final version. Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Pls.' Mots. for a Prelim. Inj. &amp; Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 78 [hereinafter Pls.' Reply], at 30. But that is incorrect. Not only does the final rule expressly incorporate the findings from the Proposed Deeming Rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   81 Fed. Reg. at 29,062, but the agency also responded to comments questioning the need and efficacy of warning requirements, and it rejected those views,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29,063. Accordingly, the agency's findings are adequately reflected in the record after the public had the opportunity of notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs assert that FDA \"merely mouths the words of the statute, eschews any serious analysis, and hedges its language.\" Pls.' Reply at 30. But that contention also is misplaced, as both the Proposed Deeming Rule and the final Deeming Rule contain multiple pages devoted to \"the effects of larger health warnings on cigars and pipe tobacco,\" which Plaintiffs claim is lacking,\n   <em>\n    id. See\n   </em>\n   81 Fed. Reg. at 28,982, 28,988 -89, 29,060-73;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. at 23,146, 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,162 -70. Thus, FDA did more than simply regurgitate the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs assert that FDA itself conceded the lack of connection between the required health warnings and the likelihood of reducing cigar and pipe tobacco use, when it admitted that \"there has not yet been extensive research regarding the effectiveness of health warnings on tobacco products other than cigarettes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. at 23,165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as Defendants explain, that excerpt, derived from the agency's Regulatory Impact Analysis, addresses the agency's inability to\n   <em>\n    quantify\n   </em>\n   the benefits of the Deeming Rule's warning requirements prior to their implementation date. The agency did not concede, as Plaintiffs insist, the absence of any connection between health warnings and reducing and discouraging cigar and pipe tobacco use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In any event, the relative absence of such studies is not fatal. \"It is not infrequent that the available data does not settle a regulatory issue and the agency must then exercise its judgment in moving from the facts and probabilities on the record to a policy conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is precisely what the agency did here. It extrapolated from its experience with other tobacco products-particularly cigarettes-to reach its determination that the health warnings are appropriate for the public health and likely to affect cigar and pipe tobacco usage, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f(d)(1).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. at 23,165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"FDA believes that the fundamental similarities between cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and other tobacco products allow for the application of data regarding\n   the effectiveness of cigarette and smokeless tobacco warnings to warnings for other tobacco products.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Although there has not yet been extensive research regarding the effectiveness of health warnings on tobacco products other than cigarettes,\n   <em>\n    existing studies support the use of these messages\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added) (citations omitted) ). Thus, the agency's determination that health warnings will likely reduce and prevent cigar and pipe tobacco use, despite limited research studies specific to those newly deemed products, was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that the \"agency cannot seriously contend ... that quantitative data was beyond its grasp,\" as it \"had\n   <em>\n    sixteen years\n   </em>\n   and an entire nation's worth of data to examine the efficacy of the FTC warnings.\" Pls.' Reply at 31. Plaintiffs, however, have identified no requirement, statutory or otherwise, that compelled the FDA to undertake such studies to make the findings required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f(d)(1).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Wildlands v.

Cir. 2008) (\"[I]n the absence of available evidence, Congress does not require the agency to conduct its own studies.\"). Plaintiffs' TCA challenge to the health warning requirements therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs' APA challenge to the warning requirements suffers the same fate. To the extent Plaintiffs suggest that the warnings mandate violates the APA because the agency failed to make the requisite findings under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f(d)(1), the court rejects the argument for the reasons already stated. Plaintiffs offer two other arguments under the APA. First, they assert that the Deeming Rule's health warning requirements are arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to consider, as an alternative, adopting the existing FTC scheme already in place for much of the cigar industry, which would have been less costly and less burdensome to integrate. And, second, they argue that the warning requirements placed on the cigar industry are disproportionately more onerous than those placed on the cigarette industry, even though the FDA has determined that cigarettes occupy \"the most dangerous end of the risk continuum.\" Pls.' Mot. at 36. Neither argument is convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As to Plaintiffs' first argument, the court takes issue with the notion that the \"baseline\" for warning statements on cigar packaging and advertising\n   <em>\n    begins\n   </em>\n   with the FTC warning scheme. Plaintiffs cite no case requiring one agency to use as its starting point restrictions adopted by another agency, especially when the other agency's restrictions arose not from rulemaking but from a consent agreement with the regulated parties and, importantly, do not cover all regulated products. In that respect, this case differs materially from\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   , relied upon by Plaintiffs. There, the agency failed to consider, without explanation, an alternative regulatory approach, which the agency itself previously had endorsed as a way of achieving regulatory objectives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, the alternative endorsed by Plaintiffs-the FTC consent orders-was the result of another agency's enforcement action and compromise and pre-dates the Deeming Rule by nearly fifteen years.\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   therefore did not compel the FDA to take as its starting point the FTC warnings scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In developing its own cigar warnings regime, the FDA was well within its discretion to look elsewhere.

Plaintiffs assert that the Deeming Rule is unconstitutional because it unjustifiably and dramatically increases the size of health warnings already required by the FTC consent orders on cigar packages and advertisements, thereby crowding out and restricting the space available to manufacturers and retailers to communicate with consumers. Defendants counter that the Deeming Rule does not restrict the speech of cigar manufacturers or retailers, but instead merely requires Plaintiffs to make accurate health-related disclosures reasonably aimed at \"help[ing] consumers better understand and appreciate the risks and characteristics of tobacco products,\" and does not otherwise impose an undue burden, and thus falls well within the limits of the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

There, the New Jersey Supreme Court approved an attorney guideline prohibiting attorneys from advertising using complimentary quotations from judicial opinions, unless the full text of the judicial opinion appeared in full.\n   <em>\n    Dwyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179931\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/275/#p284\">\n    762 F.3d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Observing that the challenged guideline \"bears characteristics\" of both a disclosure requirement and a restriction on speech, the Third Circuit ultimately opted to analyze the disclosure requirement under\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   . And, applying\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   , the court found the full-opinion disclosure requirement unduly burdensome and thus struck down the rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179931\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/275/#p284\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179931\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/275/#p284\">\n    at 282-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, although\n   <em>\n    Dwyer\n   </em>\n   helps Plaintiffs in one sense-an example of a case invalidating a disclosure requirement even under\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   's more lenient standard-it does not help them establish that\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   is the appropriate test here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Having concluded that\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   's test is the correct one to apply in this case, the court now turns to assess whether the Deeming Rule's health warning statement requirements withstand scrutiny under that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   ii.

Plaintiffs argue that the Deeming Rule fails to satisfy even this \"relaxed standard.\" They identify what they contend are three fatal flaws. First, they maintain that the government has not identified a \"substantial\" government interest that can sustain the Deeming Rule's disclosure requirement. Second, Plaintiffs assert that the warning statement disclosures are not reasonably related to any government interest.

The health warning requirements have an effective date of August 10, 2018. In the lead up to that date, the cigar industry has expended millions of dollars in designing and creating new, conforming packaging-a fact that the FDA does not contest. However, months\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the effective date's arrival, the FDA issued an ANPRM, \"seeking comments, data, results or other information that may inform regulatory actions FDA might take with respect to premium cigars.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C901\">\n    83 Fed.

For example, the ANPRM asks for \"[s]tudies or information on the required warning statements, ... which will be required to appear on cigar packaging and advertising in the near future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C901\">\n    at 12,904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The sheer breadth of the ANPRM begs the obvious question: Might the FDA in the near future do away with the health warning requirements for premium cigars? And yet another: Why is the agency insisting that the premium cigar industry expend millions of dollars to conform to regulatory mandates that might be rescinded only months after their effective date? The FDA provides no satisfactory response to either question. Whatever the answers, one thing is certain: Requiring the premium cigar industry to incur substantial compliance costs while the agency comprehensively reassesses the wisdom of regulation,\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the warnings requirements go into effect, smacks of basic unfairness. In the court's view, the prudent course would be for FDA to stay the warnings requirement as to premium cigars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The court's displeasure with the FDA's handling of the status of premium cigars, no doubt, provides little consolation to the industry.

Nor is an agency's present willingness to consider new information necessarily an indictment of its past decision-making. As the D.C. Circuit recently observed: \"[A] change in an agency's course in reaction to new information does not indicate that its initial course was necessarily arbitrary and capricious when charted.\"\n   <em>\n    New Eng.

Nor does the ANPRM affirmatively state or suggest that the regulatory regime\n   <em>\n    will change\n   </em>\n   as to premium cigars.

Thus, the agency's decision here to re-analyze the status of premium cigars, even before the warning requirements go into effect, is not \"smoking gun\" evidence of prior arbitrary and capricious rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The court's power to act is limited in yet another way. The present posture of this case does not offer a basis on which to enjoin enforcement of the Deeming Rule's warning requirements during the pendency of the FDA's newly announced rulemaking process. The court already has rejected Plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional challenges to the warning requirements, so the court has found no violation to be remedied. Additionally, Plaintiffs agreed to defer litigating their claim under the APA that the FDA's decision not to adopt \"Option Two,\" i.e., the option that would have excluded premium cigars from regulation, was itself arbitrary and capricious (Count V).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Status Report (dated Sept. 8, 2017), ECF No. 53, \u00b6 4. Therefore, there is no claim presently before the court that contests the agency's basis for subjecting premium cigars to regulation in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Nor have Plaintiffs made a different challenge, namely to the FDA's refusal to stay the warnings requirement as to premium cigars during the pendency of the present rulemaking process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

The agency has delayed implementing regulations in seemingly similar circumstances. For instance, the FDA decided to delay other aspects of the Deeming Rule in July 2017 when it announced its intention to engage in rulemaking, and \"to begin a public dialogue,\" concerning lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive levels through product-standard setting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA Press Release (announcing delay of deadline to submit tobacco product review applications for newly regulated tobacco\n   products to \"afford the agency time to explore clear and meaningful measures to make tobacco products less toxic, appealing[,] and addictive\").

Plaintiffs do not challenge the FDA's decision to assess user fees on domestic manufacturers and importers of cigars and pipe tobacco in order to fund the FDA's regulation of tobacco products. Instead, they challenge the FDA's decision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to assess user fees on e-cigarettes, another newly deemed tobacco product. According to Plaintiffs, this \"selective implementation of a user fee\" is unlawful for three reasons. Pls.' Mot. at 40. First, they assert that the FDA incorrectly concluded that it did not have statutory authority to impose user fees on e-cigarettes under the TCA. Second, they argue that charging only some newly deemed products impermissibly imposes a \"tax,\" rather than a user fee. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the selective imposition of the User Fee Rule violates the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The court concludes that the FDA's decision not to impose the User Fee Rule on e-cigarettes is compelled by statute and, even if the statute were ambiguous or silent, is a reasonable interpretation of the TCA deserving of deference. Additionally, the court rejects Plaintiffs' characterization of the user fee as a \"tax,\" along with Plaintiffs' contention that imposing the User Fee Rule only on some newly \"deemed\" products violates the Fifth Amendment.

Section 387s(a) provides that user fees must be assessed \"in accordance\n   <em>\n    with this section\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20387\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (s)(a) (emphasis added). The \"section\" itself does not expressly provide an allocation among\n   classes of tobacco products, but instead, in a subsection titled \"[a]llocations,\" states that \"[t]he applicable percentage of each class of tobacco product described in clause (i) for a fiscal year shall be the percentage determined under\" FETRA \"for each such class of product for such fiscal year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 387s(b)(2)(B)(ii). Two features of this provision are noteworthy. The first is that the provision refers to the applicable percentages for the classes of tobacco products \"described in clause (i).\" \"[C]lause (i)\" \"describes\" only six classes of tobacco products; it does not contemplate an allocation for any newly deemed products, unless among the listed six. The second critical feature is that the allocation among the enumerated six classes of tobacco products is supposed to be done in the manner Congress set forth in FETRA. FETRA in turn identifies the same six classes of tobacco products named in \"clause (i),\" or Section 387s(b)(2)(B)(i), and it too does not contemplate an allocation for any product other than the listed six. The percentages specified in FETRA for each of the six classes total 100 percent.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.13. Thus, to harmonize these provisions, the user fees assessed under the TCA among the six tobacco products listed in \"clause (i)\" must be allocated using the FETRA percentages, up to 100 percent. Any other reading would not \"be in accordance with this section.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387s(a). Plaintiffs offer no satisfactory explanation as to how, consistent with the TCA's directions, the agency could reduce the pro rata share of each of the six listed tobacco products to create a seventh share for e-cigarettes (or an eighth share for other newly deemed products, and so on) or how such a re-allocation would be determined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 518d(c)(1) ; 81 Fed. Reg. at 28,709. The FDA's interpretation of the TCA's user fees provision therefore is the natural one, and is not foreclosed by Plaintiffs' contrary reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Stifled by the statutory text, Plaintiffs resort to policy arguments to support their reading. They contend that Congress could not have intended to allow newly deemed tobacco products, like e-cigarettes, to become a free rider in funding the TCA's regulatory scheme. As Plaintiffs put it: \"There is no provision in the statute for regulating a class of tobacco products and requiring other classes of products to pay the necessary costs of such regulation.\" Pls.' Reply at 34. That argument is not without some force. After all, it does seem unfair that a newly deemed product increasingly used among youth and adults alike does not have to pay its fair share.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicopure Labs, LLC v.

But the argument ultimately proves unpersuasive. The agency cannot legislate when Congress has clearly spoken. This is an area better left for Congress to consider in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In sum, the statute plainly provides that if one day deemed to be \"tobacco products\" by the FDA, \"cigars\" and \"pipe tobacco\" \"shall\" be subject to user fees to fund the statutory scheme. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387s(b)(2)(B). The text, however, contains no such mandate with regard to e-cigarettes, despite evidence that Congress was aware of their existence at the time it passed the TCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply in Supp. of Cross-Mot., ECF No. 80, at 20 (citing 155 Cong. Rec. H6626 (June 12, 2009) ). The statutory text could be no clearer: The\n   agency was compelled to assess user fees only on the six classes of tobacco products enumerated in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Step Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In the court's view, the plain text of the TCA mandates the assessment of user fees only on those enumerated classes of tobacco products. But, even assuming that the plain text of the TCA does not unambiguously compel the FDA's interpretation, and proceeding to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's second step, the court holds, for the reasons stated above, that the FDA has offered in the User Fee Rule a \"reasonable explanation of how its interpretation serves the statute's objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Broads. v.

Cir. 2015). The court therefore defers to the agency's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   When promulgating the final User Fee Rule, the FDA addressed public comments asserting that the agency was required by statute to assess fees on all deemed tobacco products, including those outside the six classes. 81 Fed. Reg. at 28,709 -14. In its responses, the FDA explained its belief that assessing user fees on classes of tobacco products beyond the six listed in the TCA and FETRA was prohibited by the text of the statute, but also explained that even if the statute were silent or ambiguous, its interpretation was a reasonable one.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28,711 -12. Moreover, in response to comments arguing that the FDA abandon the tax-based methodology from FETRA altogether, or even adopt a metric proposed by the public, the FDA explained that it was interpreting the text to prohibit the assessment of user fees on any class of tobacco products beyond the six listed in the TCA in part because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   [I]t is reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend FDA to develop a new system that departs from the methodology mandated by FETRA. Any such system would necessarily be subjective, especially relative to the system Congress established for the enumerated six classes. As such, FDA's interpretation is a reasonable construction of the [TCA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28,712. In light of the FDA's reasonable-and in the court's view, compelled-interpretation of the statute, the court concludes that the User Fee Rule is entitled to deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <em>\n    2. The User Fees Are Not a \"Tax\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Plaintiffs' assertion that the uneven application of the User Fee Rule imposes a \"tax\" on the tobacco products assessed is readily dismissed. The court understands Plaintiffs to argue that, by excepting e-cigarette makers from paying a user fee, the FDA is not imposing on other tobacco products a \"user fee,\" as that term is commonly understood, but instead a \"tax,\" which the FDA does not have the authority to impose. According to Plaintiffs, a \"user fee\" is: \"(1) predicated on a voluntary act by a payer; (2) paid for a specific service or benefit, including the 'benefit' of regulation; and (3) not meant for the benefit of others.\" Pls.'

Or, Congress could have decided that incorporating the FETRA scheme-and its readily available data-was the best way to assess user fees, as manufacturers and importers\n   already were providing information and paying fees pursuant to FETRA.

Plaintiffs also contend that because the text of Section 387e distinguishes the manufacturer from \"the person who makes final delivery or sale to the ultimate consumer or user,\" then any retailer who blends pipe tobacco cannot be the person who \"manufacture[s], prepar[es], compound[s], or process[es].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Thus, Plaintiffs conclude, Section 387e's textual reference to a \"person who makes final delivery or sale to the ultimate consumer or user\" dictates the conclusion that a retailer, typically the entity which makes the final delivery or sale of a tobacco product to the ultimate consumer or user, cannot be subject to the same requirements as a \"manufacturer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20387\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   For its part, the FDA defends its action by pointing to the definition of \"tobacco product manufacturer\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20387\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (20), which is the TCA's general definitional section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

At a minimum, Defendants argue, pipe tobacco blending qualifies as \"assembling\" or \"processing\" a tobacco product and therefore blenders are subject to regulation under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Starting with Plaintiffs' arguments, the court finds them unpersuasive. The court\n   agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs incorrectly read Section 387e to exclude any and all retailers from its reach. A person's designation as a \"retailer\" does not preclude application of Section 387e ; instead, the focus of the statutory text is on the activity that the person undertakes. If a person in fact \"engage[s] in the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product,\" then he or she is covered by the plain terms of the provision. It matters not, for purposes of Section 387e, whether that establishment is also a retailer. Indeed, crediting Plaintiffs' reading would-as Defendants point out-lead to the absurd conclusion that an establishment could undertake the full manufacture of a tobacco product, but not be subject to Section 387e, as long as it was the entity that made the final sale to the ultimate consumer. The statutory text cannot bear such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   At the same time, the court cannot accept the agency's interpretation of Section 387e because its reliance on the general definition of \"tobacco product manufacturer\" to interpret that section is misplaced. Section 387e does not incorporate, as Defendants seem to assert, Section 387(20)'s definition of \"tobacco product manufacturer.\" To the contrary, all of Section 387e's requirements are triggered upon a person \"first engaging in the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product,\" which action compels the person to register with the FDA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387e(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20387\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 387e(d), (g), (j) (imposing requirements upon persons \"required to register under this section\"). Thus, the threshold question under Section 387e is whether the blending of pipe tobacco constitutes \"the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of tobacco product,\" not whether a person who engages in blending meets the general definition of \"tobacco product manufacturer.\" To cross-reference a defined term that appears nowhere in Section 387e, as Defendants have done, does not answer that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   It may be that the act of blending pipe tobacco does constitute the \"manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product,\" but the agency neither makes that argument here nor did it make it during the rulemaking process.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   81 Fed.

Neither the pipe nor the pipe tobacco has any independent use or function apart from the other, and Plaintiffs do not assert otherwise. Only when used together do the two create a consumable tobacco product, which is of course the object of regulation under the TCA. None of the definitions of the key terms requires the material regulated to be \"integrated\" into the tobacco product, as Plaintiffs contend.

But even if Plaintiffs are right that \"additives\" and \"ingredients\" suggest some degree of \"integration\" into the tobacco product, that reading does not foreclose a pipe from fitting the bill. For instance, as Defendants point out, with respect to cigarettes, the TCA uses the term \"component\" to include elements segregable from the tobacco itself but necessary to consume the cigarette tobacco, such as filters and paper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387g(a)(1)(A).

Thus, rather than undermining the agency's reading of \"component,\" other uses of the term in the TCA support it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that the agency's conclusion that a \"pipe\" is a \"component or part\" subject to regulation is not foreclosed by the statutory text and therefore survives\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step one review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicopure\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264826\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/360/#p394\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at 384-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the challenger's similar argument that \"the context of the TCA as a whole supports [the] argument that the terms 'component or part' must mean a part physically connected to the whole\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   Chevron\n   <em>\n    Step Two and Arbitrary and Capricious Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Having rejected Plaintiffs' argument at\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's first step, the court turns to consider whether the agency's interpretation of the TCA is a permissible one. Assessing Plaintiffs' statutory and\n   APA challenge to FDA's interpretation under the overlapping\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step two and \"arbitrary and capricious\" framework, the court holds that the FDA did not act unreasonably in designating \"pipes\" as \"components or parts\" subject to regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that, even if the statutory text is ambiguous, the FDA's interpretation is nonetheless an unreasonable one because \"[t]here is nothing in the record to suggest that pipe architecture is being manipulated to make tobacco more addictive or dangerous and have any other direct effect on public health,\" thus compelling the conclusion that a pipe is an \"accessory,\" rather than a \"component or part\" of a tobacco product. Pls.' Mot. at 48. To that end, Plaintiffs assert that differentiation among pipes is merely for aesthetic reasons, citing public comments to the Proposed Deeming Rule contending that \"while [pipes] enable the smoking of tobacco, they present no independent potential harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264826\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/360/#p394\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing A.R. 130248).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument is unavailing. For starters, Plaintiffs do not take issue with the definition of \"component or part\" that the FDA applied to pipes. Plaintiffs do not dispel Defendants' argument that pipe design-the size and shape of the bowl, as well as the inclusion of filters-would in fact be \"reasonably expected\" to alter or affect the \"performance,\" \"constituents,\" and \"characteristics\" of pipe tobacco.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   81 Fed. Reg. at 29,102. Moreover, Plaintiffs also do not explain how pipes are not \"to be used with or for the human consumption of a tobacco product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29,041 -42. Thus, the agency's conclusion that a pipe meets the definition of \"component or part\" is a reasonable one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Also bolstering the agency's interpretation is a comparison of pipes against objects that qualify as non-regulated \"accessories.\" Observing the agency's provided examples of \"accessories,\" it is clear that pipes are wholly unlike \"ashtrays, spittoons, [or] hookah tongs,\" that do nothing to affect the \"performance, composition, constituents, or characteristics of a tobacco product,\" or \"conventional matches and lighters that solely provide an external heat source to initiate but not maintain combustion of a tobacco product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28,975. Rather, pipes are \"fundamental\" to the delivery and consumption of pipe tobacco.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicopure\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264826\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/360/#p394\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs do not counter that reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   In the alternative, Plaintiffs argue for the first time in their reply brief that the agency's failure to contend with whether to regulate all \"components,\" or not to regulate all \"accessories,\" instead of subsets of each, violates the APA. Plaintiffs did not, however, raise this argument in their initial Motion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot.
