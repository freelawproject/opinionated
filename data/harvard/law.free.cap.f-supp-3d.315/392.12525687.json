Mr. Wilson and his campaign committee allege in their Amended Complaint that the DNC Services Corporation, doing business as the Democratic National Committee, or DNC, discriminated against Mr. Wilson and thwarted his campaign efforts because of his race. They seek $2 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages under four theories of recovery: breach of contract, promissory estoppel, race discrimination in violation of the right under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to make and enforce contracts, and conspiracy to violate civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' breach of contract and promissory estoppel theories fail because the Amended Complaint does not adequately allege the existence of a contract that the DNC breached or of an unkept promise by the DNC on which the Plaintiffs reasonably relied. But it would be premature to dismiss Plaintiffs' Section 1981 and Section 1985 claims at this early stage in the proceedings. Thus, the DNC's Motion to Dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
