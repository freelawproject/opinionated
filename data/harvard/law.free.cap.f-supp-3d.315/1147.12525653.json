(\"Ticketmaster\") brings this suit against Prestige Entertainment West, Inc., Renaissance Ventures LLC, Nicholas Lombardi, and Steven K. Lichtman\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, \"Defendants\"), alleging thirteen causes of action based on Defendants' use of automated programs generally known as bots, which navigate Ticketmaster's website and mobile app in order to purchase large quantities of tickets for resale at a profit. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint, and the Court granted the motion in part with leave to amend. (ECF Nos. 24, 32.) Ticketmaster filed its First Amended Complaint on February 21, 2018. (First Am. Compl. (\"FAC\"), ECF No. 36.) Defendants now move to dismiss the First Amended Complaint in its entirety. (Mot. 1, ECF No. 37.) The parties submitted briefs in support of their positions, and the Court heard the parties' arguments on April 9, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. (Mot.; Opp'n, ECF No. 39; Reply, ECF No. 41; ECF No. 42.) For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ticketmaster sells tickets for live entertainment events to the general public on behalf of its clients through its website, mobile app, and telephone call centers. (FAC \u00b6 17.) Consumer demand for tickets to a given event often exceeds the supply available through Ticketmaster. (FAC \u00b6 18.) This results in intense competition among consumers, who try to purchase tickets the moment that the tickets become available for sale on Ticketmaster's website and mobile app. (FAC \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ticketmaster has employed various measures in an effort to ensure a fair and equitable ticket purchasing process for its consumers. (FAC \u00b6 19.) For instance, Ticketmaster requires each user to create a password-protected account before the\n   user can purchase a ticket. (FAC \u00b6 42.) This allows Ticketmaster to better regulate ticket sales, and it also functions as a form of password protection against unauthorized access to the Ticketmaster platform. (FAC \u00b6 42.) Ticketmaster also limits the number of tickets that may be purchased in a single transaction and regulates the speed with which users may refresh their requests to search for, reserve, and purchase tickets. (FAC \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants are an enterprise that seeks to profit off the intense competition for tickets that Ticketmaster's platforms engender. They do this by purchasing large quantities of tickets from Ticketmaster and selling them at a markup on StubHub.com and other ticket resale sites. (FAC \u00b6 47.) In order to gain an unfair advantage in searching for and buying these tickets, Defendants have employed robots, programs, and other automated devices, generally known and referred to herein as \"bots.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5.) These bots inundate Ticketmaster's website and mobile app with page requests and ticket reserve requests at a far higher rate than would be possible for a human alone. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In an effort to put a stop to bots Ticketmaster has employed several countermeasures, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 CAPTCHA, a security program whose purpose is to distinguish between human users and bots by requiring the purchaser to retype a series of random, partially obscured characters, a task designed to be impossible for a bot to accomplish (FAC \u00b6 20);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Splunk and other commercial data compilation and analysis services, which help Ticketmaster analyze its sales data and detect patterns that indicate that tickets have been purchased by bots (FAC \u00b6 21);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Over Ticket Limit, a proprietary feature created to automatically block, in real time, the purchase of tickets that appear to be coming from bots (FAC \u00b6 22).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite Ticketmaster's efforts, Defendants have found ways to circumvent these countermeasures by using, among other things, colocation facilities with high speed bandwidth, random number and letter generators, cookie trading, and CAPTCHA farms. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 47, 51, 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants' enterprise seems to have achieved its goals. Defendants used their bots to acquire tens of thousands of tickets for the New York stage play\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   , often purchasing thirty to forty percent of the entire amount of tickets available for a given performance. (FAC \u00b6 5.) Defendants' bots also procured a majority of tickets available through Ticketmaster to the high-profile Mayweather v. Pacquiao boxing match in Las Vegas in 2015. (FAC \u00b6 5.) In total, Ticketmaster estimates that between January 2015 and September 2016, Defendants generated 9,047 dummy user accounts and 313,528 ticket orders, sending a total of six million requests to the Ticketmaster website and mobile app. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 42, 51, 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Use of Ticketmaster's website is governed by its Terms of Use. (FAC \u00b6 24.) Users must agree to the Terms of Use before they can view and use Ticketmaster's platforms, and both the website and mobile app repeatedly remind users that the Terms of Use govern the use of Ticketmaster's services. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27.) The Terms of Use grant users a \"limited, conditional no-cost, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to view Ticketmaster's site to purchase tickets as permitted by these Terms for non-commercial purposes only if\" the user agrees not to conduct certain activities. (FAC \u00b6 30.) These activities include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 using \"any robot ... or any other ... device, tool, or process to retrieve, index, data mine, or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Content or the Site, including with respect to any CAPTCHA displayed on the site,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 using any \"automated software or computer system to search for, reserve, buy, or otherwise obtain tickets,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 accessing, reloading, or refreshing transactional event or ticketing pages, or making any other request to transactional servers, more than once during any three-second interval,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 requesting \"more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any 24-hour period, whether alone or with a group of individuals;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 reproducing, modifying, displaying, publicly performing, distributing, or creating derivative works of the Site or its Content.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (FAC \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ticketmaster owns registered copyrights in its website and mobile app. (FAC \u00b6 28.) According to the express language in the Terms of Use, any of the above activities constitutes copyright, patent, and trademark infringement, because engaging in any prohibited activity revokes the user's permission to use the Ticketmaster website and mobile app. (FAC, Ex. A at 56.) Continued use of the Ticketmaster website without permission to do so, says the Terms of Use, constitutes infringement. (FAC \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ticketmaster diligently attempts to identify and stop the users of bots, but Defendants' sophisticated techniques have hindered Ticketmaster's ability to do so. (FAC \u00b6 58.) After tracing the bot-related ticket purchases for the Mayweather-Pacquiao boxing match to Renaissance, Ticketmaster sent a cease-and-desist letter (the \"Letter\") in May 2015 addressed to Nicholas Lombardi describing some of the evidence Ticketmaster had uncovered that linked him, his colleagues, and their companies to the improper ticket purchases. (FAC \u00b6 59, Ex. E.) The Letter demanded that Defendants \"cease and desist from any further violations of Ticketmaster's rights.\" (FAC \u00b6 59, Ex. E at 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lombardi acknowledged receiving the Letter, but Defendants continued their enterprise. (FAC \u00b6 60.) On October 2, 2017, Ticketmaster initiated this lawsuit against Defendants and several Doe Defendants. Does 7 and 8 are the computer programmers and developers that created, marketed, and provided the named Defendants with the bots, and they are referred to herein as the Bot Developers. (FAC \u00b6 6.) Does 9 and 10 are those entities who assisted and conspired with Prestige West by purchasing the improperly procured tickets from Defendants for later resale. (FAC \u00b6 7.) These Doe defendants are referred to herein as the Additional Purchasers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its initial Complaint, Ticketmaster brought claims for: (1) breach of contract; (2) copyright infringement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (3) violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (4) fraud; (5) aiding and abetting fraud; (6) inducing breach of contract; (7) intentional interference with contractual relations; (8) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (9) violation of the California Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (\"CDAFA\"), California Penal Code section 502\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and (10) violation of the New York Anti-Scalping Law,\n   New York Arts and Cultural Affairs Law section 25.01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After Ticketmaster filed its Complaint, Defendants moved to dismiss seven of Ticketmaster's ten claims. (ECF No. 24.) The Court granted Defendants' motion in part, dismissing the copyright infringement claim, the CFAA claim, and the California CDAFA claim. (Order Mot. Dismiss (\"Order\") 9, 14, ECF No. 32.) Dismissal was granted with leave to amend, except to the extent that the copyright infringement claim was based on Defendants' excess of the limitations on page refreshes and ticket requests imposed by the Terms of Use. (Order 9.) The Court also denied Defendants' motion in part, finding that Ticketmaster's initial Complaint stated a claim with respect to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, breach of contract, and fraud. (Order 11, 16, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ticketmaster's First Amended Complaint asserts a new theory of copyright infringement, and adds new allegations regarding the CFAA and CDAFA claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-104; 160-165; 166-178.) On March 7, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Mot. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

While a plaintiff need not give \"detailed factual allegations,\" the plaintiff must plead sufficient facts that, if true, \"raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Baca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759026\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1202/#p1216\">\n    652 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216 (9th Cir. 2011) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants argue that Ticketmaster has failed to state a claim with respect to copyright infringement, the DMCA, the CFAA, and the California CDAFA. (Mot. 1.) Defendants argue that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining claims. (Mot. 1.) They also argue that the Court should dismiss the Doe defendants because Ticketmaster has failed to timely serve them. (Mot. 4.) The Court first addresses Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Doe defendants, because some of Ticketmaster's claims against Defendants rest on the viability of its claims against the Doe defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Doe Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As discussed in further detail below, Ticketmaster's claim for secondary copyright infringement against the moving Defendants rests on their direct infringement claim against Doe defendants 7 and 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants argue that such Doe pleading is improper, and that the Court should dismiss these Doe defendants because Ticketmaster has failed to identify or serve them. (Mot. 4.) Defendants seek dismissal of the Doe defendants pursuant to Rule 4(m), governing dismissal of unserved defendants, and not under 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (Mot. 4;)\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Buckheit v. Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026558\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/713/910/\">\n    713 F.Supp.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 n.4 (N.D. Cal. 2010), for the observation that \"[g]enerally, 'Doe' pleading is improper in federal court.\" Although there is no provision in the Federal Rules permitting the use of fictitious defendants,\n   <em>\n    Fifty Associates v. Prudential Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813941\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/446/1187/#p1191\">\n    446 F.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1191 (9th Cir. 1970), there is a provision in the Local Rules of the Central District of California allowing the practice of pleading up to 10 Doe defendants without the need for the leave of the Court. C.D. Cal. L.R. 19-1. This alone shows that, at least in some circumstances in the Central District of California, Doe pleading is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, although Doe defendants 7 and 8 are fictitiously named, they are anything but fictitious. Does 7 and 8 are the individuals or entities who assisted Defendants in creating and developing the bots, and the very fact that the bots exist is proof that Does 7 and 8 exist as well. Ticketmaster has identified with specificity the roles that Does 7-8 and Does 9-10 played in the alleged enterprise. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   When the identity of alleged defendants will not be known prior to the filing of a complaint, \"the plaintiff should be given an opportunity through discovery to identify the unknown defendants, unless it is clear that discovery would not uncover the identities, or that the complaint would be dismissed on other grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Gillespie v. Civiletti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387485\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/629/637/#p642\">\n    629 F.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (9th Cir. 1980). Doe pleading is therefore particularly appropriate when, as here, the viability of a claim against a known party depends on the actions of a party whose identity is unknown at the time of the pleading. As discussed below, Ticketmaster's copyright claim against the moving Defendants depends on direct infringement by Does 7 and 8, whose identities Ticketmaster does not yet know. Ticketmaster's lack of information prevents it from identifying the Bot Developers and the Additional Purchasers, but, as discussed below in greater detail, it knows circumstantially that these individuals or entities must exist, so it impleads them as Doe defendants. This is perfectly acceptable. There is a reasonable probability that Ticketmaster, by propounding discovery with tools such as interrogatories and requests for inspection of electronically stored information, will succeed at uncovering the identities of the Bot Developers and the Additional Purchasers. The Court will give Ticketmaster the opportunity to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants maintain that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) requires a court to dismiss a defendant who has not been served within 90 days after the Complaint was filed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). However, according to that same rule, \"if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387485\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/629/637/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Good cause exists in this case to allow Ticketmaster additional time to serve the unidentified Defendants. The Court has yet to enter a scheduling order in this case or set a deadline for moving for leave to amend the pleadings. Moreover, as the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Gillespie\n   </em>\n   implicitly recognized, an information deficit, where discovery would correct that deficit, is good cause to allow a plaintiff an extended period of time to identify and serve unknown defendants.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387485\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/629/637/#p642\">\n    629 F.2d at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such a deficit exists here, and the fact that Ticketmaster\n   has indicated that it is ready to name one of the Doe defendant Bot Developers supports the conclusion that further discovery will allow Ticketmaster to identify the remaining Doe defendants. (Opp'n 23.) Ticketmaster has shown good cause, and the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss the Doe defendants from this case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Copyright Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Ticketmaster's secondary copyright infringement claim against Prestige West, Renaissance, and the Additional Purchasers. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-99.) To establish secondary infringement, Ticketmaster must first allege direct infringement of its copyright.\n   <em>\n    MDY Indus., LLC v. Blizzard Entm't, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    629 F.3d 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 937 (9th Cir. 2010). Ticketmaster alleges that Doe defendants 7 and 8, the entities that assisted the named Defendants by creating, marketing, and providing bots, are the direct infringers in this case.

This method of proving copying circumstantially is grounded in the notion that an accused work can be so similar to the copyrighted work that at a certain point the factfinder's only reasonable conclusion must be that the defendant copied the work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Airframe Sys., Inc. v.

Specifically, Ticketmaster alleges that (1) the Bot Developers developed bots that proved highly capable of purchasing large quantities of tickets, and (2) Ticketmaster's website and mobile app are complex platforms that each contain several layers of protection and security measures. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) Ticketmaster asserts that developing such capable bots would necessarily require deep study and analysis of the pages and code of Ticketmaster's website and mobile app, which means that the Bot Developers\n   <em>\n    must have\n   </em>\n   downloaded and stored literal or non-literal elements of Ticketmaster's website and mobile app on their local systems in the course of developing these bots. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 66, 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Ticketmaster's argument about the striking compatibility of Defendants' bots with Ticketmaster's platforms is a compelling variation on the well-known \"substantial similarity\" test for circumstantial proof of copyright infringement. Ticketmaster's theory is based on the legally sound (and rather unremarkable) proposition that circumstantial evidence can create a plausible inference that copying has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Ticketmaster pleads several facts that together make a strong case for its \"striking compatibility\" argument. The bots enable Defendants to launch thousands of concurrent and recurring reserve requests for tickets for specific events. (FAC \u00b6 45.) The bots are calibrated such that when the reserve request expires, the bot is able to regenerate a new ticket reserve request at a far greater speed than any legitimate human could manage, thus preventing any human from reserving or purchasing the ticket. (FAC \u00b6 45.) Moreover, the bots can\n   trade information so that purchases coming from multiple computers would appear to be coming from the same computer, allowing the bots to hide themselves by more closely mirroring what Ticketmaster's algorithms considered normal human use. (FAC \u00b6 47.) Finally, the bots are able to escape detection when ordering tickets through the mobile app interface, which Ticketmaster alleges is not possible without first obtaining certain lines of code called security tokens embedded deep within the code of the Ticketmaster mobile app. (FAC \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   These allegations show that Defendants' bots were remarkably effective at circumventing a leading online ticketing platform's best defenses. It strains credulity to think that the Bot Developers could have developed such successful bots without downloading and storing Ticketmaster's pages and code. The bots' effectiveness is circumstantial evidence that plausibly supports the conclusion that at some point the Bot Developers copied protected portions of the Ticketmaster website and mobile app onto its own servers, in order to develop bots that could successfully circumvent Ticketmaster's myriad security measures. Under the federal standards for notice pleading, Ticketmaster's allegations of copying are sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

Ariz. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court finds that nothing in the Complaint, including Ticketmaster's Terms of Use attached thereto as Exhibit E, shows that Ticketmaster granted Defendants, or any other users, a license to download and store Ticketmaster's pages and code on the user's local system. The section of the Terms of Use entitled \"Ownership of Content and Grant of Conditional License\" describes exactly what rights Ticketmaster grants its users, and nowhere does Ticketmaster grant its users a right to download and copy. The relevant section of the Terms of Use provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The Site and all data, text, designs, pages, print screens, images, artwork, photographs, audio and video clips, and HTML code, source code, or software that reside or are viewable or otherwise discoverable on the Site, and all tickets obtained from the Site, (collectively, the \"Content\") are owned by us or our licensors....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   We grant you a limited, conditional, no-cost, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to view this Site and its Content as permitted by these Terms for non-commercial purposes only if, as a condition precedent, you agree that you will not [engage in one of several prohibited activities.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (FAC, Ex. E at 55.) These Terms of Use give Ticketmaster users the right to \"view\" Ticketmaster's website. While the Terms of Use do indicate that the website's\n   HTML code and source code may be \"viewable or otherwise discoverable,\" such descriptive language does not amount to a grant of a license. Under no reasonable interpretation do these Terms of Use grant Defendants a license to download and store Ticketmaster's pages and code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At Defendants' motion to dismiss Ticketmaster's original Complaint, both the Court and the parties devoted considerable attention to whether the provisions of Ticketmaster's Terms of Use were conditions or covenants. (Prior Mot. 7-8, ECF No. 24-1; Prior Opp'n 10, ECF No. 25; Order 8-9.) Defendants now reiterate that, pursuant to this Court's prior order, the provisions of the Terms of Use are covenants, and that, under\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   , the violation of a covenant gives rise only to a contract claim and not to a claim for copyright infringement. (Mot. 6; Order 9.) In so arguing, Defendants misconstrue\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   and the underlying copyright laws. Under\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   , a violation of a provision of a Terms of Use is copyright infringement if the violation implicates one of the copyright holder's exclusive rights, regardless of whether the violated provision is a covenant or a condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MDY Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    629 F.3d at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ticketmaster's new theory of direct infringement is based on the Bot Developers' violation of its exclusive statutory right of reproduction, and under\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   , this is sufficient. (FAC \u00b6 102.) The condition-versus-covenant issue is moot in a scenario where, as here, the defendant has violated the plaintiff's exclusive statutory right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   court's concern with the condition-versus-covenant distinction arose from public policy concerns that are not present in this case. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   was the developer of an online multiplayer game, and the defendant was the developer of a bot that ordinary gamers could purchase to automatically play the early stages of the game on behalf of the gamer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff claimed that the direct infringers were the gamers who used the bots.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    at 937-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the game's Terms of Use declared that playing the game with a bot was unauthorized use of the game, any gamer who used a bot was a direct infringer of the plaintiff's copyright, by virtue of the fact that the gamer's computer made an unauthorized \"copy\" of the game in the gamer's local computer memory (RAM) while the game was being played.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court rejected this analysis, refusing to recognize common bot use by ordinary gamers as copyright infringement. To hold these gamers liable, the court reasoned, would allow \"any software copyright holder [to] designate any disfavored conduct during software use as copyright infringement, by purporting to condition the license on the player's abstention from the disfavored conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The concerns of the\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   court are not implicated by Ticketmaster's First Amended Complaint. Ticketmaster is alleging direct infringement by a small number of sophisticated software developers and marketers. (FAC \u00b6 6.) This is a completely different theory of direct infringement than that alleged by the\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    629 F.3d at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A finding of direct infringement in this case will not expose masses of Ticketmaster users to copyright liability merely because they violated Ticketmaster's own house rules. Thus, the holding of\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   does not directly control today's outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Ticketmaster has plausibly alleged that the Bot Developers infringed Ticketmaster's statutory right of reproduction, and Defendants have not established that they had a license to reproduce Ticketmaster's pages and code by downloading and storing them on a local system. As the Court explained in its prior order, under\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   , this constitutes copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Order 7;)\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    629 F.3d at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To recover for copyright infringement based on breach of a license agreement, (1) the copying must exceed the scope of the defendant's license and (2) the copyright owner's complaint must be grounded in an exclusive right of copyright ....\") Ticketmaster's claim survives not because the Bot Developers violated Ticketmaster's Terms of Use, but rather because they reproduced Ticketmaster's website in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , without possessing a license to do so. The Court therefore concludes that Ticketmaster has stated a claim for direct copyright infringement on the part of the Bot Developers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    4. Secondary Infringement by Moving Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having alleged direct infringement, Ticketmaster proceeds to accuse Defendants of secondary copyright infringement. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-99.) A defendant may commit secondary infringement in one of two ways: contributorily, \"by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement,\" or vicariously, \"by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it.\"\n   <em>\n    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

Wash. June 20, 2017) (ellipsis and some internal quotation marks removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ticketmaster has sufficiently pled Defendants' contributory liability for the copying committed by the Bot Developers. First, Ticketmaster alleges that the moving Defendants directed the Bot Developers to download and store on their computer systems large portions of Ticketmaster's copyrighted Site and App. (FAC \u00b6 67.) Ticketmaster has therefore alleged facts that show that Defendants had knowledge of the Bot Developers' infringing activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Ticketmaster has also shown that the named Defendants induced or materially contributed to the Bot Developers' infringement. Ticketmaster alleges that the Bot Developers created, marketed, and provided the bots. (FAC \u00b6 6.) Defendants then used those bots to purchase large\n   quantities of tickets. (FAC \u00b6 5.) These facts indicate a relationship between Defendants and the Bot Developers of mutual benefit to both parties, and it is reasonable to infer that Defendants contributed to the Bot Developers' infringement as part of this relationship. Without more knowledge about the nature of the relationship between Defendants and the Bot Developers, Ticketmaster cannot be expected to plead with any greater specificity. A 12(b)(6) motion tests the sufficiency of a complaint, not the sufficiency of the available evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because the Court has determined that Ticketmaster has successfully pled the moving Defendants' contributory liability for copyright infringement, the Court need not consider whether the moving Defendants are also vicariously liable under the facts as alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss Ticketmaster's Second Claim for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Order 11.) Under the doctrine of law of the case, a court is generally precluded from reconsidering an issue that has already been decided by the same court or a higher court in the identical case, absent a material change in circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Ticketmaster's First Amended Complaint does contain new factual allegations, but none of those allegations disturb the sufficiency of its DMCA claim. In accordance with its prior order, the Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss Ticketmaster's Fifth Claim for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court will briefly address Defendants' main argument against the DMCA claim as pressed in its brief in support of this Motion. The relevant provision of the DMCA provides that \"[n]o person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a [copyrighted] work ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Ticketmaster alleges that Ticketmaster's security measures, including CAPTCHA, are technological measures that control access to Ticketmaster's copyrighted webpages, and that Defendants' bots and other efforts circumvent those measures in violation of the DMCA. (FAC \u00b6 52, 111.) Defendants' main argument is that Ticketmaster has failed to indicate any copyrighted work to which any of Ticketmaster's technological measures were effectively controlling access. (Mot. 10; Reply 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants' argument fails because Ticketmaster's CAPTCHA controls non-human access to Ticketmaster's ticket purchase pages and ticket confirmation pages, both of which are copyrighted works. The three-tiered analytical framework for copyrightable content as discussed above and as articulated by the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   makes this abundantly clear.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    629 F.3d at 942-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The defendant in\n   <em>\n    MDY\n   </em>\n   argued that the bots he developed simply helped players play a game, and that there wasn't any copyrighted material that his bots were accessing in circumvention of a security measure. The court did agree with the defendant that the game's literal and individual non-literal elements did not qualify as access-controlled works under the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    at 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that there was no technological measure controlling access to the literal and individual non-literal elements of the game because\n   those elements were readily accessible to any player who had installed the game on their computers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With respect to the game's dynamic non-literal elements, though, the court found a DMCA violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n    at 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The individual experience of the game-the particular configuration of shapes, colors, and sounds presented on the screen as the gamer plays the game-was copyrightable expression, to which only a human had authorized access.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff put security measures in place to keep bots from playing the game-that is, from accessing the game's copyrighted dynamic non-literal elements-and when the bots circumvented those measures, they circumvented an access control to a copyrighted work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079616\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/928/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants' bots in this case do the very same thing. In order to purchase tickets from Ticketmaster, one must work through Ticketmaster's security measures, including CAPTCHA. Ticketmaster designs these security measures so that only a human can progress through Ticketmaster's pages and ultimately purchase a ticket. Each of these pages is a unique page, tailored specifically to the customer and what that customer is trying to accomplish. The process is familiar to anyone who has shopped online. For example, the purchase confirmation page of an online store will contain an individualized presentation of details, including the purchaser's shipping and billing information, information about the product or service purchased, and a purchase confirmation number. This unique, individualized presentation of information constitutes dynamic non-literal content which is subject to copyright protection. Moreover, the source code used to generate the purchase confirmation page is literal content which is also subject to copyright protection. Thus, when Defendants used bots to progress through Ticketmaster's security measures and ultimately gain access to ticket confirmation pages and data, they circumvented a technological measure that Ticketmaster had put in place to control access to Ticketmaster's copyrighted ticket confirmation pages and data. These pages and data are dynamic non-literal content and literal content, respectively, both of which, as discussed above, are protected by Ticketmaster's copyrights. Defendants' activities therefore satisfy the textual elements of the DMCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court's finding falls in line with the growing number of courts that have concluded that circumvention of CAPTCHA and similar measures designed to distinguish between humans and non-humans violates the DMCA.

The parties in this case characterize the CFAA as an anti-hacking statute, and argue vigorously that hacking has not or has occurred. (Mot. 13; Opp'n 12 n.9.)

The proper inquiry is whether Ticketmaster has sufficiently pled that Defendants accessed Ticketmaster's computers, either without any authorization, or in excess of the authorization they did have. Ticketmaster argues that each use of a bot to purchase a ticket was a use in excess of authorization because an individualized cease-and-desist Letter sent to Prestige on May 7, 2015 explicitly prohibited Prestige and the other Defendants from using bots to access Ticketmaster's website. (FAC, Ex. E; Opp'n 17.)

(FAC, Ex. E at 71-72.) Ticketmaster's cease-and-desist Letter was of far greater practical and legal significance than a generally applicable \"use restriction,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nosal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756996\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/854/#p858\">\n    676 F.3d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Nosal\n   </em>\n   opinion, the\n   <em>\n    Facebook\n   </em>\n   opinion contains no discussion of the risk of turning Terms of Use violators into copyright infringers, because after receipt of an individualized cease-and-desist letter, the defendant's use-as here-is no longer a mere Terms of Use violation and is instead a violation of a set of permissions and prohibitions directly and individually imposed upon the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Ticketmaster's Letter has the same effect as the letter in\n   <em>\n    Facebook\n   </em>\n   . Ticketmaster's Letter explicitly reminded Defendants that \"use of the [Ticketmaster] website is conditioned on an agreement that the user will not ... use any automated ... computer system to ... buy ... tickets,\" and instructed Defendants to \"cease and desist from any further violations of Ticketmaster's rights.\" (FAC, Ex.

The\n   <em>\n    Facebook\n   </em>\n   court required something \"more\" than mere violation of a website owner's terms of use to impose liability under the CFAA, and the Letter satisfies that requirement.\n   <em>\n    Facebook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177522\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1058/#p1065\">\n    844 F.3d at 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(FAC, Ex. E at 69-70.) The Letter, with its detailed factual allegations, is a \"far cry from the permission skirmishes that ordinary Internet users face.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Facebook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177522\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1058/#p1065\">\n    844 F.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants are anything but innocuous. They know that their entire business model is built on a scheme to evade Ticketmaster's policies for profit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 122 (alleging 9,047 instances of fraud for each account Defendants created and 313,528 instances of fraud for each ticket order Defendants executed).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendants attempt to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Facebook\n   </em>\n   by pointing out that this Court previously found that Ticketmaster's Letter did not completely revoke access authority. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order 13 (\"Ticketmaster's cease-and-desist letter appears to imply that Defendants could continue to use Ticketmaster's website so long as they abide by the TOU.\") ) In\n   <em>\n    Facebook\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, the cease-and-desist letter sent by Facebook to the defendants appears to have revoked\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   authorization for defendants to use\n   Facebook's website.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177522\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1058/#p1065\">\n    844 F.3d at 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants make a distinction without a difference, because the CFAA penalizes both access without authorization\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   situations where a defendant possesses some authorization, but acts excess of that authorization.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(c), (a)(4). Therefore, the fact that the Letter may have allowed Defendants to continue using Ticketmaster's website in a limited way does not allow Defendants to escape CFAA liability. After receipt of the Letter, each time Defendants purchased tickets with a bot, they accessed the Ticketmaster website in a manner explicitly forbidden to them, thus exceeding their authorization to use the Ticketmaster website. Defendants exceeded authorized access to Ticketmaster's computers when they received Ticketmaster's letter and nevertheless continued to use bots to purchase Ticketmaster tickets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    2. Loss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   To sufficiently state its CFAA claim, Ticketmaster must plead facts that show that Defendants' conduct caused \"loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period ... aggregating at least $5,000 in value.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(A)(i)(I). The CFAA defines \"loss\" as \"any reasonable cost to any victim,\" and lists as examples \"the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(11). Defendants insist that the CFAA requires Ticketmaster to plead facts that show \"interruption of service or impairment of data\" and losses that flow directly therefrom. (Reply 11.) The Court disagrees with this reading of the statute's definition of \"loss\" for two reasons. First, the placement of the commas in the definition of \"loss\" indicates that \"the cost of responding to an offense\" does not have to be caused by \"interruption of service.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. 1030(e)(11). These two clauses are separated by seven commas, and a strained reading is required to conclude that the last clause controls the first. The cost of \"responding to an offense,\" on its own, qualifies as loss under the CFAA, without any need to connect it to an interruption of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court is mindful of a split among the circuits over what constitutes \"loss\" under the CFAA. Namely, some district courts have held that \"loss\" under the CFAA must \"relate to the investigation or repair of a computer system following a violation that caused impairment or unavailability of data.\"\n   <em>\n    Cassetica Software, Inc. v.

Ticketmaster alleges that the Defendants have collectively committed acts that constitute violations under seven different subsections of the CDAFA. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 167-173.) The Court finds that Ticketmaster has stated a claim with respect to three of these subsections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   First, Ticketmaster has not stated a claim with respect to subsections (c)(1) and (c)(4), because those subsections both require that the Defendants have altered, damaged, deleted, or destroyed the data in some way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 502(c)(1), (4). Although Ticketmaster does allege that the Defendants' activities resulted in alteration, deletion, and destruction of data on the system, the allegation merely tracks the language of the statute itself, without providing facts to substantiate the claimed legal conclusions. (FAC \u00b6 77.) Defendants' bots place a heavy load on Ticketmaster's system, and they cause Ticketmaster's system to relinquish tickets to Defendants against Ticketmaster's wishes, but Defendants' bots do not actually alter, damage, delete, or destroy data on Ticketmaster's systems. Precisely the opposite is true: the fact that Ticketmaster's systems continued to deliver tickets to Defendants' bots shows that Ticketmaster's systems continued to function as intended, without damage or alteration, while the bots operated. It is for this same reason that Ticketmaster has also failed to state a claim with respect to subsection (c)(5) of the CDAFA, which requires a showing of \"disruption\" or \"denial\" of computer services.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    Cal.

The sale of tickets is insufficiently similar to \"computer time, data processing, or storage functions\" to justify construing the \"other uses\" provision of the statutory definition of \"computer services\" to include ticket sale services.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Ticketmaster has not pled facts showing that it offers computer services, section 502(b)(4) does not provide Ticketmaster a basis for a CDAFA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Ticketmaster's allegations with respect to subsections (c)(2), (c)(6), and (c)(7) of the CDAFA, on the other hand, are sufficient. The above-mentioned\n   <em>\n    Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177522\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1058/#p1065\">\n    844 F.3d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (9th Cir. 2016) controls the Court's holding with respect to subsection (c)(2). After sustaining the District Court's finding that the\n   <em>\n    Facebook\n   </em>\n   plaintiff stated a claim for a CFAA violation, the Ninth Circuit observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   [D]espite differences in wording, the analysis under both [the CFAA and the CDAFA] is similar in the present case. Because [defendant] Power had implied authorization to access [plaintiff] Facebook's computers, it did not, at first, violate the statute. But when Facebook sent the cease and desist letter, Power, as it conceded, knew that it no longer had permission to access Facebook's computers at all. Power, therefore, knowingly accessed and without permission took, copied, and made use of Facebook's data. Accordingly, we affirm in part the district\n   court's holding that Power violated section 502.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Facebook, Inc. v.

Penal Code \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). Ticketmaster's Letter informed Defendants that they no longer had permission to use bots to purchase tickets from Ticketmaster. The fact that the Letter allowed Defendants to continue to make normal human use of the Ticketmaster website and app is of no consequence, because Defendants' subsequent ticket purchases constituted taking, copying, or making use of data, all done without Ticketmaster's permission by virtue of the fact that the purchases were powered by bots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Next, subsection (c)(7) of the CDAFA prohibits knowing, unauthorized access of a computer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 502(c)(7). Ticketmaster's Letter revoked Defendants' authorization to use bots to access the Ticketmaster website in the same way that it revoked Defendants' authorization to use bots to take and make use of Ticketmaster tickets. For those reasons, supported by the Court's prior reasoning with respect to \"exceeding authorized access\" under the CFAA, Ticketmaster has stated a claim with respect to subsection (c)(7).\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Section IV.D.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, subsection (c)(6) prohibits knowingly providing a means of accessing a computer system in violation of the CDAFA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 502(c)(6). The Bot Developers provided Defendants with bots, which Defendants used to commit violations of at least three other subsections of the CDAFA. Ticketmaster has therefore pled allegations sufficient to show the Bot Developers' violation of subsection (c)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss Ticketmaster's Twelfth Claim for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Remaining Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Ticketmaster has stated claims for relief for violations of three different federal laws: copyright infringement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the Court has original jurisdiction over these claims, the Court will continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss Claims 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 13. Moreover, the Court will give Ticketmaster the opportunity to identify the Doe defendants through discovery.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A. The Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss Claims 3, 4, and 6 against the Doe defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. (ECF No. 37.) The Court finds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   (1) The First Amended Complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a claim for relief on the face of its pleading, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), with respect to Ticketmaster's Second, Fifth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Claims for Relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   (2) This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over Ticketmaster's state law claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   (3) Doe defendants will not be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Ticketmaster's original Complaint also listed Prestige Entertainment, Inc. as a defendant, but Ticketmaster voluntarily dismissed this Defendant before filing its First Amended Complaint. (Compl. 1; Not. Dismissal, ECF No. 35.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Other provisions of the Terms of Use contain minor provisions regarding the scope of the user's license, but these two paragraphs contain all the material provisions of the user's license.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Defendants maintain that this Court's prior order, which dismissed Ticketmaster's CFAA claim, constitutes law of the case that requires dismissal of Ticketmaster's CFAA claim on this Motion as well. (Mot. 13.) Ticketmaster's First Amended Complaint identifies specific ways that Defendants accessed the Ticketmaster website without authorization or in excess of authorization that were not identified in the original Complaint. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , FAC \u00b6 163.) In light of Ticketmaster's new factual allegations, the Court finds it appropriate to consider Ticketmaster's CFAA claim anew.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Section 1030(a)(4) further specifies that a defendant who obtained only \"the use of the computer,\" where the value of that use was not more than $5,000 in any one-year period, has not violated the CFAA. Since Defendants here allegedly did more than use Ticketmaster's computers, this exception does not apply.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The Court will not read the phrase \"or otherwise uses\" in section 502(c)(1) as prohibiting anything other than use that is similar to alteration, damage, deletion, or destruction. Under the doctrine of eiusdem generis, when a list of two or more specific terms is followed by a more general term, the otherwise wide meaning of the general term must be restricted to the same class of the specific terms that precede it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p114\">\n     532 U.S. 105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 114-15,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p114\">\n     121 S.Ct. 1302\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p114\">\n     149 L.Ed.2d 234\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2001).
