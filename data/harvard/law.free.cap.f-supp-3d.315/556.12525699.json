BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Shaundelle Dial, proceeding before this Court\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , brings a civil-rights action against thirteen current or former employees of the Bureau of Prisons. Dial is a federal prisoner currently serving a 100-month sentence for carjacking. His Complaint alleges that during his time in prison he has suffered a litany of abuses by BOP staff at various institutions. Dial claims,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that he was unlawfully denied medical and mental-health treatment, prevented from accessing legal work and the law library, deprived of mail privileges, and impermissibly left in solitary confinement. Defendants now move for dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint for failure to state a claim. They additionally request that the Court explicitly state that the dismissal, if granted, counts as a \"strike\" under the three-strikes provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). The Court acquiesces in both respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 24, 2017, Dial filed a suit alleging seven counts against thirteen BOP Defendants. According to the facts alleged in the Complaint, which the Court must at this stage presume as true, he asserts that Defendant Thomas Kane, the Acting Direction of the Bureau, \"allowed\" him to get \"sexual[ly] abused, [and] physically abused by correctional staff\" at six federal prisons from 2014 to 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Complaint), \u00b6 1. He states that, as a result of his abuse, he has \"suffered injuries, permanent scars, [and] nerve damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, Dial contends that he has been improperly retaliated against by BOP employees for behaviors related to his \"chronic and lifelong\" mental-health conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. He asserts that he has \"an\n   IQ of 64 and concurrent deficits in adaptive functioning\" that \"interfere with [his] ability to learn in a conventional manner and [be] in society.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dial alleges that his \"severe mental illness\" includes \"exhibitionist[ ] disorder where I cannot stop exposing my genitals to staff or anybody,\" but that he has been \"denied sexual deviance treatment,\" \"left in [solitary] confinement lock-down 23 hours a day for months at a time,\" and denied other unspecified \"accommodations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third, Plaintiff alleges that he has been \"denied medical attention or treatment\" for his \"nerve damage from the prison staff physical abuse, [a] deformed toe ... [,] allerg[ies] to bean, corn, peanuts, hernia, [and] urine problems.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3. Fourth, he states that Defendants have thrown away his legal work and mail, have not granted him family and community contact, and have \"denied [him] time in [the] law library to prepare for [his] case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4. Fifth, Dial brings a claim for \"extortion,\" alleging that Defendants have \"frozen [his] account,\" have made him \"pay them 425 dollars,\" and have \"denie[d] [him] all privileges where [he has] nothing to look forward to.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. Sixth, he contends that he has been left \"in solitary confinement as a punishment\" and been denied \"all programming, vocational training, [and] any rehabilitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. Finally, Dial's seventh count asks for a lawyer to represent him because of his disabilities and mental illness, and states that he is \"in seclusion where [his] property is taken from [him].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7. As relief for these alleged violations of his civil rights, Plaintiff requests,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"100 million dollars, an investigation, the prosecution of defendants, medical care, ... mental health treatment, psychotherapy, counseling ..., [and] a lawyer appointed by the courts to represent [him].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April of this year, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss or, in the alternative, a Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16.

Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816009\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/669/45/#p49\">\n    669 F.Supp.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (D.D.C.2009) ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (providing that \"[n]o action shall be brought ... by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\"). This exhaustion requirement, the Supreme Court has held, \"demands compliance with an agency's deadlines and other critical procedural rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodford v. Ngo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p90\">\n    548 U.S. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p90\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p90\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Here, Defendants assert-and Plaintiff does not dispute-that Dial did not complete the BOP administrative-remedy process for any of the claims alleged in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 11-12. The Court therefore concludes that his failure to exhaust is an additional reason why his Complaint cannot overcome the instant Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4025380\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/869/34/#p37\">\n    869 F.Supp.2d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 (D.D.C. 2012) (\" Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss ... [is] the appropriate vehicle[ ] to challenge an alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the PLRA.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Other Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Last, the Court briefly addresses two other issues raised in the parties' respective briefing. It turns first to Plaintiff's attempt to request discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 2-5. Under this Rule, the Court may, in its discretion, postpone ruling on a motion for summary judgment pending further discovery. In order to obtain such relief, however, the party seeking discovery must show \"by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, [he] cannot present facts essential to justify [his] opposition.\" Here, the Court need not reach this issue because, as discussed above, it grants Defendants' Motion to Dismiss under the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   and exhaustion standards. As the Court is not converting the Motion into one seeking summary judgment, Plaintiff's request under Rule 56 simply does not come into play. Yet, even if the Court were to consider the Motion under the summary-judgment standard, Dial would not clear the Rule 56 bar. His Response never explains how his long list of discovery demands would provide him with information to contest Defendants' position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 2-6. Such unsupported requests for discovery do not suffice as a reason for postponing summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Convertino v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3772206,5880430\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/93/\">\n    684 F.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (D.C. Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, the Court considers Defendants' request that, if this case is dismissed, the dismissal be explicitly deemed\n   a \"strike\" under the PLRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 12. Under the Act's \"three strikes\" rule, an inmate who has had three prior actions or appeals dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failing to state a claim may not proceed in a further civil action\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   unless he is in \"imminent danger of serious physical injury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Here, Defendants urge the Court to affirmatively state that its dismissal of Dial's Complaint counts as a \"strike\" under this provision. Because the Court dismisses the suit\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   for failure to state a claim, it finds that its determination meets the criteria of \u00a7 1915(g) and will so state in its accompanying Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the Court will grant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion shall issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
