The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\" or \"appellant\") and joint debtor-appellees Thomas E. Daley and Nicole E. Daley (collectively, \"the Daleys\" or \"appellees\") disagree as to whether the liability imposed by an early withdrawal from a qualified retirement plan is 1) a tax, 2) compensation for actual pecuniary loss or 3) compensation for non-pecuniary loss. Appellees made early withdrawals from a qualified retirement plan in 2012 and 2013. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2072\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (t), they incurred charges of $6,693 in 2012 and $10,351 in 2013 (collectively, \"the 10% exaction\"). Those charges were equal to approximately 10% of the amounts withdrawn by appellees from a qualified retirement plan in 2012 and 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court is the appeal of the IRS from a United States Bankruptcy Court (\"Bankruptcy Court\") opinion holding that the 10% exaction is compensation for non-pecuniary loss and thus subject to a general unsecured claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July, 2015, appellees filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. In March, 2016, the IRS filed its fifth amended proof of claim No. 1 (\"POC\") in the amount of $44,149, of which $28,431 was categorized as \"Unsecured Priority Claims\". The amount of the Unsecured Priority Claim attributable to \u00a7 72(t) is $6,693 for the tax year 2012 and $10,351 for the tax year 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court allowed the Daleys' motion for summary judgment and denied the IRS's cross-motion for summary judgment. The Bankruptcy Court held that the charges against the Daleys attributable to \u00a7 72(t) are penalties that do not compensate the IRS for a pecuniary loss and thus its claims are characterized as unsecured general claims. On May 22, 2017, appellant filed an appeal in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   United States district courts have jurisdiction to hear \"appeals from final judgments, orders, and decrees ... of bankruptcy judges.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

The Tenth Circuit reasoned that, because the purpose of the 10% exaction in bankruptcy proceedings is,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , to deter debtors from discharging their obligations at the expense of innocent creditors, the exaction is a penalty for determining priority in bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642632,6521397\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/161/\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642632,6521397\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/161/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This Court agrees with that conclusion. Although the exaction may generate some revenue, the presence of \"hardship\" exceptions to the early withdrawal rule indicates that the purpose of the statutory provision is to deter unwanted conduct. Therefore, the exaction functions as a penalty and not a tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The judgement of the Bankruptcy Court that the Daleys' charges attributable to \u00a7 72(t) are penalties will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Liability Imposed by \u00a7 72(t) Is Not a Penalty for Actual Pecuniary Loss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Alternatively, the IRS claims that the 10% exaction should be classified as a penalty compensating the government for actual pecuniary loss because it compensates the government for the cost incurred in deferring tax revenue. Appellant asserts that because the 10% exaction is a penalty for actual pecuniary loss, it is entitled to priority status as an unsecured priority claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(G). The Daleys deny that characterization and maintain that because the primary purpose of the 10% exaction is to deter taxpayers from taking early withdrawals from their retirement accounts, it is not a penalty for pecuniary loss and thus should be characterized as an unsecured general claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court agrees with appellees that the primary purpose of \u00a7 72(t) in the context of the Bankruptcy Code is to deter taxpayers from making early withdrawals from qualified retirement plans and not to compensate the government for lost revenue. The\n   <em>\n    Cassidy\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the \u00a7 72(t) penalty is not for actual pecuniary loss because it is a flat rate penalty \"bearing no relationship to the direct financial loss of the government.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642632,6521397\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/161/\">\n    983 F.2d at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court agrees. The exaction is also\n   imposed on Roth IRAs, from which the government generally expects no tax revenue, and the rate does not change relative to the taxpayer's age. There is no indication that the government suffered any actual pecuniary loss for which it seeks compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, the judgment of the Bankruptcy Court that appellees' charges attributable to \u00a7 72(t) are penalties not for actual pecuniary loss will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Bankruptcy Court is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   and the bankruptcy appeal (Docket No. 1) is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    So ordered\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
