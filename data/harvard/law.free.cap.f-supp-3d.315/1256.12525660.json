CORRIGAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   If individuals or religious groups organize a prayer vigil and gather in the Downtown Square in the City of Ocala to pray for an end to violent crime, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution will protect the \"free exercise\" of their religion. But what if the government organizes and sponsors the prayer vigil? That is a problem because under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the government cannot conduct such religious activity. Yet that is what happened here. While the Ocala Police Chief and his subordinates were no doubt well-intentioned and sincere in sponsoring the Prayer Vigil, their actions violated the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When the City of Ocala experienced a violent crime-spree in the late summer and early fall of 2014, its police department sought to curtail the violence using all available means. As part of those efforts, Chief of Police Kenneth Gregory \"Greg\" Graham met with members of Ocala's faith-based community to seek their assistance. What resulted was an invitation from Chief Graham to the community, promoted\n   on the Ocala Police Department facebook page and elsewhere, encouraging everyone's attendance at a \"Community Prayer Vigil\" on September 24, 2014 in the Downtown Square. The plaintiffs, who are atheists, contacted Chief Graham and Ocala's mayor, Reuben \"Kent\" Guinn, in advance of the Vigil, advising them of their concern that the City's promotion and sponsorship of a Prayer Vigil would violate the United States Constitution's Establishment Clause. The plaintiffs were rebuffed, the Vigil took place, and this lawsuit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Efforts to settle the case failed and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment (Docs. 52, 53, 54) and responses thereto (Docs. 61, 62, 64, 68). The Court held argument on the motions on May 26, 2017, the record of which is incorporated by reference. The parties made further efforts to settle, but those too failed and the Court now issues this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2014, the Ocala Police Department pursued various means to try to apprehend those responsible for the recent shooting spree that left several children injured. Graham Dec. I\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 52-1) at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. The police knew who the shooters were, but could not persuade witnesses to come forward to testify. Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 21. Their efforts included meeting with local leaders of the NAACP, who suggested to Chief Graham that the police reach out to the local faith-based community for help in convincing witnesses to cooperate. Graham Dec. I (Doc. 52-1) at \u00b6 7. Heeding that suggestion, Chief Graham held a meeting at the Ocala Police Department on September 17, 2014, with Captain Richard Edwards, the District Commander of the area where most of the trouble was occurring; Officer Mary Williams, who assisted Captain Edwards with community events in the area; Captain Carmen Sirolli, the Captain in charge of the division investigating the shootings; Major Dennis Yonce, the Major to whom Sirolli reported; Hugh Brockington, an Ocala Police Department Chaplain; Edwin Quintana, another Police Chaplain; and Narvella Haynes, a community activist who lived in the area where the crimes occurred and who had previously assisted the police with community outreach. Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The purpose of the meeting was to develop ideas about how \"to get the ministers in that area to lean on, talk to, encourage witnesses to come forward\" so the police could hold the perpetrators accountable. Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 21. Chaplain Edwin Quintana suggested that a prayer vigil or similar event on Ocala's public Downtown Square might bring the faith-based community together to get the word out and encourage people to cooperate. Graham Dec. I (Doc. 52-1) at \u00b6 10; Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 23. Chief Graham \"thought it was a great idea\" and said \"Let's do it.\" Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 23. Graham says he then left the meeting and Quintana and Haynes began planning the Vigil, creating a letter for Chief Graham's and Haynes' signatures that invited the community to participate in the Vigil.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Graham Dec. I (Doc. 52-1) at \u00b6 10; Haynes Dec. (Doc. 52-2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9; Quintana Dec. (Doc. 52-3) at \u00b6\u00b6 5 &amp; 6. Chief Graham read the letter and directed an Ocala Police Department Sergeant to post it on the Ocala Police Department's facebook page, and Haynes and the Chaplains encouraged members of the community to attend the Vigil. Graham Dec. I (Doc. 52-1) at \u00b6 11; Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 31, 58; Graham Inter. Resp. (Doc. 54-6) at # 1; Haynes Dec. (Doc. 52-2) at \u00b6 8, Quintana Dec. (Doc. 52-3) at \u00b6 7. Chief Graham agreed that by posting the letter on the Ocala Police Department facebook page, he was \"promoting\" the Prayer Vigil. Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Printed on Ocala Police Department letterhead (with the image of the Ocala Police Department badge and words OCALA POLICE DEPARTMENT displayed at the top, and the Department address and phone number at the bottom), the text of the letter read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Blessings to all our citizens, specifically Pastors, Community Leaders, Parents and our precious youth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   We are facing a crisis in the City of Ocala and Marion County that requires fervent prayer and your presence to show unity and help in this senseless crime spree that is affecting our communities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Within the last 30 days we have had numerous shootings that have resulted in two children and an infant being hit by bullets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Stray bullets do not have respect for addresses, social status, economic status, educational background, political status and the list goes on.

We need you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The letter was signed with \"Blessings and Highest Regards\" by Greg Graham, as Chief of Police, and Narvella Haynes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, Ex. A. Here is an image of the letter:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ocala Police Department staff created a separate flyer about the Vigil which depicts a photo of the gazebo covered stage in the Downtown Square with an image of praying hands in one corner and the Ocala Police Department logo in the opposite corner, and the words \"Community Prayer Vigil Wednesday, September 24, 2014 6:30 p.m. Ocala/Marion County is in crisis! Help Stop The Violence! Join us downtown on the square.\" Doc. 54-22 (marked Ex. 6) at 7. The Police Chief's letter and an earlier version of the flyer (created before the Ocala Police Department logo was added) were sent to Narvella Haynes by Officer Williams on September 19. Doc. 54-23 (marked Ex. 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chief Graham stated he\n   was unaware of the existence of the flyer. Graham Dec. II (Doc. 68-1) at \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Quintana invited several local clergymen to participate in the Vigil and sent an email to the Ocala Police Chaplains (copying Graham) telling them that Chief Graham asked Quintana to ask all the Chaplains to be present at the Vigil and to come wearing their Police Chaplain uniforms. Quintana Dec. (Doc. 52-3) at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8; Doc. 54-26 (marked Ex. 10) (9/22/2014 email to chaplains from Quintana, copying Graham).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ocala Police Chaplain uniform differs from the uniform of a sworn officer-the Chaplains wear white shirts instead of blue, the sleeves bear patches that say \"CHAPLAIN\" above the Ocala Police Department patch, and the Chaplains do not carry weapons. Quintana Dec. (Doc. 52-3) at \u00b6 9; Doc. 54-19 (marked Ex. 3) at Page ID 1386, 1389, 1394, 1396, 1401, 1402 (photos of uniformed Ocala Police Officers and uniformed Ocala Police Chaplains).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Ocala Police Department supplies and pays for the Chaplains' uniforms. City Inter. Resp. (Doc. 54-5) at # 7. Chief Graham testified that when the Chaplains are in their police uniforms, the public would perceive them as being connected with the Ocala Police Department. Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 165-66. The Chaplains have office space in the Ocala Police Department's building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 169. According to the Ocala Police Department Directive, \"Ocala Police Department Chaplains are official members of the Ocala Police Department[,]\" who are \"appointed by the Chief of Police,\" and are \"considered members of the staff of the Chief of Police in a support capacity and report directly to the Chief of Police.\" Doc. 52-6 (marked Ex. 2) at 2. \"They are issued Police Identifications in the form of an identification card with holder and badge[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , are issued cell phones, and are authorized to drive Department vehicles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ocala Police Department Police Chaplain Section Manual, 2010, and as reviewed 2015 (Doc. 54-74 (marked Ex. 58) ) at 23-24, 36-37. Chief Graham has the authority to terminate the Ocala Police Chaplains. Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 168. Although the Ocala Police Chaplains are volunteers, they are covered by worker's compensation when performing official Department duties. Doc. 52-6 (marked Ex. 2) at 2. All of the Ocala Police Department Chaplains are of the Christian faith. Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 157. Chief Graham agreed that although it would be inappropriate for Ocala Police Chaplains to try to \"convert\" people in the course of their work for the Ocala Police Department, \"participating in a prayer vigil\" would be part of the official function of an Ocala Police Chaplain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Tr. 78-79.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Soon after the Vigil was advertised, several citizens, including some of the plaintiffs, contacted Chief Graham and Mayor Guinn, expressing concern that a prayer vigil organized by a police department would violate the U.S. Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 52-9 at 3-4 (9/20/2014 6:03 p.m. email); Doc. 54-51 (marked Ex. 35) at 2 (9/22/2014 5:14 p.m. email). Initially, Chief Graham's responses tended to take ownership of the Vigil, saying, for example, \"I have no intention of canceling the event,\" Doc. 54-40 (marked Ex. 24) at 4 (9/22/2014 4:05 p.m. email), and \"[t]his 'vigil' is not the only strategy that we [the Police Department] are employing to fight crime in Ocala\" and explaining that the purpose of the Vigil was for the Police Department to engage the faith-based community to help make the community safer. Doc. 52-9 at 3 (9/21/2014 2:43 p.m. email). As the Chief responded to one supporter who wrote to him with the subject line \"Stand tall on prayer!\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Thanks for the encouraging words. I have been getting quite a few responses from people, mostly from out of our area, who oppose this. I have no intention on calling this gathering off nor changing my personal belief on the power of prayer. Take care and I hope to see you on Wednesday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Doc. 54-55 (marked Ex. 39) (9/22/2014 3:55 p.m. email).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Soon thereafter, however, Chief Graham began to distance himself and his Department from the Vigil, responding that the Vigil was a community event he could not stop and over which he had no control. For example, on September 23, 2014, he wrote to one citizen with whom he had been corresponding about the meaning of the Establishment Clause, \"I think you are misunderstanding my role in this event. I am not leading the event, I am not speaking at the event, I will be in attendance at the event.\" Doc. 54-49 at 5 (marked Ex. 33-B) (9/23/2014 4:07 p.m. email). He further wrote that he knew the minister who was organizing it and could put the citizen in touch in case he wanted to attend \"and say a few words.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To another citizen, he wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I am not sure if I have been clear in any of my prior emails to you that this event tonight is a \"Community Prayer Vigil\" not an Ocala Police Department or City of Ocala Prayer Vigil and as such I have no say in whether it gets canceled or not. I have indicated to several others that I have no intent on canceling the event and should have expanded my thoughts. If I were to try and cancel this event I would be violating the Constitution by preventing people from gathering and exercising their right to free speech.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Doc. 54-40 at 6 (marked Ex. 24-C) (9/24/2014 2:48 p.m. email from Graham).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 54-50 (marked Ex. 34) (9/24/2014 1:27 p.m. email from Graham) (\"I am not attacking your rights as an American to freedom of religion, I am upholding others['] rights to express themselves ... this is not a City of Ocala or Ocala Police Department Prayer Vigil, it is\n   a Community Prayer Vigil and as such I have no say in canceling the event\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although there is no evidence that Kent Guinn, Ocala's Mayor, had anything to do with the planning of the Prayer Vigil, once he learned about it,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   he readily embraced it as a government-sponsored event, responding to a citizen's complaint about what the citizen perceived to be the Police Chief's endorsement of religion: \"I think this is great. I'll be sure to praise him [Chief Graham] for it.\" (Doc. 54-49 (marked Ex. 33) at 3 (9/19/2014 10:55 p.m. email from Guinn to citizen, copying Graham) ). Mayor Guinn wrote to Chief Graham about the Prayer Vigil two days later, stating: \"As I told you I think this is a great idea and have been responding to the atheist groups that are writing me about it. I put it on my calendar to be there,\" but telling Graham that next time he does \"things like that\" to let the Mayor know so he doesn't find out from his \"church and random emails.\" Doc. 54-25 (marked Ex. 9) at 2 (9/21/2014 12:33 p.m. email from Guinn to Graham). The next day, Mayor Guinn wrote to a protesting citizen who had urged the Mayor to show leadership in addressing the Chief's violation of the First Amendment, saying,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I'm proud to stand by my Chief and support him. Times like this do test leadership and that's why we're leading the community in this prayer vigil. Yes, we have heard from folks like you who don't understand the constitution.

In responding to another citizen's concern about the upcoming Prayer Vigil, Mayor Guinn responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Thanks for your interest in our community. There is nothing in the constitution to prohibit us from having this vigil. Not only are we not canceling it we are trying to promote it and have as many people as possible to [sic] join us. We open every council meeting with a prayer. And we end the prayer in Jesus name we pray.

For example, one person wrote on the Ocala Police Department's facebook page: \"why are the police asking us to pray? will they arrest us if we don't pray?\" Doc. 54-18 (marked Ex. 2) at CM/ECF Page 4. Plaintiffs contacted counsel for The American Humanist Association (now representing plaintiffs here) who urged Chief Graham to remove the Prayer Vigil letter from the Ocala Police Department facebook page on the grounds that it was an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. Doc. 54-46 at 2 (marked Ex. 30-A) (9/21/2014 10:47 a.m. email from David Niose to Graham). Chief Graham responded that his efforts were upholding the rights of others to assemble and that taxpayer funds were used only to the minimal extent that Graham wrote the letter and printed it on Department letterhead.

Guinn also said he had the authority to instruct that Ocala Police Department Chaplains not lead prayers at the Prayer Vigil or attend in Ocala Police Department Chaplain uniforms, but he did not consider doing any of that because he believed those actions were permitted under the Establishment Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the charter for the City of Ocala, the Mayor is the sole municipal official in authority over the Ocala Police Department and he recommends a chief of police nominee to the City Council, who appoints the Chief.

Captain Edwards sent an email to Chief Graham, Ocala Police Chaplain Quintana and Ms. Haynes, copying an Ocala Police Department officer, asking whether they should secure an indoor location as an alternative. Doc. 54-28 (marked Ex. 12) at 2. Quintana's suggestion was that the Vigil should take place on the Square with or without rain, \"[n]othing should stop, hinder or prevent from [sic] fervent prayer,\" proposing they \"[k]eep it to 15-20 minutes of PRAYER only.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (capitalization in original).

The facebook posting discussed the crisis of crime affecting citizens of Ocala and Marion County, and Ms. Hale agreed that crime creates a negative environment for all citizens, but she felt that the message inviting everyone\n   to a Prayer Vigil did not include her or others who do not pray. L. Hale Depo. (Doc. 54-15) at Tr. 17-19. Mr. Hale engaged in email correspondence with the Mayor in advance of the Vigil, expressing regret for the recent crime spree and applauding the Chief for his attempts to curb crime, but explaining that the Vigil invitation violated the Establishment Clause and suggesting that the City promote a different rally encouraging people to come forward with ideas about how to stop crime.

The factual development\n   of the case since then further supports that determination. The undisputed facts reveal that the Hales are residents of Marion County who have attended events in the Downtown Square in Ocala. They saw the Ocala Police Department facebook page and attended the Prayer Vigil because they wanted to observe, but also because they have interest in being a part of the community and are concerned about crime. They attended the Prayer Vigil but were unable to participate in any of the activity because the speakers only invited the audience to pray and sing. The Hales have more than a mere interest in the matter. They have demonstrated an injury in fact. Similarly, Art Rojas lives and works in the City of Ocala. He saw the Ocala Police Department facebook page and attended the Prayer Vigil. He wants his community to be inclusive of all its residents, not just Christians. Like the Hales, Rojas has more than a mere interest in the matter and has demonstrated injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Having demonstrated injury in fact, the causal connection and redressability prongs of standing are easily satisfied here. Plaintiffs' injuries are causally connected to the Prayer Vigil which they contend was sponsored by the City of Ocala and its Chief of Police. If proven, an award of nominal damages for conduct that violated the Establishment Clause would redress their injuries.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Amnesty Int'l, USA v.

For starters, the Chief initiated the meeting at the police department at which the plan for the Prayer Vigil was hatched and he pronounced it \"a great idea.\" Graham Depo. (Doc. 54-10) at Tr. 23. The facebook posting which invites the community to come to the Prayer Vigil is written on Ocala Police Department letterhead and is signed by Chief Graham in his capacity as Chief of Police. The letter states in part, \"We are facing a crisis in the City of Ocala and Marion County that requires fervent prayer and your presence ... I [Chief Graham] am urging you all to please support a very important 'Community Prayer Vigil.' \" Doc. 1, Ex. A. Chief Graham agrees that he read the letter and directed that it be posted on the Department's facebook page. He further agreed that in doing so, he was promoting the Prayer Vigil. The record also shows that Chief Graham sent an email suggesting the date for the Prayer Vigil be moved to accommodate local ministers; he sent multiple emails to citizens in reference to the Prayer Vigil that suggested his involvement, using words such as \"we\" and \"I,\" and he did not direct these inquirers to contact someone else to complain; nor did he disabuse the Mayor or other supporters in his emails as to whose Prayer Vigil it was. Chief Graham said he did not know what the speakers would say, yet he received an email from Quintana recommending the Vigil consist of \"PRAYER only.\" When the speakers are chaplains and the platform is a prayer vigil, a reasonable observer would understand the content of the program would be prayer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Chief Graham also permitted Captain Edwards and others to work on the Vigil while on City time. Additionally, although the Ocala Police Department Chaplains are volunteers, they are similar to employees in that they are covered by worker's compensation, have office space at the Police Department, are issued police badges, receive paid uniforms (which they wore to the Prayer Vigil), and are considered members of the Ocala Police Department who are subject to the authority of Chief Graham, who appoints them. When Chief Graham was copied on an email to the Chaplains advising them that the Chief\n   wanted them to attend the Vigil and to wear their uniforms, Chief Graham did not follow up to correct what he now claims was not really his directive. Of the ten people on the stage at the Prayer Vigil, four were uniformed Ocala Police Department Chaplains, and another was an off-duty Ocala Police Department employee who was not in uniform (but who may have announced to the crowd that he was indeed a police officer).\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Chief Graham agreed that participating in a prayer vigil would be part of an official function of an Ocala Police Department Chaplain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In reaching its decision, the Court relies only upon undisputed material facts-i.e., those disclosed by the contemporaneous documents, such as the emails which show Chief Graham's knowledge and involvement, his deposition testimony, and that of the plaintiffs, to the extent it is undisputed. Defendants' briefs are filled with bold statements such as, \"[O]nce the idea of a community vigil was raised ... Chief Graham left the meeting and had no further involvement with the Vigil, except to coordinate the presence of uniformed officers (including himself) at the Vigil to maintain safety and engage citizens, as is usual for public events held downtown[,]\" Doc. 52 at 27, and \"[t]he only other action attributable to Graham in relation to the Vigil is his expression of support for the event through the Facebook post.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321142\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/29/584/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But such rhetoric, belied by the undisputed facts, is no impediment to granting summary judgment. Likewise, many of the statements made in Chief Graham's declarations (both of which post-date his deposition) seem very lawyerly and designed to \"walk back\" his deposition testimony; but to the extent these statements contradict Chief Graham's deposition testimony without explanation or are conclusory, the Court need not consider them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 6. Also, while defendants do point to some discrepancies in the evidence, they are about immaterial matters. In the end, the Court, fairly applying the undisputed facts as described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , pp. 1263-73, and drawing all reasonable inferences in Chief Graham's favor, must ask this question: Has Chief Graham shown a genuine issue of material fact that would preclude a finding that his actions violated the Establishment Clause?

By these authorities, all of which well-predate the actions here, a reasonable fact-finder could find that it was clearly established that a government-sponsored prayer vigil would violate the Establishment Clause.

Mayor Kent Guinn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The evidence reveals that Mayor Guinn had nothing to do with planning the Vigil, promoting it to the community, or participating in it in any official way. He attended the Prayer Vigil as a citizen. Yet, when the Mayor learned about the upcoming Prayer Vigil, he wholeheartedly endorsed it, and continued to do so up to and following the event. This was in the face of many vocal complaints that the Vigil would\n   and did violate the Establishment Clause. To those citizens and others, he declared that he would not stop the Vigil. Moreover, both the Mayor and Chief Graham testified that the Mayor had the authority to tell Chief Graham to take down the facebook page, but Mayor Guinn refused. Nor did he tell the Chief not to permit the police chaplains to participate, which the Mayor also said he had the authority to do. Additionally, the Mayor responded to citizens in a manner that reflected that the Vigil was a government-sponsored event, repeatedly referencing that \"we\" are holding this Vigil and telling one person that \"[t]here is nothing in the constitution to prohibit\n   <em>\n    us\n   </em>\n   from having this Vigil.\" Doc. 54-44 (marked Ex. 28) (9/22/2014 10:24 a.m. email from Guinn to citizen, copying Graham) (emphasis added). To another who complained about the Chief's apparent violation of the Establishment Clause, the Mayor responded that not only would he not stop it, he intended to praise the Chief for his efforts. Doc. 54-49 (marked Ex. 33) at 3 (9/19/2014 10:55 p.m. email from Guinn to citizen, copying Graham).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Yet there is not enough evidence to show that the Mayor himself had sufficient connection to the Prayer Vigil to hold him liable for it. He was certainly an ardent cheerleader, but a reasonable observer, taking into account the creation, planning, and execution of the Vigil would find the Mayor was not a part of it. The Mayor did, however, have authority to direct the Chief to take down the facebook page and to order that the Chaplains not participate in the Prayer Vigil, but he refused to take these measures. It is true, as plaintiffs contend, that the failure to intervene to stop a constitutional violation can itself create liability. But the circumstances in which that doctrine arises are generally excessive force cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The Court is denying Chief Graham and the City's motion for summary judgment and granting plaintiffs' cross-motion as to the Chief and the City. In so doing, the Court considered whether it should instead deny plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to the Chief and the City and conduct a non-jury trial (no remaining party requested a jury trial). However, the Court determined that holding a non-jury trial was not required: based on the undisputed facts, plaintiffs have demonstrated as a matter of law that the Chief and the City of Ocala violated the Establishment Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In sum, under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the government cannot initiate, organize, sponsor, or conduct a community prayer vigil.

(Doc. 54-12) at Tr. 25-26, 28-29 (testifying that if the Chief could not cancel the Vigil, he could at least stop the police chaplains from being involved). Moreover, the Establishment Clause focuses on the constitutionality of the government's action from the perspective of a reasonable observer (who is not necessarily the plaintiff). Additionally, there is no such concern with the Hales, the two other plaintiffs here.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , D. Hale Depo.

The City and Chief Graham tried to suggest that Ms. Hale knew Chief Graham could not cancel the Vigil because he told Ms. Porgal that (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Brief, Doc. 52 at 4) and Ms. Hale testified that Ms. Porgal \"probably at least gave me the gist\" of Chief Graham's communications with Ms. Porgal (Doc. 54-15 at Tr. 13). But this is hardly enough to import Ms. Porgal's knowledge of any of Chief Graham's particular statements to Ms. Hale. Moreover, when responding to the direct question of whether she believed they (the Chief and Mayor) had the power to cancel the Vigil, Ms. Hale testified: \"I believe that they did. I believe they still do, should it occur again. And I believe that if it had been otherwise, they would have put that in writing. They would have taken [the] letter down immediately and have said, sorry, folks, that was a mistake; this is being held by these [other] people.
