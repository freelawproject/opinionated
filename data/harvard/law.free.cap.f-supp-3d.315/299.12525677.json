Reg. 1724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Feb. 15, 2013), represents the culmination of decades of effort on the part of the government of the District of Columbia (the \"District\") to obtain greater budget autonomy by limiting the degree of congressional oversight over the manner in\n   which the District enacts its annual budget and spends local tax and fee revenues. In the instant action, Plaintiff Clarice Feldman claims that the Budget Autonomy Act improperly circumvents congressionally-mandated budget procedures, because it authorizes the District to adopt and implement a \"local\" spending plan as part of the municipality's annual budget without submitting that portion of the budget to the President and Congress for approval.

By virtue of her status as a District of Columbia taxpayer, Feldman contends that she has Article III standing to file a federal lawsuit that challenges the Budget Autonomy Act and each of the annual fiscal year (\"FY\") budgets that the District has enacted pursuant to that Act from 2016 to the present. Feldman's one-count complaint requests a declaration that the Budget Autonomy Act and the local portion of the District's annual budgets are unlawful, and seeks an injunction that prevents defendants Muriel Bowser (in her official capacity as the District's Mayor) and Jeffrey DeWitt (in his official capacity as the District's Chief Financial Officer) (collectively, \"Defendants\") from incurring further obligations or making further expenditures of local taxpayer funds on those portions of the District's annual budget.

The Council unanimously passed a legislative proposal-the Budget Autonomy Act-which the District of Columbia's residents subsequently voted to ratify, and Congress ultimately let stand without expressing its disapproval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344235\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/42/134/#p139\">\n    42 F.Supp.3d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Bowser's Mot. at 15.) As enacted, the Budget Autonomy Act altered the Home Rule Act by removing the federal government from the budget-formulation and appropriation process for most District funds. Specifically, the Budget Autonomy Act bifurcated the District's annual budget into a \"local\" portion consisting of locally-derived funds (e.g., funds raised from local taxes imposed on District residents), and a federal portion consisting of federally-derived funds (e.g., funds provided by Congress) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bowser's Mot. at 14), and as to the local portion, removed the President from the review process entirely, providing that, rather than having the Mayor submit the entire budget to the President to be presented to Congress, \"[t]he local portion of the annual budget shall be submitted by the Chairman of the Council to the Speaker of the House of Representatives[,]\" Budget Autonomy Act \u00a7 2(e). In addition, the Budget Autonomy Act established that Congress's review of the local portion of the District's proposed budget would be passive, rather than active. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bowser's Mot. at 14-15.) Thus, rather than requiring Congress to enact affirmative legislation\n   <em>\n    approving\n   </em>\n   the\n   District's annual budget-as had been the process under the pre-amendment Home Rule Act-the Budget Autonomy Act permitted the local portion of the District's budget to take effect if, after a thirty-day review period, Congress did not pass a joint resolution\n   <em>\n    disapproving\n   </em>\n   of the District's spending plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344235\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/42/134/#p139\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Challenges To The Budget Autonomy Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Several months after the July 2013 enactment of the Budget Autonomy Act, then-District of Columbia Attorney General Irvin Nathan formally advised then-Mayor Vincent Gray that he should not implement the Act, and should \"advise Executive Branch officials and employees not to do so absent a binding judicial decision to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344235\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/42/134/#p139\">\n    42 F.Supp.3d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In April of 2014, based on the Attorney General's recommendation, Gray and Defendant DeWitt (the District's Chief Financial Officer) advised the Council (1) that they believed the Act violated the Home Rule Act, the District's Charter, and other federal laws, (2) that any fiscal year budget had to be enacted pursuant to the pre-amendment provisions of the Home Rule Act, and (3) that, on Mayor Gray's watch, no expenditures would be authorized pursuant to a budget that was enacted in accordance with the Budget Autonomy Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344235\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/42/134/#p139\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344235\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/42/134/#p139\">\n    at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Council disagreed with this assessment, and in response, sued Mayor Gray in D.C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,\n   <em>\n    Council of the Dist. of Columbia v. Gray\n   </em>\n   , No. 2014-CA-2371-B (Apr. 17, 2014).) That action was removed to this federal district, and on May 19, 2014, the Court (Sullivan, J.) ruled that the Budget Autonomy Act violated the Home Rule Act and the Anti-Deficiency Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because, among other things, it exceeds the Home Rule Act's limits on the District's ability to alter the federal government's role in the District's budget.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344235\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/42/134/#p139\">\n    42 F.Supp.3d at 138, 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Council appealed the District Court's decision to the D.C.

However, while that appeal was pending, Councilwoman Muriel Bowser was elected as the District's Mayor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bowser's Mot. at 15-16.) Bowser supported the Budget Autonomy Act and intended to enforce it, and she therefore moved to dismiss the Council's appeal and vacate the District Court's judgment on grounds that the Mayor's office had changed its position in a manner that rendered the Council's legal claims moot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) The D.C.

According to the Superior Court, the Act was a valid exercise of the District's authority to amend the Home Rule Act and the District's Charter largely because, by enacting the Home Rule Act, Congress had intended to delegate sweeping legislative authority to the District; because no provision of the Home Rule Act or the Anti-Deficiency Act preempted the Budget Autonomy Act; and because any ambiguities in the Home Rule Act had to be resolved the District's favor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-37.) DeWitt did not appeal the Superior Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Feldman alleges that \"[t]he Budget Autonomy Act violates the Home Rule Act[,]\" and that, \"[b]y complying with the Budget Autonomy Act,\" the District is \"incur[ring] illegal, unlawful, and\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   obligations of local taxpayer funds[,]\" and \"mak[ing] illegal, unlawful, and\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   expenditures of local taxpayer funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.)

Indeed, Feldman does not claim that the District has used any municipal funds to make illicit expenditures, and she fully acknowledges that her only basis for claiming that the District has unlawfully expended taxpayer funds is \"[b]ecause of the process\" by which the District allocates funds under the Budget Autonomy Act. (Hr'g Tr. at 6:21-22;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:20-16:2 (asserting that she is not challenging \"where the money is going\" or \"how much money the [District] is allotting\" to, for example, \"the fire department, ... the police department, [or] ... the teachers\").) Nor does Feldman purport to argue that the District would have spent taxpayer money any differently if the challenged budgets had been approved under the pre-amendment provisions of the Home Rule Act. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:4-17:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, Feldman cannot proceed with the instant lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354945\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/275/#p280\">\n    836 F.3d at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In order for a plaintiff to gain access to federal court using municipal taxpayer standing, she must show that the municipality has actually expended funds on the allegedly illegal elements of the disputed practice.\"). Feldman's insistence that the alleged unlawfulness of the budgeting process itself makes\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   dollar allocated pursuant to the Budget Autonomy Act an unlawful expenditure (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 14, 16) finds no support in the case law, or the principles that undergird the municipal taxpayer standing doctrine. To the contrary, both make clear that what matters for the purpose of establishing a cognizable injury to taxpayers is not the method by which city officials undertake to make lawful expenditures that may well have been made even absent the allegedly unlawful conduct, but the city's investment of taxpayer dollars on things that are themselves unlawful, which qualifies as a waste of limited resources that could otherwise have been spent to make legitimately beneficial expenditures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Common Cause\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523892,3462924\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/1/\">\n    858 F.2d at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thus, it is clear beyond cavil that permitting Feldman's challenge would \"expand[the] municipal taxpayer standing doctrine to encompass [a] far broader category of challenges\" (Bowser's Mot. at 18) than the sorts of \"good-faith pocketbook action[s]\" contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Common Cause\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523892,3462924\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/1/\">\n    858 F.2d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed, Feldman apparently launched this action to advocate for allowing municipal taxpayers to \"[act as] Attorney[s] General and police the policies of the District because they pay taxes here[.]\" (Hr'g Tr. at 48:24-49:14.) But this Court is not persuaded that it should\n   <em>\n    expand\n   </em>\n   the reach of the narrow standing exception available to municipal taxpayers under\n   <em>\n    Frothingham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Common Cause\n   </em>\n   , and the Court is especially cautious in this case, given that no other court in this circuit has addressed municipal taxpayer standing in the thirty years since\n   <em>\n    Common Cause\n   </em>\n   was decided, much less affirmed a plaintiff's standing based on her status as a municipal taxpayer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There is presently a narrow window of opportunity for a municipal taxpayer claiming \"misuse of funds\" to proceed in federal court; Article III standing can be established if such a taxpayer challenges a discrete expenditure of public funds for an unlawful purpose, such that a court order enjoining the challenged expenditure will permit funds to be reallocated to lawful purposes of potential benefit to the plaintiff and other taxpayers. Feldman makes no such allegation. Instead, she seeks to challenge the District's annual budget procedures, as prescribed in the allegedly unlawful Budget Autonomy Act, and she does not maintain that the illegal process has actually caused any funds to be expended for unlawful purposes. Thus, this Court concludes that Feldman has not brought a good-faith pocketbook action that can be pursued in federal court based solely on her status as a municipal taxpayer. Accordingly, and on that basis alone, Defendants' motions to dismiss will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Feldman's case will be dismissed, as set forth in the accompanying Order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Page-number citations to the documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the Court's electronic filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The instant case was reassigned to this Court on July 15, 2016, after which the Court ordered the parties to file corrected briefs that conform with this Court's General Order and Guidelines for Civil Cases.
