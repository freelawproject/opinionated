In the Court's view, such offices are distinct in character from the ubiquitous retail locations and ATMs alleged to be the banks' contacts with this District in this case. Furthermore, the Court cannot conclude that Bank of America's sponsorship of the Washington\n   Redskins elevates its presence in this District to a level sufficient to satisfy a standard that, at a minimum, \"overlap[s] considerably\" with the general personal jurisdiction standard,\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Thai-Lao Lignite (Thailand) Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955625\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/821/289/\">\n    821 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   294 n.4, particularly since the facts presented to the Court demonstrate that only the Redskins' city name has an association with this District,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Okafor's Opp'n at 4 (noting that the Washington Redskins' \"stadium is located at FedEx field in [Maryland] and the team's corporate headquarters are located in [ ] Virginia\" (footnote omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notably, the applicant cites to no case law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Masters' Mem. at 4-5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Masters' Reply at 2-3, nor is the Court able to locate any, finding that a corporation's retail locations and a single corporate sponsorship (of an entity that does not even exist here) are sufficient to render a party \"found\" in a district for purposes of \u00a7 1782. The only case cited by the applicant as support for his position is\n   <em>\n    In re Inversiones\n   </em>\n   , which he asserts \"had no difficulty finding that Exxon was 'found in' [a] district, even when equating the 'found in' standard with a personal jurisdiction standard because, although Exxon was not incorporated or headquartered in Florida, it engaged in systematic and continuous business activities there [by] selling its product at Exxon gasoline stations.\" Masters' Reply at 3 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20181311\">\n    2011 WL 181311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However, the case does not support the applicant's position for two reasons. First, the magistrate judge in that case did not identify any of the Exxon contacts that she found sufficient to establish that Exxon was \"found\" in her district, only appearing to base her conclusion on \"Exxon['s] ... [failure to] contest the fact that it conducts systematic and continuous activities in this District such that, if it were sued as a defendant in an ordinary civil lawsuit, the Court would have personal jurisdiction over [it].\"\n   <em>\n    In re Inversiones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20181311\">\n    2011 WL 181311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Second, even if the magistrate judge had concluded that the presence of Exxon's retail gas stations in the district was sufficient to establish that Exxon was \"found\" in her district for purposes of \u00a7 1782, she likely would not reach the same conclusion now, given that since that case was decided, the Supreme Court issued its decisions in\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   , which imposed a stricter standard for finding general personal jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Farber v.
