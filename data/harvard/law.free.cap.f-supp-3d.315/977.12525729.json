First, another court in this district observed that\n   <em>\n    Linear\n   </em>\n   did not benefit from the guidance of the Federal Circuit's later decision in\n   <em>\n    Vehicle Intelligence &amp; Safety LLC v.

The\n   <em>\n    Vehicle Intelligence\n   </em>\n   decision does not cite\n   <em>\n    Linear\n   </em>\n   nor express any opinion on it. And TTI itself points out that\n   <em>\n    Linear\n   </em>\n   \"involved a different Chamberlain patent...that solved a different problem and recited limitations different from those in the claims asserted here.\" (TTI's Reply in Supp. of Summary Judgment at 1, Dkt. 546.) Unlike\n   <em>\n    Joao's\n   </em>\n   characterization of the claims in\n   <em>\n    Linear,\n   </em>\n   the\n   claims asserted here are not directed to an abstract idea that merely happens to make use of physical equipment. And as for the\n   <em>\n    Chargepoint\n   </em>\n   critique, the technological improvements of the asserted '275 patent claims are not limited to the introduction of network connectivity. Rather, the asserted '275 claims are directed to a particular improvement over prior art which uses a particular manner of sending and experiencing data. This particularity distinction matters. In\n   <em>\n    Core Wireless,\n   </em>\n   the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's patent-eligibility finding for claims directed to \"an improved user interface for computing devices.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267250\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1356/#p1361\">\n    880 F.3d at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The moveable barrier operator (\"MBO,\" often used interchangeably in the briefing with garage door opener, or \"GDO\") taught by the '275 patent does not merely receive transmissions, as did MBOs in the prior art; instead, Chamberlain's MBO experiences-via an onboard controller-status conditions and then transmits them to other devices. This improvement eliminated the need for a \"physical interface...to support numerous potentially utilized peripheral devices,\" thus cutting out \"undesired additional cost when part of the [otherwise, necessarily installed] interface goes unused in a given installation.\" ( '275 Patent 1:55-63, Dkt. 1-2).) In addition, the improvements taught by the '275 patent brought new compatibility to the MBO; the prior art, by contrast, \"fail[ed] to permit compatible support of a given peripheral,\" and precluded users from coupling\n   their prior-art MBO with a new function \"not specifically supported by a given [MBO].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:4-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thus, contrary to TTI's assertions, the '275 patent claims are unlike the ones in\n   <em>\n    Vehicle Intelligence,\n   </em>\n   which merely specified the abstract idea of testing operators of moving equipment for impairment and indicated that such testing could be conducted more quickly, accurately, and reliably by using an \"expert system\" that the claims failed to define.\n   <em>\n    Vehicle Intelligence,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=635%20Fed.%20Appx.%20914\">\n    635 Fed.Appx. at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But TTI did not present any evidence that the Menard GDO 1000-as opposed to an add-on module to that GDO-contained a controller or wireless transmitter. Indeed, Chamberlain's technical expert, Dr. Rhyne, presented evidence showing that the Menard GDO 1000 and the system 10000 (the aforementioned module) each have their own, separate controllers and power supplies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1297:16-1299:8.) In response to this, TTI emphasizes that the Chamberlain claims do not require the controller to be housed in the GDO's head unit.

Specifically, claim 5 depends from claim 1's recitation of \"a controller having a plurality of potential operational status conditions defined, at least in part, by a plurality of operating states,\" and claim 15 depends from claim 14's recitation of \"a movable barrier operator detecting at least one predetermined condition as corresponds to a present operational status defined, at least in part, by at least two operating states[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Rhyne Tr. 1309:21-22; Foley Tr. 871:5-8 (both citations describing dependent relationships of claims).) In contrast, the Menard prior art does not explain how its signals are defined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. Do [Dr. Foley's slides concerning the Menard prior art] show a condition defined by a plurality of states as claimed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A. They show things that the Menard module can report like whether the door is open, closed, or partially closing, freezing, normal, overheating on the temperature of the unit, but it doesn't-there's no disclosure of how those things are defined, and there are other ways to do it than having states that would define those conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Q. Can you provide us one example?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   A. A good one would be door position. You can report the number of times the motor has turned, so the rotations. And every rotation incrementally pulls the door up or, if it's going the other way, it lets it down a little bit. And then you can leave it up to the receiver at the other end to decide how many rotations is it going to take to get the door open, how many is it going to take to get the door to close. And if it sees the rotations coming at a different speed, it knows that it's partially closing. Those are not reporting specific states in the message itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Rhyne Tr. 1307:16-1308:9.) Simply put, the jury heard substantial evidence that while the Menard PCT status conditions could be defined in a number of ways, Chamberlain's '275 claims limit its status conditions to one type of definition. Because that limitation appears only in the asserted claims, the Menard prior art does not anticipate them.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liebel-Flarsheim Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3868332\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/1371/#p1381\">\n    481 F.3d at 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

But at trial, Chamberlain presented evidence showing that the Cohen prior art does not claim sending status conditions defined by two or more states. (Rhyne Tr. 1312:3-9 (\"All [the Cohen reference] does is it talks about a state signal that indicates in a way that is not described that the door is opening, closing, opening, or closing. And as I said, there are certainly ways to do it that doesn't involve sending a state-a status condition signal that gives you two states as, for example, that rotational information as an alternative.\").) Further, Dr. Rhyne explained that just like the Menard prior art, the Cohen reference teaches an add-on modular device, meaning that once again a controller in the module sends out the signal-not the controller in the GDO itself. (Rhyne Tr. 1310:11-21.) Because, according to Dr. Rhyne's testimony, this combination does not teach the limitations of the '275 patent claims, the jury heard substantial evidence supporting a finding of nonobviousness.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hearing Components, Inc. v.

Literal Infringement of the '275 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This argument is nothing new. TTI moved for pre-trial summary judgment of non-infringement of the '275 patent, and the Court denied that motion. (June 21, 2017, Order, Dkt. 397.) TTI posits once more that the Ryobi signal does not \"correspond[ ] to a present operational status condition defined, at least in part, by\n   <em>\n    at least two from the two or more\n   </em>\n   operational conditions being experienced by the controller,\" as recited in claims 1 and 24.\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201304559\">\n    2017 WL 1304559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). According to TTI, this is so because the Ryobi controller cannot simultaneously experience two operational conditions given that-in TTI's reading-such conditions are mutually exclusive,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \"[t]he controller cannot simultaneously be experiencing door open, closed, opening, closing, or fault.\" (Mem. in Supp. at 18, Dkt. 618.) But as the Court has already noted, this contention misses the mark: \"[M]any (if not all) GDO components contain multiple potential but mutually exclusive positions or states, making it unclear how a transmitter as [TTI] conceive[s] [is recited by the '275 patent ] would even be operative.\" (June 21, 2017, Order at 4, Dkt. 397.) In short, TTI's renewed argument depends upon a narrow reading of \"operational status condition\" which does not square with this Court's earlier construction of the term as encompassing status conditions of other categories of information the controller may experience (for example, light on/off, vacation mode on,\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   ). (See,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 (\"[a present] status condition [may] be\n   <em>\n    defined\n   </em>\n   (or determined, or its meaning clarified) by multiple operational conditions being experienced by the controller (for example, lights on in tandem with, as a result of, or in response to\n   the garage door's opening, a sensor's detection of a proximal vehicle, or a user's flipping the vacation mode switch).\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Claim 1 recites a transmitter that transmits \"a status condition signal that: corresponds to a present operational status condition defined, at least in part, by at least two operating states from the plurality of operating states...\" ( '275 Patent 8:13-17, Dkt. 1-2.) At trial, Chamberlain's evidence demonstrated that the Ryobi GDOs (both the GD200 and the revised, GD200A) do exactly that. Dr. Rhyne explained that in both versions of the Ryobi GDO, the device \"send[s] a signal corresponding to a present operational status condition.\" (Rhyne Tr. 288:4-5.) Such a signal (for example, \"light on\") is defined both by the status condition it carries and the potential, but not present, condition(s) it necessarily precludes (in this example, \"light off\"). (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   June 21, 2017, Order at 4, Dkt. 397 (indicating that Court's\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   order did not limit the operational conditions that are \"experienced by the controller and capable of defining its operational status condition(s)\" to only potential or to only present status conditions).) Dr. Rhyne explained as much to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [N]otice this light state [in the Ryobi electronic system architecture and design specifications]. This is the status condition on the light, and it's got two states. Remember, we had to have a plurality of states, two or more: Off and on. This is the status condition for the door. It's got five states: Closed, open, closing, opening, or a fault....[Y]ou can see here are those five states that are available. So I've got a status for the door defined by five possible states, the same words [as in the '275 patent ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (Rhyne Tr. 275:15-20, 277:14-17.) Chamberlain presented the jury with substantial evidence that accorded with the Court's claim constructions showing that the device taught by the '275 patent and the Ryobi GDOs send signals defined in the same way. A reasonable jury hearing this testimony could find literal infringement, so the Court will not grant TTI's JMOL and vacate that finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Here, TTI marshals two arguments against the jury's finding that TTI infringed the '275 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. First, TTI contends that because Chamberlain narrowed its claims during prosecution, it is estopped from arguing the doctrine of equivalents. Second, TTI argues that even if Chamberlain is not so estopped, Chamberlain nevertheless failed to present the jury with substantial evidence on the equivalents theory.

According to TTI, Chamberlain interjected such a limitation during the prosecution of '275 patent to overcome the Examiner's initial rejection of independent claim 1 based on the Doyle reference. The Court previously summarized the pertinent prosecution history as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   In the relevant amendment and remarks, the Applicant traversed Doyle by citing to Figure 2 of the Doyle and its associated text, which disclose a mercury switch oriented within a radio frequency (\"RF\") transmitter where the mercury bead only causes transmission of the RF signal when the garage door is in\n   <em>\n    an intermediate position\n   </em>\n   . The Application contrasted this facet of Doyle, in which the transmitted RF signal is keyed to a\n   <em>\n    single position or state of Doyle's garage door\n   </em>\n   , with its amended claims, which \"require a wireless status condition data transmitter to transmit a status condition signal that corresponds to a present operational status condition defined, at least in part, by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     at least two operating states\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   from the plurality of operating states.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20368027\">\n    2017 WL 368027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citing File History, App. No. 10/477,633, June 15, 2005, Amendment at 12 (emphasis in original) ).

As discussed above, Dr. Rhyne explained that both the Ryobi and Chamberlain GDOs use status conditions defined by a plurality of states (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   two states-on and off-define the status condition of the light; five states-closed, open, closing, opening, and fault- define the status of the door,\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   ). (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Rhyne Tr. 275:15-20, 277:14-17.) TTI now makes much of another part of Dr. Rhyne's testimony, which TTI takes as proof that Dr. Rhyne later reversed his position and agreed that the Ryobi status conditions are defined by only one state at a time. However, TTI's selection of that testimony leaves out Dr. Rhyne's clarification and is not representative. The full selection is this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q: So I asked you this question [in your deposition], Dr. Rhyne. \"So if we're talking about the present operational status condition,\" present operational status condition, \"of the door, at any point in time, it is only defined by one of the states that the door can be in, correct?\" And you asked me, \"One of the operating states?\" I said, \"Correct.\" And your answer was, \"Yes,\" correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A: I interpreted what you asked me to mean as I did the previous one, what's in that transmitted status condition that's sent out by the data transmitter.

At that time, you send out that one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   (Rhyne Tr. 354:4-22.) As Dr. Rhyne's clarification makes clear, he did not opine that the Ryobi devices operated based on status conditions defined at a given time by only one state; rather, Dr. Rhyne simply described the signal\n   <em>\n    format\n   </em>\n   of the GD200A device, which sends several discrete pings of data seriatim rather than sending a single batch, as does the pre-revision GD200. To the extent Chamberlain narrowed its claims during prosecution, TTI has not shown that its Ryobi GDOs fall between the broader and narrower language.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Festo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355200\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/722/#p733\">\n    535 U.S. at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156783\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/122/1831/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that applicants only surrender equivalents falling between the broader and narrower, post-amendment language).

Such evidence must establish \"equivalency on a limitation-by-limitation basis by particularized testimony and linking argument as to the insubstantiality of the differences between the claimed invention and the accused device or process.\"\n   <em>\n    Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc. v.

Cir. 1996) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Here, TTI argues that Chamberlain failed generally to provide evidence showing equivalents for claims 5 and 14 and failed specifically to provide equivalency evidence of the unique identifier limitation required in claims 1 and 14. These assertions do not accurately describe the evidence presented as trial. Dr. Rhyne clearly articulated the basis for his belief concerning equivalency for claim 1. (Rhyne Tr. 267:16-296:9 (concluding with \"[w]e have [now discussed every element of claim 1], and I've explained why in my opinion each and every element is met either literally under the way I think the claim ought to be interpreted or under the doctrine of equivalents under the way TTI thinks it should be interpreted.\").) Claim 5 incorporates all of the limitations of claim 1, which Dr. Rhyne explained at trial: \"[Claim 5] basically is what's called a dependent claim. So it starts out by saying 'the movable barrier operator of Claim 1.' So to infringe claim 5, you've got to meet all the limitations of claim 1.\" (Rhyne Tr. 296:13-16.) At trial, then, Chamberlain needed to present evidence of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents for all limitations of claim 1-which, as discussed, it did-as well as for the limitation unique to claim 5. That remaining limitation concerns the '275 patent's reliance on a \"plurality of operating states [that] includes at least one of\" any of the fourteen listed states, including, for example, \"moving a movable barrier in a first direction; moving the movable barrier in a second direction;...halting movement of the movable barrier;...receiving a wireless remote control signal;...[and] a lighting status change.\" ( '275 Patent 8:30-36, Dkt. 1-2.)

According to Dr. Rhyne, the Craftsman battery must be screwed in one way or another, because otherwise the battery could fall off the unit when it vibrates while raising or lowering the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1316:17-21.) In contrast, TTI's technical expert, Dr. Foley, maintained that a user's ability to remove those screws rendered the Craftsman battery removably connectable, but Dr. Rhyne rebutted that interpretation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   I think [that in explaining his position as to why the Craftsman battery is removable connectable, Dr. Foley] said, 'Well, I could go up there and undo the screws or something.'

Are you going to go up there, back your car out, get up on a ladder, and go up and unscrew it just so you can move it to another garage door, maybe if you have a two-car garage, especially when that other door already has a battery bolted on top of it to start with. That's just not-that's not a reasonable interpretation of the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   (Rhyne Tr. 1317:16-24.)

That claim discloses a battery removably connectable \"to electrically powered equipment other than and physically separate or separable from the barrier movement operator.\" ( '966 Patent 8:15-17, Dkt. 1-1.) At trial, Dr. Foley opined that the other electrically powered equipment disclosed here could be a second GDO, and that such an arrangement is possible under the Craftsman prior art. Dr. Rhyne disagreed, and relied on the specification for his conclusion that the other equipment cannot simply be a second GDO, and thus the '966 patent discloses a limitation not present in Craftsman. (Rhyne Tr. 1315:10-1316:11.) \"[W]hen there is conflicting testimony at trial, and the evidence overall does not make only one finding on the point reasonable, the jury is permitted to make credibility determinations and believe the witness it considers more trustworthy.\"\n   <em>\n    MobileMedia Ideas, LLC v.

As with Craftsman, TTI maintains that Crusius anticipates the '966 patent. But Dr. Rhyne testified that Crusius does not invalidate any of the '966 claims because the Crusius patent \"covers essentially the same thing as the Craftsman battery.\" (Rhyne Tr. 1324:7-19.) He added that the Crusius patent does not disclose a \"removably connectable\" battery nor any separate equipment that could be powered by the battery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Foley contradicted this latter finding in much the same way as he did Dr. Rhyne's opinions on Craftsman, that is, by explaining that the Crusius battery could be plugged into a second GDO and thereby satisfy the \"powered equipment other than and physically separate or separable from\" limitation. Again, Dr. Rhyne explained that the '966 specification required \"separate\" equipment other than a second GDO, and the jury was entitled to credit his interpretation over Dr. Foley's competing one.\n   <em>\n    MobileMedia Ideas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073377\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/1159/#p1168\">\n    780 F.3d at 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As for obviousness, TTI does not articulate any justification for its belief that no reasonable jury could have failed to find that the Crusius prior art renders obvious the asserted claims. And to any extent, Chamberlain points out that Dr. Rhyne testified regarding secondary considerations of nonobviousness which the jury may, and apparently did, choose to credit.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v.

According to Dr. Rhyne, TTI's internal patent disclosure demonstrated an industry-perceived, long-felt need for a GDO using a removably connectable, rechargeable battery, which is exactly what the '966 patent teaches. Chamberlain thus presented the jury with a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention as required for the jury to accord these secondary considerations of nonobviousness substantial weight.\n   <em>\n    FastShip, LLC v.

The Weik patent teaches a motor-operated door, and discloses \"two different embodiments, one of which has a portable battery and no charger and one of which has a non-portable battery but does have a charger.\" (Rhyne Tr. 1322:2-1323:3.) TTI does not argue that either embodiment, on its own, anticipates or renders obvious the '966 patent. Instead, TTI argues these problems arise for the '966 patent once the two Weik embodiments are combined. Neither of these arguments meets the high bar required to merit JMOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   First, to obviousness: \"Combining two embodiments disclosed adjacent to each other in a prior art patent does not require a leap of inventiveness\"; accordingly, such combinations can render an asserted patent obvious.\n   <em>\n    Boston Sci.

Cir. 2013) ). Dr. Rhyne explained at trial that the Weik patent teaches away from combining the two embodiments: The integrated charger embodiment offers the benefit of not requiring service personnel to bring a rechargeable battery with them when they service the motor-operated door taught by Weik, and, further, if service personnel brought a rechargeable battery to such a door, the trickle charger-which is designed to keep the plugged-in battery always charged-would take \"a couple of hours\" to charge the newly installed battery. (Rhyne 1321:23-1324:6.) Dr. Foley expressed a competing opinion, noting that the Weik patent teaches that \"there are many ways to interconnect various electrical elements to achieve the functions [of the Weik invention],\" which Dr. Foley took as \"teaching...to take the trickle charger from [the integrated embodiment] and drop it [into the non-integrated embodiment].\" (Foley Tr. 940:20-941:4.) But once more, because Dr. Foley's is not the only reasonable interpretation on this point, the Court will not overrule the jury's apparent credit for Dr. Rhyne's testimony over his counterpart's.\n   <em>\n    MobileMedia Ideas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073377\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/1159/#p1168\">\n    780 F.3d at 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Next, to anticipation: TTI correctly points out in its reply that whether prior art \"teaches away\" from combinations is only a part of the obviousness analysis and \"is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relevant to an anticipation analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Krippelz v.

Cir. 2012) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). As such, Dr. Rhyne's testimony concerning the Weik patent's teaching away from combining its embodiments cannot be substantial evidence against anticipation. Given this, TTI suggests that combining the embodiments covers every limitation in the '966 patent, and so the Weik combination anticipates, and thus invalidates, the patent. TTI's argument\n   is faulty. Though combinations of adjacently disclosed embodiments may be considered under the obviousness analysis, the same is not true for anticipation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp. v.

TTI suggests that Dr. Foley testified that \"it is appropriate to use elements from the two figures in his anticipation analysis.\" (Resp. at 36, Dkt. 618 (citing Foley Tr. 940:3-15, 1023:18-19).) If this was Dr. Foley's method, it was improper as a matter of law. And because Dr. Foley conceded that no one Weik embodiment anticipates all of claim 9's limitations, the jury was entitled to find that the Weik patent did not anticipate that claim. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Foley Tr. 1023:14-19 (\"Q: [Y]ou couldn't get all the elements of the claim here from one of the embodiments, you needed to mix and match from the two embodiments; is that right?

Literal Infringement of '966 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Dr. Rhyne walked through each element of each of claims 9, 14, and 15-18 of the '966 patent and explained that the Ryobi GDO infringes each one. (Rhyne Tr. 318:11-328:1.) Against this evidentiary backdrop, TTI argues that a reasonable jury still could not find TTI literally infringed because the '966 patent recites \"a battery charging station in electrical communication with a\n   <em>\n    rechargeable battery\n   </em>\n   \" and \"a method of power flow between at least one rechargeable battery, a barrier movement operator, [and]\n   <em>\n    electrically powered equipment other than and physically separate or separable from the barrier movement operator.\n   </em>\n   ( '966 Patent 8:10-11, 40-44, Dkt. 1-1 (emphasis added).)

And yet, as described more fully below, the jury heard very little, if any, evidence of TTI taking steps to avoid infringing the '966 patent, even though TTI was well aware of it. (\n   <em>\n    See, infra\n   </em>\n   at Part IV.)

One useful, but non-exclusive method to establish a patentee's entitlement to lost profits is the\n   <em>\n    Panduit\n   </em>\n   test, which requires four showings: (1) \"demand for the patented product\"; (2) \"absence of acceptable noninfringing substitutes\"; (3) \"manufacturing and marketing capability to exploit the demand\"; and (4) \"the amount of profit that...would have [been] made.\"\n   <em>\n    Georgetown Rail Equip.

TTI argues that Chamberlain could not satisfy the second\n   <em>\n    Panduit\n   </em>\n   factor because the Genie Aladdin Connect was an acceptable, noninfringing substitute available on the market during the relevant timeframe. True, the evidence at trial demonstrated that the Aladdin Connect was available, (Hansen Tr. 491:7-11), and non-infringing, (Rhyne Tr. 392:18-22), but it does not necessarily follow that it was also an \"acceptable substitute.\" TTI puts a lot of stock in one selection from testimony given by Chamberlain's damages expert, Mr. Hansen. Shortly after Hansen acknowledged that Home Depot sold the Aladdin Connect during the relevant timeframe, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Q. And so at least as far as Home Depot is concerned, that system is acceptable?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   A. It's-it's an alternative. It's an alternative that they make available for their customers, provide an additional choice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   Q. It's an acceptable alternative to Home Depot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   A. I would agree that it's acceptable to Home Depot. I wouldn't expect them to sell products that they don't think are acceptable at some level.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   (Hansen Tr. 492:2-10.) But all Hansen says here is that Home Depot finds the Aladdin Connect to be an acceptable product to stock and sell. Absent from this selection is any indication that this product, beyond being an acceptable \"alternative,\" is an acceptable\n   <em>\n    substitute\n   </em>\n   for the infringing Ryobi GDOs. The \"[m]ere existence of a competing device does not make that device an acceptable substitute.\"\n   <em>\n    TWM Mfg. Co. v.

Cir. 1986). Further, a \"product lacking the advantages of that patented can hardly be termed a substitute 'acceptable' to the customer who wants those advantages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573816\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/895/#p901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Panduit Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"930210,930086\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/575/1152/\">\n    575 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1162 ). The Aladdin Connect does not share the advantages of the infringing Ryobi GDOs and so TTI cannot hold it out as an acceptable substitute. For one, the Aladdin Connect employs a separate, powered wall control and a door sensor, which require additional setup, providing a greater chance for \"frustration and/or failure.\" (Sorice Tr. 182:5.) The Aladdin Connect thus lacks the out-of-the-box connectivity that, according to the record, makes the Chamberlain and Ryobi GDOs uniquely attractive to vendors and customers alike.

TTI argues that there are four, independently sufficient reasons it is entitled to a new trial: (1) the Court erroneously permitted the jury to determine the scope of the claims; (2) prejudicial and erroneous evidentiary rulings; (3) inconsistent verdicts given the Court's doctrine-of-equivalents instruction; and (4) the Court should have granted TTI's pre-trial motion to transfer venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The heart of the matter is the meaning behind this language, from claim 1: \"a present operational status condition defined, at least in part, by at least two operating states from the plurality of operating states.\" ( '275 Patent, 8:15-17, Dkt. 1-2.) TTI points to the Court's end-of-trial statement that \"there was a clear dispute between the experts on what 'defined' means\" (Tr. 1391:1-3) to argue that there was thus a \"fundamental dispute regarding the scope of a claim term,\" which must be resolved by the Court and not the jury.\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro Int'l Ltd. v.

TTI did not press for a construction of \"defined\"; rather, the parties sought a construction of the encapsulating claim language \"a controller having a plurality of potential operational status conditions defined, at least in part, by a plurality of operating states.\" This the Court provided, to wit: \"a programmable platform (such as, for example, a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a programmable logic or gate array, or the like), that can obtain, though self-awareness or through externally developed information (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   from sensors), two or more potential operational status conditions\n   <em>\n    defined,\n   </em>\n   at least in\n   part,\n   <em>\n    by two or more operational conditions being experienced by the controller [programmable platform]\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201304559\">\n    2017 WL 1304559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (brackets in original) (emphasis added). While it is true that TTI initially suggested in its opening\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   briefs that \"defined by\" should be should be construed as \"determined by\" (Dkt. 151 at 10-11, 14; Dkt. 188 at 7-8), TTI apparently abandoned that suggestion before the Court ruled. As Chamberlain observes, TTI ended up proposing a construction that mimics the \"defined by\" language TTI now claims spawned a grave legal error. (TTI's Supp. Claim Constr. at 11, Dkt. 286 (proposing construction: \"...where each potential status condition is\n   <em>\n    defined by\n   </em>\n   at least two actions that can be performed by the controller at a particular time\").) Indeed, the Court went so far as to note in its\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   decision that \"[n]either side proposes to construe 'defined,' \"\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201304559\">\n    2017 WL 1304559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 -an observation that TTI never took issue with until after the close the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Ultimately, TTI's complaint is not directed to some purported failure by the Court to define the scope of these claims. Rather, TTI is simply relitigating its already-defeated grievance that the Court's construction of claim 1 was different than what TTI urged. As described, TTI urged the Court to construe the recited status condition as defined by\n   <em>\n    actions performed\n   </em>\n   by the controller. But the Court declined to do so in light of the specification, observing that the \" 'operating states' recited in dependent claim 5 [cannot] be read as uniformly or as broadly\" as TTI suggested.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201304559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After consulting the prosecution history and the Federal Circuit's claim construction ruling in this case, the Court construed \"operating states\" not as actions taken by the controller, but rather as \"operational conditions being experienced by the controller.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13. Further, the Court made clear during this litigation that the \"operational conditions being experienced\" are not limited, in the Court's construction, to only potential or only present conditions. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   June 21, 2017, Summary Judgment Order at 4, Dkt. 397.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In its new trial Motion, TTI basically argues that even though the parties did not propose or seek a construction of \"define,\" the Court's construction of the encapsulating claim language did not provide sufficient clarification as to the scope of claims. (Mem. in Supp. of New Trial at 5, Dkt. 620 (\"The Court provided little guidance....\").) This is odd. If TTI believed the Court's constructions were not sufficient, TTI should have requested further construction. Yet this TTI never did, even as discovery progressed and the parties' experts began tendering their reports. Now TTI maintains that these experts testified not to the\n   <em>\n    meaning\n   </em>\n   of the construed language, but rather to the\n   <em>\n    claim scope,\n   </em>\n   and that the Court then submitted those competing interpretations of law to the jury for deliberation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   There is problem with TTI's argument. Put simply, beyond TTI's initial, and quickly abandoned, suggestion that the Court construe \"defined by\" as \"determined by,\" TTI never requested that the Court construe this now-challenged phrase, nor suggested that some allegedly lacking construction could open the door to legal error. TTI did not object while Chamberlain's experts testified-TTI would now presumably argue inappropriately-concerning the meaning of \"experienced by,\" nor when the Court instructed the jury and placed this question in their hands. \"[L]itigants waive their right to present new claim construction disputes if they are raised for the first time after trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Broadcom Corp. v.

TTI leans on the Court's close-of-trial (but pre-jury-deliberation) comment that a \"clear dispute\" existed between the experts on what \"defined\" means, but in making that remark, the Court was thinking only of the\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   dispute between experts concerning the meaning of the claim term. If a misapprehension of this comment struck TTI like a lightning bolt and for the first time caused TTI to see some legal deficiency in the Court's constructions, TTI should have said so. Because TTI did not, TTI has waived this claim construction argument. TTI never requested that the district court construe the complained-of term and did not offer a construction; instead, TTI waited until \"after the presentation of all of the evidence to the jury [to] even suggest that claim construction might be helpful to determine the proper scope of the claimed invention.\"\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly &amp; Company v.

The Court denied that motion, and TTI now argues that permitting this evidence to go to the jury created prejudice and juror confusion that necessitates a new trial. The PTAB relied on different claim constructions than did this Court, and TTI argues that allowing this evidence risks that the jury could have improperly substituted the PTAB decisions-or Chamberlain's characterization of those decisions-for the jury's own findings.

By the time the Supreme Court announced\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland,\n   </em>\n   the Chamberlain/TTI trial date was only three months away. Still, TTI waited another month before filing its\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   motion to transfer. (Dkt. 392.) This unnecessary delay is problematic for two reasons. First, with the trial date fast approaching, the parties continued to burn resources in discovery and pre-trial motion practice, and the Court expended its own energies mediating these disputes. The parties exchanged discovery, submitted expert reports, answered one another's claims, and attended two in-court hearings. Second, TTI's counsel chose not to delay in raising a\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   argument in another matter. During the month-long interregnum in the instant litigation, TTI's counsel moved-a mere eight days after the Supreme Court published\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   to transfer venue in another case pending in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cobalt Boats,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273948\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/836/#p840\">\n    254 F.Supp.3d at 839-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Virginia district court denied that motion,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273948\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/836/#p840\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   and counsel sought a writ of mandamus from the Federal Circuit, which was denied,\n   <em>\n    In re Sea Ray Boats, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=695%20Fed.%20Appx.%20543\">\n    695 Fed.Appx. 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2017). Only then did counsel file the\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   motion to transfer venue in the instant case. Chamberlain suggests this behavior has the hallmarks of a \"tactical wait-and-see\" approach which enabled TTI's counsel to reshape their\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   argument as necessary in the instant case depending on the relative success of their first attempt in Virginia. The Federal Circuit took care to suggest the potentially problematic nature of such gamesmanship: \"We also note a scenario that presents at least an obvious starting point for a claim of forfeiture, whether based on timeliness or consent or\n   distinct grounds: a defendant's tactical wait-and-see bypassing of an opportunity to declare a desire for a different forum, where the course of proceedings might well have been altered by such a declaration.\"\n   <em>\n    Micron,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266696\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1091/#p1098\">\n    875 F.3d at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And finally, though the Federal Circuit chose not to provide a specific framework for when courts may find waiver by means other than noncompliance with Rule 12, the court of appeals approvingly recited its past denials of mandamus \"in several cases involving venue objections based on\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   that were presented close to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266696\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1091/#p1098\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266696\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1091/#p1098\">\n    at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Beyond this, Chamberlain also requests a Court-approval condition, under which TTI cannot introduce\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   WiFi-capable GDO without prior permission from the Court.

TTI instead proposes \"to voluntarily provide [Chamberlain's] outside counsel with seven days' notice of its intended launch date of any new GDO at The Home Depot,\" and to meet and confer regarding the same. Finally, Chamberlain replies that if the Court is inclined to impose such a notice condition as TTI suggests, the notice period should be two months, not seven days. To any extent, the Court will not impose any of these additional conditions. TTI is enjoined from further infringing the '275 patent as set forth above; if TTI disregards that mandate, TTI will likely owe Chamberlain still further damages and possibly find itself sanctioned by the Court.

Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Here, Chamberlain says TTI acted egregiously. TTI, of course, disputes the characterization, claiming instead that this litigation arose from a simple business dispute and that its attorneys permissibly litigated with zeal. Before the Court takes up the\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factors, it notes the relevant background: First, during the time that TTI developed the Ryobi GDO 200, TTI was acutely aware that the enterprise could trespass on IP rights if TTI were not careful. TTI's primary customer, Home Depot, acknowledged as much (Dkt. 642-5 at 2 (Trial Ex. No. PTX-188) (describing IP research as \"the main area of concern\" with the Ryobi GDO development) ), and TTI's internal documents described possible IP problems as high risk, meaning \"[t]he project is going to be adversely impacted by th[e] issue if it is not addressed. Multiple risk reduction plans are necessary.\" (Dkt. 642-7 at 35, 37 (Trial Ex. No. PTX-67).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   But TTI's awareness of possible IP issues was not limited to the abstract. Several events put TTI on notice of both the '275 and the '966 patents specifically. As to the former: TTI engineers acquired Chamberlain GDOs which practice the\n   '275 patent ; these engineers disassembled the devices and used the internal parts to make a demo of the Ryobi device that TTI presented to Home Depot. (Huggins Tr. 601:17-603:2.) At the time the TTI engineers took apart Chamberlain's GDO, it was marked, in a place plainly visible upon deconstructing the device, as practicing the '275 patent. (Huggins Tr. 605:9-606:12.) Despite admitting both the visibility of this marking and the fact that TTI took apart the Chamberlain unit (\n   <em>\n    see,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267284\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1350/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), TTI's employees testified that they never saw the '275 patent marking. (TTI's Resp. to Mot. for Enhanced Damages at 14, Dkt. 645 (collecting citations to trial transcript).) This is not the only example of TTI being put on notice of the '275 patent, however. During the Ryobi GDO development phase, TTI hired a consultant who had previously worked at Overhead Door, another market competitor. This consultant had been aware of the '275 patent while at Overhead Door and advised TTI that it would need to be careful of the intellectual property rights around \"wireless devices and [GDOs].\" (Carlson Dep. Designations 37:13-15, 37:17-38:8, 56:4-7, 70:7-11, Dkt. 610-1.) TTI was also on notice during this time-and indeed, long before- of the '966 patent. TTI filed a PCT application back in 2009, and international search reports indicated that it faced novelty and obviousness problems in light of the '966 patent. (Dkt. 623-9 at 27 (Trial Ex. No. PTX-630).) TTI learned of the patent again in February 2015 during GDO development. (TTI's Fifth Supp. Answers to Chamberlain's First Set of Interrogatories at 9, Dkt. 624-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Read\n    </em>\n    Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <em>\n    Deliberate Copying.\n   </em>\n   Here, \"the evidence show[s] that [TTI] was aware of [Chamberlain's GDO] and intended to develop a product with similar capabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Polara Eng'g, Inc. v.

And yet, despite being aware of the risk of infringement, there is no suggestion that TTI did anything to avoid colliding with it head-on.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apple Inc. v.

The Court will not nitpick each of these contests now, though it will note one moment in which TTI behaved less than admirably. Chamberlain moved for a preliminary injunction and the Court granted it on September 15, 2016. (Mem. Op. and Order, Dkt. 104.) But the Court did not actually enter that injunction until five days later. (Order, Dkt. 111.) In that brief interim, TTI sold off\n   approximately 6,000 of the original GD200s to Home Depot. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Ex. J to Enhanced Damages Mot., Dkt. 624-11.) TTI thus unloaded (since-determined-to-be) infringing stock despite the Court's announcement that it intended to halt all such sales imminently. That the Federal Circuit later vacated the preliminary injunction is no defense; possible\n   <em>\n    vacatur\n   </em>\n   on appeal is no excuse for disregarding a court order. This factor also weighs in favor of enhanced damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <em>\n    TTI's Size and Financial Condition.\n   </em>\n   TTI is a multibillion dollar company with the means to absorb $11.4 million in treble damages.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metabolite Labs., Inc. v.

Courts may account for such pre-verdict sales not presented at trial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finjan, Inc. v. Secure Computing Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052325\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/1197/#p1212\">\n    626 F.3d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (affirming supplemental damages for infringing sales never considered by the jury);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20284\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When damages are not found by a jury, the court shall assess them\"). These supplemental damages derive from the same three sources as the original damages determined by the jury: (1) lost profits for sales of infringing GDOs; (2) future accessories for those infringing GDOs; (3) royalties for sales of infringing GDOs not accounted for in Chamberlain's lost profits, as determined by Chamberlain's market share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   TTI contends that none of these supplemental damages is appropriate because TTI has begun and intends to complete buying back from Home Depot all remaining stock of infringing Ryobi GDOs. But TTI cites no legal authority explaining why its repurchasing plan erases the harm done to Chamberlain or annuls damages TTI would otherwise owe. As Chamberlain correctly notes, Chamberlain suffered lost profits at the time TTI made the initial, infringing sales to Home Depot; a later-implemented buy-back plan does not undo that harm. Beyond this, TTI states that its intent in repurchasing the infringing GDOs is simply to sell those GDOs directly to consumers, rather than use Home Depot as a middle man. Chamberlain is entitled to supplemental damages for both lost profits and royalties for TTI's infringing sales occurring from May 1, 2017 to September 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   However, the calculus might not be so simple for the supplemental damages for lost future sales of GDO accessories. By using an \"accessory attach rate\" of 0.75, Chamberlain's damages expert concluded that Chamberlain \"lost or is likely to lose in the future sales of 11,442 accessory units associated with the lost GDOs, resulting in additional lost profits of $134,496 for accessories.\" (J. Hansen Decl. \u00b6 2, Dkt. 630-1.) So unlike the supplemental damages for lost profits or royalties associated with GDO sales, these accessory-sales damages are predicated upon downstream purchases by consumers. Thus, to the extent TTI's buy-back strategy removes infringing Ryobi GDOs from the market, Chamberlain may not\n   recover for now-prevented, would-have-been purchases of accessories. But again, TTI has announced its intention to re-sell the repurchased GDOs directly to consumers. If TTI has already repurchased and resold all of Home Depot's remaining stock, this digression is moot and Chamberlain is entitled to supplemental damages for accessory lost profits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TTI's Opp. to Enhanced Damages at 13 n.10, Dkt. 645 (acknowledging TTI's intent to sell its remaining inventory of infringing Ryobi GDOs and predicting selling out all on-hand stock within six months of October 18, 2017).) But as discussed above, the Court now grants Chamberlain's Motion for a permanent injunction. As such, any repurchased product on-hand at TTI may not be sold to future consumers. Thus, it is only that stock-stock which no consumer will ever use-that may decrease the supplemental accessory damages TTI must pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Given the above, the Court grants Chamberlain's Motion for supplemental damages in part and awards the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   1.

(\n   <em>\n    See, id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under the totality of the circumstances, the Court believes an exercise of its discretion is appropriate here: It finds this case exceptional and accordingly awards Chamberlain reasonable attorneys' fees.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   <strong>\n    B. What Fees to Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Chamberlain and TTI tussle over whether TTI's objections to the sought-after fees were untimely under Local Rule 54.3 and thus waived. The shortest version of the dispute is this: The Court required the parties to file their Joint Statement by November 21, 2017. Chamberlain produced 562 pages of invoices to TTI about two months in advance of that deadline, but did not provide any further breakdown or summary of those fees until the November 21st due date. In the Joint Statement, TTI maintains that because Chamberlain tardily produced this breakdown, TTI lacked the information necessary to provide specific objections to Chamberlain's invoices, which \"contained numerous categories of fees and costs that [are] not compensable.\" (Joint Statement at 10, Dkt. 690.) Still, TTI then waited until January 3, 2018 to articulate its objections in its response to Chamberlain's motion for fees. Though both parties make much of this quarrel, Local Rule 54.3 does not mandate waiver in such circumstances, and here TTI's delayed articulation has not prejudiced the Court's ability to settle the fee dispute. The Court will accordingly consider TTI's objections as it weighs which fees to award in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Chamberlain requests $8,033,942.73 in attorneys' fees (Reply at 13, Dkt. 717 (explaining that since Chamberlain filed its Motion for fees requesting $8,286,135.93, Chamberlain received updated information regarding its legal expenses in this case and adjusted its request accordingly).) In support of its request, Chamberlain provides a breakdown of the billing rates for each attorney who\n   worked on this matter. (M. Brody Decl. at 5-6, Dkt. 704-2.) The Seventh Circuit has \"defined a reasonable hourly rate as one that is 'derived from the market rate for the services rendered.' [Further, the court of appeals] presume[s] that an attorney's actual billing rate for similar litigation is appropriate to use as the market rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Pickett v. Sheridan Health Care Ctr.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861306\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/632/#p640\">\n    664 F.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (7th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Denius v.

Here, Chamberlain provides the affidavit of Michael Brody, the Co-Chair of Winston &amp; Strawn's IP Practice. Mr. Brody attests to extensive litigation and intellectual property experience and has been a member of this district's trial bar since 1985. He regularly handles litigation budgeting matters at his law firm, and he has applied that experience to his review of Chamberlain's billing invoices in this matter. He also reviewed the backgrounds of Chamberlain's attorneys and ultimately agreed that Chamberlain's proposed fees in this case are competitive with those incurred by other Chicago and nationwide firms handling patent litigation of similar complexity. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Brody Decl., Dkt. 704-2.) Further, the Court compared the hourly rates for Chamberlain's and TTI's respective counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124786\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/919/#p930\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (reciting hourly rates for Chamberlain's counsel),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 711-9 (reciting hourly rates for TTI's counsel).) When, as often occurs in Mr. Brody's declaration, Chamberlain lists an individual timekeeper's rates as a range rather than a single figure, the Court used the median of the range presented for the purposes of this comparison. These are the results: Chamberlain's attorneys charged an average of $753.57/hour per partner and $453.31/hour per associate; TTI's attorneys charged an average of $747.35/hour per partner and $410.80/hour per associate. These rates are not far apart-TTI's rates are within 10% of Chamberlain's-suggesting that the rates charged by Chamberlain's counsel do not much deviate from the market rate for services rendered.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pickett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861306\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/632/#p640\">\n    664 F.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because of this and Mr. Brody's declaration to the same effect, the Court agrees with Chamberlain that its counsels' recited hourly rates are reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Having determined that the rates are reasonable, the Court must decide whether it should subtract any sums from Chamberlain's requested total. Chamberlain provides the following breakdown of its attorneys' fees:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-240\"><strong>Firm</strong> <strong>Total Paid</strong> <strong>Total Paid</strong> <strong>Total Paid</strong> <strong>(-6097 Related</strong> <strong>(-6097</strong> <strong>(-6097</strong> <strong>IPRs)</strong> <strong>Litigation)</strong> <strong>Litigation &amp;</strong> <strong>Related IPRs)</strong> Winston &amp; $0 $1,737,490.30 $1,737,490.30 Strawn Fish &amp; $870,437.82 $5,426,014.61 $6,296,452.43 Richardson</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   (Reply, Dkt. 717 at 13.) First, the Court will not award Chamberlain the $870,437.82 it spent on counsel for IPR proceedings. Fees related to a separate legal proceeding cannot be recovered.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hickory Farms, Inc. v.

Cal. Aug. 19, 2015), but as TTI points out, both of the cases Chamberlain cites\n   involved a stay of litigation pending the Patent Office proceedings. Thus, in those cases, \"[t]he parties and the district court clearly intended to replace the district court litigation with the [Patent Office] proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    PPG Indus.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550768\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/1565/#p1568\">\n    840 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1568 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deep Sky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2010844231\">\n    2015 WL 10844231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. No such replacement occurred here, where the Patent Office proceedings ran concurrently with this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Nor can Chamberlain recover fees for efforts that ultimately failed. Prime among these is TTI's ultimately victorious appeal to the Federal Circuit from this Court's Order instituting the preliminary injunction. Chamberlain did not win that appeal, and the Federal Circuit has taken issue with district courts awarding fees related to court-of-appeals proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Phonometrics, Inc. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Appx.%20284\">\n    65 Fed.Appx. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285-86 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (vacating award of interlocutory-appeal-related attorney fees). The Court will not award Chamberlain the $250,289.69 in fees and costs related to that appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   True, Chamberlain won fleeting victories on its motions for a preliminary injunction and for contempt. But the aforementioned Federal Circuit decision vacated those victories. The Court will not award Chamberlain for these unsuccessful motions, even if this Court at first agreed with Chamberlain's arguments.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Zenith Goldline Pharm., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110449\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/264/753/#p771\">\n    264 F.Supp.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 771 (S.D. Ind. 2003) (denying fees for unsuccessful motions to compel and for summary judgment). However, calculating how much Chamberlain spent in fees pursuing these motions has not been simple. TTI helpfully provided a breakdown of the 2,289.90 total purported hours related to these motions and to the Federal Circuit appeal (\n   <em>\n    see,\n   </em>\n   Ex. E to Response, Dkt. 711-5), but there are limits to that breakdown's usefulness: TTI did not break out which of these 2,000-plus hours relate to the appeal, as opposed to the motions; though TTI split up these total hours between individual timekeepers, TTI did not import the hourly fees for these timekeepers from the joint status report (Dkt. 690); and TTI lists one attorney twice, without explanation. Chamberlain did not provide a breakdown of its own. To clear this up swiftly and avoid further unnecessary briefing, the parties shall submit a joint report within fourteen (14) days providing a billing rate for each timekeeper appearing in TTI's list, and the report shall identify which hours relate to the appeal and which to the motions. For those timekeepers that Mr. Brody's declaration lists not a single hourly rate by a range, the parties shall use the median of that range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   To the remaining, sought-after attorneys' fees: TTI levies two objections the Court finds somewhat meritorious. In some instances, partners could have kept fees lower by delegating tasks such as responding to discovery requests and drafting simple motions to more junior, and thus less expensive, attorneys.\n   <em>\n    Prather v.

Second, Chamberlain points out that not only were several stages of this case particularly fast-moving-\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   the preliminary injunction and TTI's Federal Circuit petition for a writ of mandamus after this Court's denial of TTI's motion to transfer venue-but also that hearing transcripts were often cited before the Court throughout this litigation only days or weeks after they were ordered. (Chamberlain's Reply at 6, Dkt. 683 (citing three examples).) Further, expedited trial transcripts have been found to be reasonable and necessary where, as here, \"the case involved expert witnesses whose cross-examination required knowledge of the exact wording of their previous testimony or that of any other witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Hillmann v.

Neither Chamberlain's affidavit nor its invoices state the number of copies made of each document, although Chamberlain's memorandum in support explains that while the answer is seven of each, Chamberlain only seeks costs for three copies a piece given this Court's recognition that \"district courts have usually limited recovery to three sets of copies, as a prevailing party may not recover copies made for its personal use, but may recover for copies submitted to the court and opposing counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Menasha Corp. v.
