International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Airline Division and Teamsters Local Union No. 1108 (Local 1108) move to dismiss the complaint or to transfer venue to the Northern District of Ohio, where both Flight Options and Local 1108 are located. Flight Options, as Plaintiff, has selected the District of Columbia as its preferred forum; Defendant IBT Airline Division, the certified bargaining representative and signatory to the parties' collective bargaining agreement, is located in D.C. All parties agreed to arbitrate Captain Hodges' discharge in the District; the arbitration that is the focus of this case began and continued for two days in D.C.; and Defendant Local 1108 thereby had substantial contacts with D.C. and can be deemed to have consented to jurisdiction in D.C. The Court will deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the papers, Flight Options is a luxury jet fractional air carrier headquartered in Richmond Heights, Ohio. Flight Options is signatory to a collective bargaining agreement with IBT Airline Division that covers its pilots. IBT and IBT Airline Division are located in the District of Columbia. Local 1108, which \"implement[s]\" the collective bargaining agreement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer Venue (Defs.' Mot.) [Dkt. 5] at 2, is located in Richmond Heights, Ohio.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties argue over whether this Court in the District of Columbia has jurisdiction over Local 1108, which is an unincorporated association headquartered in Richmond, Ohio, where Flight Options is also headquartered.

Contending that \"Local 1108 is the local affiliate of the IBT that handles the day-to-day representation of the pilots at Flight Options and actually prosecuted the grievance and arbitration from its headquarters in Richmond Heights, Ohio,\" Defendants argue that \"[n]o substantial part of events or omissions giving rise to the claim for relief occurred in the District of Columbia,\" so that jurisdiction cannot be predicated on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

As is the IBT, this \"administrative\" arm of IBT is located in the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. at 2. The underlying legal relationship that binds the parties to arbitrate Captain Hodges' discharge is, therefore, between Flight Options and IBT Airline Division. Local 1108 is the local agent authorized to carry out IBT Airline Division's contractual responsibilities and assert its contractual rights, as Local 1108 has done here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Local 1108 is headquartered in Richmond, Ohio where it is an unincorporated \"resident\" that can sue and be sued. However, it also \"resides\" for purposes of \u00a7 1391(c)(2)\"in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question.\" 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1391(c)(2). The question, therefore, returns to \u00a7 1391(b) and whether Local 1108 has purposefully established minimum contacts in the District of Columbia through (i) its agreement to arbitrate the Hodges grievance in this district (the location of IBT Airline Division and near the arbitrator in Columbia, MD); and (ii) its active presence in the District of Columbia for the first two days of that arbitration, which is the subject of the instant petition. This is a close question on which the instant record does not provide sufficient historical detail to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, it is much more clear that the District of Columbia is \"a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p474\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1391(b)(2). First, all parties mutually agreed to hold the arbitration hearing in this city. Second, all parties presented themselves on the appointed days to present their cases to Arbitrator LaRue. Third, it is exactly that Arbitrator's decision that is in contention here. Fourth, the District of Columbia is Plaintiff Flight Options' preferred venue, which gets some deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This conclusion does not deny that other venues, such as the Northern District of Ohio, might also be available. It merely reflects that, not unusually, a lawsuit\n   might properly be filed in more than one district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
