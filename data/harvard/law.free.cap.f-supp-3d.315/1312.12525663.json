The due process request alleged: (1) that the November 10, 2016, IEP was finalized without C.B., and the classroom teacher being present at the IEP meeting, (2) that the IEP overstated J.A.B.'s need for intensive instruction in an Exceptional Student Education classroom and therefore denied J.A.B. a FAPE under the IDEA, and (3) that J.A.B. had been removed from the Florida State Standards Curriculum without his mother's consent. D.E. 1-1 at 2. The School Board responded to the complaint and admitted that the IEP meeting had been\n   convened without C.B. being present. D.E. 1-1 at 7-8. On April 18, 2017, the ALJ issued an Amended Final Order, finding that the IEP was prepared and implemented without parental input in violation of the IDEA, that J.A.B. was entitled to 30 minutes of weekly language services as compensation, and that J.A.B. was entitled to attorney's fees and costs under Florida Administrative Code Rule 6A-6.03311(9)(x).

In the alternative, the School Board argued that J.A.B. should not have been awarded attorney's fees because J.A.B. had not been the \"prevailing party\" at the due process hearing, and the relief finally awarded to J.A.B. was less than Plaintiff's previous settlement offer.

Defendant did not raise the \u00a7 1983, ADA, or Section 504 claims at the due process hearing in her request for a due process hearing, D.E. 19-1, and Defendant did not amended her due process complaint to reflect these claims. D.E. 1-2 at 8. Defendant therefore failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as required by the IDEA and these counterclaims must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendant argues that she did not need to exhaust her administrative remedies because she is seeking additional damages and other relief not available under the IDEA, namely damages and declaratory judgment. D.E. 22 at 15. Defendant also argues that exhaustion would be futile as the ALJ in an administrative hearing does not have jurisdiction to decide ADA or \u00a7 1983 claims, and although ALJs have some authority to resolve Section 504 claims, it would be futile to litigate the same set of facts with regard to its Section 504 claim. D.E. 22 at 15. These arguments are unavailing. The fact that bringing the Section 504 claim before the ALJ would involve \"re-litigating\" the same facts does not absolve Defendant of her obligation to bring that claim before the ALJ in the first instance; if the Defendant seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE, Defendant\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   first exhaust her administrative remedies as to that claim before coming to this Court.\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p754\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only reason Defendant would have to \"relitigate\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   the facts of her Section 504 claim is because she failed to raise it at the due process hearing. As to the ALJ's jurisdiction, the Eleventh Circuit has found that \"[t]he IDEA's broad complaint provision affords the 'opportunity to present complaints with respect to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   matter\n   <em>\n    relating\n   </em>\n   to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a [FAPE] to such child.' \"\n   <em>\n    M.T.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2844095\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/1153/#p1158\">\n    446 F.3d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6) ) (emphasis in original). Defendant's additional argument that she did not need to exhaust administrative remedies because she is seeking relief not available under the IDEA is similarly unavailing.
