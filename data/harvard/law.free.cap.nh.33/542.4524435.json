H. 509; <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>15 N. H. 227; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jenness &amp; a., </em>7 Howard S. C. R. 612.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-10\">This lien was duly perfected by judgment, the levy of execution, and the deed of the officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-11\">The contest is not in this case as in <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>3 Foster 136, between partnership creditors and separate creditors, both claiming under the laws of this State, but between creditors of the firm, claiming title under the laws of New-Hampshire, and purchasers of a title purporting to be derived under the bankrupt act of August 19, 1841.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-12\">If the claim of Crockett &amp; Shapleigh had been a separate debt of Peck, there would be no dispute as to the demandant\u2019s title; the authorities above cited are conclusive of that matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-13\">The separate estate of a member of a partnership is liable for the partnership debts, and may be attached and held on such debts, unless the separate creditors interfere.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-14\">Until such interference the lien so acquired is as valid as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>attachment of partnership property on the same claim would be; and even if such lien were conditional or contingent, it would be no less a lien within the proviso of the bankrupt act. <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>before cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-5\">An attachment of the separate property of a member of a firm by a partnership creditor would not necessarily be defeated or destroyed by an attachment by a separate creditor. The only effect would be to give the separate creditor a preference in case he obtained judgment; and if there were other separate property sufficient to satisfy the separate debt, or the property attached were more than sufficient to satisfy such debt, the lien created by the attachment on the partnership debt would still subsist, and might be made effectual for paying that debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-6\">The mere existence of separate debts cannot operate to defeat an attachment on a partnership debt, and a lien on Peck\u2019s separate estate having been acquired by Crockett &amp; Shaplegh\u2019s attachment on the 10th day of October, 1842, the demandant\u2019s title must prevail, unless it can be shown that this lien has been in some way defeated. And if so, how has it been defeated ? Not, as might perhaps have been done, by attachments on Peek\u2019s separate debts between October 10 and December 21,1842. Not by virtue of any of the provisions of the bankrupt act, for liens of this character are preserved by the express terms of the proviso of that act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-7\">2. The payment to Yose of the sum due on the Cochran mortgage operated as an assignment of the mortgage ; Yose\u2019s protest to the contrary notwithstanding. The court will treat such payment either as a discharge or an assignment, as may best subserve the purposes of justice-, without regard to the gratuitous declarations of one whose rights to interfere or dictate in the matter have been extinguished by payment of his claim.

The property in question, being the property of Philip Peck, had been at the time of the levy of the plaintiffs, lawfully applied in payment of his separate creditors. Bankrupt Law of 1841.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-8\">2. The demandants acquired no right or title by the tender to Mr. Yose, made June 24,1846. They could only acquire a right in virtue of their own right as attaching creditors. But when the tender was made, the <em>right </em>to redeem had been lawfully sold by the assignee of the separate estate of Philip <em>Peck; so </em>that they had in fact no interest to protect, and no right to make the tender. Comp. Stat., chap. 195, sec. 8, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-9\">3. The equity of redemption having been duly conveyed to Henry Foster, the assignment by Mr. Yose of the Cochran mortgage, the mortgage not having been foreclosed, amounted in fact to a <em>discharge </em>of the mortgage, so that Henry Foster\u2019s title was after that time wholly under the assignee\u2019s deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-10\">The tenant being in possession, February 16, 1850, the deed of Henry Foster of that date was a good conveyance as against Mm and his heirs, to all the interest he then had in the land. Comp. Stat., chap. 136.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-11\">4. But whether the title be in the heirs of Henry Foster or in the tenant, is, for the purposes of this case, immaterial. The tenant is in possession, and his possession cannot be disturbed by the demandants unless they show some title which they do not. They never had any <em>seizin, </em>or title of any kind.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b549-12\">Eastman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGoZ\">It was settled in <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>3 Foster 136, after a thorough examination of the question, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>separate creditors of a partner have a preference over the separate estate of their debtor, for the satisfaction of their debts; and that where land of one partner is set off on execution, for a debt due from the partnership, and afterwards the same land is set off on execution for a separate debt of the partner, the separate creditor of the individual partner will hold the land, and such must be regarded as the law in this State. The following among other authorities sustain that decision. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Neill, </em>8 Howard\u2019s Sup. Court 414; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Blodgett, </em>8 N. H. 248; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Newman, 5 </em>Serg. &amp; Rawle 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>the attachment on the partnership debt was made before that on the individual debt, and the set-off on the execution recovered in the former suit was made six months before that in the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The rule laid down in that case goes to the extent to protect the separate property for the separate debts, until it shall be actually and legally appropriated for the partnership debts. The fact that a lien has been created by attachment in favor of a partnership creditor, does not give him any advantage over the separate creditor; for the latter may, notwithstanding the previous attachment, attach and hold the property on his debt. Until the property is actually and legally applied to the payment of the partnership debt, the separate creditor may interfere to prevent such application, and cause his own debt to be first satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In the present case, the attachment on which the plaintiffs\u2019 title is founded was made on the 10th of October, 1842, on a partnership debt; and on the 21st of December following, before the action was entered in court, Peck, the debtor, was declared a bankrupt, and on the 28th of the same month an assignee was appointed. At any time between the attachment and the decree of bankruptcy, the separate creditors of Peck could have attached the property and held it against the attachment that had been made on the partnership debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The decree in bankruptcy took from the creditors the power of proceeding against Peck or his property to secure their debts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The only course then left to them was to prove their debts under the commission, and receive such dividend as might be made from the avails of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The general rule for distribution in bankruptcy is, that partnership property shall pay partnership debts, and separate property separate debts. Such are the provisions of the bankrupt act of 1841, and such also are the authorities. <em>Gray </em>v. Chiswell, 9 Vesey 118; <em>Murray </em>v. Murray, 5 Johns. Ch. 72; <em>Ex parte </em>Cook, 2 P. Williams 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">As the separate creditors of Peck by the decree of bankruptcy were deprived of all power to enforce the payment of their debts, and all power to stay the proceedings under the attachment, it would be inequitable to hold that the separate property attached on the partnership debt should be thus appropriated to the payment of such debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">It is not to be doubted that had the attachment been made upon partnership property it would have created a lien valid by our laws and within the proviso of the bankrupt act. <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>14 N. H. 509; <em>Kittredge </em>v. Emerson, 15 N. H. 237; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jenness, </em>7 Howard 612. But is an attachment of separate property, founded upon a partnership debt, to be held thus valid against separate creditors ? We think not. The attachment does not prevent the right of property from passing to the assignee, for it is not a lien that could operate to defeat separate creditors before the bankrupt decree; and as against them it should have no more effect after than before the decree, as by the decree their power to proceed against the debtor is taken away.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We are, therefore, of opinion that the demandants cannnot sustain their suit by virtue of the attachment and levy. Can they do it upon the mortgage from Peck to Martha Cochran ?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">At the time of the attachment Martha Cochran held a mortgage against Peck upon the premises, dated January 17,1839. This mortgage, on the 22d of December, 1845, was assigned to Mr. Yose. On the 24th of June, 1846, two days before the lien would have become perfected by virtue of the judgment obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>on the mortgage, the attaching creditors made a tender of the amount due on the mortgage to Mr. Yose, and the demandants claim to hold under that mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">If there were no other difficulties surrounding the question, and the demandants had the legal right at the time to make the tender so as to stay the foreclosure, the title to the mortgage would have so far passed as to secure the rights of the creditors. <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Hoit, </em>14 N. H. 61; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>7 N. H. 100; <em>Rigney </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>13 N. H. 252; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>7 Foster 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">But by the decree in bankruptcy all the right of Peck to the premises passed into the hands of the district court for the benefit, in the first instance, of Peck\u2019s separate creditors. When he went into bankruptcy these premises were included in his schedule as his private property, and, upon the equity of redemption being sold by the assignee, the proceeds were decreed by the district court to be paid to his separate creditors, and were so paid. It was sold for their benefit and went to satisfy in part their debts. The district court was acting for them, and the same reasoning which proves that the attachment could not operate as a lien to defeat the rights of the separate creditors, shows, that as against them the tender of the partnership creditors could confer no title that would be paramount to that acquired by a purchaser at an assignee\u2019s sale, made for the purpose of converting the property into funds to divide among the separate creditors.
