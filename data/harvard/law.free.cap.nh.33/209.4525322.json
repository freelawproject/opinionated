New-York, and there being no evidence that either the plaintiff or Marden had a pedlars license ; but the court held that a want of such license did not vitiate the sale, if one was made, so as to bar the plaintiff from recovering; to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, which the defendant moves to set aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-5\"><em>W. H. Y. Hackett, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuV\">referred the court to the first section of chapter 130 of the Compiled Statutes, and cited <em>Favor </em>v. <em>Philbrick, </em>7 N. H. 326; <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>12 N. H. 267; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>3 Foster 385; <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Hoitt, </em>9 Foster 264.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-6\"><em>Hatch, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJZ\">contended that there was no illegality in the sale of the stove, as the statute prohibits, not sales by pedlars, but the \u201c going about to sell,\u201d and \u201c exposing for sale,\u201d and that this case is within the principle settled in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>and <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Hoitt, </em>cited by the defendant; that the statute is studiously- worded to prevent the injustice the defendant seeks to accomplish.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b210-7\">Sawyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aex\">The exception to the verdict in this case is founded on the supposition that the sale by a pedlar without license is prohibited by the statute of 1848, chap. 734, entitled \u201c an act relating to pedlars.\u201d The act provides that every pedlar, or other person going from place to place, either on foot or with a horse, or otherwise, carrying to sell, or exposing for sale, any goods, &amp;c., without license, shall be punished by fine, &amp;e. Comp. Stat. 281. Whatever the acts, may be which are thus declared subject to the penalty, they are to be considered as prohibited, and the question is, what is it that is thus prohibited, the sale ? or the carrying to sell, and exposing for sale, only ? In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>3 Foster 385, assumpsit was brought to recover the price of shingles sold in Massachusetts. JBy the law of that State, in force at the time of the sale, all shingles made in the State, or offered for sale, were required to be sur veyed and branded in a specified manner, and all shingles <em>offered </em>for sale without being thus surveyed and branded, were to be forfeited to the use of the town where they might be so offered. It was held that \u201c offering to sell\u201d was not necessarily included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>in a sale, as a sale might be made without an offer to sell, and that, therefore, the sale was not to be considered as prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In <em>Brackett </em>v. Hoitt, 9 Foster 264, a similar question arose under the statute of this State relating to the sale of hay. Rev. Stat., chap. 107, secs. 1 and 2. These sections provide that all pressed hay, offered for sale in this State, shall be branded in a specified manner, and prescribe a penalty for offering to sell pressed hay not so branded. This action was also brought to recover the price of the article sold, and the exception was taken that the sale was prohibited. It was held, however, that it was the offer to sell and not the sale which was prohibited. The grounds of the decision in Williams <em>v. </em>Tappan were carefully reviewed, and the doctrine of that case was fully affirmed. Those cases are decisive of this. The statute relating to pedlars declares, not that every pedlar, or other person, going from place to place, selling, &amp;e., shall be liable to the penalty, but <em>carrying </em>to sell, or <em>exposing </em>for sale. The prohibition of the statute, like the others referred to, is against the carrying to sell and exposing for sale, and against the sale itself. Those are no more necessarily implied in a sale than is the \u201c offering to selland the ease finds only that the stove was sold, if sold at all, by a pedlar, without license. These statutes, being all penal in their character, are to be construed strictly. The fair and obvious meaning of the words is undoubtedly to be given to them, and the intention of the legislature, as expressed, is to be carried into effect; but they are not to be strained to embrace by implication subjects not clearly within the obvious meaning of the terms employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We are satisfied with the soundness of the views expressed in the cases referred to, and can perceive no ground of distinction between those cases and this.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
