Susanne, along with her husband and co-defendant, Lamont Timothy Bunton (\u201cTimothy\u201d), withdrew $44,900 from the bank accounts of an 82-year-old widow over a period of months by forging the victim\u2019s signature on checks, moving money from her money market account to another of her accounts, and using her debit card and password to withdraw money and purchase items at various stores. The defendants had gained the victim\u2019s trust by helping her with errands and appointments, and although the victim offered to pay them for their services, they refused and said they were helping her because they loved her. The defendants concealed their theft by replacing the victim\u2019s actual bank statements with forgeries, and created a fraudulent contract, purportedly between themselves and the victim, alleging that she had lent them large sums of money and they had begun to repay her. The defendants also created fraudulent receipts, purportedly with the victim\u2019s signature, showing repayment. When interviewed by law enforcement, Susanne responded with the fraudulent contract and receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">On appeal, Susanne argues that: (1) the district court made insufficient findings to consider Timothy\u2019s actions and the loss resulting from his actions as relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, for purposes of sentencing her; (2) she should have received credit for the value of the services rendered to the victim for purposes of calculating the loss amount; (3) the district court clearly erred in applying enhancements for sophisticated means and obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) and 3C1.1, respectively; and (4) her 21-month prison sentence was substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact and loss calculations for clear error, and the district court\u2019s application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 <em>de novo. United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1066, 181 L.Ed.2d 781 (2012); <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725, 728 (11th Cir.2004). Review for clear error is deferential, and we will not disturb the district court\u2019s finding unless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant used sophisticated means, <em>id., </em>as well as the district court\u2019s application of a two level obstruction-of-justice enhancement where the application required the district court to make a particularized assessment of the defendant\u2019s credibility or demeanor. <em>United States v. Banks, </em>347 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2003). Where the defendant\u2019s credibility or demeanor is not at issue, however, and the defendant\u2019s conduct is clearly set forth in detailed, non-conclusory findings, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement to those facts. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">First, we are unpersuaded by Susanne\u2019s claim that the district court failed to make specific factual findings as to when she became criminally involved, which, she says, was at the end of the scheme. However, in a case involving jointly undertaken criminal activity, the defendant is responsible for all reasonably foreseeable acts of others in furtherance of the activity that occurred during the offense\u2019s commission, in preparation for the offense, and in the course of attempting to avoid detection. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). A jointly undertaken criminal activity is a criminal plan or scheme undertaken by the defendant together with others, even if not charged as a conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2). To determine a defendant\u2019s accountability for others in a criminal scheme, the district court first determines the scope of the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to undertake. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1319-22 (11th Cir.2003) (vacating and remanding where district court made findings regarding reasonable foreseeability without first determining scope of criminal activity that defendants jointly agreed to undertake). Whether the defendant assisted in designing and executing the scheme is a relevant factor in determining if an activity is jointly undertaken. <em>Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1321. The district court may consider any implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others in determining the scope of the criminal activity that the defendant agreed jointly to undertake. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2). Therefore, a defendant may be held accountable for losses resulting from the reasonably foreseeable acts of other participants. <em>Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1319 (conspiracy context). Nevertheless, a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct does not include conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant\u2019s joining of the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of that conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">To the extent Susanne argues that the district court clearly erred in determining that she was involved from the outset of the scheme, that argument is unpersuasive. In addition to the bank fraud to which she pled guilty and to pawning the victim\u2019s ring, Susanne helped Timothy execute the scheme by (1) helping to draft the contract that the victim signed and was later fraudulently altered and (2) signing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>the fraudulent receipts. <em>See Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1321. Together, Susanne and Timothy gained the victim\u2019s trust by helping her with her errands and appointments\u2014 which was crucial, since it allowed the defendants access to the victim\u2019s personal and financial information, and to later exploit that trust. Indeed, Timothy stated during his plea colloquy that Susanne knew of all of his illicit acts. From these facts, the district court could reasonably have inferred that, from the outset, Timothy and Susanne jointly undertook a scheme to defraud the victim. <em>See id. </em>This remains true despite Timothy\u2019s testimony that he himself took the victim\u2019s debit card, deposited the checks, and withdrew the money. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) &amp; comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">To the extent that Susanne argues that the district court failed to make any particularized findings as to the point at which Susanne became involved in the scheme, that argument is also without merit. As the record shows, the district court heard and considered Susanne\u2019s argument that the government had not proven the point in time at which she joined the criminal scheme and the government\u2019s response. However, the district court adopted the portion of the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) Addendum in which the probation officer determined that she had joined the scheme from the outset, as we\u2019ve described above. Moreover, because the criminal scheme here involved defrauding the victim, it was reasonably foreseeable that Timothy would use the victim\u2019s bank account information to take money from the victim\u2019s account. <em>See Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1319. Accordingly, the district court did not err in holding Susanne accountable for the total losses resulting from Timothy\u2019s acts \u2014 as well as those from Susanne\u2019s attempt to cash a fraudulent cheek. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">We also reject Susanne\u2019s suggestion that she should receive a credit for the services she and Timothy rendered to the victim for purposes of calculating the total loss amount. In her brief, Susanne mentioned this argument in her section addressing relevant conduct broadly by copying and pasting a lengthy quotation from the PSI Addendum, and, in conclusory fashion, she said that the district court did not adequately address the issues mentioned in the quotation. Because Susanne did not plainly and unambiguously demarcate this issue, she has abandoned it on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Next, we find no merit to Susanne\u2019s argument that the district court erred in applying a sophisticated means enhancement because the scheme involved only depositing checks into an account that the victim did not use, typing up a two-page document that only somewhat resembled a bank statement, and moving money from one account to another, and none of those acts was particularly complex. The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement if the offense involved \u201csophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). The commentary defines \u201csophisticated means\u201d as \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct\u201d that pertains to executing or concealing the offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.8(B)). Each of a defendant\u2019s individual actions need not be sophisticated to impose the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) enhancement, provided that the totality of the scheme was sophisticated. <em>Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">As the record shows, Timothy and Susanne worked together to gain the victim\u2019s trust and then took concerted steps to avoid detection, which involved creating fraudulent bank statements and a fraudulent contract, among other things. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.8(B)). Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>der the circumstances, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the totality of Timothy\u2019s and Susanne\u2019s scheme was sophisticated. <em>Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Nor do we find merit to Susanne\u2019s argument that the district court erred in applying an obstruction-of-justice enhancement because the term \u201cofficial investigation,\u201d as used in the Guidelines commentary, should exclude interviews like hers, which occurred pre-indictment and were non-custodial, and because her act of presenting investigators with the fraudulent contract and receipts did not actually obstruct the investigation. The Guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to instruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation ... of the ... offense of conviction\u201d and if the conduct related to \u201cthe defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct\u201d or to \u201ca closely related offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The enhancement may apply if the obstructive conduct related to the case of a codefen-dant. <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l). The relevant commentary sets out \u201ca non-exhaustive list of examples\u201d to which the enhancement applies, including where a defendant \u201cpro-duc[es] or attempt[s] to produce a false, altered, or counterfeit document or record during an official investigation or judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.4(C)). The commentary also sets out a nonexhaustive list of examples of conduct that ordinarily does not warrant an enhancement, including giving a false name or identification document at arrest-except where giving the false information actually results in a significant hindrance to the investigation. <em>See id., </em>comment. (n.5(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Here, Susanne has cited no authority to support her contention that \u00a7 3C1.1 should not apply in a pre-indictment, non-custodial setting. Moreover, by its own terms, \u00a7 3C1.1 applies to attempted obstruction, not only to actual obstruction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying an obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Finally, we disagree with Susanne that her sentence was substantively unreasonable. Our review of sentences for substantive reasonableness is based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). While a district court must consider all the factors listed in \u00a7 3553 and explain the sentence imposed, the court need not discuss each factor explicitly. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). While we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect that sentence to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. A sentence imposed well below the statutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>mum penalty is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Here, Susanne has not shown that her 21-month sentence was unreasonable. For starters, her sentence was the lowest sentence in her guideline range and was well below the statutory maximum of 30 years. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788; <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Further, the district court listened to Susanne\u2019s argument regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including argument concerning her minimal criminal history and background, and said that it had listened to Susanne directly and through counsel, reviewed the PSI and PSI Addendum, and reviewed Susanne\u2019s sentencing memorandum. The court also said that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which is more than sufficient. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Moreover, simply because the district court considered and disagreed with Susanne\u2019s position about the problem of sentence disparities does not show the district court did not sufficiently consider that factor or that her sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378; <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Under these circumstances, Susanne has not shown that her sentence of 21 months\u2019 imprisonment was unreasonable. <em>See Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
