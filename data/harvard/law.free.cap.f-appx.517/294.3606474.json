Herrera-Cortez also appeals the six-month consecutive sentence he received following the revocation of his supervised release. He contends that both sentences are procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain the chosen sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-22\">Because Herrera-Cortez did not object on these procedural grounds in the district court, as he acknowledges, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Herrera-Cortez thus must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-23\">Our review of the sentencing record indicates that the district court did not fail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, nor did it err by failing to sufficiently state reasons for imposing a within-guideline sentence of 60 months for Herrera-Cortez\u2019s most recent illegal reentry conviction. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Similarly, the sentencing record indicates that the district court considered the arguments presented and provided a reasoned basis for imposing a six-month consecutive sentence upon revocation of Herrera-Cortez\u2019s supervised release. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 261 (2009) Accordingly, Herrera-Cortez has failed to show plain error in connection with his procedural reasonableness argument. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Herrera-Cortez also contends that his 60-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that the sentence was \u201cdisproportional\u201d because his illegal reentry conviction amounts to \u201ca victimless, harmless, territorial trespass into the United States.\u201d He also argues that his sentence fails to take into account his cultural assimilation. Herrera-Cortez also contends that the presumption of reasonableness afforded within-guidelines sentences is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). He further contends that the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 dissimilarly treats similarly situated defendants because it double counts convictions and is not empirically based. Because Herrera-Cortez did not object to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, his arguments are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We have consistently rejected Herrera-Cortez\u2019s \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument and his argument that \u00a7 2L1.2 results in an excessive sentence because it is not empirically based. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001). Additionally, this court has rejected the argument that the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is simply an international trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Further, Herrera-Cortez\u2019s challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 345-56, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The record reflects that the district court considered Herrera-Cortez\u2019s arguments for a \u201clow end\u201d guidelines sentence, including his cultural assimilation argument. The district court, in fact, sentenced him to 60 months, which is at the \u201clow end\u201d of the 57 to 71 months advisory guidelines range. Herrera-Cortez has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that is accorded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (2008). He has thus failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
