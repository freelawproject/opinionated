He was sentenced to 14 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Alcero\u2019s term of supervised release was revoked after he was found unlawfully in this country and convicted of another illegal reentry offense. He challenges the substantive reasonableness of the consecutive eight month sentence he received upon revocation of his supervised release on the basis that it is greater than necessary to achieve the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that the district court did not consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as it was required to do, and categorically refused to consider a concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Ordinarily, this court reviews revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). Because Al-cero did not object to the reasonableness of his revocation sentence in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Plain error requires there be a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If such a showing is made, the court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">The revocation sentence imposed in the instant case both fell within the advisory range and was in keeping with the Guidelines\u2019 advice regarding concurrent or consecutive sentences. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 792 (5th Cir.2007); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f)). The sentence is, therefore, entitled to an appellate presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">Further, even if the district court committed obvious or clear error with respect to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Alcero cannot show his substantial rights were affected because he fails to show that with other consideration of the factors he would have received a sentence below the policy statement range of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010). Thus, Alcero has not shown that the revocation sentence imposed constituted plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
