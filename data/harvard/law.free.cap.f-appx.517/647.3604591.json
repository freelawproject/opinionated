On appeal, Mr. Scott argues that an initial protective sweep of his residence by arresting officers was unlawful because it was not supported by reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>able suspicion. As a result, he contends that evidence seized in a subsequent search of his home must be suppressed. While we conclude that the initial protective sweep of Mr. Scott\u2019s home was illegal, we nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress as the subsequent search of his home was made pursuant to validly obtained consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">I.Background</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On December 21, 2010, three officers of the Miami-Dade Police Department went to Mr. Scott\u2019s residence to investigate an anonymous tip that he was a convicted felon in possession of weapons. After conducting several minutes of surveillance of Mr. Scott\u2019s home, two officers knocked on the front door. When Mr. Scott opened the door, investigating officers could smell raw and smoked marijuana and could see a clear sandwich bag of marijuana on a table in the kitchen. The officers asked Mr. Scott to step outside and arrested him, just outside the front door. They proceeded to conduct a protective sweep of the two-story house, checking all spaces large enough to conceal a person. In the course of that sweep, officers observed additional baggies of marijuana and a handgun on a sofa.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">After completing the sweep, one of the arresting officers advised Mr. Scott of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asked him to sign a consent form to give the officers permission to search his house. At the time, Mr. Scott was handcuffed with his hands in front of his body. After initially indicating he did not think he should sign the form, one of the officers told him to \u201ctake [his] time, go ahead and read it again.\u201d Mr. Scott read the form a second time and signed the form. In the subsequent search of the house, officers seized marijuana, the handgun located on the sofa, a rifle, and a coffee container filled with marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Before trial, Mr. Scott filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search of his house. The district court denied his motions to suppress, concluding that the officer\u2019s initial sweep of the house was legal under <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990), and that his subsequent consent to the search of his home was voluntary. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">II.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 748-49 (11th Cir.2002). We review \u201cfindings of fact for clear error and the application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Martinelli, </em>454 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2006). In reviewing the district court\u2019s ruling, we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1290 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">III.The Protective Sweep</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Mr. Scott challenges the arresting officers\u2019 initial protective sweep of his residence. In <em>Buie, </em>the Supreme Court held that arresting officers do not need a warrant to justify a limited protective sweep of a house incident to an in-home arrest. The <em>Buie </em>Court recognized two scenarios in which a protective sweep is justified. First, officers can perform a protective sweep of the areas immediately adjoining the place of the arrest, with or without probable cause or reasonable suspicion. <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093. Second, officers may conduct a protective sweep of non-adjoining areas of the place of the arrest if they have reasonable suspicion that \u201cthe area to be swept harbors an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Here, the district, court found that the arresting officers asked Mr. Scott to step outside of his home, after which he was arrested. Given that Mr. Scott was arrested outside of his home, the officer\u2019s subsequent protective sweep of his home was not justified under <em>Buie </em>absent reasonable suspicion that there were dangerous individuals in the home. <em>See United States v. Archibald, </em>589 F.3d 289, 297 (6th Cir.2009) (adopting position of several courts that a sweep incident to an arrest made outside the home requires officers to have reasonable suspicion that there is a dangerous individual in the house); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>48 F.3d 1282, 1284 (D.C.Cir.1995) (requiring reasonable suspicion of the presence of a dangerous individual to justify a sweep incident to an arrest made outside of front door); <em>United States v. Oguns, </em>921 F.2d 442, 446 (2d Cir.1990) (adopting Buie\u2019s reasonable suspicion test for evaluating security sweeps incident to arrests made outside of the home); <em>see also United States v. Kimmons, </em>965 F.2d 1001, 1009-10 (11th Cir.1992) <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>508 U.S. 902, 113 S.Ct. 2326, 124 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993) (holding that protective sweep was justified incident to arrest outside residence where officers had reasonable suspicion that dangerous individuals were in apartment). But the officer\u2019s protective sweep in this case was completely unsupported by any suspicion that \u201cthe area to be swept harbor[ed] an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093. Officers testifying at the suppression hearing could not identify any articulable fact which would lead a reasonable person to believe that another person was home at the time of Mr. Scott\u2019s arrest. Arresting officers surveilled Mr. Scott\u2019s house before the arrest and did not observe the presence of another individual. The anonymous tip itself could not afford the officers with any reason to believe anyone was in the house, as the tip only mentioned Mr. Scott, who was of no danger to the officers once arrested. The investigating officers\u2019 lack of information about whether anyone inside the house posed any danger cannot be used to justify a protective sweep. <em>See United States v. Chaves, </em>169 F.3d 687, 692 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201c[I]n the absence of specific and articulable facts showing that another individual, who posed a danger to the officers or others, was inside the warehouse, the officers\u2019 lack of information cannot justify the warrantless sweep in this case.\u201d). As a result, we hold that the district court erred in holding that the protective sweep Mr. Scott\u2019s house was justified under <em>Buie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">IV. The Subsequent Search</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Our conclusion that the initial protective sweep of Mr. Scott\u2019s house was unconstitutional does not end our inquiry. Because the evidence admitted at trial against Mr. Scott was not seized during the protective sweep, but during the second warrantless search of Mr. Scott\u2019s home, we must determine whether this latter search was tainted by the initial constitutional violation. Where a search is made pursuant to consent following prior illegal police activity, we conduct a two-step inquiry to evaluate the constitutionality of the subsequent search. \u201cFirst, a court must determine whether the consent was voluntary. Second, the court must determine whether the consent, even if voluntary, requires exclusion of the evidence found during the search because it was the \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 \u2014 the product of an illegal entry.\u201d <em>United States v. Delancy, </em>502 F.3d 1297, 1308 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>First, we consider whether Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was given voluntarily. Whether a defendant\u2019s consent to search was voluntary is a question of fact to be determined from all of the circumstance. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>890 F.2d 355, 358 (11th Cir.1989). The district court did not clearly err in finding that Mr. Scott\u2019s consent to the search of his home was voluntarily given. Although Mr. Scott was handcuffed and under arrest when he consented to the search, these circumstances alone do not mandate a finding of involuntariness. <em>See id. </em>at 362. The evidence at the suppression hearing showed that Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was not obtained through coercive or deceptive conduct. Rather, officers obtained Mr. Scott\u2019s consent after merely asking him to read the consent form a second time. The fact that Mr. Scott initially refused to consent to the search does not render his subsequent consent voluntary, particularly in the absence of any coercive conduct by the police beyond the coercion inherent in any arrest made pursuant to probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Because we conclude that Mr. Scott voluntarily gave consent to have his home searched, we consider whether his consent was tainted by the investigating officer\u2019s illegal protective sweep of his home. <em>Delancy, </em>502 F.3d at 1308. We consider three factors when determining whether a voluntary consent was tainted by an initial search: \u201cthe temporal proximity of the seizure and the consent, the presence of intervening circumstances, and, particularly, the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Santa, </em>236 F.3d 662, 677 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe proper inquiry is not simply whether [Mr. Scott\u2019s] will was overborne by the agents\u2019 illegal entry, but also whether his consent was a \u201cproduct\u201d of that illegality.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Considering these factors, we conclude that Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was not tainted by the illegal protective sweep of his home. To be sure, Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was obtained minutes after the illegal protective sweep was completed. And we recognize that the fact that Mr. Scott was apprised of his right to refuse the search does not constitute an intervening factor sufficient to dissipate the taint of the illegal sweep. <em>Id. </em>at 678 (holding that the reading of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the signing of a waiver of Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights are not sufficient intervening factors sufficient to dissipate the taint of an unlawful entry into a home). However, the officers\u2019 conduct in this case, while illegal, was not flagrant. The district court found that the officers conducted the protective sweep for the purposes of officer safety and not for the purposes of uncovering contraband. The officers\u2019 search was limited to spaces that were big enough to conceal a dangerous person and did not extend into smaller drawers, containers, or storage spaces. Arresting officers did not seize any items during their protective search and did not bring any of the illegal items they saw during that search to Mr. Scott\u2019s attention. Thus, the arresting officers did not use the fruits of the illegal protective sweep as leverage or as a tool of psychological coercion to persuade Mr. Scott to consent to the search. Instead, the officers only discussed with Mr. Scott the marijuana in plain view of the doorway prior to obtaining his consent to the search of the full house. Given these circumstances, we cannot conclude that Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was a product of the officer\u2019s illegal protective sweep.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Y.
