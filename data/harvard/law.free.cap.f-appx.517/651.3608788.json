And the District Court sentenced her to concurrent prison terms of 24 months on Counts 1 and 2 and a consecutive 24-months\u2019 term on Count 4. She now appeals her sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Ferdinand argues that the District Court committed \u201cplain error\u201d by enhancing the base offense level for credit card fraud by two levels for identity theft and erred in calculating the amount of loss associated with the fraud. We. find no plain in error the court\u2019s two-level enhancement. And we find no error in its calculation of the loss. Ferdinand\u2019s sentences are accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">We begin our assessment of Ferdinand\u2019s arguments with a brief description of her criminal activity. Ferdinand participated in a conspiracy to commit credit card fraud. The conspirators acquired personal information about the victims and used it to obtain multiple credit cards. Ferdinand made calls to credit card companies and arranged for the companies to send replacement cards to addresses the conspirators, including Ferdinand, used to receive mail. The conspirators then used the cards to purchase goods and obtain cash. The sum total of fraudulent purchases and cash withdrawals was $129,202. Ferdinand shared with her co-conspirators what the fraud yielded.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">The District Court grouped Counts 1 and 2 to calculate the guideline sentence range for those counts; it then added the mandatory term (24 months\u2019 imprisonment) called for by the Court 4 offense. The court determined the sentence range for Counts 1 and 2 this way. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2) provided the base offense level of 6. The court enhanced that level by two levels pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(C)(i) for the use of identity theft and 10 levels pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(F) for losses exceeding $120,000. It then reduced that total of 18 by three levels under \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, for an adjusted offense level of 15. That total coupled with a criminal history category of III yielded a sentence range for Counts 1 and 2 of 24-30 months imprisonment; that added to the 24 months on Count 4, resulted in a sentence range of 48-54 months\u2019 imprisonment (24-30 months on Counts 1 and 2 plus and 24 months on Count 4). The court then imposed the sentences indicated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The District Court erred in enhancing the base offense level for Counts 1 and 2 under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(C)(i). Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6 prohibits enhancements to related offenses when the defendant is separately convicted for identity theft. And the error is plain. Under the plain error doctrine, to obtain relief Ferdinand must show in addition that the error affects her substantial rights and seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 867 n. 7 (11th Cir.2010). As a general matter, to affect substantial rights, the error must have been prejudicial; that is, it must have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In this case, we are not persuaded that the error affected Ferdinand\u2019s substantial rights\u2014that she would have received a different sentence had the District Court omitted the two-level \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(C)(i) enhancement for identity theft. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1300. We say this because, at the sentencing hearing, in denying Ferdinand\u2019s request for a two-level minor role adjustment of her offense level (for Counts 1 and 2), the court indicated that she would receive the same sentence whether or not it made the adjustment. So, it is absolutely unclear what sentence the court would have imposed had it eliminated the two level \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(C)(i) enhancement. That aside, there are no indications at all that affirming her sentences on Counts 1 and 2 will affect the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\u201d Ferdinand\u2019s plain error argument accordingly fails. We turn, then, to her argument about the loss calculation, which, if clearly erroneous, would have lowered the loss calculation under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We review the District Court\u2019s calculation of the amount of loss\u2014a factual finding\u2014for clear error. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>172 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.1999). Clear error exists when this Court is \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 629, 184 L.Ed.2d 408 (2012). The amount of loss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss, and includes amounts the defendant \u201cknew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known [were] potential loss[es] of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 3). The calculation of loss does not have to be rigorously precise, only reasonable given the information available. <em>Cabrera, </em>172 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The facts before the court at sentencing established that Ferdinand ordered unauthorized cards with information provided by her co-conspirators, had the cards sent to her residence address, or her father\u2019s address, or a co-conspirator\u2019s, and engaged in fraudulent transactions with the cards. Hence, the court found that she was involved in the overall conspiracy and thus was accountable for losses the conspiracy caused the four victims, in excess of $120,000. Her argument that the court erred in fixing the amount of loss therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
