He raises claims of district court error and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The Government has moved to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary affirmance, contending that Millender\u2019s appeal is barred by the appellate waiver in his plea agreement. Additionally, the Government moves to strike an affidavit submitted by Millender for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-21\">The plain language of Millender\u2019s plea agreement, which states that he waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence on all grounds, confirms that the waiver applies to the instant appeal. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Our review of the record indicates that Millender knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal because he indicated that he had reviewed and understood the waiver. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-22\">Among his claims, however, Millender argues that his trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance rendered his guilty plea unknowing and involuntary. An ineffective assistance claim will survive an appeal waiver when the alleged ineffectiveness \u201cdirectly affected the validity of that waiver or the plea itself.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d 336, 343 (5th Cir.2002). In general, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be addressed on direct appeal unless the claim has been presented to the district court. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Navejar, </em>963 F.2d 732, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>735 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We conclude that the factual issues underlying Millender\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance cannot be determined on the current record. The Supreme Court has noted that such factual issues are best resolved by the district court on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 review. <em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 502-06, 123 S.Ct. 1690. Consequently, we decline to address Millender\u2019s ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal. Our decision not to address the issue is without prejudice to Millender raising his claims again in a timely \u00a7 2255 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">For the reason that Millender waived appeal, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to strike Millender\u2019s non-record exhibit and its alternative motion to dismiss are DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
