In 2006 and 2007 Ryba Enterprises and Applegate executed three promissory notes in favor of Darby. Those three notes were personally guaranteed by Baines. A fourth promissory note was executed in 2008 by Applegate Snayd Industries, Inc. in favor of Darby, and it was personally guaranteed by Dominic Apple-gate. When the four notes matured in 2010, the makers and guarantors were not able to pay back the principal and interest that was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">In July 2010 Applegate, Ryba Enterprises, and Baines (collectively referred to as the borrowers) filed suit against Darby in Georgia state court alleging misrepresentation, breach of contract, detrimental reliance, and tortious interference with contractual relations. Darby counterclaimed for the amounts due under the four promissory notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">On November 12, 2010, the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance closed Darby and took possession of it. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was appointed as its receiver. The FDIC then sold virtually all of Darby\u2019s assets to Am-eris Bank. The FDIC also executed assignments that transferred to Ameris all of the FDIC\u2019s rights in Darby\u2019s loans, including the four promissory notes at issue in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">The Georgia state court later substituted the FDIC as the defendant and Ameris, which now holds the four promissory notes, as the counter-plaintiff. The FDIC removed the case to federal court. The borrowers eventually dismissed with prejudice all their claims against the FDIC, leaving only Ameris\u2019 counterclaim against the borrowers. The district court granted summary judgment to Ameris on its counterclaim, rejecting the borrowers\u2019 argument that Ameris was estopped from collecting on the notes. The court concluded that estoppel could not be asserted against Ameris because the <em>D\u2019Oench Duhme </em>doctrine applied, because the loan documents contained an \u201centire agreement\u201d clause, and because the borrowers had alleged only that Darby had engaged in wrongdoing and did not allege any wrongdoing by Ameris. The court entered judgment against the borrowers jointly and severally in the amount of $7,035,709.83 and against Applegate separately in the amount of $679,832.10. The borrowers have appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, \u201cviewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Chapter 7 Tr. v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., </em>683 F.3d 1249, 1254 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cSummary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cA creditor in possession of a valid and signed promissory note has a prima facie right to repayment, unless the debtor can establish a valid defense.\u201d <em>City of Bremen v. Regions Bank, </em>274 Ga. 733, 559 S.E.2d 440, 445-46 (2002). Here, the borrowers do not contest the validity of the promissory notes. Instead, they contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ameris because equitable estoppel bars Ameris\u2019 claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">\u201cEstoppels are not generally favored by the law.\u201d <em>Collins v. Grafton, Inc., </em>263 Ga. 441, 435 S.E.2d 37, 39 (1993). An equitable estoppel defense can be raised only against a party that has: (1) made a false representation or concealed a material fact; (2) with the intention that the other party act upon the misrepresentation; and (3) with knowledge of the true facts. <em>Bell v. Studdard, </em>220 Ga. 756, 141 S.E.2d 536, 540 (1965). A party asserting equitable estoppel must show justifiable reliance on the other party\u2019s representations and a change in position to his or her detriment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The borrowers assert that Ameris should be estopped from collecting on the notes because Darby\u2019s loan officer \u201crepresented\u201d to them that Darby would finance the construction costs of certain improvements on real property, but then failed to do so. The borrowers also maintain that Darby\u2019s loan officer asked them to \u201cput more collateral or personal funds into the projects to get further support from Darby,\u201d which they did, but Darby still failed to make additional loans that were promised. Even if those allegations are true, they do not prevent Ameris from collecting on the loans that Darby did make. \u201cA lender\u2019s refusal to make a second loan, or even misrepresentations that it would make .a second loan, does not bar the lender from recovery of the amount owed under the first loan.\u201d <em>Ga. Invs. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co., </em>305 Ga.App. 673, 700 S.E.2d 662, 664 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">The borrowers also claim that Darby\u2019s loan officer \u201cfrequently encouraged\u201d them \u201cto purchase more property and obtain more loans through Darby Bank without finishing any projects.\u201d Even if that is true, Darby\u2019s \u201cencouragement\u201d to make business decisions that later went sour does not warrant application of equitable estoppel because that encouragement was neither a \u201cfalse representation\u201d nor a \u201cconcealment of a material fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">The borrowers further assert that Darby permitted Applegate to sign incomplete loan applications, dated one loan agreement on a day that Applegate was not available to sign it, froze disbursement of construction draws under one of the notes, and refused to approve short sales of the collateral securing the notes. While those allegations do suggest wrongful conduct by Darby, that still does not relieve the borrowers of their obligation to pay back the money they borrowed. In order for equitable estoppel to apply against Darby, its conduct \u201cmust amount to a concealment or false representation of material facts\u201d that is inconsistent with the position it later tries to assert. <em>Collins, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>435 S.E.2d at 39. Even if the actions alleged by the borrowers did amount to misrepresentations or concealments, which we doubt, those acts are not inconsistent with the position that Ameris is now asserting \u2014 that the borrowers are required to repay the money they borrowed. Because the defense of equitable estoppel could not be asserted against Darby, it cannot be asserted against its successor in interest, Ameris.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The borrowers also contend that the district court \u201cfailed to consider\u201d its argument that Ameris would be unjustly enriched by a judgment for the entire amount of the four promissory notes because it purchased those notes at a \u201cconsiderable discount.\u201d The court did consider that argument and rejected it, noting that there was no reason to \u201cbelabor the issue\u201d because the argument was \u201cmerit-less.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The district court correctly concluded that Ameris was entitled to summary judgment on its counterclaims against the borrowers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-10\">. In finding that equitable estoppel could not be asserted, the district court relied on reasons that are different from the ones we rely on, including the <em>D'Oench Duhme </em>doctrine. However, we may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied on by the district court. <em>United States v. $121,100 in United States Currency, </em>999 F.2d 1503, 1507 (11th Cir.1993). For that reason we need not address the <em>D\u2019Oench Duhme </em>doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
