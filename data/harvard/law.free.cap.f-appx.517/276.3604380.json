Branch appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Cemex, Incorporated; Rinker Materials Corporation, Agent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>PolyPipe, Incorporated, (\u201cAppellees\u201d), dismissing Branch\u2019s employment discrimination action with prejudice. Like both the EEOC investigator and the district court before us, we conclude that Branch \u2014 who was in his seventies when his employment was terminated and, thereafter, when his independent-contractor consulting agreement expired on its own terms (and his duties were assumed by a mid level manager in his sixties) \u2014 has not only failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to avoid summary judgment, but has substantially misstated the operable facts of this case. Even worse, Branch\u2019s counsel on appeal wrote, signed, and filed a brief with this court in which she misrepresents numerous facts of the case and of the proceedings in the district court, to a point approaching sanctionability. In affirming the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Branch\u2019s action for cogent reasons patiently, objectively, and extensively set forth in that court\u2019s thirty-five page Memorandum and Opinion, the facts of which are totally supported by the record on appeal and the legal basis of which is unassailable, we caution counsel against filing such pleadings in the future, lest she incur sanctions for such unprofessional and unacceptable submissions. Although we appreciate and encourage vigorous representation by counsel, we will not tolerate representation that is \u201czealous\u201d to the point of false or misleading statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

We remind counsel that \"zealous\u201d is derived from \u201cZealots,\u201d the sect that, when besieged by the Roman Legions at Masada, took the extreme action of slaying their own families and then committing suicide rather than surrendering or fighting a losing battle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
