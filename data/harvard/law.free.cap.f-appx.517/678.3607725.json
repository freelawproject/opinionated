Jaimes contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly considering his substance abuse, difficult family circumstances, and lack of criminal history. Jaimes also challenges his sentence as unreasonable in relation to the sentences of his co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-23\">In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we apply a deferen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>tial abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Those purposes include the need for a sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offender, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from future criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). Additional considerations include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is a task committed to the discretion of the district court, and we will vacate a sentence as substantively unreasonable \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). We do not automatically presume that a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, but we ordinarily expect it to be. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing its unreasonableness in light of the record and \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1236 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In the present case the guidelines calculations are unchallenged. Jaimes\u2019 base offense level was 38 because the offense involved more than 150 kilograms of cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). He received a four-level enhancement because he was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a). He received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a) &amp; (b), making his total offense level 39. With a criminal history category of I, his guidelines range was 262 to 327 months imprisonment. He faced a mandatory minimum of 120 months and a maximum of life imprisonment. At his sentence hearing, the government asked the court to impose a sentence of 327 months to life, and Jaimes argued for a sentence below his guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The district court stated that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including those that it had not specifically mentioned, and the record shows that the district court did carefully consider the factors. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a district court is not required \u201cto articulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor, particularly where, as here, it is obvious the court considered many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d) (emphasis omitted). Although Jaimes argues that the district court gave only minimal consideration to his wife\u2019s and his daughter\u2019s illnesses, the court discussed the effect his incarceration would have on his family, while recognizing that this hardship was a consequence of Jaimes\u2019 actions. The court also considered and discussed Jaimes\u2019 personal drug abuse and limited criminal history. The court expressed its familiarity with the sentences of Jaimes\u2019 co-conspirators and selected a sentence it believed fit Jaimes\u2019 role and his participation in the conspiracy, noting that Jaimes had not objected to the enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>ment that applied to him based on his role as an organizer or leader in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The court emphasized that the offense involved a large amount of cocaine. That amount was keyed to the guidelines\u2019 the highest offense level based on drug quantity, which the court took as guidance indicating that Jaimes\u2019 criminal conduct was very serious. Based on all of that, the court concluded that only a significant sentence reflected the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Jaimes has failed to show any abuse of discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment for the district court\u2019s or reweigh the <em>\u00a7 </em>3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Saac, </em>632 F.3d 1203, 1214-15 (11th Cir.2011). Jaimes has not shown that his 300-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
