He pleaded guilty of violating two special conditions of his release and appeals the thirty-six-month sentence he received after his probation was revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>A sentence imposed after the revocation of probation must not be \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 496 (5th Cir.2012). A sentence is not plainly unreasonable if the court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence, including failing to explain a deviation from the sentencing guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Anaya argues that the district court procedurally erred because it did not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and gave inadequate and improper reasons for its sentence. He correctly concedes that because he objected only generally to the reasonableness of the sentence, review of the procedural reasonableness is for plain error. <em>See id. </em>Given that the district court articulated reasons for its sentence outside the guideline policy statement range, and those reasons addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Anaya fails to show that under plain-error review the sentence is not procedurally reasonable. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 497-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Anaya disputes the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for the same reasons that it is procedurally unreasonable. He also argues that in light of his significant substance-abuse history, the district court should have provided more progressive sanctions, such as substance-abuse treatment, instead of a prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Because Anaya was convicted of violating a condition of his probation, the court was authorized to sentence him to imprisonment. See \u00a7 3565(a)(2). This court considers the extent of the district court\u2019s deviation from a guideline statement range, but we defer to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justify the extent of the variance. <em>Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 500. In light of the district court\u2019s previous leniency and the temporal nature of Anaya\u2019s violation of the conditions of his probation, the decision to revoke probation and sentence him to thirty-six months in prison was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 499-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
