After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-20\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only when the evidence before the court demonstrates that \u2018there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-21\">The party seeking summary judgment \u201cbears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Rice-Lamar v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, </em>232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cWhen the non-moving party bears the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the moving party need not support its motion with affidavits or other similar material negating the opponent\u2019s claim in order to discharge this initial responsibility. Instead, the moving party simply may show \u2014 that is, point out to the district court \u2014 that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation, quotation, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-22\">Once the moving party has satisfied this initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he mere existence of some alleged fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (emphases omitted). If the nonmoving party fails to make \u201ca sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof,\u201d the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">\u201cIn reviewing whether the nonmoving party has met its burden, the court must stop short of weighing the evidence and making credibility determinations of the truth of the matter. Instead, the evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [her] favor.\u201d <em>Tipton v. Bergrohr GMBH-Siegen, </em>965 F.2d 994, 998-99 (11th Cir.1992) (internal quotation, citation and alterations omitted). However, if the non-moving party\u2019s facts are \u201cblatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonably jury could believe it\u201d the district court need not adopt that fact in ruling on the motion for summary judgment. <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Where, as here, discrimination claims are premised on circumstantial evidence, we use the three-step burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-08, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004). This framework applies to all of Jackson\u2019s claims. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Pub. Sch., </em>543 F.3d 1261, 1267-68 (11th Cir.2008) (FMLA); <em>Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.2004) (ADA); <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330-31 (11th Cir.1998) (Title VII and \u00a7 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, which creates a rebuttable presumption of discrimination. <em>Standard, </em>161 F.3d at 1331. The employer must rebut this presumption by offering a legitimate nondiseriminatory reason for the employment action. <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the proffered reasons were mere pretext. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In this case, Sara Lee met its initial summary judgment burden by identifying legitimate nondiseriminatory reasons for the employment decisions, and then demonstrating to the district court that Jackson was unable to establish that those reasons were mere pretext for illegal discrimination. Because the district court concluded that Jackson failed to establish pretext on each of her claims, and Jackson has not argued on appeal that this conclusion was error, she has abandoned review of this issue, and we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Sara Lee. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>S.W. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A] legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
