She contends that she did not receive notice of proceedings that resulted in an in absentia removal order in 2001. She argues that affidavits from her and her sister overcame the slight presumption that notice was delivered to her address of record. <em>See Matter of M-R-A-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 665, 672-73 (BIA 2008) (holding that there is a slight presumption of delivery where notice is sent by regular mail). We review the BIA\u2019s decision under highly deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">The precise factual findings and legal rationale for the BIA\u2019s decision are somewhat nebulous. Nonetheless, discrepancies between Richardson\u2019s allegations and the record undermine the veracity of her claims of non-receipt. Moreover, she showed no diligence in seeking to reopen the proceedings where she had undisputed actual notice of the removal order for more than three years and constructive notice for 10 years, by virtue of a certified letter successfully delivered to her address of record. <em>See Matter of M-R-A-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 665, 674 (BIA 2008); <em>Matter of G-Y-R-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001). We therefore cannot say that the BIA\u2019s implicit disbelief of Richardson and its consequent dismissal of her appeal were \u201ccapricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 358. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
