Frazier claimed that he and the government had agreed to an incorrect offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines and that the district court at sentencing plainly erred under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) by failing to correct the total offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>level after the probation officer told the district court of the mistake. The district court construed Frazier\u2019s motion as seeking relief pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 and dismissed it after determining that Frazier filed the motion outside of Rule 35(a)\u2019s jurisdictional time limit and that the government made no motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to Rule 35(b). On appeal, Frazier reiterates that the district court plainly erred in failing to correct the mistake in his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court has the authority to modify a sentence. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010). A district court can modify a term of imprisonment only under very limited circumstances, including (1) where the Bureau of Prisons moves to reduce the sentence because of extraordinary circumstances or because the defendant is at least 70 years old and meets other certain requirements, (2) where another statute or Rule 35 permits such modification, or (3) where a defendant\u2019s guideline range is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission and certain other requirements are met. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) (2002); <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1194-95. Outside of \u00a7 3582, district courts do not possess inherent authority to modify a sentence. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that a lower court was wrong to conclude that it \u201ccould invoke an \u2018inherent power\u2019 to correct\u201d a sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The Bureau of Prisons has filed no motion for Frazier, nor has there been a modification in the sentencing guidelines that would apply to his case. There is no other statute that provides relief. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). Thus Frazier\u2019s only remaining option for a sentence modification is Rule 35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">At the time of Frazier\u2019s sentencing in 2008, Rule 35(a) permitted district courts to correct arithmetical, technical, or other clear errors in a sentence within a seven-day window after sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(a) (2007). Rule 35(a)\u2019s time limit is jurisdictional. <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1196. Rule 35(b) allows a court to reduce a sentence upon a motion by the government where a defendant has provided substantial assistance in another prosecution. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Our review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs leads us to affirm the district court\u2019s ruling. It is undisputed that Frazier\u2019s request, coming over four years after his conviction, falls outside the seven-day time period of Rule 35(a) and the government has not asked for a sentence reduction on account of substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Frazier\u2019s motion to correct or amend his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-5\">. Frazier\u2019s reliance on Rule 52(b) is misplaced. Rule 52(b) governs in criminal appeals and \"provides a <em>court of appeals </em>[with] limited power to correct\u201d forfeited errors. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (emphasis added). Because Rule 52(b) governs appeals, not post-conviction motions to amend sentences, <em>see id., </em>the district court had no jurisdiction under Rule 52(b) to modify Frazier\u2019s sentence. <em>Cf. Diaz-Clark, 292 </em>F.3d at 1317 (explaining that a district court's modification of a sentence without the requisite jurisdiction is a \"legal nullity\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-14\">. As the district court acknowledged, the time limit was extended to fourteen days when Rule 35(a) was amended in 2009. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(a) &amp; advisory committee\u2019s note.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
