Council argues that, despite the fact that he was sentenced under the career offender provision, he is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 750 reduced the sentencing range for the drug quantity for which he was held responsible. He further argues that, because the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) reduced the statutory maximum sentence for his offense, which in turn would have lowered Council\u2019s base offense level and concomitant sentencing guideline range, he is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-22\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>(2012). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Any reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission and must be based on a retroactively applicable guideline amendment listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>Id. </em>According to \u00a7 1B1.10, a sentence reduction is unauthorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where an amendment does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The FSA lowered the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine offenses in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372, 2372 (2010). In addition, the FSA directed the Sentencing Commission to promulgate emergency amendments to bring the Guidelines into conformity with its provisions \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d Pub.L. 111-220 \u00a7 8, 124 Stat. at 2374. Pursuant to this directive, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 750, which, in pertinent part, altered the drug quantity tables of the guidelines, located in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, by increasing the quantity of crack cocaine required to trigger each offense level. U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">A career offender\u2019s offense level is determined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), rather than \u00a7 2D1.1. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). We have held that a career offender is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where a retroactive guideline amendment reduces his base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320-21. We recently addressed the applicability of Amendment 750 and the FSA in the context of an \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, holding that the district court did not have the authority to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion where Amendment 750 had no effect on a defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). We further observed that \u201cthe FSA is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Here, the district court correctly denied Council\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Amendment 750 did not alter Council\u2019s advisory guideline range because he was sentenced as a career offender, and therefore he was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Further, the FSA\u2019s amendments to the statutory maximum penalties for drug offenses cannot serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
