The District Court looked to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. Sneed also appeals the denial of his motion for recusal of the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">Briefly stated, Sneed contended that he was fraudulently convicted in his state criminal trial. The District Court properly dismissed the first two counts of the complaint under <em>Heck, </em>given that the counts requested monetary damages, and properly dismissed \u2014 without prejudice \u2014 the third count for lack of supplemental jurisdiction. The district court also correctly found that Sneed had failed to demonstrate improper bias by the magistrate: no abuse of discretion in denying Sneed\u2019s motion for recusal. Objectively viewed, the magistrate seems fully impartial. Sneed alleged no facts that indicate that the magistrate held the kind of antagonism toward him that made fair judgment impossible. For background, see <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
