Stat. \u00a7 122.80 <em>et seq., </em>and for the deprivation of property without due process. The district court found that 1) neither the FBR nor the Town\u2019s ordinances required notice or a hearing before the Town Manager was permitted to fire Ama-dor, and 2) as such, Amador was not deprived of a property right without due process. Amador explains that his appeal asks whether the lower court\u2019s ruling \u201callowed the Town to terminate [Amador] without due process of law as required by the [FBR] statute\u201d which \u201cin turn deprived [Amador] of valued property rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-21\">The facts of this case are not in dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Amador served as the Fire Chief for the town of Palm Beach, Florida, from August of 2007, until his termination on January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>26, 2011. As Fire Chief, Amador was a part of the Town\u2019s management team involved in negotiations with the Firefighters\u2019 Union concerning the Town\u2019s pension plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Evidence came to the attention of Town Manager Peter Elwell that Amador had been feeding confidential information to the Union and that he had participated in the creation and maintenance of a website, www.palmbeachpensions.com, supporting the Union\u2019s position. Amador denied any wrongdoing. Believing that Amador had deceived the town, Elwell decided to fire Amador and explained in a memorandum that Amador\u2019s release was due to his involvement with the website and his alleged sharing of confidential information. The termination occurred without notice, a hearing, or an interrogation, and the firing was solely Elwell\u2019s decision. The Town offered Amador a post-termination hearing to clear his name, but Amador refused. Amador conceded that Elwell\u2019s proffered reasons for the termination were honest and non-pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Nothing in the Town\u2019s ordinances required a hearing before Amador\u2019s termination, and Amador admitted in a deposition that he understood himself to be an \u201cat-will\u201d employee. Under the ordinances of the Town, the Fire Chief is an \u201cappointive administrative and managerial official\u201d who is exempt from the Town\u2019s Personnel Regulations and Policies and Fire Rescue Rules. The Fire Chief serves at the pleasure of the Town Manager and may be removed for the \u201cgood of the town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Amador\u2019s suit asserted that although nothing in the Town\u2019s ordinances created a right to employment, under the Firefighters\u2019 Bill of Rights, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.80 <em>et seq, </em>Amador could not be fired without notice and a hearing. Beyond that, he argued that the limitation on how Amador could be fired meant that Amador had a property right in his job that could not be deprived without due process. The district court disagreed and granted summary judgment in favor of the Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all of the evidence and its reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Waddell v. Hendry Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>329 F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.2003). Summary judgment shall be granted if the pleadings and evidence show that there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of a state statute. <em>FTC v. Leshin, </em>618 F.3d 1221, 1231 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cAs a general rule, statutory interpretation begins with the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Fla. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Admin. Hearings, </em>29 So.3d 992, 997 (Fla.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">Amador argues that the FBR required notice before his termination because under the statute, after supervisory personnel have determined that they are going to reprimand, suspend, or remove someone they are required to conduct a \u201cformal investigation.\u201d Amador argues that under \u00a7 112.82 firefighters have a right to notice of that investigation, therefore the Town was required to give Ama-dor notice before termination. Amador argues that to read the statute as not requiring notice \u201crenders the law toothless, unworthy of the name \u2018bill of rights.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">Having read the statute closely and considered Amador\u2019s briefs, we do not find his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>argument to be persuasive. The \u201cDefinitions\u201d section of the FBR defines \u201cFormal investigation\u201d as \u201cthe process of investigation ordered by supervisory personnel, after the supervisory personnel have previously determined that the firefighter shall be reprimanded, suspended, or removed, during which the questioning of a firefighter is conducted_\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.81(4). \u201c \u2018Interrogation\u2019 means the questioning of a firefighter by an employing agency in connection with a formal investigation. ...\u201d M \u00a7 112.81(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The \u201cRights of Firefighters\u201d are delineated in \u00a7 112.82. The preamble to that section explains that <em>\u201c[wjhenever </em>a firefighter is subjected to an interrogation, such interrogation shall be conducted pursuant to the terms of this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 112.82 (emphasis added). Under subsection 2, \u201c[n]o firefighter shall be subjected to interrogation without first receiving written <em>notice....\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 112.82(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Contrary to Amador\u2019s assertions, there is nothing in the statute that \u201crequires\u201d supervisors to conduct a formal investigation before termination. The district court was right when it explained that \u201c[a] plain reading of the phrase <em>\u2018whenever </em>a firefighter is subjected to interrogation\u2019 strongly suggests that the legislature intended to provide firefighters with certain rights only <em>if and when </em>they are made the subject of an interrogation.\u201d Neither does any other provision of the statute require that firefighters receive pre-termination notice. Rather, the notice provisions can only be found in connection with interrogation. Courts \u201care not at liberty to add words ... not placed there by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Lawnwood Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Seeger, </em>990 So.2d 503, 512 (Fla.2008) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Also, as the Town and the district court have pointed out, this statutory structure is different from that of the \u201cPolicemen\u2019s Bill of Rights\u201d (PBR), which is also found under chapter 112 of the Florida statutory code. Under the PBR, the \u201c[r]ights of law enforcement officers ... under investigation,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.532(1), are roughly analogous to the firefighter rights in \u00a7 112.82. But a separate section of the PBR specifically references \u201cNotice of disciplinary action\u201d and makes clear that no punitive action can be taken against a police officer without notice. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 112.532(4)(a). The FBR does not contain a similar notice section.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Where the legislature has chosen to use a term in one section of a statute but omitted it in another, courts should not \u201cimply [the term] where it has been excluded.\u201d <em>Leisure Resorts, Inc. v. Frank J. Rooney, Inc., </em>654 So.2d 911, 914 (Fla.1995). We find that a plain reading of the statute and a comparison to similar, statutory provisions reveal that the Firefighters\u2019 Bill of Rights does not create mandatory notice for terminated firefighters. Therefore Amador\u2019s termination did not violate the state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Nor did the termination violate Amador\u2019s constitutional rights by depriving him of property without due process. In order to have a constitutionally protected property interest in one\u2019s public employment, the employee must have a legitimate and objective entitlement to continued employment based on ordinances, rules, regulations, or other mutual understandings promulgated by the government. <em>See Sullivan v. Sch. Bd. of Pinellas Cnty., </em>773 F.2d 1182, 1185 (11th Cir.1985); <em>see also Ross v. Clayton Cnty., </em>173 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that a property interest may arise where state law limits the power of a local government or other public employer to terminate an employee).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">A constitutionally protected property or liberty interest must be at stake in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>for an employee to invoke procedural due process rights. <em>See Sullivan, </em>773 F.2d at 1185. We have held that the employee does not have a constitutionally protected property interest where the terms of employment give the public employer significant discretion to terminate an employee. <em>See Warren v. Crawford, </em>927 F.2d 559, 562-64 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Amador has admitted that he was an \u201cat will\u201d employee under the Town rules and, as already explained, the Town was not limited in its power to terminate Amador by the state statute. Therefore, Amador\u2019s termination without notice did not deprive him of a property interest without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Because the Town\u2019s actions did not violate Amador\u2019s statutory or constitutional rights, the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-12\">. The trial court, in accordance with Local Rule 7.5, accepted as true the Town\u2019s statement of material facts submitted with its motion for summary judgment when the Amador failed to respond. On appeal, Amador explains \"[t]he trial court\u2019s recitation of facts is generally correct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
