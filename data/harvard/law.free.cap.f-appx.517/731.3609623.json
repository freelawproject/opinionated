The district court thought the petition was barred by the one-year statute of limitations of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Reversible error has been shown; we vacate the judgment and remand the case for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">Section 2254 petitions are governed by a one-year statute of limitations that begins to run on the latest of four triggering events. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Two triggering events are pertinent to this appeal: (1) \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Ross pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery on 9 September 1999 and was sentenced to 23 years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His conviction and sentence became final on 12 October 1999, after the time for filing a direct appeal expired. <em>See </em>Fla. R.App. P. 9.140(b)(3) (providing a 30-day period for filing a direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">In his federal habeas petition, Ross claimed that his lawyer was ineffective for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>failing to discover \u2014 and for failing to tell Ross about \u2014 a DNA report that showed that no DNA evidence was found on the victim. According to Ross, his lawyer told him (or Ross\u2019s mother or both) that the state prosecutor had said that Ross\u2019s DNA was found on the victim. When asked about an actual DNA report, Ross\u2019s lawyer told Ross that he was not aware that a DNA report existed. The record shows, however, that a copy of the pertinent DNA report was hand-delivered to Ross\u2019s lawyer eight days before Ross pleaded guilty. Ross asserted that, but for his lawyer\u2019s incorrect and confusing and misleading advice about DNA evidence and a DNA report, Ross would not have pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">That Ross\u2019s habeas petition \u2014 filed on 28 February 2011 \u2014 was filed more than one year after his judgment became final is undisputed. But Ross argued that his petition was timely under section 2244(d)(1)(D) because less than one year of untolled time had elapsed since his discovering \u201cnew evidence.\u201d Ross alleged that he began filing a series of public records requests in 2001 but received no copy of the pertinent DNA report until 27 October 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The district court dismissed Ross\u2019s petition as time-barred under section 2244(d)(1)(A) because more than one year of untolled time had elapsed since Ross\u2019s conviction became final. The district court concluded that Ross was unable to extend the statute of limitations \u2014 pursuant to section 2244(d)(1)(D) \u2014 based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d Because the DNA report was hand-delivered to Ross\u2019s lawyer and also mentioned in a document that had been entered into the state court\u2019s docket before Ross pleaded guilty, the district court concluded that the report did not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">We granted a certificate of appealability on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">Whether the district court erred in finding that Ross\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred, based on its finding that the one-year statute of limitations period began to run on the date on which Ross\u2019s conviction became final, rather than on the date on which the factual predicate of Ross\u2019s claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence, under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a petition for federal habeas corpus relief is time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In determining whether a habeas petition is timely under section 2244(d)(1)(D), courts must first address whether the petitioner exercised due diligence. <em>See Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 711 (11th Cir.2002) (stating \u2014 in the context of a nearly identical provision in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(4)\u2014 that \u201cthe court should begin the timeliness inquiry ... by determining whether the petitioner exercised due diligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Because the district court looked to the date Ross\u2019s conviction became final, the district court erred in concluding that Ross\u2019s habeas petition was time-barred. Ross\u2019s ineffectiveness claim is based on a representation or nondisclosure made by his trial counsel. That the DNA report (one favorable to Ross) actually was in existence and that Ross\u2019s lawyer knew or should have known about the report at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>time before Ross pleaded guilty do not bar Ross\u2019s claim: these circumstances are the underlying factual predicate for Ross\u2019s ineffectiveness-of-counsel claim. And, even if the existence of the DNA report might have been discovered from a review of the state court record at the time the lawyer made the alleged inaccurate representation to Ross, that fact alone does not bar Ross\u2019s claim. Ross \u2014 when he had legal counsel as a matter of right \u2014 did not act unreasonably in accepting his lawyer\u2019s representations. Ross had no legal duty to check the court record for himself (even assuming that he, in fact, could have done so),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at a time when Ross had a lawyer representing him in his case. <em>Cf. Beavers v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>566 F.3d 436, 440 (5th Cir.2009) (noting that, under Texas law, an attorney \u2014 as a fiduciary \u2014 \u201cis obligated to render a full and fair disclosure of facts material to the client\u2019s representation. The client must feel free to rely on his attorney\u2019s advice.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Golden Pac. Bancorp v. FDIC, </em>273 F.3d 509, 519 (2d Cir.2001) (explaining that a \u201cbeneficiary should be entitled to rely upon a fiduciary\u2019s skill\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">To determine the timeliness of Ross\u2019s habeas petition, therefore, the district court must first assess when Ross could have learned about his lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness: that is, when Ross \u2014 through the exercise of due diligence \u2014 could have learned that his lawyer\u2019s representation was incorrect about no DNA report being available. This determination is tied to when Ross\u2014 through the exercise of due diligence\u2014 could have discovered that a DNA report (showing no DNA evidence) existed and was (or should have been) known by Ross\u2019s lawyer before Ross pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Our impression of the record is that the statute of limitations, as a matter of law, must have begun to run at <em>some time after </em>Ross\u2019s conviction became final, that is, after the time when Ross was represented by the lawyer Ross says misled him. Up until that point at least, Ross says he did not know of the DNA report; and Ross had acted with due diligence, for he was relying on his lawyer\u2019s representations. The district court erred in concluding the limitations period began to run on the date Ross\u2019s conviction became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-9\">. Ross was represented by the same court-appointed lawyer throughout the state criminal case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\">. The state court docket makes no mention of a DNA report. Instead, the court docket lists a \u201cFirst Supplemental Response to Demand for Discovery.\u201d Within that \"Response\u201d document is a list of items that the state prosecutor provided to Ross\u2019s lawyer, including a \u201cFDLE DNA Report.\" The DNA report itself was not part of the public court record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b759-14\">. In addition, we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-5\">. Ross was already incarcerated before his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\">. In dismissing Ross\u2019s claim, the district court noted that Ross \"has failed to show how the fact that there was no DNA found on the victim would have in any way changed the outcome of his plea to the charge of attempted sexual battery.\u201d Because our review is limited to the single timeliness issue presented in the COA, we will not address whether the district court commented improperly on the underlying merits of Ross's habeas claim. We vacate the district court\u2019s decision completely, so \u2014 to the extent proper and necessary \u2014 the merits of Ross\u2019s claim can be looked at anew on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
