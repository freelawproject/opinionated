Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Park argues (1) the government\u2019s failure to disclose certain documents impaired his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination, and (2) the government\u2019s suppression of those documents violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-17\">Under Rule 33, newly-discovered evidence warrants a new trial only when such a remedy is \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Vicaria, </em>12 F.3d 195, 198 (11th Cir.1994). Park has not made this showing, because the evidence upon which he relies is merely cumulative impeachment material that in no way suggests a new trial would \u201cprobably produce a different result.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2003). Park\u2019s newly-discovered evidence consists of three documents: (1) a report describing a key witness\u2019s criminal history; (2) the same witness\u2019s handwritten account of his arrest; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>that witness\u2019s handwritten diagram of the parties\u2019 narco-trafficking operation. The information contained in these documents was either known to the jury, and was thus cumulative, or had no relevance to Park\u2019s guilt or innocence, and was thus merely impeachment material. Moreover, none of Park\u2019s new evidence contradicts the Government\u2019s proof of his guilt. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying Park\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">We likewise reject Park\u2019s constitutional challenges. Any Sixth Amendment errors were harmless, because it is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d the jury would have found Park guilty of drug conspiracy even with the disclosure of the documents at issue. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (holding that harmless error in this context is determined by, among other factors, \u201cthe importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case,\u201d \u201cthe extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case\u201d). Aside from the key witness\u2019s testimony, the jury saw videotape of Park negotiating to buy more than five kilograms of cocaine and boasting about his intent to distribute the drugs. The record also shows Park had ample opportunity to cross-examine the Government\u2019s key witness. In light of these considerations as well as the \u201coverall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case,\u201d any Sixth Amendment error was harmless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Similarly, Park\u2019s <em>Brady </em>challenge fails. The newly-discovered documents do not qualify as \u201cmaterial\u201d under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), because they do not \u201cput the whole ease in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Cone v. Bell, </em>556 U.S. 449, 470, 129 S.Ct. 1769, 173 L.Ed.2d 701 (2009). Based on the Government\u2019s proof at trial\u2014 which Park\u2019s new evidence does not contradict \u2014 there is no \u201creasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Park\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial is</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-10\">. The denial of a Rule 33 motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Sweat, </em>555 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.2009). A district court abuses its discretion when it applies an erroneous legal standard or makes clearly erroneous findings of fact. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>316 F.3d 1215, 1249 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
