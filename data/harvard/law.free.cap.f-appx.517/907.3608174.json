App. C, amend 750 (Nov.2011). The district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Brabham was sentenced as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and thus Amendment 750 had no effect on his guidelines calculations. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>A sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). Further, the applicable guidelines range that must be lowered to be eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category ... determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (requiring any reduction to be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). As such, when a crack cocaine defendant\u2019s offense level was determined by the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s drug quantity table, the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on amendments to the crack cocaine offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). This is because those amendments did not lower the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was based. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28 (involving Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The district court did not err in denying Brabham\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. At his sentencing, Brabham was designated a career offender, and his base offense level of 37 and his sentencing range of 262 to 327 months were based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Amendment 750 did not change the offense levels in \u00a7 4B1.1. Thus, Amendment 750 did not lower Brabham\u2019s sentencing range. Under our binding precedent in <em>Moore, </em>the district court lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Brabham\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Brabham argues that, despite his career offender status, he remains eligible for a sentence reduction in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). As Brabham concedes, however, this Court recently concluded in <em>United States v. Lawson </em>that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent and was not abrogated by <em>Freeman. See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012) (explaining that <em>Freeman </em>did not address defendants whose total offense levels were calculated according to the career offender provision and therefore <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d with the career offender issue in <em>Moore).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">Brabham contends that <em>Lawson </em>\u201cdoes not control his appeal because unlike the defendant in <em>Lawson, </em>Mr. Brabham was sentenced below his career offender guideline range\u201d due to a substantial-assistance downward departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This factual distinction is not a basis to ignore <em>Lawsoris </em>conclusion that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">Moreover, it is not <em>Lawson, </em>but <em>Moore </em>that controls Brabham\u2019s appeal. In <em>Moore, </em>one of the defendants, like Brab-ham, received a substantial assistance downward departure. <em>See </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Nonetheless, we concluded in <em>Moore </em>that the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on his career-offender sentencing range and that he was therefore ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">Notably, <em>Moore, </em>decided in 2008, is supported by the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which was amended in 2011 to address this precise point. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 759, Reason for Amendment (Nov.2011). That commentary clearly provides that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d an amendment must lower is the range determined <em>before </em>any downward departure for substantial assistance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A). In short, we remain bound by Moore, and, under <em>Moore, </em>Brabham was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-11\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.
