His convictions were based on events that occurred in September 1986. In 2008, Mr. Galatolo filed his first Rule 35(a) motion, which claimed that his \u00a7 924(c) conviction was illegal because the version of \u00a7 924(c) in effect when he committed his offense did not prohibit the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime. The district court denied the motion and we affirmed, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">Galatolo is correct that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime before it was a crime to do so. However, for purposes of Rule 35(a), Galatolo may only challenge the legality of his sentence and not his underlying conviction. Therefore, as a matter of law, Galatolo\u2019s conviction must be treated as valid. Because a defendant who is convicted under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) must be sentenced to at least 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, Galatolo\u2019s 60-month sentence is not illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-7\"><em>United States v. </em>Galatolo, 361 Fed.Appx. 29, 30 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">In his current Rule 35(a) motion, Mr. Galatolo argues that the district court erroneously imposed a mandatory five-year sentence, to run consecutive with his other sentences, by applying a version of \u00a7 924(c) that did not become effective until November 1986. He contends that he should have been sentenced under the version of \u00a7 924(c) in effect in September 1986, which would have produced a sentence of imprisonment of one to ten years to run concurrently with his other sentences. The district court summarily denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">\u201cUnder the law of the case doctrine, both district courts and appellate courts are generally bound by a prior appellate decision in the same case.\u201d <em>Thomas v. United States, </em>572 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). However, we have recognized three exceptions to the law-of-the-case doctrine: \u201c(1) the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to the issue, or (3) the previous decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Westbrook v. Zant, </em>743 F.2d 764, 768-69 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">As our previous decision on Mr. Galato-lo\u2019s 2008 Rule 35(a) motion held that his sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) was not illegal, our review of his current Rule 35(a) motion is governed by the law of the case doctrine. None of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine apply here. Contrary to Mr. Galatolo\u2019s argument, the version of \u00a7 924(c) in effect at the time he committed the underlying offense mandated a five-year consecutive sentence upon for a \u00a7 924(c) conviction. <em>See </em>Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, tit. II, \u00a7 1005, 98 Stat. 1837, 2138 (1984). Our previous ruling on Mr. Gala-tolo\u2019s original Rule 35(a) was therefore not clearly erroneous. As a result, the resolution of Mr. Galatolo\u2019s Rule 35(a) motion is controlled by the law-of-the-case doctrine and the district court did not err in denying his current Rule 35(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-11\">.
