Crummie argues that the court erred \u201cby treating the Guidelines as advisory\u201d and sentencing Crummie to a term that was greater than his amended guideline range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment that resulted from the application of Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">A district court may modify a sentence if the defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When considering a motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court must engage in a two-step analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range and holding all other guideline findings made at the original sentencing hearing constant. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and then determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)). Under the second step, the district court \u201cmust consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B))).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">We conclude from the record that the district court neither lacked the authority to sentence Crummie to a term above the modified sentencing range nor abused its discretion in doing so. The district court was required, after recalculating Crum-mie\u2019s sentence under the amended guidelines, to determine the extent to which his sentence should be reduced \u2014 if at all \u2014 in consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as other concerns. <em>See generally Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256. The record indicates that the district court appropriately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, giving particular consideration to the seriousness of the offense, in determining that only a reduction to a term above the modified guideline range was appropriate. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion, and we affirm its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
