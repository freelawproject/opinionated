He asserts that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on its determination that his prior Texas burglary of a habitation conviction was a crime of violence. Specifically, he argues that his conviction was not for generic burglary because his conviction fell under Texas\u2019s unique \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-23\">Because he objected to the enhancement in the district court on this ground, we review the issue de novo. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). We recently rejected this same contention in <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.2013) (affirming a 16-level sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a Texas conviction for burglary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>a habitation under \u00a7 30.02(a)). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
