Patel appeals <em>pro se </em>from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Title VII and Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d) complaint against the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (\u201cthe Department\u201d), alleging discrimination and retaliation based on race, sex, national origin, and age. Patel alleged that the Department fired him after he complained about not receiving a raise and in retaliation for Patel\u2019s refusal to work the night shift while he was on approved jury duty leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), which recommended dismissal of Patel\u2019s Title VII complaint as barred by the statute of limitations because it was filed more than 90 days after Patel received right-to-sue letters from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on February 8, 2011 and September 29, 2011. Additionally the district court concluded, in accordance with the R <em>&amp; </em>R, that Patel\u2019s ADEA claim was due to be dismissed as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">In a Title VII suit, a party must file his complaint within 90 days of receiving an EEOC notice of his right to sue. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(f)(1); <em>Green v. Union Foundry Co., </em>281 F.3d 1229, 1283-34 (11th Cir.2002). Patel does not dispute that his present employment discrimination complaint was not filed within 90 days of either of the EEOC\u2019s right-to-sue letters, but argues that the time limit should be equitably tolled based on the pendency of his previous and separately filed employment discrimination complaint. After receiving the February 3, 2011 right-to-sue letter, Patel timely filed a Title VII complaint alleging, as he does in the present suit, that his firing was based on race, sex, national origin, and retaliation. Patel later sought leave to amend his complaint when he received the September 29, 2011 EEOC right-to-sue letter. The district court eventually dismissed Patel\u2019s complaint without prejudice, denying Patel\u2019s request for leave to amend his complaint on the basis of futility, which decision we affirmed in an unpublished decision, <em>Patel v. Ga. Dep\u2019t BHDD, </em>485 Fed.Appx. 982 (11th Cir.2012) <em>(\u201cPatel I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">Patel seems to argue that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the untimeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>ness of his current complaint because he timely filed and promptly pursued his rights in <em>Patel 1 </em>and that his failure to state a plausible basis for relief in <em>Patel I </em>is due to the failure of the Department and the EEOC to give him documents. A court may toll a statute of limitations only if it finds that an inequitable event prevented the plaintiff from filing a timely action, <em>Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1479 (11th Cir.1993), and the plaintiff has the burden in establishing the grounds for equitable tolling, <em>Bost v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>372 F.3d 1233, 1242 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Here, we do not find that Patel has met his burden in showing that some inequitable event prevented him from raising the claims in this suit in a timely manner and thus conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in denying equitable tolling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that Patel had initially filed a timely complaint, by itself, does not warrant equitable tolling based on that complaint\u2019s dismissal without prejudice. <em>Justice, </em>6 F.3d at 1478-79 (explaining that as a general rule, the filing of a lawsuit that the court subsequently dismissed without prejudice does not automatically toll the statute of limitations). In addition, that the Department or the EEOC did not give Patel unspecified records does not constitute an inequitable event that precluded him from being able to state a claim upon which relief could be granted so as to prevent the dismissal of his complaint in <em>Patel I. </em>We cannot see how Patel would not have been aware of the facts necessary to support a claim of discrimination and retaliation that he alleges were committed against him. Patel has pointed to nothing more than his failure to allege facts sufficient to grant relief in <em>Patel I </em>to suggest that he is entitled to equitable tolling. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Patel\u2019s Title VII complaint for his failure to file it in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Patel further argues that the district court failed to address all of the claims that he raised in his complaint. Specifically, Patel argues that, in his complaint, he raised issues under the Fourteenth Amendment, Title IV\u2019s Healthcare Quality Improvement Act (\u201cHCQIA\u201d), and Georgia state law and Department policy, including that the Department failed to give him a required hearing before firing him. The district court\u2019s order dismissing the case is silent regarding all of these claims, despite Patel\u2019s specific objection to the district court that the magistrate judge in his R &amp; R failed to address these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) states that a \u201cpleading that states a claim for relief must contain: ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d In order to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must present more than labels and conclusions or a \u201cformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A plaintiff must allege enough facts to state a claim that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. However, when con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>sidering a motion to dismiss <em>pro se </em>pleadings, we must bear in mind that such pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than counseled pleadings, and are construed liberally. <em>Bingham v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1171, 1175 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Giving Patel\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint a liberal reading, we conclude that he did at least attempt to raise the separate claim that firing him without a hearing violated his rights arising under (1) the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, (2) the HCQIA, and (3) state law and Department policy. Claim # 3 of his complaint begins with \u201cThis title VII and ADEA \u2018discrimination and retaliation\u2019 <em>as well as </em>\u2018Defendant\u2019s denial of Dr. Patel\u2019s rights to the hearing pursuant to the provisions of HCQIA Title IV, U.S. Constitution 14th Amendment and GRH-Atlanta Medical Staff By-Laws\u2019 took place at Georgia Regional Hospital-Atlanta.\u201d (emphasis added). To the extent that Patel\u2019s complaint can be read to raise a claim under state law and Department policy, he appears to argue that: (1) he received positive performance reviews, required to be given by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-20-21, but was still treated unfairly, in violation of the policy statement contained in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-20-1; and (2) pursuant to the Department\u2019s medical staff bylaws, which are authorized under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 31-7-140, he was entitled to a hearing before being fired. Likewise, he arguably has alleged that his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights were violated when he was terminated without a hearing. Because both the magistrate judge and district court judge failed to address the Fourteenth Amendment and state law claims, we remand these claims to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">However, Patel cannot have raised a valid claim under the HCQIA, because this Court has held that no private cause of action exists under that act. <em>Bok v. Mutual Assurance, Inc., </em>119 F.3d 927, 928-29 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that nothing explicitly or impliedly provides for a private cause of action under the HCQIA). Accordingly, we see no need to remand this claim, even though it was not addressed below, and affirm the dismissal of Patel\u2019s complaint to the extent that it attempted to raise a Title IV HCQIA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Finally, Patel argues that the magistrate judge erred in denying him a hearing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(i) and we should remand the case for the hearing. However, because Patel did not object to that ruling before the district judge, he waived his ability to appeal that order. <em>Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty., </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that a party that does not file a timely objection to a magistrate judge\u2019s order to the district court waives his right to appeal such an order).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-11\">. Patel does not argue on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing his ADEA claim. Therefore, he has abandoned on appeal any argument relating to that claim, and the district court's dismissal of that claim is affirmed. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\">. We note that the magistrate judge\u2019s basis for recommending the denial of equitable tolling, as adopted by the district court, is based in part on a clearly erroneous view that Patel neither sought leave to amend his complaint in <em>Patel I </em>nor objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in <em>Patel I. </em>However, because Patel\u2019s diligence alone is not enough to merit equitable tolling, the magistrate judge\u2019s factual error does not constitute reversible error. <em>See Justice, </em>6 F.3d at 1479-80. <em>See also Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., </em>135 F.3d 1428, 1433 n. 9 (11th Cir.1998) (explaining that this Court may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
