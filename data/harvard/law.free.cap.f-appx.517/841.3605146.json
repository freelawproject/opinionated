Davis makes two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the government failed to prove he possessed a firearm as required to impose a two-level enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2011). Second, he argues that the district court incorrectly calculated the length of several underlying sentences when determining his criminal history category. The government argues that Davis\u2019s argument about the firearm enhancement is precluded by the invited error doctrine and that each of Davis\u2019s arguments should be rejected based on <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">We first consider Davis\u2019s firearm enhancement challenge. \u201cIt is a cardinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation marks omitted). For example, in <em>United States v. Thayer, </em>204 F.3d 1352 (11th Cir.2000), we held that invited error precluded the defendant from challenging the admissibility of evidence on appeal because the district court had affirmatively asked defense counsel if the admission of the evidence was acceptable and defense counsel replied that there was no objection. <em>Id. </em>at 1355. Failing to object, in and of itself, \u201cdoes not trigger the doctrine of invited error.\u201d <em>United States v. Dortch, </em>696 F.3d 1104, 1112 (11th Cir.2012). But, unambiguously agreeing with a course of action can trigger the invited error doctrine. <em>See id.; Thayer, </em>204 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Here, we are unable to consider Davis\u2019s firearm enhancement challenge because he invited any error concerning that enhancement. Defense counsel unambiguously agreed with the imposition of the firearm enhancement. Specifically, defense counsel informed the district court that the firearm issue had been resolved pursuant to an oral agreement with the government. When Davis personally expressed disagreement with the firearm enhancement, the district court asked Davis if he wished to continue with the current arrangement. Davis discussed his options with counsel, and his counsel stated, \u201cMr. Davis informed me that he wants to move forward today and go ahead with the sentencing.\u201d Accordingly, any error by the district court in regards to the firearm enhancement was invited by Davis, and we decline to review this claim on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Thayer, </em>204 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">We next consider Davis\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history category. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Acuna-Reyna, </em>677 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). However, if a defendant has not preserved his objection, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-79, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We need not resolve which standard is proper as to this challenge, because Davis\u2019s argument fails under either standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Davis\u2019s first argument regarding the district court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history category is that the district court erred in assigning two points toward criminal history for the 2003 misdemeanor listed in paragraph 42 of the Presentence Report. However, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 calls for the addition of two points \u201cfor each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days,\u201d but not \u201cexceeding one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>and one month.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 (2011). When Davis\u2019s probation was revoked on this charge, he was sentenced to 75 days of incarceration, with 40 days jail credit. In evaluating a defendant\u2019s criminal history we consider the \u201csentence pronounced, not the length of time actually served,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 2), and \u201clook only to the language used in the sentencing court\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>154 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.1998). We do not subtract Davis\u2019s 40 days of jail credit from his 75-day sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 1295-96. Therefore, Davis\u2019s total sentence of imprisonment for the 2003 misdemeanor in paragraph 42 was 75 days and the district court correctly assigned 2 points toward criminal history. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Davis\u2019s second argument is that the district court similarly erred in adding two points towards criminal history based on the 2005 misdemeanor addressed in paragraph 45. This argument also fails. When his probation was revoked on this charge, he was sentenced to 60 days imprisonment, with 5 days jail credit. Therefore, his total sentence of imprisonment for purposes of the guidelines was 60 months, <em>see Glover, </em>154 F.3d at 1295-96, and the district court correctly assigned 2 points toward criminal history, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">For these reasons, Davis\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-6\">. The government argues that our review of the district court's criminal history category calculations is limited by <em>Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1348-49. In that case, this Court held that if a sentencing court clearly says that it would have given a defendant the same sentence even if it was wrong in overruling the defendant's objections to the guidelines range calculation we need only consider whether \"the sentence imposed through the alternative or fallback reasoning of \u00a7 3553(a) [was] reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349. When asked whether the court was \"find[ing] ... a reasonable sentence, even if there\u2019s been an error in the guideline calculations,\u201d the court responded that it was <em>\u201cgiven </em>the guideline calculations based on the facts as presented by the parties at this time.\u201d (emphasis added). The court\u2019s response was arguably ambiguous, but given our analysis of the merits of Davis\u2019s claim, we need not determine whether the court\u2019s statement was sufficiently clear to limit our review under <em>Keene.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
