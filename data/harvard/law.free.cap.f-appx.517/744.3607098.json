For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the orders of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">Capital brought the underlying lawsuit against various defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after it sustained monetary loss in a fraudulent loan scheme. Capital alleged that Cesar Nunez, an employee of Wells Fargo, misrepresented American\u2019s ability to fund and close loans and induced Capital to apply and pay loan fees as part of the scheme. In its first amended complaint, Capital added Wells Fargo as a defendant and brought claims against it, based on Nunez\u2019s alleged representations, for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, aiding and abetting fraud, and negligent supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">Wells Fargo filed a motion to dismiss Capital\u2019s first amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the district court granted its motion without prejudice and with leave to amend. With regard to the fraud and misrepresentation claims, the district court found that Capital failed to plead the circumstances surrounding the fraud with particularity as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and failed to provide sufficient factual allegations to allow the court to infer that Wells Fargo was liable for the misconduct alleged. The court also found that the negligent supervision claim, while not subject to Rule 9(b), was deficient under Rule 8(a) because Capital failed to plead \u201cfactual allegations from which the Court could infer that Wells Fargo or its employees somehow made misrepresentations which deceived [Capital] into making unsafe deposits.\u201d [R. 70 at 13.]</p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">Capital filed a second amended complaint, abandoning the aiding and abetting claim, and Wells Fargo answered. Thereafter, the district court granted a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed by another defendant, the Law Office of Lloyd J. Michaelson, P.A., but gave Capital leave to amend the complaint for a third time. After Capital filed a third amended complaint, which contained the same allegations against Wells Fargo as the second amended complaint, Wells Fargo filed another motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>April 29, 2011, order on the motion, the district court dismissed Capital\u2019s negligent supervision claim with prejudice. The district court also found that Capital\u2019s fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims were \u201cagain deficient when viewed through the lens of Rule 9(b) and the <em>Brooks [v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Florida, Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1370-71 (11th Cir.1997) ] standard.\u201d [R. 196 at 6.] However, the court \u201cafford[ed] Capital one final opportunity to allege its misrepresentation claims with particularity.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\">If Capital chooses to amend these claims, Capital shall, for each and every alleged misrepresentation, provide the name of the person making the misstatement, what the precise misrepresentation was (using direct quotations when possible),, where the statement was made, when the statement was made, how the statement misled Capital, and what [ ] Wells Fargo gained as a result of the statement, in accordance with Rule 9(b) and <em>Brooks. </em>The failure to properly plead these misrepresentation[ ] claims as instructed will result in the dismissal of these claims with prejudice and may result in the imposition of sanctions. If Capital does not believe it can properly plead these claims in accordance with <em>Brooks </em>and Rule 9(b), it shall refrain from re-filing these claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 9.] At the conclusion of its order, the district court clarified that Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was granted, that Capital\u2019s claim for negligent supervision was dismissed with prejudice, and that Capital\u2019s failure to file an amended complaint with regard to the fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims \u201cwill result in dismissal of [those] claims ... with prejudice.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 12-13.]</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Instead of filing an amended complaint, Capital filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Wells Fargo pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2). On July 5, 2011, the district court denied Capital\u2019s motion, concluding that Capital\u2019s failure to file an amended complaint within the allowed 15-day period operated as a dismissal with prejudice as to the fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims, such that there were \u201cno claims currently pending against Wells Fargo which could possibly be voluntarily dismissed without prejudice under Rule 41(a)[ (2) ].\u201d [R. 241 at 3-4.] With the conclusion of the litigation as to the other defendants, Capital then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs. Ctrs. for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, </em>623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cIn ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, the Court accepts the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">\u201c[W]e review a district court\u2019s decision to allow a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2) only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Pontenberg v. Boston Scientific Corp., </em>252 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2001). Similarly, we review a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to comply with the rules of the court for an abuse of discretion. <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of dismissal with prejudice in favor of Wells Fargo as to all claims and denial of Capital\u2019s voluntary motion to dismiss without prejudice based on the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>trict court\u2019s April 29, 2011 and July 5, 2011 well-reasoned orders. Moreover, we rely on additional reasoning set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a pleading contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\"><em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (alteration, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) provides: \u201cIn alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d Rule 9(b) \u201cserves an important purpose in fraud actions by alerting defendants to the precise misconduct with which they are charged and protecting defendants against spurious charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior.\u201d Brooks, 116 F.3d at 1370-71 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rule 9(b) may be satisfied when the complaint sets forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">(1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">(2) the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making (or in the case of omissions, not making) same, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-11\">(3) the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-12\">(4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1371 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">We agree with the district court that Capital failed to plead sufficient factual allegations in its third amended complaint to support its negligent supervision claim as required by Rule 8(a) or its fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims as required by Rule 9(b). Specifically, Capital\u2019s negligent supervision claim is deficient because it failed to plead sufficient factual allegations that Wells Fargo was aware or should have been aware that Nunez was predisposed to committing the wrongs alleged in the third amended complaint. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Hardy, </em>907 So.2d 655, 660 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005) (noting that, under Florida law, to state a claim for negligent supervision \u201c[t]he plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to show that once an employer received actual or constructive notice of problems with an employee\u2019s fitness, it was unreasonable for the employer not to investigate and take corrective action\u201d). Likewise, with regard to Capital\u2019s claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation, we agree with the district court that the allegations contained in the third amended complaint do not meet the requirements of Rule 9(b) described in <em>Brooks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">Capital\u2019s argument that Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201cintransigence\u201d during discovery somehow prevented Capital from pleading particular facts is misguided. [Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14.] Rules 8(a) and 9(b) are pleading standards which apply <em>before </em>the discovery period begins and cannot be relied upon to defeat a motion to dismiss for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>failure to state a claim. <em>See Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cFacial challenges to the legal sufficiency of a claim or defense, such as a motion to dismiss based on failure to state a claim for relief, should ... be resolved before discovery begins.\u201d); <em>see also Kaylor v. Fields, </em>661 F.2d 1177, 1184 (8th Cir.1981) (\u201cDiscovery should follow the filing of a well-pleaded complaint. It is not a device to enable a plaintiff to make a case when his complaint has failed to state a claim.\u201d). By Capital\u2019s own admission, it \u201cwas in no better position to plead more definitive facts about Wells [Fargo\u2019s] involvement\u201d in the loan fraud scheme after the court\u2019s April 29, 2011 order. [Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14.] Capital was not placed in an \u201cunwinnable procedural position\u201d <em>[id. </em>at 15] by the district court\u2019s requirement that it plead its claims against Wells Fargo in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As we have explained before, delaying a ruling on a motion to dismiss \u201cencourages abusive discovery and, if the court ultimately dismisses the claim, imposes unnecessary costs.\u201d <em>Chudasama, </em>123 F.3d at 1368. Consequently, \u201cneither the parties nor the court have any need for discovery before the court rules on [a] motion [to dismiss].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1367. Because Capital failed to adequately plead a claim for relief against Wells Fargo, and because we find no merit in its argument that it was entitled to discovery to assist in doing so, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal in favor of Wells Fargo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), \u201can action may be dismissed at the plaintiffs request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.\u201d \u201cIn exercising its broad equitable discretion under Rule 41(a)(2), the district court must weigh the relevant equities and do justice between the parties in each case, imposing such costs and attaching such conditions to the dismissal as are deemed appropriate.\u201d <em>Pontenberg, </em>252 F.3d at 1256 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]n most cases a dismissal should be granted unless the defendant will suffer clear legal prejudice, other than the mere prospect of a subsequent lawsuit, as a result.\u201d <em>McCants v. Ford Motor Co., </em>781 F.2d 855, 856-57 (11th Cir.1986) (emphasis omitted). \u201cIt is clear that a district court does, and indeed must, have the power to control and direct the cases on its docket.\u201d <em>Burden v. Yates, </em>644 F.2d 503, 505 (5th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt is also clear that a district court\u2019s power to control its docket includes the inherent power to dismiss a case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Capital argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying Capital\u2019s motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice because it \u201cfailfed] to weigh the equities of the parties, particularly ... the absence of any clear legal prejudice to Wells\u201d [Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20], and because it failed to apply the test for imposing sanctions described in <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd., </em>432 F.3d at 1337-38. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The district court exercised its discretion to control its docket by generously affording Capital the option of filing its third amended complaint in the underlying litigation. The court expressly instructed Capital that it must allege particular facts to support the elements of each misrepresentation claim and \u201c[t]he failure to properly plead [those] claims as instructed <em>will </em>result in the dismissal of these claims with prejudice and may result in the imposition of sanctions.\u201d [R. 196 at 9.] The court warned that Capital\u2019s failure to file a fourth amended complaint within 15 days \u201cwill result in dismissal of [those] claims.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 13.] Based on the district court\u2019s order, Capital had two options. Thus, Capital\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying Capital\u2019s attempt to circumvent the district court\u2019s order by inventing a third option \u2014 filing a motion for voluntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) \u2014 is not persuasive. Capital\u2019s failure to file an amended complaint effectively caused the district court\u2019s April 29, 2011, order to operate as a dismissal with prejudice of Capital\u2019s fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims. Accordingly, there was no need for the court to engage in an analysis of Capital\u2019s Rule 41(a)(2) motion for voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss and its denial of Capital\u2019s Rule 41(a)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-12\">.
