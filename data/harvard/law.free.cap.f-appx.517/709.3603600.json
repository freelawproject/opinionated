This Court granted a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on a single issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">Whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request jury instructions that specified the method, pursuant to the indictment, in which the offense of aggravated assault was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">After, review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">A. State Court Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b737-16\">In 2006, Banks was indicted in Newton County, Georgia for: (1) aggravated assault, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-21 (Count 1); (2) possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-11-106 (Count 2); (3) pointing a gun or pistol at another, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-11-102 (Count 3); and (4) criminal trespass (damage), in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-7-21(a) (Count 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-19\">As to the aggravated assault charge, the indictment specifically alleged that Banks unlawfully \u201cwith a pistol, a deadly weapon, ma[de] an assault upon the person of Alvin Wilson by pointing said pistol at Alvin Wilson, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-21.\u201d As to the pointing-a-gun charge, the indictment alleged that Banks \u201cintentionally and without legal justification point[ed] a pistol at another person, to wit: Alvin Wilson, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16 \u2014 11\u2014 102.\u201d Banks pled not guilty and was represented by the public defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-20\">B. Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">At trial, the victim, Alvin Wilson, testified that he was employed with the United States Army and stationed in Virginia. Wilson was married to Juliette Williams, who lived in their home in Covington, Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">In January, 2006, Wilson received a call from his wife, who said she wanted a divorce and hung up. When Wilson was unable to reach his wife for several days, he accessed his wife\u2019s cell phone records and called one of the phone numbers. Defendant Banks answered and told Wilson that he (Banks) and Wilson\u2019s wife were in love.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">On January 11, 2006, Wilson traveled to Covington to talk with his wife. Shortly after Wilson arrived at their home, his wife pulled into the garage. Wilson went into the garage to talk with her. As Williams got out of her car, another car pulled into the driveway. Wilson saw a man he did not know, but identified at trial as Defendant Banks, walk up the driveway with a handgun in his hand. Defendant Banks stuck the gun in Wilson\u2019s face for approximately ten or fifteen seconds and told Wilson not to touch Williams.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Williams told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Defendant Banks to put the gun away, and Defendant Banks put the gun back in his car. Wilson then went into the house to call 911. With the phone in hand, Wilson returned to the garage, and Defendant Banks threatened him. Wilson and his wife then went into the house and locked the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Defendant Banks then broke the door down and continued to tell Wilson not to touch Williams. At one point, Wilson reached for his wife, and Defendant Banks \u201ctook a swing\u201d at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Defendant Banks testified in his own defense. Banks arrived at the Covington home after Williams invited him over to do laundry. As Banks was retrieving his clothes from the back of his car, Banks saw Wilson look in the window of Banks\u2019s car and then run inside the house and return with a phone. Wilson was speaking into the phone, stating, \u201c[H]e have a gun pointed at my head.\u201d When Banks realized Wilson was referring to him, he dropped the clothes, closed the car hatch and told Wilson he was waiting for the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Banks admitted having a gun in his car, but denied pointing the gun at Wilson' or breaking down the door and going inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">C. Trial Court\u2019s Jury Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">In charging the jury, the trial court read the indictment, including that Count 1 charged that Banks \u201cunlawfully with a pistol, a deadly weapon, ma[de] an assault upon the person of Alvin Wilson by pointing said pistol at Alvin Wilson in violation of OCGA Section 16-5-21....\u201d The trial court instructed that the indictment and Banks\u2019s not guilty plea were not evidence, but formed the issue the jury was to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The trial court further instructed that \u201c[n]o person shall be convicted of any crime unless and until each element of the crime as charged is charged [sic] beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and that the State had the burden \u201cto prove every material allegation of the indictment and every essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">As to the aggravated assault charge, the trial court also instructed: (1) \u201c[a] person commits the offense of Aggravated Assault when that person assaults another person with a deadly weapon\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]o constitute such an assault, actual injury to the alleged victim need not be shown\u201d (3) \u201c[i]t is only necessary that the evidence show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally committed an act that placed the alleged victim in reasonable fear of immediately receiving a violent injury\u201d; and (4) \u201c[a] firearm, when used as such, is a deadly weapon as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">As to the pointing-a-gun charge, the trial court instructed that a person commits the offense of pointing a gun at another when \u201cthat person intentionally and without legal justification points or aims a gun or pistol at another whether or not the gun or pistol is loaded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">The trial court then reviewed the statutory definitions of each offense and instructed the jury on how to enter its verdict. The trial court explained that, as to each offense, if the jury found that Banks committed the crime as alleged in the indictment, the jury could find Banks guilty, but if the jury had a reasonable doubt, it was required to acquit him. As to the aggravated assault charge specifically, the trial court instructed again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>If after considering the testimony and the evidence presented to you, together with the Charge of the Court, you should find or believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in Newton County, Georgia, did on or about January 11, 2006, commit the offense of aggravated assault <em>as alleged in Count 1 of the indictment, </em>you would be authorized to find the defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">(emphasis added.) After the trial court concluded the instructions, Banks\u2019s defense counsel reserved objection to the charge. Before the jury retired to deliberate, the trial court said it would give the jury a copy of the indictment and the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">D. Verdict and Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The jury found Banks guilty of aggravated assault, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and criminal trespass. It found Banks not guilty of \u201cintentionally and without justification\u201d pointing a gun at another.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">On July 17, 2007, the trial court sentenced Banks to: (1) fifteen years on the aggravated assault conviction, with five years to be served in prison and ten years to be served on probation; (2) a consecutive five-year probationary sentence on the firearm possession conviction; and (3) a twelve-month prison sentence on the criminal trespass conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">At the sentencing hearing, Banks said he believed his trial counsel was ineffective. The trial court stated a new attorney would be appointed for Banks in any direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">E. Banks\u2019s <em>Pro Se </em>Post-Trial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">After trial, Banks filed <em>pro se </em>motions, including: (1) \u201cPost Conviction Motions for Arrest of Judgement, Judgement of Aquit-tal and/or Alternative Motion for New Trial [sic]\u201d raising numerous trial errors; and (2) a motion for leave to file an appeal out of time with the trial court. Banks\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">F.Banks Refuses Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">The trial court appointed Banks new counsel. New counsel filed: (1) a motion to modify Banks\u2019s sentence; (2) an amended motion for a new trial; and (3) a notice of defendant\u2019s intent to proceed <em>pro se </em>on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">At a June 3, 2008 hearing on these post-trial motions with Banks\u2019s new counsel present, Banks said he wished to proceed <em>pro se. </em>After questioning Banks about his decision, the trial court relieved Banks\u2019s new counsel from representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">That same day, Banks filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for acquittal by the trial court, which argued that: (1) because his indictment specified that he committed the aggravated assault by pointing a pistol at Wilson, the State was required to prove that he pointed a gun at Wilson; (2) because the jury acquitted him of the separate charge of pointing a pistol at Wilson, his aggravated assault conviction was \u201cunconstitutional and inconsistant [sic] therewith,\u201d constituted a \u201cfatal variance\u201d and violated his due process and equal protection rights; and (3) his trial counsel was ineffective for \u201crefusing to raise these issues or file this post conviction motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">At a July 1, 2008 hearing on the motions, Banks reaffirmed that he wanted to represent himself. The trial court orally denied Banks\u2019s <em>pro se </em>and counseled motions. The trial court then allowed Banks to raise his own ineffective counsel arguments in support of a new trial. Banks contended that his trial counsel was ineffective \u201cbecause she refused to bring out things that [he] really needed brought out, such as the warrant that was signed by Judge Baker,\u201d which charged only misde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>meanors, and not the felonies with which he was later convicted. The trial court denied Banks\u2019s new arguments as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">On February 20, 2009, the trial court entered a written order denying all of Banks\u2019s post-conviction motions, including his motion to file an appeal out of time \u201cnunc pro tunc, July 1, 2008.\u201d Banks did not appeal the trial court\u2019s February 20, 2009 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">G. State Habeas Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In 2008, Banks filed <em>pro se </em>state habeas petitions in two separate state courts. After Banks was released on parole, the two cases were transferred to Newton County, where they were heard by the same court that conducted his criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Relevant to this \u00a7 2254 appeal, Banks\u2019s state habeas petitions asserted that: (1) his indictment alleged that he committed aggravated assault by pointing a pistol at Wilson; (2) the jury found him not guilty of the separate of charge of pointing a gun at Wilson; and (3) thus, his convictions for aggravated assault violated not only Georgia law regarding inconsistent verdicts, but also his due process and equal protection rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Banks also argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for not raising an inconsistent verdict argument and for not requesting that the trial court instruct the jury that pointing a gun at Wilson was an essential element of the aggravated assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">On September 21, 2010, the state habeas court held an evidentiary hearing. Banks called Anthony Carter, the Circuit Public Defender for the Alcovy Judicial Circuit and the supervisor of Banks\u2019s trial counsel, to testify. Carter, who participated in Banks\u2019s trial, testified: (1) the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on Count One for aggravated assault, but not guilty on Count Three for pointing a gun at Wilson was inconsistent; (2) his office was \u201cin the process of beginning to look into that for [Banks\u2019s] appeal\u201d when Banks \u201cdetermined that [he] wanted outside counsel\u201d and discharged them; and (8) Banks\u2019s appellate counsel should have researched and pursued the inconsistent verdict issue on direct appeal. Banks did not ask Carter about the issues raised in this federal appeal: trial counsel\u2019s failure to request a jury instruction that specified the method of committing the aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The State\u2019s attorney (who was also the prosecutor in Banks\u2019s criminal trial) pointed out that, once Banks was convicted, the public defender\u2019s office \u201cdid everything they were supposed to do to preserve [Banks\u2019s] appellate rights\u201d; however, because Banks wanted to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a new attorney was appointed to handle his appeal, but Banks \u201cadamantly said he did not want her to represent him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">After the hearing, the state habeas court denied Banks\u2019s two state habeas petitions, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Banks \u201cpresented no credible evidence to support his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d The Georgia Supreme Court denied Banks\u2019s application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">H. Federal Habeas Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">On June 30, 2011, Banks filed this \u00a7 2254 petition. In relevant part, Banks alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective, among other claims, for not requesting a jury instruction that pointing a pistol at Wilson was a material element of the aggravated assault offense as it was charged in the indictment. Banks argued that the state habeas court\u2019s ruling on the ineffective assistance issue was contrary to clearly established law and unreasonably applied <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">A magistrate judge issued a report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending that Banks\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition be denied as to all claims. The district court agreed with the R <em>&amp; </em>R and, over Banks\u2019s objections, concluded that Banks had not shown that the state habeas court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. The district court denied Banks a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">On appeal, this Court granted Banks\u2019s motion for a COA on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">Whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request jury instructions that specified the method, pursuant to the indictment, in which the offense of aggravated assault was committed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ABHq\">A. AEDPA</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on a state prisoner\u2019s claim that was denied on the merits in state court unless the state court decision was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">B. Ineffective Assistance Under <em>Strickland</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">To establish constitutionally ineffective assistance, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. To establish deficient performance, the petitioner must show his counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable in light of prevailing professional norms. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. To satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, the petitioner must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">Our standard of review is \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d when \u201ca <em>Strickland </em>claim [is] evaluated under the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard.\u201d <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). \u201cThe question is not whether a federal court believes the state court\u2019s determination under the <em>Strickland </em>standard was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable \u2014 a substantially higher threshold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>C. Georgia Law on Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Under Georgia law, to convict a defendant of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, the State need only prove that the defendant: (1) committed an act with deadly weapon that (2) placed the victim in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 16-5-20(a), 16-5-21(a); <em>see also Atwell v. State, </em>293 Ga.App. 586, 587, 667 S.E.2d 442, 444 (2008). Thus, while pointing a firearm at another is one method of committing an aggravated assault if doing so causes the requisite apprehension, pointing a firearm at another is not an essential element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Nonetheless, Georgia law provides that \u201c[a]verments in an indictment as to the specific manner in which a crime was committed are not mere surplusage.\u201d <em>Talton v. State, </em>254 Ga.App. 111, 112, 561 S.E.2d 139, 141 (2002). Thus, in criminal prosecutions, the jury instructions \u201cmust be tailored to fit the charge in the indictment and the evidence [adduced] at trial. This is particularly true when the offense charged may be committed in one of several ways, but the indictment charges one specific method.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">However, Georgia law also recognizes the \u201cfundamental rule that jury instructions must be considered as a whole in determining whether the charge contained error.\u201d <em>Thomas v. State, </em>264 Ga.App. 389, 392, 590 S.E.2d 778, 780 (2003) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, if \u201c[t]aken as a whole, the trial court\u2019s charge properly set forth the basis on which the jury was authorized to convict [the defendant]\u201d there is no reversible error. <em>Id.; see also James v. State, </em>268 Ga.App. 851, 853, 602 S.E.2d 854, 856 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">D. Banks\u2019s Ineffective Assistance Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Here, we cannot say that the state habeas court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that the trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance with respect the aggravated assault jury instruction \u2014 was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">First, the trial court gave the general pattern instruction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Second, and more importantly, the trial court read each count of the indictment verbatim, including, with respect to Count One, that the accused \u201cunlawfully with a pistol, a deadly weapon, make an assault upon the person of Alvin Wilson by pointing said pistol at Alvin Wilson....\u201d The trial court then instructed the jury that the State had the burden \u201cto prove every material allegation of the indictment and every essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">Third, after giving the pattern jury instruction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, the trial court again charged the jury that it was only authorized to find Banks guilty of aggravated assault if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the offense \u201cas alleged in Count 1 of the indictment.\u201d Importantly, too, the state trial court sent the written indictment and jury charge to the jury room.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">Fourth, Banks fails to take into account that his verdict on the aggravated assault count was not necessarily inconsistent because the pointing a gun count included the element that he acted \u201cwithout justification,\u201d and the government had to prove that element. In contrast, the aggravated assault charge did not place the burden on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the government to show Banks\u2019s conduct was without any justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">For all of these reasons taken together, Banks did not show that it was objectively unreasonable for his trial counsel to not request a jury instruction on the specific method of committing the aggravated assault charged. Alternatively, even assuming Banks\u2019s attorneys performed deficiently, Banks did not demonstrate that his counsels\u2019 failure to request such a jury instruction prejudiced him. That is, Banks did not show a reasonable probability that, but for his counsels\u2019 failure to request the instruction, he would not have been convicted of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Accordingly, Banks has not shown that the state habeas court acted contrary to, or unreasonably applied, <em>Strickland </em>in rejecting Banks\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-17\">. Williams (Wilson's wife) also testified that Banks pointed a gun at Wilson\u2019s face for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>few seconds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\">. On appeal, Banks asks this Court to consider all of the claims raised in his \u00a7 2254 petition. We decline to review issues that are outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Jordan v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>485 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b741-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination whether the state court acted contrary to, or unreasonably applied, clearly established federal law or made an unreasonable determination of fact. <em>Reed v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>593 F.3d 1217, 1239 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b741-17\">.The state\u2019s position is that we apply AEDPA deference. Banks did not set forth a different standard in his opening brief or file a reply brief disputing that AEDPA's deferential standard applied. In any event, whether we apply deference or review <em>de novo, </em>we reach the same result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\">.
