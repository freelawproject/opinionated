In February 2010, the District Court reduced Jones\u2019s sentences to terms of 60 months, the 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), based on Amendments 706, 711 and 715 to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">On November 2, 2011, Jones moved the court to reduce his sentences further again pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c), based on Amendment 750 to the Guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), arguing that the FSA, which lowered the mandatory minimum sentence applicable in Jones\u2019s case, should be applied retroactively in \u00a7 3582(c) proceedings. The court denied his motion, and he appeals its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-20\">Recent decisions of the Supreme Court, <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), and this court, <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535 (11th Cir.2013), foreclose Jones\u2019s argument and require that we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision. The FSA does not apply in cases, like Jones\u2019s, where the convictions occurred and the sentences were imposed prior to the FSA\u2019s enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
