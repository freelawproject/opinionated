Barber pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine base and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The district court sentenced Barber to a statutorily mandated life sentence on the drug charge; however, the court later reduced the sentence to 168 months of imprisonment after the Government filed a motion under Federal Rule Of Criminal Prooedure 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o) ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In determining whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court first determines whether the defendant is eligible for a sentence modification. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). If the court determines that a defendant is eligible for a sentence modification, it must then consider the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to decide whether a reduction \u201cis warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2692. The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Section 1B1.10 of the Sentencing Guidelines limits the circumstances under which a defendant is entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on retroactive guidelines amendments. Only an individual currently serving a sentence determined by a guidelines sentencing range lowered by particular listed amendments is potentially eligible. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s. Even then, a reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision. \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s., comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">In <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009), this court held that the guidelines amendments lowering the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses did not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders. This court reasoned that a career offender\u2019s sentence \u201cdid not derive from the amount of crack cocaine involved in his offense,\u201d and that a career offender \u201cwas not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, at 577-81 (5th Cir.2010), this court held that a defendant subject to a statutory minimum term of imprisonment was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), even where the district court departed below the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>minimum pursuant to a downward departure. This court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, holding that when a defendant is \u201csubject to a statutory minimum sentence above the upper end of his guidelines range, even if the district court departs downwardly from that minimum under a statutory exception, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides no authority to the district court to later modify the sentence based on amendments to the guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Barber argues that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2693, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), this court should not follow the precedent established in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Carter. </em>We reject this contention because Barber has not shown that <em>Freem </em>an either explicitly or implicitly overrules this court\u2019s prior decisions. <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999) (noting that the panel was \u201cbound by the precedent of previous panels absent an intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling that prior precedent!)]\u201d). The Court in <em>Freeman </em>did not address, even tangentially, either of the factual scenarios presented in <em>Carter </em>or <em>Anderson, </em>or in the instant case. Barber\u2019s contention that <em>Freeman </em>undermines this court\u2019s prior precedent in <em>Carter </em>and <em>Anderson </em>lacks merit in either law or logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Moreover, we note that the district court gave an additional reason for denying Barber\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the substantial reduction Barber already received following the Government\u2019s Rule 35 motion. Accordingly, the denial of Barber\u2019s motion does not warrant reversal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Levi, </em>401 Fed.Appx. 982, 983 (5th Cir.2010) (noting that any error in the district court\u2019s determination that the crack cocaine amendment were inapplicable did not warrant reversal where the court also indicated it would exercise its discretion not to grant a reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
