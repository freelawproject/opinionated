Qian applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief on the ground that he would be persecuted for his family\u2019s ties to Falun Gong and the Chinese government\u2019s belief that he was a Falun Gong practitioner. After review, we deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">Where \u201cthe BIA issues its own opinion, we review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Carrizo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>652 F.3d 1326, 1330 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). We will affirm a decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe will reverse an IJ\u2019s factual findings only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has the discretion to grant asylum to an alien who meets the definition of a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is defined as a person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-14\">who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable and unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">INA \u00a7 101 (a) (42) (A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). In order to meet this burden, the applicant must prove, with credible evidence, that either: \u201c(1) he suffered past persecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>on account of his political opinion, or (2) he has a well-founded fear that his political opinion will cause him to be persecuted.\u201d <em>Carrizo, </em>652 F.3d at 1331 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">We have described that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that [m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the applicant fails to demonstrate past persecution, an applicant may still establish asylum based upon proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1007 (11th Cir.2008); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). \u201cTo establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, an alien need only show that there is a <em>reasonable possibility </em>of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). \u201cThe alien must establish a fear that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">In <em>Zheng v. United States Attorney General, </em>we denied a petitioner\u2019s asylum claim based on persecution for his involvement in Falun Gong because he failed to demonstrate past persecution, and did not establish a reasonable possibility that he would suffer future persecution. 451 F.3d 1287, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We held that Zheng\u2019s five day detention, in which he was forced to watch anti-Falun Gong videos, stand in the sun for two hours, and sign a statement that he would no longer practice Falun Gong, did not establish past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1289, 1291-92. As to Zheng\u2019s well-founded fear of future persecution, we noted that although the 2002 Country Report indicates the \u201cChinese government\u2019s effort to repress Falun Gong ... the Report also states that Falun Gong followers were generally released from detention and that the harshest punishments were reserved for core leaders of the movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291-92. Because Zheng was not a \u201ccore leader\u201d and had been able to relocate to a rural village without enduring any harm, we concluded that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s determination that Zheng failed to demonstrate that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">In this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision because the BIA expressly adopted it. <em>See Tang, </em>578 F.3d at 1275. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Qian failed to establish eligibility for asylum based on his family\u2019s practice of Falun Gong and the Chinese government\u2019s belief that he was a Falun Gong practitioner. The IJ and BIA concluded that Qian\u2019s asylum claim failed to meet the objective prong of the well-founded fear of future persecution analysis and that the record did not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Although Qian testified that police detained him and his father once after Falun Gong material was found in the family home, Qian did not suffer any harm during this detention and was released after two days. Qian acknowledged that he was not a \u201ccore leader\u201d of the Falun Gong movement. In fact, Qian admitted that he did not even practice Falun Gong. Further, after Qian left for the United States, Qian\u2019s father took sole responsibility for the Falun Gong material found in Qian\u2019s family\u2019s home. Based on the 2009 Country Report, which is substantially similar to the 2002 Country Report we relied upon in <em>Zheng, </em>the harshest punishment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>reserved for Falun Gong\u2019s \u201ccore leaders,\u201d while most casual practitioners of Falun Gong were punished administratively. Despite testifying that he would be arrested and beaten if returned to China, Qian has not provided any evidence to show that he would be punished more severely than the petitioner in <em>Zheng, </em>whom we found did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Because Qian was not a leader of the Falun Gong movement and he was not harmed during his prior Falun Gong-based detention, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Qian did not show he faced a reasonable possibility of harsh punishment upon return to China. As such, the IJ and BIA correctly determined that Qian was not eligible for asylum. Accordingly, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-10\">. On appeal, Qian did not offer any argument on his claims for withholding of removal or CAT relief. As such, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (stating that \u201c[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
