Sneed contends that the court abused its discretion in reducing his 87-month term of imprisonment by only 16 months to 71 months and in not giving reasons for declining to reduce it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision \u201cwhether to reduce a sentence pursuant to ... \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, ... its interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA court abuses its discretion when the court makes an error of law or bases its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. When a court in applying its discretion fails to consider the factors as required by law, it also abuses its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and internal citation omitted). Although \u201ca district court need not mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or articulate its reasoning for why the factors support its decision on the motion,\u201d the court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>(citing, <em>inter alia, United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The record reflects that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in ruling on Sneed\u2019s motion. <em>See id. </em>The court, \u201cwhich was under no obligation to reduce [Sneed\u2019s] sentence at all, was under no obligation to reduce it even further within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673 (citations omitted). The court was not required to give reasons for granting the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion but not imposing a lower sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 674. Sneed has failed to show that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
