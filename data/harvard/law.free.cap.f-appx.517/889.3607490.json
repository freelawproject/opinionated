After his release, Llanes was informed that he would be deported. In 2011, Llanes petitioned for a writ of <em>coram no-bis,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>challenging his 1993 conviction on the grounds that counsel failed to inform him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. His argument was based upon <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), which held that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to inform noncitizen criminal defendants that pleading guilty may result in deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-22\">As Llanes concedes, <em>Padilla </em>was decided after his conviction became final and thus could only serve as a basis for his petition if it is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Llanes filed his petition and briefed this appeal, the retroactivity of <em>Padilla </em>was an unsettled question. <em>See Chaidez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1107 n. 2, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013) (collecting cases). But in February, the Supreme Court resolved the conflict and held that <em>Padilla </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 1113 (\u201c[Defendants whose convictions became final prior to <em>Padilla ... </em>cannot benefit from its holding.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Llanes\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-16\">. We assume, without deciding, that an ineffective-assistance claim is cognizable in a <em>coram nobis </em>petition. <em>See Chaidez v. United </em>States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1106 n. 1, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013) (assuming \"without deciding\u201d that \"nothing in this case turns on the difference between a <em>coram nobis </em>petition and a habeas petition\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-19\">. Llanes\u2019s apparent contention (confusingly argued under the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Witt v. State, </em>387 So.2d 922 (Fla.1980), which is flatly inapplicable to Llanes\u2019s federal conviction) that <em>Padilla </em>applies retroactively even as a \"new rule\u201d under the exception for \"watershed\u201d rules of criminal procedure, <em>see Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 311-12, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), is squarely foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>Figuereo-Sanchez v. United States, </em>678 F.3d 1203, 1209 (11th Cir.2012) <em>(\"Padilla </em>did not announce a watershed rule of criminal procedure.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
