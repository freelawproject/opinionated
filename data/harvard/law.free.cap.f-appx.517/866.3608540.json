The presen-tence investigation report concluded that he was a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (Nov.2005). Because Rogers was a career offender and the offense carried a statutory maximum sentence of 40 years, the PSR recommended a base offense level of 34. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B). After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, his total offense level was 31. As a career offender, Roger\u2019s criminal history category was VI. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1. His resulting guidelines range was 188 to 235 months imprisonment. The district court adopted the PSR and sentenced Roger to 188 months imprisonment. The government later filed a motion to reduce Rogers\u2019 sentence by two levels based on his substantial assistance to the government. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). The district court granted that motion and reduced Rogers\u2019 sentence to 151 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-20\">In 2011 the district court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the probation office to provide a supplemental report on whether Rogers was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines. The report concluded that Rogers was ineligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender. In his response, Rogers argued that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). The district court concluded that Rogers was ineligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced under the career offender guidelines. This is Rogers\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the [career offender] sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Amendment 750, which lowered the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses, did not alter the sentencing range upon which Rogers\u2019 sentence was based because he was sentenced under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. For that reason, <em>Moore </em>controls this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Rogers contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), abrogated our decision in <em>Moore, </em>but we have already rejected that argument in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012). Rogers argues that <em>Lawson </em>is distinguishable because in <em>Lawson, </em>the defendant\u2019s sentence was within the career offender guidelines range, while Rogers\u2019 sentence was later reduced below his career offender guidelines range because of his substantial assistance to the government. That distinction does not matter, because the question we are required to ask under <em>Moore </em>and <em>Lawson </em>is whether Amendment 750 altered \u201cthe sentencing range upon which [Rogers\u2019] sentence was based.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Even though Rogers\u2019 sentence was later reduced below his guidelines range, his sentence was still based on the career offender guideline. And because Amendment 750 did not alter Rogers\u2019 sentencing range under the career offender guideline, he is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
