Because Gilmore had previously been convicted of three serious drug offenses, the district court sentenced her to a statutory mandatory minimum of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). As we explain below, because the two arguments Gilmore raises on appeal are foreclosed by binding precedent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-23\">Gilmore first contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) exceeds Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power, both facially and as applied. But prior precedent dictates that \u00a7 922(g) is facially constitutional. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011). And we have found it constitutional as applied to a defendant who, like Gilmore, stipulated \u201cthat the firearm in question had travelled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-24\">Gilmore next argues that the district court violated her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing her sentence based on prior convictions not charged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the indictment or admitted as part of her guilty plea. This argument is likewise foreclosed by binding precedent. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that prior convictions used to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence are not elements of an offense and therefore need not be alleged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">For the above reasons, Gilmore\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
