In December 2011, Voma filed his second motion to reopen his immigration proceedings with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and in March 2012, the BIA denied the motion to reopen. Voma has filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his second motion to reopen. The BIA\u2019s decision denying reopening found, inter alia, that Voma\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely and barred by the numerical limitations set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). Voma argues that the BIA erred in finding that his motion to reopen was time barred and number barred because he was entitled to equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to equitably toll time and numerical limitations based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, reasoning that a request for equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel was in essence a request for sua sponte reopening. <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008). Voma acknowledges this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ramos-Bonilla, </em>but he challenges that opinion as incorrectly decided. However, one panel of this court may not overturn a prior decision of another, absent an intervening change in the law, such as a statutory amendment, or by a contrary or superseding decision by either the Supreme Court or this court en banc. <em>See, e.g., Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Although Voma challenges the BIA\u2019s application of the \u201cdeparture bar,\u201d <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d), in the light of this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Garcia-Carias v. Holder, </em>697 F.3d 257 (5th Cir.2012), because the BIA also determined that Voma\u2019s motion to reopen was time barred and numerically barred, we need not address the BIA\u2019s application of the departure bar. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla, </em>543 F.3d at 219-20. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Voma\u2019s untimely motion to reopen, we need not address Voma\u2019s equitable tolling or ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on their merits. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla, </em>543 F.3d at 220 (\u201cBecause this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Ramos\u2019s untimely motions to reopen, we do not reach Ramos\u2019s equitable tolling or ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on their merits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
