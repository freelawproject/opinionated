This suit rehashes claims already raised in prior suits against largely the same defendants, who can be divided into two groups: Ordeneaux, Phillips, Cut\u00ed, Trabona, Simmons, Varnado, Reid, Golds-by, and the Amite City Council (collectively, the \u201cAmite Defendants\u201d) and Cox, Hin-gle, Spallinger, Peltier, Carter, Holifield, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>and Hudson\u2019s Salvage, LLC (collectively, the \u201cHudson\u2019s Defendants\u201d). Because all of Donley\u2019s claims are precluded under res judicata, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In September 2008, Donley was in a store owned by Hudson\u2019s Salvage, LLC (\u201cHudson\u2019s Salvage\u201d) photographing what he believed to be safety violations. A store employee called the police, and Officer Ordeneaux was dispatched to the investigate the complaint that Donley refused to leave. When Ordeneaux arrived, Cox, a store manager, told him that Don-ley was verbally combative and refused to leave the store. Cox also told Ordeneaux that Donley struck Hingle, a store employee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Spallinger, a private security officer on duty at the store. Cox had already called for ambulances for Hingle and Don-ley.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Donley refused Ordeneaux\u2019s request for his driver\u2019s license and, according to affidavits from Ordeneaux and Officer Phillips, was verbally combative. Donley gestured sharply at Ordeneaux. Ordeneaux stated that Donley \u201clunged at me with a closed fist as if to strike me.\u201d Phillips stated that Donley \u201craised his arms above his head and walked toward Officer Orde-neaux in a threatening manner.\u201d Orde-neaux then handcuffed Donley. The store surveillance video does not show Donley lunging at Ordeneaux or raising his arms above his head, and it does not conclusively show whether Donley gestured with a closed fist, but it does show Donley abruptly gesturing and that Ordeneaux did not touch Donley prior to handcuffing him. The officers remained with Donley until the ambulance arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Hospital staff examined and released Donley. The officers allowed him to visit his personal physician for a second opinion, but instructed him to surrender to the Amite City Police Department the next day. Donley surrendered to the police the next day and was booked for two counts of simple battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">Donley was convicted of one count of simple battery on Hingle by Magistrate Reid in the Amite City Mayor\u2019s Court. The conviction was dismissed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">Donley has filed four prior civil actions based on his arrest and subsequent conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his first suit, Donley filed a \u00a7 1983 complaint in the Eastern District of Louisiana against a paramedic not named in this action and appellees Ordeneaux, Phillips, Cut\u00ed, Trabona, and Simmons in their capacities as employees of Amite City. The lower court granted summary judgment and dismissed Donley\u2019s claims on the basis of qualified immunity, and we affirmed. <em>Donley v. Ordeneaux, </em>419 Fed.Appx. 519, 520 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 405, 181 L.Ed.2d 258 (2011). In his second suit, Donley sued Reid in state court in his capacity as City Attorney and Magistrate of Amite City. The trial court granted Reid\u2019s peremptory exception of no cause or right of action and dismissed Donley\u2019s suit on the ground that Reid enjoyed judicial immunity for all of his official acts as presiding officer of a major\u2019s court, and the appellate court affirmed. <em>Donley v. Reid, </em>No. 2010-1217, 2010 WL 5487149, at *1 (La.App. 1st Cir. Dec. 22, 2010), <em>unit denied, </em>61 So.3d 669 (La.2011), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>nied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 113, 181 L.Ed.2d 38 (2011). In his third suit, Don-ley sued Hudson\u2019s Salvage, Cox, Hingle, Spallinger, Peltier, and Holifield \u201cfor personal injury, false arrest and imprisonment, defamation, malicious prosecution, and violation of his civil rights,\u201d arising out of his arrest and trial. <em>Donley v. Hudson\u2019s Salvage, LLC, </em>No. 2010-1315, 2010 WL 5480438, at *1 (La.App. 1st Cir. Dec. 22, 2010). The appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision in favor of the defendants for malicious prosecution and defamation and affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision in favor of the defendants on all other claims. The remaining claims for malicious prosecution and defamation are pending in Louisiana state court as of the filing of the Hudson\u2019s Defendants\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The district court in this case held that the three prior judgments against Donley preclude all of his claims against the defendants who were parties to Donley\u2019s pri- or suits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court held that Donley\u2019s claims against the remaining defendants are also barred by claim preclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court also held that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Donley\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims because there is no vicarious liability under \u00a7 1983, the Hudson\u2019s Defendants are not state actors, and no cause of action for malicious prosecution exists under \u00a7 1983. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Donley\u2019s conspiracy claim under \u00a7 1983 because Don-ley produced no evidence of an agreement among any of the defendants to do an illegal act. The district court held that Donley\u2019s claims against Reid are barred by judicial immunity and that his defamation claims based on testimony by the defendants are barred by witness immunity. The district court held that all of Donley\u2019s state law claims, except for malicious prosecution, have prescribed and that, in regard to his malicious prosecution claim, Donley could not establish that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">\u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. Summary judgment is warranted if \u2018the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is not genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>DePree v. Saunders, </em>588 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2009) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">The Full Faith and Credit Statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, \u201c \u2018requires federal courts to give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sevin v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>632 F.Supp.2d 586, 594 (E.D.La.2008) (quoting <em>Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 466, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982)). \u201cIn determining the preclusive effect of an earlier state court judgment, federal courts apply the preclusion law of the state that rendered the judgment.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Tex. Capital Bank N.A., </em>660 F.3d 900, 906 (5th Cir.2011) (citations omitted). As the Louisiana res judicata statute \u201cis modeled on federal preclusion doctrine and the Restatement on Judgments, federal jurisprudence may be consulted when the relevant Louisiana cases leave doubt at to the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Sevin, 632 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>F.Supp.2d at 595. The federal common law of claim preclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">bars the litigation of claims that either have been litigated or should have been raised in an earlier suit. The test for claim preclusion has four elements: (1) the parties in the subsequent action are identical to, or in privity with, the parties in the same action; (2) the judgment in the prior case was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) there has been a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the same claim or cause of action is involved in both suits.... When all four elements are present, claim preclusion prohibits a litigant from asserting any claim or defense in the later action that was or could have been raised in support of or in opposition to the cause of action asserted in the prior action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>Duffie v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 372 (5th Cir.2010) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">This court has held that res judicata is justified \u201cwhere the non-party\u2019s interests were adequately represented by a party to the original suit.\u201d <em>Meza v. Gen. Battery Corp., </em>908 F.2d 1262, 1266 (5th Cir.1990). \u201c[A] non-party will be considered \u2018in privity, or sufficiently close to a party in the prior suit so as to justify preclusion,\u2019 where the party to the first suit is so closely aligned with the nonparty\u2019s interests as to be his \u2018virtual representative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royal Ins. Co. of Am. v. Quinn-L Capital Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1286, 1297 (5th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Benson &amp; Ford, Inc. v. Wanda Petroleum Co., </em>833 F.2d 1172, 1174-75 (5th Cir.1987)). Under Louisiana law, \u201cthe preclusive effect of an earlier judgment could bind a nonparty ... whose interests were adequately represented by parties to the prior litigation.\u201d <em>Williams v. Orleans Levee Dist., </em>31 So.3d 1048, 1049 (La.2010) (citing <em>Forum for Equality PAC v. McKeithen, </em>893 So.2d 738, 745 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">While we \u201cliberally construe briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants and apply less stringent standards to. parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel, <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Donley lists eighteen separate issues in his appellate brief (two issues are labeled in Donley\u2019s brief as \u201cIssue III\u201d). For the sake of clarity, we will address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">1. Donley argues that Magistrate Judge Wilkinson was biased against him in his ruling granting the Amite Defendants summary judgment. The only indications of Judge Wilkinson\u2019s bias that Donley points toward are his unsupported assertion that Judge Willdnsoris \u201cassessment of the [store surveillance video] does not appear to be even-handed\u201d and that Judge Wilkinson granted the defendants summary judgment knowing that Phillips, Or-deneaux, and Cuti had submitted false documents with the intent to mislead the court. There is no proof of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">2. Donley argues that Reid committed \u201cFraud on the Courts\u201d by serving as both Town Attorney and Town Magistrate. Donley previously made this argument in another suit. <em>Reid, </em>2010 WL 5487149, at *3. Because Reid was party to the prior suit, because the Louisiana court was one of competent jurisdiction, because that court made a final judgment against Donley on the merits, and because the same claim was involved in both suits, the district court in this case correctly held that Donley\u2019s claim was precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"Adi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>3A. Donley argues that Detweiler, the Amite Defendants\u2019 attorney, committed \u201cFraud on the Courts\u201d by \u201cinjecting his own testimony in violation of Attorney Ethics, altering defendant testimony, documents, omitting known evidence, [and] misleading the Court by citing a Town Court conviction that is not admissible evidence.\u201d Donley contends that Detweiler submitted perjured affidavits from the police officers involved, made a false statement to the court concerning when Donley was arrested, altered wording in Orde-neaux\u2019s and Phillip\u2019s affidavits, and withheld evidence favorable to Donley. The affidavits and other evidence Donley refers to concern claims against the Amite Defendants precluded by his prior suit. <em>Ordeneaux, </em>419 Fed.Appx. at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"AEr\">3B. Donley argues that the district court erred in dismissing his motion for summary judgment. The district court held that all of Donley\u2019s claims were precluded under res judicata. Although Don-ley still has claims for defamation and malicious prosecution pending in state court, the district court properly held that those claims were precluded in federal court by the judgments in <em>Ordeneaux, </em>419 Fed.Appx. 519, and <em>Reid, </em>2010 WL 5487149, because they arose out of the same transaction as the claims in those cases and could have been raised in those suits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Donley claims that res judicata should not apply due to \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d namely that he was denied evidence, documents were altered, the defendants misled the court, that the store surveillance video confirms his version of events, and there was \u201cgeneral ... manifest injustice.\u201d The Louisiana res judicata statute makes an exception where \u201cexceptional circumstances justify relief from the res judicata effect of the [prior] judgment.\u201d La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13:4232(A)(1). <em>But see Avenue Plaza, LLC v. Falgoust, </em>676 So.2d 1077, 1079 (La.1996) (\u201cOnce a final judgment acquires the authority of the thing adjudged, no court has jurisdiction to change the judgment, regardless of the magnitude of the final judgment\u2019s error.\u201d) (citations omitted). The Louisiana statute gives the court \u201cdiscretion [that] must be exercised on a case by case basis and ... granted only in truly exceptional cases, otherwise the purpose of res judicata would be defeated.\u201d <em>Spear v. Prudential Prop, and Cas. Ins. Co., </em>727 So.2d 640, 642-43 (1999). Donley\u2019s mere allegations do not amount to exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak_a\">4. Donley argues that the district court erred in granting the Amite and Hudson\u2019s Salvage Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. For the same reasons that the district court did not err in dismissing Donley\u2019s motion for summary judgment, it did not err in granting the Amite and Hudson\u2019s Salvage Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ8\">5. Donley argues that district court erred in holding Donley\u2019s claims against Reid and Goldsby were barred by immunity. The district court properly held that Donley\u2019s claims against both were precluded. A court of competent jurisdiction previously held that Donley\u2019s claims against Reid were barred by judicial immunity. <em>Reid, </em>2010 WL 5487149, at *2-3. While Goldsby was not party to Donley\u2019s prior suit, Donley added him to this suit on the theory that, as mayor, he illegally recommended to the Amite City Council that they illegally appoint Reid as magistrate despite already serving as City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Attorney. Goldsby has the same interest in defending Reid\u2019s authority as magistrate as Reid did in the prior case. Because Reid appeared in the \u201csame quality or capacity\u201d and adequately represented the interests of Goldsby in the prior suit, Donley is precluded from arguing that Reid and Goldsby are not protected by immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"Apd\">6. Donley argues that the district court erred in holding Donley\u2019s claims against the officers were barred by immunity. The lower court only addressed immunity for the officers in holding that Or-deneaux, Phillips, and Cut\u00ed were immune from suit for claims based on their testimony against Donley at his criminal trial. \u201c[Witnesses are entitled to absolute immunity against \u00a7 1983 suits based on their testimony in a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Mowbray v. Cameron Cnty., </em>274 F.3d 269, 277 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983)). Donley also argues that the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity; however, Donley\u2019s arguments are precluded by a prior judgment. <em>Ordeneaux, </em>419 Fed.Appx. at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"ALo\">7. Donley argues that the district court \u201cabused its discretion when viewing the Evidence.\u201d Because the district court correctly held that all of Donley\u2019s claim were precluded by prior judgments, we need not and do not review whether the district court properly viewed the evidence on summary judgment in the light most favorable to Donley.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">8. Donley argues that Blondell, attorney for the Hudson\u2019s Defendants, was not admitted to the bar to practice in the district court. Donley did not raise this issue before the lower court, and accordingly it is waived. <em>Nissho-Iwai Am. Corp. v. Kline, </em>845 F.2d 1300, 1307 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"AZJ\">9. Donley argues that an unbiased viewer of the store surveillance video could not conclude that Donley was not \u201cexcessively abused and Cruel and inhuman punishment inflicted.\u201d This court, in reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applies the same standard as the district court. <em>DePree, </em>588 F.3d at 286. Facts are to be \u201cconstrued in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Your Credit, Inc., </em>148 F.3d 427, 432 (5th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s treatment of the facts in this case, however, is not relevant because all of Donley\u2019s claims are precluded by judgments in prior suits.</p>\n<p id=\"AlX\">10. Donley argues that the district court did not accord him the consideration due to <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs in denying several motions to compel. We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to order production of discovery for abuse of discretion. <em>Batton v. Evers, </em>598 F.3d 169, 175 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). The district court was obliged to construe Don-ley\u2019s motions liberally, but Donley is not free from the rules of the court. In each order denying a motion to compel, the district court stated its reasons. Despite this Donley repeatedly filed motions to compel containing the same deficiencies. As such, the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Donley\u2019s motions to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"AJQ\">11. Donley argues that the police arrested him without a proper warrant. His claim is precluded by a prior judgment. <em>Ordeneaux, </em>419 Fed.Appx. at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"AAG\">12. Donley argues that he was \u201csubjected to Manifest Injustice by the manipulations of the Amite defendants and/or their attorney.\u201d Donley appears to rely on the same arguments he made in contending that Detweiler, the Amite Defendants\u2019 attorney, committed \u201cFraud on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Courts\u201d in Issue 3A. Accordingly, these arguments are precluded by the judgment against Donley in <em>Ordeneaux, </em>419 Fed.Appx. at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">13. Donley argues that the district court committed reversible error when it allowed the defendants to cite the Mayor\u2019s Court trial in USDC Cases 2:09ev6422 and 2:10cv3223. <em>Donley v. Ordeneaux, </em>No. 2:09cv6422, 2010 WL 2836115 (E.D.La. Jul. 16, 2010), is not before us on appeal. In regards to this case, it is unclear what Donley is referring to; the Magistrate Judge\u2019s opinion did not rely on Donley\u2019s Mayor\u2019s Court trial in holding against him. \u201cAlthough we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs, such litigants must still brief contentions in order to preserve them.\u201d <em>Longoria v. Dretke, </em>507 F.3d 898, 901 (5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">14. Donley argues that the district court erred by not sufficiently explaining why his motions to compel were denied. The district court denied nine motions to compel filed by Donley in eight separate orders. (E.D. La. 2:10cv3223, ECF Nos. 34, 44, 45, 48, 49, 57, 71, 102.) One was denied as moot, and the district court provided specific reasons for each of the other motions. Donley failed to provide the court with a copy of the subject requests in violation of the local rules (Nos.44, 45, 57), failed to notice for hearing and provide indication that he contacted opposing counsel beforehand (Nos.48, 49, 71), and submitted motions to compel that were \u201cvague and perfunctory\u201d (No. 102).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">15. Donley argues that the editing of the store surveillance video violated his rights by omitting scenes that favored him. The only direct reference to this argument, however, that he makes in his brief is the statement that the video does not show him being assaulted by Officer Cuti because it panned away beforehand. Donley does not state how this should have changed the district court\u2019s holding. The Magistrate Judge acknowledged the video was sometimes inconclusive and did not show everything relevant that happened, but the court need only look to affidavits and deposition testimony and interpret the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant in addressing off-camera actions. Donley also does not state why the editing of the store surveillance video would defeat the preclusive effect of the prior judgments against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">16. Donley argues that the defendants concealed or conspired to conceal evidence. Donley makes conclusory statements of a conspiracy and multiple references to \u201cperjured\u201d statements by the defendants in his brief. Unsupported statements alone are insufficient grounds to overturn the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">17. Donley argues that the district court\u2019s decision in USDC Case 2:09-cv-6422 was influenced by the concealment, alteration, or withholding of evidence. <em>Donley v. Ordeneaux, </em>2010 WL 2836115, is not before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Because the district court did not err in granting the Amite Defendants\u2019 and Hudson\u2019s Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the basis of res judicata and because each of Donley\u2019s other arguments are without merit, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
