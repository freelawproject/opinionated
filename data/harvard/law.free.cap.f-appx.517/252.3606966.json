The advisory guidelines range of imprisonment was 6 to 12 months. At sentencing, the district court found that Arechiga-Duarte\u2019s criminal history score did not represent his criminal history adequately and increased his criminal history category from I to IV, resulting in a recommended range of 15 to 21 months of imprisonment. The district court, in an upward departure, sentenced him to 21 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. On appeal, Arechiga-Duarte does not challenge the district court\u2019s upward departure based on his criminal history. Rather he argues that the term of supervised release was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to make case-specific findings to justify it. Because Arechiga-Duarte did not raise his objections in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c), supervised release is not ordinarily imposed on aliens who will likely be deported. When \u00a7 5Dl.l(e) applies, \u201csupervised release should not be imposed absent a determination that supervised release would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329; \u00a7 5D 1.1, comment. (n.5). Arechiga-Duarte had 10 prior convictions, for which the district court specifically found that it was necessary to increase his term of imprisonment considering the sentencing factors found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which include protecting the public and deterring criminal conduct. Arechiga-Duarte has not challenged the upward departure or the findings supporting it. Arechiga-Duarte does not address why these unchallenged findings are not sufficient to support the imposition of a term of supervised release considering the same \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, Are-chiga-Duarte has not established, under the applicable plain error standard, that his sentence was either procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
