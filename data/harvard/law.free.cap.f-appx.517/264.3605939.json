The district court found no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that Armstead had sufficient monthly income after paying expenses, as listed in his motion, to pay the court\u2019s filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">Armstead now moves in this court for leave to proceed IFP on appeal from that decision. To proceed IFP on appeal, a movant must demonstrate that he is a pauper and that he will raise nonfrivolous issues on appeal. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Armstead has not demonstrated that he has a non-frivolous argument for appeal that the district court abused its discretion in denying his IFP motion. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
