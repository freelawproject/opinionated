Because Herring has not shown reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Herring worked as an accounts payable clerk for Alphastaff, Inc. Through Alphas-taff, Herring was eligible to receive long term disability (LTD) benefits as a participant in an employee welfare benefit plan under a group insurance policy issued by Aetna. Aetna served as the plan\u2019s claim administrator, meaning it had discretionary authority to determine whether Herring was entitled to benefits under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">In March 2009, Herring ceased work and underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Subsequently, she applied for LTD benefits. Under the policy, LTD benefits were payable for a period of \u201ctotal disability.\u201d The policy defines total disability as: (1) one who is not able to perform the material duties of her occupation; or (2) one who is not able to work at any reasonable occupation. Reasonable occupation is defined as \u201cany gainful activity for which [one is], or may reasonably become, fitted by education, training, or experience.\u201d A reasonable occupation includes \u201csedentary work,\u201d where standing and walking are required only occasionally. A period of total disability ends when one ceases to be totally disabled or fails to give proof of her continued total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">Aetna approved Herring\u2019s claim for LTD benefits effective June 27, 2009. On August 31, 2009, Aetna notified Herring that as of June 27, 2010, her eligibility for continued benefits would be contingent upon evidence that she was totally disabled. In July 2010, at Aetna\u2019s request, Dr. Josef Hudec performed an Independent Medical Examination (IME), and concluded that Herring was capable of working. A Vocational Rehabilitation Consultant (VRC), who was employed by Aet-na, reviewed Dr. Hudec\u2019s findings, and identified five sedentary occupations Herring could perform, as well as the local employers for each occupation. In August 2010, in light of the IME and the VRC\u2019s findings, Aetna terminated Herring\u2019s LTD benefits on the grounds that Herring could perform a \u201creasonable occupation,\u201d as defined under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Herring appealed Aetna\u2019s termination decision. In her appeal, Herring included a letter from her treating cardiologist, To-bia Palma, stating that Herring was totally-disabled and had \u201cno ability to work.\u201d In evaluating the appeal, Aetna hired three physicians to review Herring\u2019s medical records. Two of the three doctors concluded that Herring was capable of sedentary work and not totally disabled. The third physician offered a more restrictive view of Herring\u2019s physical capabilities. His review was consistent with the comments made by Dr. Joshua Levy, a physia-trist referred by Herring\u2019s family practitioner and assigned by Aetna to offer his medical opinion on the results of the IME. Dr. Levy agreed that Herring was able to work; however, he noted that she was capable of working fewer hours per day with more restrictive limitations on the tasks she could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">After considering the reports of all 3 physicians, Aetna affirmed its decision to terminate Herring\u2019s benefits and issued its final decision by letter dated June 30, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) itself does not provide a standard for courts to review the benefits determinations of plan administrators or fiduciaries. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109, 109 S.Ct. 948, 953, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). With <em>Firestone </em>and <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Company v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008), as guides, however, this circuit has formulated a mul-ti-step framework for courts reviewing an ERISA plan administrator\u2019s benefits decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-8\">(1)Apply the de novo standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-10\">(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is \u201cde novo wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-11\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is \u201cde novo wrong\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-12\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-13\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-14\">(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-15\"><em>Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 849, 181 L.Ed.2d 549 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">Under this framework, Herring bears the burden of proving that she is disabled and that Aetna\u2019s decision is wrong. <em>Glazer v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>524 F.3d 1241, 1247 (11th Cir.2008). If Herring satisfies this burden, she then must demonstrate that Aetna\u2019s decision to deny her LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious; that is, she must show that had no reasonable grounds support Aetna\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>The district court found that Aetna was not \u201cde novo wrong.\u201d We agree. Herring\u2019s LTD benefits were payable for a period of \u201ctotal disability.\u201d A period of total disability ends when one is not totally disabled or fails to supply proof of her continued total disability. Here, Herring has not shown proof of her continued disability. Two reviewing physicians considered the medical evidence and found Herring was capable of sedentary work. Their findings were consistent with the IME performed by Dr. Hudec, who also found that Herring was capable of sedentary work. This evidence was considered in conjunction with the-VRC report, which identified sedentary occupations available to Herring in her geographical area. <em>See Richey v. Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>608 F.Supp.2d 1306, 1312 (M.D.Fla.2009) (finding that \u201cthe use of vocational evidence in conjunction with medical evidence is an effective method of reaching an informed decision as to a claimant\u2019s work capability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Even if Aetna\u2019s decision had been \u201cde novo wrong,\u201d because Aetna had discretion to determine whether Herring was entitled to LTD benefits under the policy, Herring bears the burden of showing that Aetna\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Glazer, </em>524 F.3d at 1246. She cannot. While one of the reviewing physicians agreed with Dr. Levy that Herring was restricted in her performance of sedentary work, it was not unreasonable for Aetna to rely on the findings of the other two reviewing physicians, in conjunction with the IME and the VRC. <em>See Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1356 (holding that a termination decision was not unreasonable where it \u201crelied upon the advice of several independent medical professionals\u201d and found that the claimant failed to provide conclusive medical evidence of disability). While it is true that Dr. Parma, Herring\u2019s treating physician, determined the exact opposite\u2014 that Herring was totally disabled and could not work \u2014 his conclusion does not automatically qualify Aetna\u2019s termination decision as arbitrary and capricious. Aet-na \u201cneed not accord extra respect to the opinions of a claimant\u2019s treating physicians.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court properly granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-5\">. In light of our decision affirming the district court, Aetna's motion to strike portions of Herring's reply brief is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
