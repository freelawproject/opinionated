After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-21\">Owens filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2011. The filing automatically stayed collection on Owens\u2019s outstanding debt, including a stay of foreclosure proceedings on a home owned by Owens. GMAC, the servicer for Owens\u2019s mortgage holder, moved for relief from the stay and for <em>in rem </em>relief on the home in order to begin state-court foreclosure proceedings. The bankruptcy court held a hearing on the matter and subsequently issued an order granting GMAC both forms of relief for \u201creasons stated on the record in open court.\u201d Owens appealed to the district court, but did not request a transcript of the bankruptcy court hearing. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, GMAC foreclosed, and Owens now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-22\">Owens asserts that the bankruptcy court erred in granting both <em>in rem </em>relief and relief from the automatic stay. \u201cIf the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2). When a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s failure to do so prevents effective review of the trial court\u2019s decision, we must affirm. <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir.2002). The bankruptcy court granted relief \u201c[f]or the reasons stated on the record in open court.\u201d Yet Owens did not provide either the district court or our court a transcript of the bankruptcy court proceedings. We therefore cannot meaningfully review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision and we must affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">Owens also contends the bankruptcy court\u2019s hearing did not afford him adequate due process. \u201cThe core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>LaChance v. Erickson, </em>522 U.S. 262, 266, 118 S.Ct. 753, 139 L.Ed.2d 695 (1998). Without a transcript of the proceedings, however, we cannot evaluate whether Owens had a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Because the burden of furnishing a transcript for appellate review rests with Owens and he has failed to comply with this obligation, we must affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that his due process rights were not violated. <em>See Loren, </em>309 F.3d at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AbqQ\">. Although Owens contends on appeal that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>grant GMAC relief from the automatic stay, the bankruptcy court clearly had statutory authority to do so. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(1), (b)(2)(G).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b923-9\">. Owens also argues that GMAC illegally foreclosed because it did not have an interest in the property. But the bankruptcy court necessarily determined that GMAC had an interest in the property when it granted GMAC relief from the automatic stay. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d) (providing that only \"a party in interest\u201d can request relief from an automatic stay). Because, as discussed above, Owens has not provided the transcript necessary to meaningfully review that decision, this argument fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
