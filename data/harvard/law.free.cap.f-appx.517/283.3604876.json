Rasc\u00f3n argues that the district court erred in denying the reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to section 3El.l(a) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that the responses to the presentence report (PSR) were couched in terms of counsel\u2019s belief and that no factual or legal arguments against the drug quantity were included. He notes that when it became clear that the district court took these responses as objections, defense counsel withdrew the objections and explained that Rasc\u00f3n admitted all relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-22\">In his response to the PSR, Rasc\u00f3n objected to the use of his relevant conduct relating to his trafficking of two kilograms of cocaine on eight occasions, recalling only three occasions. The district court concluded that he had frivolously contested his relevant conduct, which section 3E1.1 explicitly cites as a basis for denial of the reduction for acceptance of responsibility. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1(A) (2010). Rasc\u00f3n seeks to characterize his objections as arguments in favor of a downward variance, but the district court\u2019s decision to treat his PSR responses as an objection frivolously contesting the probation officer\u2019s drug-quantity determination is not without foundation. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-23\">Rasc\u00f3n further argues that the denial of the acceptance of responsibility reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel. We decline to address this claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal without prejudice to Rascon\u2019s right to bring it in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
