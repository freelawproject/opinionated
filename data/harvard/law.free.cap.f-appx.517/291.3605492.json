The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that Garcia fraudulently obtained lawful permanent resident (LPR) status through a material misrepresentation and, as such, was not eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-21\">Garcia contends that the Texas offense of burglary of a habitation is a divisible statute that encompasses acts that do and do not qualify as acts of moral turpitude. He further contends that neither the IJ or the BIA conducted the proper analysis to determine whether he was convicted under a subsection of the Texas statute that constituted a crime involving moral turpitude. He thus asserts that the IJ\u2019s finding that he committed fraud by not disclosing a conviction for a crime of moral turpitude in his application for an immigrant visa was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-22\">We review constitutional claims and questions of law de novo. <em>Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 164 (5th Cir.2006). We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard and the BIA\u2019s findings will not be reversed \u201cunless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-23\">Relief under \u00a7 212(c) may not be granted to an alien who \u201chas not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(1). The statutory phrase \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d does not apply to aliens who \u201cobtained their permanent resident status by fraud, or had otherwise not been entitled to it.\u201d <em>In re Koloamatangi, </em>23 I &amp; N Dec. 548, 550 (BIA 2003). Contrary to Garcia\u2019s assertion, the act of fraud the IJ determined Garcia committed was his failure to disclose \u201chis arrest and guilty plea\u201d to the crime of burglary of a habitation. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Garcia\u2019s \u201cfailure to disclose his conviction when he applied for an immigrant visa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>constitute^] a willful misrepresentation of a material fact.\u201d As the IJ determined, Garcia\u2019s felony burglary conviction would have rendered him ineligible to obtain LPR status at the time he filed his visa application. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245A(b)(l)(C), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(b)(l)(C) (requiring an alien seeking to adjust his status to show that he has not been convicted of a felony). Thus, Garcia\u2019s argument, which focuses on whether his burglary conviction constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude, is misplaced since it was not the only . basis for finding Garcia removable and, as such, ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. Garcia does not contest the existence of his burglary conviction, nor the IJ\u2019s finding that he \u201cknowingly, willfully, or fraudulently\u201d failed to disclose it in his immigrant visa application in order to obtain LPR status. Because Garcia misrepresented his criminal history and obtained his LPR status due to this misrepresentation, he was not \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d <em>See Koloamatangi, </em>28 I &amp; N Dec. at 550. As such, the BIA properly determined that Garcia was not statutorily eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1212.8(f)(1). Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
