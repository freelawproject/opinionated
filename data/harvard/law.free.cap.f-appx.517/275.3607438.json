He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 24 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"ARh\">Potts contends that the district court failed to give adequate reasons for imposing consecutive revocation sentences. The district court recognized that it had discretion to impose consecutive revocation sentences pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 and explained its concerns in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Potts \u201chad a hard time staying out of trouble,\u201d committed crimes out of aggression and anger, posed a danger to the community, and failed to change \u201c[his] ways in the many years that.. .[he] ha[d] been in trouble.\u201d Accordingly, the district court concluded that consecutive 24-month sentences were \u201cappropriate\u201d to satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly deterrence and just punishment. Therefore, the district court provided adequate reasons for imposing consecutive revocation sentences. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Herrera, </em>429 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Fed.Appx. 382, 389, 390 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 469, 181 L.Ed.2d 306 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Next, Potts asserts that the district court \u201cbased its sentencing determination on factual findings that were clearly erroneous and without a reasoned basis\u201d and \u201cdid not hear the arguments of appellant regarding the consecutive sentences.\u201d However, he does not explain which findings were erroneous nor what arguments the district court should have but erroneously failed to consider. These arguments are therefore waived by virtue of inadequate briefing. <em>See United States v. Reagan, </em>596 F.3d 251, 254 (5th Cir.2010). For the foregoing reasons, Potts has failed to show that his revocation sentence was plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Potts also contends that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the consecutive revocation sentences. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Potts must show that counsel performed deficiently and that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Potts\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is derivative of his first claim of error. Therefore, the record is adequately developed to address this claim. <em>Cf. United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). Since the first claim of error has no merit, even under the ordinary standard of review, \u201cthe requisite deficient performance does not exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Mudekunye, </em>646 F.3d 281, 288 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
