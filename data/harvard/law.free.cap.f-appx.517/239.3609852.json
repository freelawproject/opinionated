Linzay asserts he had a property interest in his job as a certified probationary teacher and coach, and that Appellees violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process by terminating Linzay without providing him written reasons and an opportunity to be heard before termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>Cornerstone Christian Sch. v. Univ. Interscholastic League, </em>563 F.3d 127, 133 (5th Cir.2009). We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>482 F.3d 315, 318 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-21\">We have ruled that former La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:442 \u2014 the version of the statute at issue here \u2014 does not provide the basis for a probationary teacher to claim a property interest in his job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Noel v. Andrus, </em>810 F.2d 1388, 1390 (5th Cir.1987). Louisiana courts have held the same. <em>See, e.g., McKenzie v. Webster Parish Sch. Bd., </em>609 So.2d 1028, 1031 (La.Ct.App.1992). Furthermore, as the district court noted, \u201cLouisiana jurisprudence has been clear for almost twenty years\u201d that certified probationary teachers do not enjoy due process protection under La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:81.5 because they are not \u201cschool employees\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Dist. Ct. Ruling Granting Mot. to Dismiss at 3 n. 1 (citing <em>Wilhelm v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., </em>598 So.2d 699, 701 (La.Ct.App.1992)). Therefore, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
