Fox also appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Blue Cross on whether Blue Cross paid the proper benefit amount under Fox\u2019s employee welfare benefit plan (Plan). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In 2008, Fox underwent brain surgery performed by an out-of-network physician. Under the terms of Fox\u2019s Plan, Blue Cross agreed to pay 100% of the \u201cAllowed Amount\u201d for the surgery. The Plan defines \u201cAllowed Amount\u201d for an out-of-network physician as \u201cthe lesser of the Provider\u2019s actual charge or an amount established by [Blue Cross] based on several factors,\u201d including the charge reimbursable by Medicare for the services performed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The actual charge for Fox\u2019s surgery was $29,000, but Blue Cross calculated the Allowed Amount as $2,729.48, leaving Fox responsible for the difference. Fox appealed this decision to Blue Cross\u2019s appeals department. Blue Cross reviewed Fox\u2019s case, verified that it had properly calculated and paid the Allowed Amount, and concluded that Fox was not entitled to any additional payment. On July 28, 2008, Blue Cross sent Fox a letter explaining the reasons for its denial of his appeal. Fox then requested copies of all relevant documents Blue Cross used to make the decision. Blue Cross responded with documentation verifying that it had paid 100% of the Allowed Amount but did not furnish documents explaining how it calculated the Allowed Amount or how it had verified that the Allowed Amount had been correctly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">Fox sued, alleging that Blue Cross: (1) violated the Plan by failing to pay the full amount of the actual charge; and (2) violated the disclosure requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024(b)(4) by failing to provide documentation about how it calculated the Allowed Amount, subjecting Blue Cross to a daily statutory penalty as the plan administrator under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">Upon Blue Cross\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed Fox\u2019s disclosure claim, finding that Blue Cross was not subject to the penalty because it was not the plan administrator. Fox\u2019s payment claim proceeded to discovery. Blue Cross moved for summary judgment on this claim and submitted the affidavit of Dr. Barry Schwartz, which explained, for the first time, that Blue Cross determined the Allowed Amount based on Medicare billing rates for the services Fox received. The district court rendered summary judgment in Blue Cross\u2019s favor, relying on this explanation to conclude that Blue Cross properly calculated and paid the Allowed Amount under the Plan. This is Fox\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">We review the dismissal of a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>\u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Lobo v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., </em>704 F.3d 882, 887 (11th Cir.2013). To survive a motion to dismiss, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>cepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Under ERISA, plan administrators must, \u201cupon written request of any participant or beneficiary, furnish a copy of the latest updated summary, plan description, and the latest annual report, any terminal report, the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024(b)(4). Failure to comply with this disclosure requirement within 30 days subjects the plan administrator to a daily statutory penalty. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1132(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The district court concluded that Blue Cross was not the plan administrator and therefore not subject to \u00a7 1132(c)(1). Fox argues this conclusion was in error. Blue Cross responds that, even assuming it was a plan administrator, the documents Fox requested in his complaint \u2014 those that Blue Cross relied on to calculate and verify the Allowed Amount \u2014 are not subject to disclosure under \u00a7 1024(b)(4). We agree. Fox argues only that these documents qualify as \u201cother instruments under which the plan is established or operated\u201d and must therefore be disclosed. But that provision \u201cencompasses formal or legal documents under which a plan is set up or managed.\u201d <em>Faircloth v. Lundy Packing Co., </em>91 F.3d 648, 653 (4th Cir.1996), <em>quoted with approval in Cotton v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>402 F.3d 1267, 1274 n. 8 (11th Cir.2005). Because the documents Blue Cross used to calculate and verify the Allowed Amount are not such documents, Blue Cross\u2019s failure to disclose them did not violate \u00a7 1024(b)(4), and the district court correctly dismissed Fox\u2019s claim. <em>See id.; cf. Brown v. J.B. Hunt Transp. Servs., Inc., </em>586 F.3d 1079, 1088 (8th Cir.2009) (\u201cNothing in [ERISA] requires plan administrators to disclose claims manuals to plan participants.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the record and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Sims v. MVM, Inc., </em>704 F.3d 1327, 1330 n. 2 (11th Cir.2013). Summary judgment is proper where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWe may affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on any legal ground supported by the record, regardless of whether the district court relied on that ground.\u201d <em>Walden v. Ctrs. for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, </em>669 F.3d 1277, 1283 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Fox contends that Blue Cross\u2019s decision to pay less than the actual charge for his surgery was improper. We follow a six-step process to review a benefits decision. <em>Capone v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>592 F.3d 1189, 1195 (11th Cir.2010). The first step is to \u201c[a]pply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u2018wrong\u2019 (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">We need not proceed beyond the first step here. The Plan provides that, for out-of-network services, Blue Cross will pay 100% of the Allowed Amount, which is defined as the lesser of the provider\u2019s actual charge or an amount established by Blue Cross based on factors enumerated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>the Plan, including the amount Medicare pays for certain services. Evidence in the administrative record \u2014 namely, the letter Blue Cross sent to Fox on July 23 and the documentation Blue Cross sent Fox in response to his request \u2014 indicates that Blue Cross paid 100% of the Allowed Amount. Fox provides no evidence to counter this assertion. He therefore cannot show, as he must to survive summary judgment, a genuine dispute that Blue Cross\u2019s benef\u00edts-denial decision was wrong under the Plan. <em>See Dietz v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., </em>598 F.3d 812, 815 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cOnce the movant adequately supports its motion [for summary judgment], the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to show that specific facts exist that raise a genuine issue for trial.\u201d). The district court therefore properly rendered summary judgment in favor of Blue Cross.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In sum, the district court properly dismissed Fox\u2019s disclosure claim and correctly concluded that Blue Cross was entitled to summary judgment. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\">. Fox argues vigorously that \"Allowed Amount\u201d means only the provider's actual charge. But the partial quotation of the Plan\u2019s definition, which he takes out of context to support this reading, plainly contradicts the Plan\u2019s actual language. We therefore do not further address this frivolous argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\">. Fox contends that it was improper for the district court to rely on Dr. Schwartz\u2019s affidavit about how the Allowed Amount was calculated because it was outside the administrative record. Even without this affidavit, however, Blue Cross offered other evidence, the validity of which Fox did not contest in the district court, that it paid 100% of the Allowed Amount. Fox has therefore forfeited this argument. <em>See Ledford v. Peeples, </em>657 F.3d 1222, 1258 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that a party who does not raise an argument in the district court forfeits his right to raise it on appeal except in limited circumstances not present here).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
