McCoy, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Lafayette, LA, Cristina Walker, Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Shreveport, LA, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-19\">Christopher Albert Aberle, Mandeville, LA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b314-21\">Before SMITH, PRADO, and HIGGINSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Pursuant to the government\u2019s U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, Eric Alexander received a departure sentence below the guideline range following his guilty-plea conviction of (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, 50 grams or more of cocaine base, and 1,000 or more kilograms of marihuana, (2) possession of a firearm, and (3) conspiracy to commit money laundering. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 1956(h). He maintains that because his guideline range of imprisonment was incorrectly enhanced by five levels instead of four pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.1 for his role as a leader or organizer of the drug conspiracy, remand for resentencing is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Because there was no objection in the district court to the incorrect calculation, plain-error review applies. <em>See United States v. Isiwele, </em>635 F.3d 196, 204 (5th Cir.2011). To show plain error, Alexander must demonstrate (1) that there was an error, (2) that it was clear or obvious, and (3) that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes that showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1126, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Given that \u00a7 3B1.1 provides for no more than a four-level increase, there was an error that was clear or obvious, a point the government does not dispute. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez, </em>690 F.3d 613, 620 (5th Cir.2012). Nevertheless, the government argues that remand for resen-tencing is not necessary, because Alexander cannot establish that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">At sentencing, the district court discussed at length Alexander\u2019s involvement in the drug conspiracy and provided a detailed examination of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) tied to the specific facts of this case. It also noted Alexander\u2019s substantial assistance to the government and the apparent value of that assistance. The court then imposed a sentence of 228 months, noting its \u201cgrave concern\u201d that it may have \u201ccut [Alexander] way too much slack here.\u201d Further, following its examination of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court stated that it would impose the same sentence even if it had erred in calculating the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">In light of the foregoing, Alexander has not shown that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the proceedings,\u201d <em>ie., </em>that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability of a lower sentence on remand.\u201d <em>United States v. Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d 415, 424 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, he has not demonstrated that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
