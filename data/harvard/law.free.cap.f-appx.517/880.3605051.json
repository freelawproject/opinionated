He argues that his trial counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected her performance in plea negotiations and in sentencing. He asserts that his counsel had shared office space with and accepted referrals from a target of the same government investigation that had given rise to the charges against him. Aguilar-Garcia argues that his counsel\u2019s relationship with this person, whom he identifies only as \u201cHector\u201d, tainted the entirety of his counsel\u2019s representation, and resulted in him receiving a harsh sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">In a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Thomas v. United States, </em>572 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). Claims involving a counsel\u2019s conflict of interest present mixed questions of law and fact, and are reviewed <em>de novo. Reynolds v. Chapman, </em>253 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">Generally, to demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s performance was so defective that it was constitutionally deficient and requires reversal, a defendant must allege facts showing: (1) that his counsel \u201cmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment;\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">Where an ineffective assistance claim is based on a conflict of interest, a petitioner \u201cmust show first, that his attorney had an actual conflict of interest, and second, that the conflict adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Pegg v. United States, </em>253 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). Thus, a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief. <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 349-50, 100 S.Ct. at 1719. However \u201cthe possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction,\u201d and absent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>showing of actual conflict and adverse effect, a petitioner is not entitled to relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">\u201cAn \u2018actual conflict\u2019 of interest occurs when a lawyer has \u2018inconsistent interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freund v. Butterworth, </em>165 F.3d 839, 859 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). The inquiry into the existence of an actual conflict is \u201cfact-specific.\u201d <em>United States v. Novaton, </em>271 F.3d 968, 1011 (11th Cir.2001). The petitioner must show an \u201cactual conflict,\u201d because a speculative or merely hypothetical conflict of interest does not yield a Sixth Amendment violation. <em>Reynolds, </em>253 F.3d at 1342-43. To prove adverse effect, a petitioner must demonstrate three elements: (1) \u201cthat the defense attorney could have pursued a plausible alternative strategy\u201d; (2) \u201cthat this alternative was reasonable\u201d; and (3) \u201cthat the alternative strategy was not followed because it conflicted with the attorney\u2019s external loyalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1343. \u201cIf there is a guilty plea involved, this Court looks at whether the attorney\u2019s actual conflict adversely affected the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty.\u201d <em>Pegg, </em>253 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The district court did not err in denying Aguilar-Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion because his allegations, taken as true, do not demonstrate that his counsel operated under an actual conflict of interest. Aguilar-Garcia did not allege any facts showing how counsel\u2019s relationship with Hector conflicted with his interests. The \u201cspeculative or merely hypothetical\u201d conflict is insufficient to show inconsistent interests. <em>Reynolds, </em>253 F.3d at 1342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
