Prieto contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the sentencing judge failed to calculate his guideline range. He argues that the sentencing judge was substantively unreasonable in imposing a consecutive, rather than concurrent, thirty-month term. The government responds that the sentencing judge was aware of the guidelines, and was not unreasonable in imposing a consecutive term of imprisonment. After careful consideration, we affirm Prieto\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We review sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence on appeal, we follow a two-step process. First, we determine whether the sentence is proeedurally reasonable, then we decide whether it is substantively appropriate. <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>584 F.3d 1354, 1364 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe reasonableness of a final sentence is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Proeedurally, a district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cOne of the factors a court must consider in sentencing following revocation is \u2018the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for \u2014 in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission....\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1318 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Here, the sentencing judge did not explicitly say that she considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. When a district court does not specifically mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we may look to the record to see whether the district court did, in fact, consider the factors. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007). This sentencing judge, who was familiar with Prieto from having previously sentenced him, described his criminal history and the serious nature of his offenses. \u201cThe Court [also] considered the statements of the parties and the information contained in the violation report.\u201d The sentencing judge explained she \u201c[found] that a sentence within the guideline range is appropriate.\u201d The sentencing judge further explained that she was imposing a consecutive, rather than concurrent, term of imprisonment because Prieto\u2019s previous incarceration \u201cseemed to have no impact on him as far as continuing committing very serious criminal conduct in, it seems, both a wholesale and retail end of the cocaine business.\u201d From this, we conclude that the district court sufficiently considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, see <em>id., </em>and explained its reason for imposing the sentence, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">As for Prieto\u2019s argument that the district court did not calculate the guideline range, the district court\u2019s consideration of the appropriateness of the guideline range was brief, but legally sufficient. \u201c[F]or sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release,\u201d we have held \u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>sufficient that there be some indication that the district court was aware of and considered the Guidelines, which requires the court to consider the sentencing range established under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349 (quotation marks, emphasis, and citations omitted). Here, the record shows that the sentencing court was aware of and considered the guidelines. The sentencing judge said that she found a sentence within the guideline range to be appropriate, and imposed a sentence within that guideline range. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.4 (Nov.2012). Thus, we cannot say that Prieto\u2019s sentence was procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u201c[I]f a sentence is procedurally reasonable and is within the applicable Guidelines sentencing range, we review substantive reasonableness of the sentence by applying a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review.\u201d <em>Chavez, </em>584 F.3d at 1365. Prieto argues that the sentencing judge was substantively unreasonable in imposing a consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentence because as a 50-year old man, this is tantamount to a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Whether a term of imprisonment following revocation of supervised release is to be served consecutively or concurrently is a question entrusted to the discretion of the sentencing judge. <em>United States v. Quinones, </em>136 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.1998). This sentencing judge was well within her discretion to impose a consecutive sentence after considering Prieto\u2019s history of recidivism and the serious nature of his crimes. We note the policy statement of the Sentencing Commission, which says \u201c[a]ny term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of probation or supervised release shall be ordered to be served consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f). For these reasons, we conclude that the sentence is not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\">. The government argues that Prieto's objection to the procedural reasonableness of the sentencing at the revocation hearing was insufficiently specific to preserve the issue for appeal. Accordingly, the government asks that we review Prieto\u2019s procedural reasonableness claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Maurice, </em>69 F.3d 1553, 1557-58 (11th Cir.1995). Because we conclude that the district court was not proeedurally unreasonable under the more stringent abuse-of-discretion standard, we need not consider this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
