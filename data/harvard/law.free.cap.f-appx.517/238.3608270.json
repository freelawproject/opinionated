He contends that his within-guidelines sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and, thus, it is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">We review sentences for reasonableness, employing a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, and we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008). The district court considered Church\u2019s arguments, the facts of the case, and the appropriate statutory sentencing factors and guidelines before concluding that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. That determination is owed deference, and Church\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of those factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338\u201439.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
