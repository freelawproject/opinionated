The facts appear in the opinion of the Court. Plaintiff had judgment, and defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-7\"><em>Gr. </em>J7. <em>\u00a7\u2022 W. H. Sharp </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">I. The appellants ask for a reversal of the judgment, for that the delivery of a good title and register was made a condition precedent to the payment of the balance of $2,200; consequently the respondent\u2019s action was prematurely brought. Cunningham <em>v. </em>Morrell, 10 J. R. 203 ; Green <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 2 J. R. 207; McIntyre <em>v. </em>Clark, 7 Wend. Rep. 330 ; Northrup <em>v. </em>Northrup, 6 Cow. Rep. 276 ; Gaze <em>v. </em>Price, 16 John. Rep. 267 ; Rob <em>v. </em>Montgomery, 20 J. R. 203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">It is no answer to say, as was contended in the Court below, that title to a ship may pass by parole ; consequently the appellants had a good title without the bill of sale and register from the last owner. The answer to all this is, that respondent had agreed to give something more, and he was bound to do it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-10\">II. Again: a good title and register to the vessel was to be given <em>\"within ninety </em>days, and before the payment of the $2,200.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-11\">The time fixed upon was also of the <em>essence </em>of the contract. The respondent was not ready or willing at the time fixed to complete the sale, consequently the appellants could not be compelled to complete the agreement. Berry <em>v. </em>Young, 2 Exp.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AjN\">delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Baldwin, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Plaintiff sold defendants a vessel for $4,400, the possession of which vessel he delivered. At the time of sale the vessel was registered as the property of another, so that a proper transfer could not be made at the time. In consequence of this it was agreed that $1,000 of the purchase money should be paid in cash, $1,200 within twelve days, and the remaining $2,200 upon the delivery by plaintiff to defendants of a good title and register of the vessel. $1,200 was paid by the defendant as by agreement. No title or register has ever been delivered or tendered to the defendants; nor is it shown that the plaintiff has ever been in a condition to make such title. The agreement between the parties was, that the money should be paid upon the delivery of the title; and in order to entitle the plaintiff to recover, he must show an offer on his part to comply with the agreement. 1 Chitty Pleadings, 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
