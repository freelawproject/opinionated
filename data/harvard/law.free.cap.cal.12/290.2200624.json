The defendant, Chase, having entered under Keller, and in privity with his title, cannot be allowed to dispute it in this action. The mortgage from Keller was duly acknowledged and recorded, and Chase must be deemed a purchaser with notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">It follows that the judgment of the Court below is erroneous, and it is reversed and the cause remanded, with direction to enter a decree foreclosing plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, and ordering the premises to be sold to satisfy the same.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
