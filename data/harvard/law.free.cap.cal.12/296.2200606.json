The defects of the complaint are stated in the opinion of the Court. Defendant demurred to the complaint, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Court below sustained the demurrer, and judgment was entered for defendant. Plaintiff appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-5\"><em>J. A. Fletcher </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-6\"><em>J. Berry </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">The complaint is wholly defective, and \u201c under no enlightened system of jurisprudence should such pleadings be upheld, tending, as they do, to obscure the true issues involved, to surprise litigants, and embarrass Courts and lawyers.\u201d It does not show what interest or estate Calhoun had in the premises ; it does not show that he ever had any interest whatever, not even that he was ever in possession of the premises, or of any part thereof, or of the esplees and profits thereof; and there could be no error, under the most liberal rules of construction, in sustaining the demurrer, where the plaintiff shows no right whatever, and therefore no damages.

J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">This case was for damages sustained by the plaintiff, by reason of the refusal of the defendant, Sheriff of Siskiyou county, to execute to him a deed for land bought at public sale ; but the complaint is fatally defective in this, that it alleges special damages, arising from the ina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>bility to get rents and profits from the estate\u2014a tavern in Yreka\u2014 without averring that the defendant in execution had any title to the premises, or that the plaintiff, if the Sheriff had made him a deed, would have been either entitled to receive, or been able to recover, possession of the property, or rents or profits. For this error the Court properly sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
