J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">Section 459 of the Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides, in part, that one who \u201centers <em>any </em>house, <em>room, </em>apartment, . . . store, ... or other building . . . with intent to commit. . . larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d (Italics added.) We granted review to address a conflict in Court of Appeal decisions concerning whether a defendant\u2019s entry into a bedroom within a single-family house with the requisite intent can support a burglary conviction if that intent was formed only after the defendant\u2019s entry into the house. We conclude that such an entry can support a burglary conviction under section 459, and hence reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which reached a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">At approximately noon on April 20, 1999, 22-year-old Ana I. answered defendant\u2019s knock at the door of her single-family home in Vista. Defendant, then 25 years of age, attempted to sell Ana some magazines, but she stated she was not interested. Defendant asked Ana for a glass of water, which she provided to him as he remained outside the house. Defendant eventually asked Ana whether he could enter the house, and he did so. (Ana could not recall at trial whether she invited defendant to enter.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Defendant sat at the dining room table while Ana stood in the \u201carea where the door to the kitchen was.\u201d Eventually Ana sat at the table with defendant. Defendant persisted in his attempt to sell a magazine subscription, but soon changed the subject, asking Ana whether she had a boyfriend. When told that she did not, defendant asked her why she did not. Ana revealed that she had broken up with her boyfriend. Ana felt nervous because she did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>speak English well and \u201cdid not know how to answer the questions he was asking.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ana asked defendant to leave, telling him that she had to depart to pick up her niece and saying to defendant, \u201ccan you go out,\u201d while raising her hand and making a motion. After some time, Ana repeated to defendant that she had to pick up her niece at school and when he still did not leave the house, Ana got up, walked to the living room to turn off the stereo, and again told defendant that she had to depart to pick up her niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">At this point, defendant had been in the house, talking with Ana at the dining room table, for about 15 minutes. Defendant rose from the dining room table, walked to the living room where Ana was standing near the stereo, and asked her whether she liked the music that was playing. Ana replied that she did, and walked down the hall to her bedroom to find outdoor shoes to wear upon leaving the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Although Ana did not ask defendant to go with her into the bedroom, he followed her into that room. (There was no testimony that the bedroom door was closed, or that Ana opened it.) As Ana retrieved her shoes from the floor of the closet, she realized that defendant was in the bedroom with her, standing just inside the bedroom doorway. At that point, defendant may have asked Ana whether the bedroom was hers. Defendant blocked Ana\u2019s exit, diverted her attention by telling her to look out a window, and then shoved her face down onto the bed, pressing a pillow on top of her head as she began to scream. During her struggles, Ana began to see white spots and had difficulty breathing. Ultimately, defendant raped her, and then walked into the bathroom. Ana closed her bedroom door, and locked it. When defendant exited from the bathroom, he knocked on Ana\u2019s door. She told him to leave and stated that she was \u201cnot going to tell anybody, but he should leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Ana left the house through her bedroom window and walked to a school to meet her niece, who noticed that Ana had red splotches on her face. Later that day Ana told her mother and her sister that she had been attacked, and that evening Ana went to a hospital, where she described the assault to a police officer. A later medical examination revealed the presence of defendant\u2019s semen in Ana\u2019s vagina. Ana also showed signs of petechiae (pinpoint hemorrhaging) on her face, a condition consistent with asphyxia.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The trial court instructed the jury on the offense of burglary by using a modified version of CALJIC No. 14.50 as follows: \u201cThe defendant is accused in count one of having committed the crime of burglary, a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>of section 459 of the Penal Code. [f|  Every person who enters a building or <em>any room within a building </em>with the specific intent to commit rape, a felony, is guilty of the crime of burglary in violation of Penal Code section 459.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Based upon these and related instructions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the prosecution argued to the jury that defendant could be found guilty of burglary if he formed the intent to rape either (i) prior to entering the house, or (ii) after entering the house, but prior to entering the bedroom in which the sexual assault occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The jury convicted defendant of first degree burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460) and forcible rape (\u00a7261, subd. (a)(2)), and found true the allegations that defendant personally used a deadly weapon (the pillow) (\u00a7\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1), 12022.3, subd. (a)). The jury also found true the allegation that the forcible rape was committed during the commission of a residential burglary with the intent to commit forcible rape (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (a) and (d)(4)). The trial court imposed a sentence of 29 years to life in prison.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The Court of Appeal upheld defendant\u2019s conviction for forcible rape, but in a split decision reversed the burglary conviction for instructional error, setting aside the related true finding concerning the section 667.61 allegation. We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The Attorney General asserts that the plain words of section 459 (defining as burglary the entry of \u201cany . . .room. . . with intent to commit . . . larceny or any felony\u201d) establish that the court\u2019s instructions were correct and that the elements of the offense of burglary were established in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Defendant contends, as the Court of Appeal majority held below, that the Legislature could not have intended for the circumstances presented here to constitute a burglary. He maintains that the word \u201croom\u201d in section 459 applies only to those rooms as to which there is an expectation of protection from intrusion\u2014from room to room\u2014that is comparable to the expectation of protection from intrusion into a house from outside the house. In other words, defendant argues that the term \u201cany . . . room\u201d as used in section 459 was intended to encompass only certain types of rooms\u2014for example, a locked room within a single-family house or a separate dwelling unit within a boarding house, entry into which is generally unauthorized even for other legal occupants of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">If we were to view the issue before us from the perspective of how the offense of burglary currently is defined in other jurisdictions in the nation, defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of that offense would have substantial support. During the past few decades, the legislatures of many of our sister states have been quite active in amending their respective burglary statutes in ways that either clarify or limit the meaning of the term \u201croom,\u201d or otherwise narrow the circumstances in which entry of a room can constitute burglary. At the present time, statutes in most jurisdictions, consistent with the recommendation of the Model Penal Code,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> make clear that the burglary statutes in these jurisdictions apply only to entry of a \u201croom\u201d that constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>a \u201cseparate unit\u201d or a \u201cseparately secured\u201d or \u201cseparately occupied\u201d portion of a building or structure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">As noted, the interpretation proposed by defendant would focus upon the nature of the room entered and would inquire whether an occupant\u2019s reasonable expectation of protection from intrusion into that room <em>from the other rooms </em>is comparable to the expectation of protection from intrusion <em>into a house from outside the house. </em>As the dissenting justice in the Court of Appeal observed, under this view no burglary occurs \u201cunless the nature of the room is such that it is considered as secure from entry from the interior of the structure as from the exterior, e.g., it is a <em>separate dwelling place or is kept </em>locked.\u201d (Italics added.) In other words, the limiting gloss proposed by defendant essentially would embrace the \u201cseparately secured or occupied\u201d standard endorsed by the Model Penal Code and adopted, in one form or another, in most (but not all) other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Although the interpretation of the statute proposed by defendant (and endorsed by the majority in the Court of Appeal below) is not unreasonable, as explained below we do not write on a clean slate. In view of the history and prior interpretation of the California statute, we are not free to adopt by judicial construction a limitation on the term \u201croom\u201d that has been explicitly established in other jurisdictions only by explicit legislative action. Instead, in light of governing California precedent, we conclude that section 459 reasonably must be interpreted in the manner urged by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">At common law, the offense of burglary was defined as breaking and entering the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony. (2 Jones\u2019 Blackstone (1916) p. 2431 (Jones\u2019 Blackstone); see 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) Crimes Relating to Property, \u00a7 8.13, p. 464.) \u201cAcross the intervening centuries these elements have been expanded or discarded to such an extent that the modern-day offense commonly known as burglary bears little relation to the common-law ancestor.\u201d (LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>at p. 464; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 712, 720-722 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 958 P.2d 1083]; <em>People v. Valencia </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1, 6-8 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 131, 46 P.3d 920].)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In California, the metamorphosis of common law burglary into statutory burglary began in 1850 with the adoption of section 58 of the Act Concerning Crimes and Punishments, from which today\u2019s Penal Code section 459 is derived. This first statute defined burglary as entering, in the nighttime and with the requisite intent, \u201cany dwelling house, or any other house whatever . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1850, ch. 99, \u00a7 58, p. 235.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Eight years later, in 1858, section 58 was amended by substituting for the phrase \u201cany dwelling house, or any other house whatever,\u201d the phrase that exists today in section 459, <em>\u2018\u2018\u2018'any </em>house, <em>room, </em>apartment or tenement.\u201d (Stats. 1858, ch. 245, \u00a7 58 p. 206, italics added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Upon being codified into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the Penal Code in 1872, the statute read essentially the same<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and, as relevant here, section 459 continues to read the same today: \u201cEvery person who enters <em>any </em>house, <em>room, </em>apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, bam, stable, outhouse or other building . . . with intent to commit. . . larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 460, subdivision (a), currently specifies that \u201c[e]very burglary of an inhabited dwelling house ... is burglary of the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We proceed to examine the principal California decisions that have construed the word \u201croom\u201d in our burglary statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">This court directly ruled upon the meaning of the word \u201croom,\u201d as used in section 459, for the first time in <em>People </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 225 [3 P. 813] <em>(Young).</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, the defendant entered a public railway station and thereafter entered a ticket office (which apparently had walls that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>eight to nine feet high but did not reach the ceiling) located within the station. We rejected the theory that section 459 required the defendant to have formed the required intent prior to entering the railway station, so long as he formed that intent prior to entering a room within that structure\u2014the ticket office. Accordingly, we held that the trial court did not err in refusing a requested defense instruction that if the defendant conceived his intent to steal after he entered the railway station building, the jury should find the defendant not guilty. <em>(Young, </em>at p. 226.) We stated: \u201cOne who enters, with burglarious intent, a room of a house enters the house with such intent. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In this regard, <em>Young </em>reflected the prevailing common law understanding that entry from inside a structure into a room within that structure could constitute a burglary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Subsequent to <em>Young, </em>a number of California appellate court decisions have held that entry into various types of rooms can constitute burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Most of these cases, like <em>Young, </em>concern entry into private rooms within public or commercial buildings. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Elsey </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 948 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 269] <em>(Elsey) </em>[entry into separate, locked school classrooms]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Church </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1151 [264 Cal.Rptr. 49] [entry into separately leased and locked offices in an office building]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mackabee </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1250 [263 Cal.Rptr. 183 ] [entry into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>enclosed \u201coffice area\u201d set off by \u201ca waist-high counter about two-and-one-half feet wide\u201d in the lobby of a building otherwise open to the public]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 598 [99 Cal.Rptr. 516] [entry into women\u2019s restroom inside hospital]; <em>People v. Garcia </em>(1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 681 [29 Cal.Rptr. 609] [entry into enclosed storage cage within a liquor store], disapproved on another ground in <em>Mozzetti </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 699, 706 [94 Cal.Rptr. 412, 484 P.2d 84]; <em>People v. Davis </em>(1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 365 [346 P.2d 248] [entry into closed office from \u201clubrication room\u201d of a service station]; <em>People v. Gaytan </em>(1940) 38 Cal.App.2d 83 [100 P.2d 496] [entry into storage room of cafe].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In other decisions, courts have upheld burglary convictions based upon the defendant\u2019s (i) entry into a private room within a multi-unit lodging facility (e.g., <em>People v. O\u2019Keefe </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 517 [271 Cal.Rptr. 769] <em>(O\u2019Keefe) </em>[entry into separate student dormitory rooms]; <em>People v. Fleetwood </em>(1985) 117 Cal.App.3d 982 [217 Cal.Rptr. 612] [entry into motel room]), (ii) entry from the garage of a single-family home into a locked kitchen <em>(People v. Thomas </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 899 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 434] <em>(Thomas)), </em>and (iii) entry, from inside a home, into a rented and locked bedroom within the home <em>(People v. Wilson </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 611 [256 Cal.Rptr. 422]).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Of all the cases applying section 459, only one, <em>People v. McCormack </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 253 [285 Cal.Rptr. 504] <em>(McCormack), </em>concerns the precise type of entry we face here\u2014entry, by an ostensible guest in the home, from inside the living quarters of a single-family home, into the unsecured bedroom of a member of a family living in the home. Most of the other recent decisions described above\u2014specifically, <em>Elsey, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 948, <em>Thomas, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 899, and <em>O\u2019Keefe, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 517\u2014have made a point of distinguishing <em>McCormack </em>and the normal single-family-home setting. We first discuss <em>McCormack, </em>and then the three other cited appellate decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The defendant in <em>McCormack, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 253, entered a single-family home through an unlocked door, assertedly at the occupant\u2019s invitation. The occupant\u2014the brother of the homeowner\u2014observed the defendant in the kitchen and asked him to leave the house, but the defendant refused to do so. Instead, the defendant asked the occupant whether he wanted a beer and requested permission to use the telephone. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 255.) The occupant departed and telephoned the police from a neighbor\u2019s residence. When the police arrived, they found the defendant (in a hallway of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the home) holding items taken from bedrooms. The defendant was charged with a single count of burglary. The trial court instructed that the \u201c \u2018intent [to steal the personal property of another] need not be in the mind of the person at the time of the initial entry into the structure, if he subsequently forms the intent and enters a room within the structure.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>bracketed material in original.) Consistent with this instruction, the prosecutor argued to the jury that the defendant committed burglary even if he formed the intent to steal after entering the house, so long as he did so before he entered one of the bedrooms. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant was convicted of burglary and appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Court of Appeal in <em>McCormack </em>found the trial court\u2019s instruction \u201cconsistent with the literal language of the controlling code section. In its current form this code section states: \u2018Every person who enters any . . . room . . . with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u2019 (\u00a7 459.) We have found no published decisions by a court of this state holding, on facts similar to those present here, that burglary is not committed when the intent to steal is formed after entry to a building but before entering a room therein from which the defendant intends to steal property.\u201d <em>(McCormack, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 253, 255.) Relying upon our decision in <em>Young, supra, </em>65 Cal. 225, and some of the Court of Appeal decisions cited <em>ante, </em>at pages 80-81, the court held that because \u201cthe plain language of the code includes entry into a room within the definition of burglary,\u201d the instruction was proper. <em>(McCormack, </em>at p. 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The court in <em>McCormack </em>also found that the basic policy underlying the burglary statute (see <em>People v. Gauze </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 709, 715 [125 Cal.Rptr. 773, 542 P.2d 1365]) supported its view: \u201cJust as the initial entry into a home carries with it a certain degree of danger [to personal safety], subsequent entries into successive rooms of the home raise the level of risk that the burglar will come into contact with the home\u2019s occupants with the resultant threat of violence and harm. Applying the plain language of the statute therefore serves rather than frustrates the policy of the law.\u201d <em>(McCormack, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 257.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">One year prior to <em>McCormack, </em>the Court of Appeal in <em>O \u2019Keefe, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 517, addressed whether entries into separate rooms in a college <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dormitory supported convictions for separate burglary counts. The court answered in the affirmative. It reasoned that merely because \u201ceach of the rooms is within the one building . . . does not mean they are not separate dwellings within the meaning of section 459,\u201d and found that \u201can individual student dormitory room is a separate inhabited dwelling within the meaning of section 459.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The defendant in <em>O\u2019Keefe, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 517, attempted to avoid this conclusion by arguing that the student dormitory rooms were analogous to rooms in a single-family home (as to which, the defendant assumed, multiple convictions under \u00a7 459 would not be proper). Without endorsing the defendant\u2019s assumption, the court in <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>rejected the attempted analogy between dormitory rooms and bedrooms of a single-family home. First, it observed, a student dormitory is \u201canalogous to a hotel or apartment complex\u201d and not to a single-family home. <em>(O\u2019Keefe, supra, 222 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 521.) The court noted that \u201c[i]n many apartment and hotel complexes, facilities are shared but separate burglaries of the individual rooms may still occur\u201d <em>(ibid), </em>and it cited decisions finding the entry into a bedroom of a tenant of a home to be burglary, and the entry into separate rooms in a business complex to constitute separate burglaries.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Second, the court in <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>declined to analogize between students living in a dormitory and family residents occupying a single-family home, noting that although the dormitory residents \u201cmay share kitchen and bathroom facilities . . . , this does not make them one big family. . . . [Ejach student lives and enjoys separate privacy in each of their individual dormitory rooms. These rooms are their homes while attending school. Unauthorized entry into each dormitory room presents a new and separate danger to each of the occupants. Accordingly, individual dormitory rooms and the students who occupy them are entitled to protection under the meaning of section 459.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Keefe, </em>at p. 521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Shortly after <em>McCormack </em>was filed, the Court of Appeal decided <em>Thomas, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 899. In that case the defendant first entered the garage of a single-family residence and then, while still in the garage, forcibly entered locked living quarters of the home\u2014the kitchen. The prosecutor in <em>Thomas </em>argued that the jury could convict the defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>burglary if he formed an intent to steal in the garage but prior to entry into the kitchen. The defendant asserted that he could not be convicted of burglary under these circumstances, because when a garage is \u201can attached, integral part of a house, it must be considered simply one room of several which together constitute the dwelling for purposes of burglary.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 905.) The court rejected the defense position, observing that section 459 proscribed entry into a \u201croom\u201d with felonious intent and \u201cnothing in this language . . . would exempt [the defendant] from conviction for burglary simply because his entry into the [victims\u2019] house took place from the garage rather than from somewhere outdoors.\u201d <em>(Thomas, </em>at p. 905.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">As in <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>however, the court in <em>Thomas, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 899, proceeded to distinguish the entry there at issue from other entries of rooms within single-family homes. The court emphasized that the defendant\u2019s \u201cforcible and unauthorized entry into the living quarters of the [victims\u2019] home [from the garage] was precisely the evil that the burglary statute is designed and intended to prevent. <em>The kitchen was separate from the garage. </em>It was protected and secured by a locked door which [the defendant] forced open with a crowbar. The [victims\u2019] expectation of privacy and security within their living quarters <em>was clearly greater than that in their garage, </em>even if the garage may be considered part of the entire dwelling for burglary purposes. In our opinion, it would defeat the purposes of the burglary statute to hold in this case that [the defendant] could not be found guilty of burglary unless it was shown that he conceived his felonious intent prior to entering the garage . . . .\u201d <em>(Thomas, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at pp. 906-907, italics added.) In the course of its discussion, the court in <em>Thomas </em>also asserted in a footnote: \u201c[W]here a burglar enters several rooms in a single structure, each with felonious intent, and steals something from each, ordinarily he or she cannot be charged with multiple burglaries and punished separately for each room burgled <em>unless </em>each room constituted a separate, individual dwelling place within the meaning of sections 459 and 460.\u201d <em>(Thomas, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 906, fii. 2, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Most recently, the court in <em>Elsey, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 948, addressed the defendant\u2019s entry into six classrooms, some of them located in the same building, on a single school campus. The court, distinguishing \u201centry into multiple rooms of a single-family house [from] the entries into multiple secured classrooms\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 959), upheld the resulting six burglary convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In so concluding, the court in <em>Elsey </em>noted that section 459 provides in relevant part that \u201cevery person who enters a house [or] room . . .\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>requisite intent is guilty of burglary, and it reasoned that \u201c[s]ince entry into a \u2018house\u2019 with the requisite intent constitutes burglary under the plain language of [section 459], it would be redundant to claim that entry into the rooms of the house constitutes additional burglaries. The larger category subsumes the smaller.\u201d <em>(Elsey, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 959.) The court then addressed the general situation that we face here\u2014formation of the requisite intent by an ostensible or actual guest, after his or her initial entry into the house, but prior to entry of the subject room within the house. The court commented: <em>\u201cOf course, where the \u2018house\u2019 may have been entered without the requisite intent, entry into the broader category does not constitute the burglary, allowing the courts to focus on an entry into a room in the house, with the requisite intent, as the basis for the </em>burglary(Ibid., italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Defendant asserts that the interpretation of section 459 set out in <em>McCormack, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 253, will produce bizarre results. He echoes the Court of Appeal majority below, which observed that the defendant in <em>McCormack </em>entered the kitchen in the home without the intent necessary for burglary, and that if the defendant had formed the requisite intent while in the kitchen and yet thereafter did not enter any other room, he would not have been guilty of burglary<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\u2014but if the defendant had gone into another room and then reentered the kitchen, this time with the requisite intent, he would have been guilty of burglary. The Court of Appeal majority also asserted that allowing a conviction of burglary on the present facts improperly would subject defendants to conviction of multiple counts of burglary for every room in the house entered with the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Justice Benke, dissenting in the Court of Appeal below, conceded that under McCormack\u2019s interpretation of the statute, whether a particular entry into a room constitutes burglary will depend upon \u201cthe location of an actor when the requisite intent is formed,\u201d but further observed that this consequence \u201cis not the result of the <em>McCormack </em>rule but of the nature of the crime of burglary itself as defined in section 459.\u201d Moreover, Justice Benke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>noted that even if the interpretation of the statute set out in <em>McCormack, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 253, may \u201callow[] the creative mind to formulate disconcerting hypotheticals about the application of the law of burglary,\u201d the rule proposed by defendant would do so as well: \u201cFor example, a person may enter a residence without the intent to commit a theft. He walks down a hall off of which there are two indistinguishable bedrooms. The first is the bedroom of a family member, the second the bedroom rented by a family friend. Under the [rule proposed by defendant and the majority below], if the person enters the first with the intent to commit a theft, he commits no burglary [because he has not invaded a separate possessory interest]. If he enters the second [with the intent to commit a theft], he commits a first degree burglary. This distinction makes no sense . . . and does not serve the policy basis of the crime.\u201d Accordingly, Justice Benke concluded that the rule proposed by defendant \u201csimply exchanges one set of potential anomalies ... for another,\u201d and she asserted that \u201c[i]f I must choose my anomalies . . . , then I believe I am duty bound to choose those created by the Legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">As noted above, California decisions applying section 459 have upheld burglary convictions based upon entry into diverse types of rooms\u2014among them ticket offices, liquor cages, business offices, enclosed counter areas, school classrooms, hotel rooms, apartments, a kitchen in a single-family home, and, in <em>McCormack, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 253, a bedroom within a single-family home. These decisions\u2014and <em>McCormack </em>in particular\u2014are consistent with common law cases from other jurisdictions, recognizing as burglary the entry (with requisite intent), from within a home, into a bedroom inside the home.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although the burglary statute historically has been the subject of frequent amendments, our Legislature has not revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>section 459 to disapprove any of these decisions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\n                   Furthermore, although in recent years the legislatures of many of our sister states have enacted statutes that have narrowed and confined the type of room that will qualify as the subject of a burglary (see <em>ante, </em>fns. 7 &amp; 8), the California Legislature, when presented with legislation that proposed similar amendments, did not adopt any similar amendment to our burglary statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">As the court observed in <em>McCormack, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 253, treating the entry at issue here as an entry for burglary is consistent with the personal security concerns of the burglary statute, because entry, from inside a home, into a bedroom of the home \u201craise[s] the level of risk that the burglar will come into contact with the home\u2019s occupants with the resultant threat of violence and harm.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 257.) Here, the 22-year-old victim, living in her family\u2019s home, reasonably could expect significant additional privacy and security when she retreated into her own bedroom. Accordingly, consistent with California decisions construing section 459, reaching back to <em>Young, supra, </em>65 Cal. 225, and consistent with the common law and the history of section 459, we conclude that the unadorned word \u201croom\u201d in section 459 reasonably must be given its ordinary meaning. It follows that the trial court did not err in this case by instructing the jury that entry into Ana\u2019s bedroom with the specific intent to commit rape constitutes a burglary in violation of section 459.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In light of California decisions construing section 459, the policy underlying that statute, common law antecedents, and the history of section 459, we conclude that the trial court did not err in defining burglary to include entry into the victim\u2019s bedroom with the specific intent to commit rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal insofar as it is contrary to the above conclusion, and remand the matter to that court with directions to affirm the conviction of burglary and the true finding on the related section 667.61 allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">On June 19, 2002, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Unless otherwise specified, all statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Ana testified with the assistance of a court interpreter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The trial court also provided the jury with the instructions in written form.

Penal Code sections 460 and 261 are defined elsewhere in these instructions. [TO If you find the defendant guilty of the crime of forcible rape as charged in Count Two, you must determine whether the defendant did so during the commission of a residential burglary as defined in [subdivision] (a) of Penal Code section 460, with the intent to commit rape as defined in Penal Code section 261[, subdivision] (a)(2).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life for rape committed during a residential burglary with intent to rape (\u00a7\u00a7 261, subd.

Defendant was not separately sentenced for the burglary conviction standing alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Model Penal Code, section 221.1, subdivision (1), first adopted in 1962, reads in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure, <em>or separately secured or occupied portion thereof, </em>with purpose to commit a crime therein . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) As explained in the comment to this section, \u201c[t]he provision in Subsection (1) as to separately secured or occupied portions of buildings and occupied structures takes care of the situation of apartment houses, office buildings, hotels, steamships with a series of private cabins, etc., where occupancy is by unit. It is the individual unit as well as the overall structure that must be safeguarded. Thus, while it would violate this section for a person to make an unprivileged entry into an apartment house for the purpose of stealing money or other valuables from a common safe, it also would violate the burglary provision if an intrusion is made into a single unit, even by an occupant of another unit of the same structure.\u201d (Model Pen.

The issue in <em>Stickman </em>arose out of a dispute in <em>the case </em>law <em>concerning </em>whether the term \u201cdwelling house\u201d included so-called outbuildings, and, if so, whether the dwelling house needed to be occupied (or used as a habitation) in order for a burglary charge to be proved. <em>(Stickman, </em>at pp. 244-245, citing 1 Bishop, Commentaries on The Criminal Law (1856) \u00a7 164 et seq., p. 151 et seq.)

The defendant claimed that he had his brother\u2019s permission to be inside the house. Applying Rhode Island General Laws section 11-8-1 (1956) (which in turn incorporates the common law definition of burglary), the Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that permission to be inside the house negated the entry element. The court observed: \u201cIt has long been held that while one may have permission to enter parts of a dwelling, entry into a room within that dwelling that a person does not have permission to enter can constitute burglary.\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Contreras-Craz, supra, </em>at p. 854; see also <em>State v.

(See Table of Sections Affected in the 1960-1970 volumes of Cal. Legislature, Final Calendar of Legislative Business, and in the 1973-2000 volumes of Cal. Legislature, Legislative Index and Table of Sections Affected.) The section has been amended six times since 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In the 1970\u2019s, a period during which many other jurisdictions amended their burglary statutes consistent with the Model Penal Code to limit the subject of burglary to certain categories of rooms (for example, those that are \u201cseparately occupied or secured\u201d), omnibus legislative proposals that would have incorporated that <em>same </em>limitation in section 459 were introduced in the California Legislature on four occasions but were not enacted. (See Sen. Bill No. 1506 (1972 Reg. Sess.) [proposed new Criminal Code, \u00a7 12601, subd. (a)]; Sen. Bill No. 39 (1973-1974 Reg. Sess.) [same]; Sen. Bill No. 565 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) [same]; Sen. Bill No. 27 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">To be sure, it is important that we be careful not to place undue significance on these unsuccessful legislative proposals. Each of the bills referred to in the prior paragraph proposed omnibus legislation that would have substantially overhauled the entire Penal Code. As we have noted, \u201cunpassed bills, as evidences of legislative intent, have little value\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1396 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323], and cases cited), and provisions contained within unpassed <em>omnibus </em>bills are, if anything, even less reliable indicants of legislative intent. Nonetheless, this history does reveal that although there have been some relatively recent attempts to limit the term \u201croom\u201d in section 459, to date no such proposal has been adopted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\">In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that our holding does not signify that a defendant who, with the requisite felonious intent, enters multiple unsecured rooms in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>single-family house properly may be convicted of multiple counts of burglary. As noted above, some California decisions have questioned whether multiple convictions might be sustained on such facts <em>(Thomas, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 899, 906, fn. 2; see also <em>Elsey, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 948, 959), and we have no occasion to consider that issue in this case, in which multiple burglary convictions are not involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
