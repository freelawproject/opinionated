Though he claims a grandfatherly bond with the victims, he has no blood, legal, or residential connection with them. The issue is whether, under pertinent Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provisions, defendant qualifies as a \u201crelative\u201d of the victims, and may thus avoid the mandatory 15-year-to-life prison sentence otherwise applicable to his crimes. Our answer is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>By a complicated intersection of the \u201cOne Strike\u201d law (\u00a7 667.61) and the statute restricting probation eligibility in lewd conduct cases (\u00a7 1203.066), a person convicted of lewd conduct (\u00a7 288) against multiple underage victims can both qualify for probation and avoid a mandatory indeterminate life term only if, among other things, he is a \u201crelative\u201d of the victim, or is \u201ca member of the victim\u2019s household who has lived in the victim\u2019s household.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (c)(1) (section 1203.066(c)(1).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant admits he is not a \u201chousehold member\u201d because he does not satisfy the statutory requirement of having lived with the victims. <em>(People v. Jeffers </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 984, 991-992 [239 Cal.Rptr. 886, 741 P.2d 1127] <em>(Jeffers)) </em>He therefore claims exemption from One Strike sentencing treatment, and possible eligibility for probation, as a \u201crelative\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The trial court rejected this claim and imposed a One Strike sentence. The Court of Appeal reversed and ordered resentencing on the ground defendant is a \u201crelative\u201d as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">As we will explain, expanding the definition of a \u201crelative\u201d to include molesters who claim nothing more than an emotional bond with the victim defies common usage, and contravenes the history of the applicable sentencing schemes. Such a construction of \u201crelative\u201d in section 1203.066(c)(1) would also swallow the adjacent \u201chousehold member\u201d provision, which was clearly intended as the catchall for \u201cnontraditional and quasi-familial\u201d ties. <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 992.) We conclude the Court of Appeal erred in analyzing the relevant sentencing statutes, and will reverse the judgment on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">There is no dispute over the relevant facts, which primarily concern defendant\u2019s relationship with Ruth P. and certain members of her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">Ruth was a widow with three grown sons, all of whom were married. Each son lived with his wife and children in their own home. Altogether, Ruth had eight grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">By all accounts, defendant was Ruth\u2019s boyfriend. They lived together for almost 20 years, but never married. Defendant had two grown daughters from a prior marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Ruth\u2019s children and their families gathered for holidays and special occasions at the large home Ruth and defendant built in Alpine in San Diego <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>County. Ruth\u2019s grandchildren also visited there on weekends and during vacations\u2014sometimes alone, and sometimes with siblings and/or cousins. Ruth and defendant bought toys for the grandchildren, and took them on family outings. Ruth\u2019s grandchildren called defendant \u201cGrandpa\u201d or \u201cPapa Jim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">This case began when four of Ruth\u2019s granddaughters complained to their parents and police that defendant sexually fondled them while they were visiting the Alpine house. Most of the alleged acts consisted of defendant sliding his hands under the victims\u2019 clothes and rubbing their breasts on the bare skin. In some instances, defendant also reportedly touched the victims\u2019 vaginas. Three of the girls\u2014Natalye, Chelsea, and Jenna\u2014were under age 14 when the complained-of acts occurred. The fourth and oldest victim, Lamen, said she was sexually violated once at age nine, and again when she was 141/2 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">The operative pleading charged defendant with 14 felony counts of lewd conduct against Natalye, Chelsea, and Jenna (\u00a7 288), and with one misdemeanor count of molesting Lamen (\u00a7 647.6). Each felony count was accompanied by an allegation that defendant qualified for an indeterminate 15-year-to-life term because he committed a One Strike offense against multiple victims. (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (b), (c) &amp; (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Before the case reached the jury, the trial court dismissed six felony counts at the parties\u2019 request. Later, when deliberations ended, the jury reached defense verdicts on fom felony counts (i.e., three acquittals and one deadlock/dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The prosecution ultimately obtained five convictions. One conviction involved the misdemeanor molestation of Lamen. The jury also found defendant guilty of fom violations of section 288, subdivision (a) (section 288(a))\u2014one against Natalye and three against Chelsea. Defendant has not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the guilty verdict either on appeal or on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">In light of related allegations under section 667.61, the One Strike law, the felony lewd conduct convictions meant that such crimes had been pleaded and proven \u201cagainst more than one victim\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)(5)). These findings both rendered defendant ineligible for probation (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a)(7)) and mandated a One Strike sentence of 15 years to life (\u00a7 667.61 subd. (b)) \u201cunless [he] qualifie[d] for probation\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)(7)) under subdivision (c) of section 1203.066 (section 1203.066(c)). As we later discuss, section 1203.066(c) contains a narrow exception to the ban on probation for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>multiple-victim molester where, in addition to other requirements, \u201c[t]he defendant is the victim\u2019s natural parent, adoptive parent, stepparent, relative, or ... a member of the victim\u2019s household who has lived in the victim\u2019s household.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.066(c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">At the sentencing hearing, defendant argued that he satisfied section 1203.066(c) in its entirety, that he was eligible for probation as a result, and that he was therefore exempt from One Strike sentencing treatment under section 667.61, subdivision (c)(7) (section 667.61(c)(7)). Focusing on section 1203.066(c)(1), defendant conceded this provision applies only if the term \u201crelative\u201d is loosely construed. He therefore emphasized evidence portraying him, in his words, as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of the victims\u2019 paternal grandfather. Defendant also urged the court to exercise any sentencing discretion in favor of probation, noting that he was 60 years old and had no prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Consistent with both the probation report and prosecutorial argument at the hearing, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s construction of section 1203.066(c)(1). As the unmarried partner of someone related by blood to the victim, defendant was not a \u201crelative\u201d in the court\u2019s view. The court observed that this conclusion effectively meant that it had no choice under section 667.61(c)(7) but to sentence defendant as a One Strike offender. Thus, while the court expressed doubt that defendant could satisfy the minimum probation-eligibility provisions of section 1203.066(c) in any other respect, it did not decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">However, the trial court rejected the suggestion of both the probation officer and the prosecutor to impose a sentence of 60 years to life, consisting of four consecutive 15-year-to-life terms for each qualifying One Strike conviction. Citing the mitigating factors identified by defendant, the court imposed four indeterminate life terms, but ordered them to run concurrently. Defendant also received a concurrent one-year jail term for his misdemeanor conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Defendant appealed. All four section 288(a) convictions were affirmed. In reaching this result, the Court of Appeal rejected complaints concerning the admissibility of prosecution evidence and the use of certain jury instructions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">However, the Court of Appeal agreed with defendant that the trial court had erred, for purposes of sentencing, in failing to find he was a \u201crelative\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>within the meaning of section 1203.066(c)(1). The Court of Appeal ruled that defendant was the victims\u2019 \u201crelative\u201d as a matter of law, because they shared a close quasi-familial relationship at the time of the crimes. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal vacated the concurrent 15-year-to-life terms and remanded the case for further consideration of defendant\u2019s probation eligibility, and his maximum sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Defendant and the People, represented by the Attorney General, each sought review in this court. Defendant challenged his convictions using the same evidentiary and instructional claims rejected on appeal. The Attorney General argued the Court of Appeal had misconstrued \u201crelative\u201d in section 1203.066(c)(1), and sought reinstatement of the One Strike sentence imposed by the trial court. Only the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review was granted. We now consider the sentencing question raised therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Effective November 30, 1994, section 667.61 ensures serious sexual offenders receive long prison sentences whether or not they have any prior convictions. (Stats. 1993-1994, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 14, \u00a7 1, pp. 8570-8572.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to a general statement of purpose in the legislative history, the targeted group preys on women and children, cannot be cured of its aberrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>impulses, and must be separated from society to prevent reoffense. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 26 (1993-1994 1st Ex. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 2, 1994, pp. 9-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The sex crimes qualifying for One Strike treatment appear in section 667.61, subdivision (c). Almost all of the enumerated crimes involve the use of force or fear <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)(l)-(6)), including forcible lewd conduct committed in violation of section 288, subdivision (b). Probation is prohibited for persons punishable under section 667.61 for any forcible sex offense specified therein. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">At issue here is the remaining One Strike offense described in section 667.61(c)(7). This provision covers <em>nonforcible </em>lewd conduct committed in \u201cviolation of subdivision (a) of Section 288, <em>unless the defendant qualifies for probation under subdivision (c) of Section 1203.066.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 667.61(c)(7), italics added; see <em>People v. Mancebo </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 735, 741 &amp; fn. 3 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 41 P.3 d 556].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Conviction of an enximerated offense alone does not trigger the One Strike law. The People also must plead and prove at least one aggravating circumstance specified in section 667.61, subdivision (d) or (e). <em>(Id., </em>subd. (i); see <em>People v. Mancebo, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 735, 743-744.) Many of these circumstances reflect the use of violent or predatory means that increase the victim\u2019s \u201cvulnerability.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Palmore </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1296 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 784].) Here, however, the jxxry sustained allegations under section 667.61, subdivision (e)(5), concerning conviction in the present case of a qualifying offense \u201cagainst more than one victim.\u201d The court cannot strike any finding duly made under section 667.61, subdivision (d) or (e). <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f); see <em>People v. Estrada </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1277 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 596].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">The length of the One Strike term depends upon the number and nature of applicable aggravating circumstances. In some cases, conviction of an enumerated offense compels an indeterminate term of 25 years to life in prison. (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (a).) Where, as here, only one circumstance under subdivision (e) of the statute is found, the requisite term is 15 years to life. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Moreover, persons convicted of sex crimes against multiple victims within the meaning of section 667.61, subdivision (e)(5) \u201care among the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>dangerous\u201d from a legislative standpoint. <em>(People </em>v. <em>DeSimone </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 693, 698 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 73].) The One Strike scheme therefore contemplates a separate life term for each victim attacked on each separate occasion. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 698-699; see \u00a7 667.61, subd. (g); <em>People v. Murphy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 153 &amp; fn. 7 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 387, 19 P.3d 1129], and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Section 667.61\u2019s intolerance toward child sexual abuse was foreshadowed by section 1203.066, which requires prison and otherwise limits probation in such cases. Section 1203.066 was enacted in 1981, along with numerous other reforms in the definition and punishment of such crimes. (See Stats. 1981, ch. 1064, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6, pp. 4093-4096 (the 1981 Act); <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 986; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 663, 670, fn. 7 [200 Cal.Rptr. 293, 677 P.2d 219].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>As pertinent here, section 1203.066, subdivision (a) states that \u201cprobation shall not be granted to\u201d persons convicted of violating section 288, the lewd conduct statute, under a wide range of circumstances. Such circumstances include commission of the crime against more than one victim. (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a)(7).)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Imprisonment is required, and probation ineligibility \u201cis absolute,\u201d for many section 288 violations described in section 1203.066, subdivision (a). <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 987.) However, as to some of the covered crimes, including those involving multiple victims under section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(7), the ban on probation does not apply under a \u201climited exception\u201d in subdivision (c) of the same statute. <em>{People v. Manners </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 826, 833 [225 Cal.Rptr. 798].) Consistent with the express terms of section 1203.066(c), probation is available as a sentencing choice \u201c[o]nly when a defendant can establish he or she meets <em>all </em>[five] criteria\u201d in this provision. <em>{People v. Groomes </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 84, 89 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 469] <em>{Groomes), </em>and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The present case involves the first factor, section 1203.066(c)(1). Distilled, it requires the defendant to prove, and the sentencing court to find, that he either is the victim\u2019s \u201crelative,\u201d or \u201cis a member of the victim\u2019s household who has lived in the victim\u2019s household.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The four other factors bearing on probation eligibility concern the victim\u2019s best interest with respect to probation; the defendant\u2019s amenability to treatment and reform; the victim\u2019s best interest with respect to any continuing household relationship or other contact with the defendant; and the threat of harm posed by probation. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c)(2)-(5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Here, as below, there is no dispute that unless defendant is a \u201crelative\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1), he is ineligible for probation and is subject to a mandatory One Strike sentence of 15 years to life, as imposed by the trial court. We proceed to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>At one extreme, defendant asks us to follow the Court of Appeal and to interpret \u201crelative\u201d as including <em>any </em>close emotional relationship perceived as familial by the molester and either the victim or other family members, even if the molester does not qualify as a \u201chousehold member\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1). At the other extreme, the Attorney General contends that because defendant was not related by blood or marriage to Ruth\u2019s granddaughters when the crimes occurred, he is not their \u201crelative\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1). The Attorney General insists that the disputed term has no other conceivable meaning, and that any inquiry beyond the plain meaning of the statutory language is pointless.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Neither approach is entirely correct. We disagree with the Attorney General that the underlying history sheds no light on the relevant statutory question, and that it should essentially be ignored. (E.g., <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 993-997.) However, we agree with the Attorney General that section 1203.066(c)(l)\u2019s \u201crelative\u201d category does not apply to someone like defendant who lacks any blood, marital, or other legal relationship with the victim, or even with other members of the victim\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Common sense suggests the Legislature would not have used the term \u201crelative\u201d in section 1203.066(c)(1) to define relationships along the amorphous lines urged by defendant. <em>None </em>of the numerous dictionaries and reference guides we have consulted use \u201crelative\u201d in this manner. In fact, these sources suggest that the word is commonly understood in terms of either a shared bloodline, or various blood-and-marriage formulas similar to what the Attorney General suggests. Thus, Ruth is a \u201crelative\u201d or \u201crelation\u201d of her granddaughters under such a traditional approach, but defendant is not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">As defendant suggests, more progressive dictionary definitions exist. However, they do not help his case. One English-language authority states, for instance, that \u201crelative[s]\u201d are linked not only by \u201ccommon origin\u201d or \u201cmarriage,\u201d but also by \u201ckinship.\u201d (American Heritage Diet. (4th ed. 2000) p. 1473, col. 1, italics added.) The same source describes \u201ckinship\u201d primarily in terms of <em>\u201cblood, marriage, or adoption,\u201d </em>and uses <em>\u201cfamily </em>relationship\u201d as an alternative secondary meaning. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 966, col. 2, italics added.) The word \u201cfamily,\u201d in turn, triggers several specific meanings, to wit, <em>\u201cparents and their </em>childrenpersons who share \u201clong-term commitments\u201d and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>live \u201cin the <em>same dwelling'; </em>all members of a \u201chousehold\u201d living <em>\u201cunder one roof'; </em>or persons sharing <em>\u201ccommon ancestry\" </em>or \u201clineage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 638, col. 2, italics added.) Defendant has never claimed that he and Ruth\u2019s granddaughters are bound along any of these lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Legal dictionaries offering expansive definitions of \u201crelative\u201d follow the same pattern, and similarly exclude defendant\u2019s relationship with the victims. One such source states that the word \u201crefers to relationship by <em>blood (consanguinity), marriage (affinity), </em>and, with increasing frequency, to relationship by <em>adoption.\" </em>(Mellinkoff\u2019s Dict, of American Legal Usage (1992) p. 282, italics added; see <em>id. </em>at p. 549.) Another prominent authority offers a similar range of meaning, using both \u201cblood or affinity\u201d, and \u201ckinsman\u201d to define \u201crelative.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999) p. 1291, col. 2.) The latter source links \u201caffinity\u201d to \u201c[a]ny familial relation resulting from a <em>marriage.\" (Id. </em>at p. 59, col. 1, italics added.) \u201cKinship\u201d requires <em>\u201cblood, marriage, or adoption.\" (Id. </em>at p. 875, col. 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Only a few Court of Appeal decisions have determined whether someone convicted of child sexual abuse is the victim\u2019s \u201crelative\u201d independent of any \u201chousehold member\u201d relationship under section 1203.066(c)(1). Consistent with the legislative history we discuss below, these cases state or imply that the statute applies only where imprisonment of the defendant would essentially destroy the victim\u2019s family or otherwise harm the victim. Hence, the Courts of Appeal have not defined \u201crelative\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1) any more broadly than the traditional dictionary meaning covering persons related by blood or marriage. <em>(Groomes, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 84, 92 [noting that \u201crelative\u201d ordinarily describes persons linked by blood and possibly marriage, but doubting that the concept applies \u201cno matter how attenuated the link\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 93 [declining to apply the statute to a defendant who was related by marriage to the victim\u2019s distant cousin, and who was a virtual stranger to the victim]; <em>People v. McLaughlin </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1037, 1039-1040 [250 Cal.Rptr. 382] [applying the statute where the defendant was the brother of the victim\u2019s mother and therefore was the victim\u2019s uncle]; <em>People v. Gutierrez </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 881, 882-884 [241 Cal.Rptr. 180] [applying the statute where the defendant and victim were first cousins because their mothers were sisters, and where the victim received child care from the defendant\u2019s mother in her home].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">When, in other statutes, the Legislature has given special status to quasi-familial relationships, it has done so by use of terms other than \u201crelative,\u201d often expressly distinguishing relatives from other forms of quasi-familial association. (E.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 1708.8, subd. (k) [defining actionable physical invasions of privacy against \u201cthe plaintiffs family or <em>significant others\" </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>(italics added)]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 972, subd. (e)(1) [limiting the scope of the spousal testimonial privilege in cases involving a spouse, \u201cchild, parent, relative, or <em>cohabitant' </em>(italics added)]; Fam. Code, \u00a7 6211, subd. (c) [applying domestic violence protections to persons in a <em>\u201cdating or engagement relationship\" </em>(italics added)]; see <em>id., </em>subds. (a) [same as to \u201cspouse\u201d], (b) [same as to \u201ccohabitant\u201d], (f) [same as to persons \u201crelated by consanguinity or affinity within the second degree\u201d]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (e)(1) [punishing battery committed against \u201ca spouse, a person with whom the defendant is cohabiting, <em>a person who is the parent of the defendant\u2019s child, </em>former spouse, <em>flane\u00e9, </em>or <em>fianc\u00e9e, </em>or a person with whom the defendant currently has, or has previously had, a dating or engagement relationship\u201d (italics added)]; Welf. &amp; Inst.

No such language appears in the statute. Instead, section 1203.066(c)(1) literally requires the defendant <em>himself to </em>be the victim\u2019s \u201crelative\u201d or to have shared the \u201cvictim\u2019s household.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Thus, mere use of the word \u201crelative\u201d does not show section 1203.066(c)(1) covers all emotional bonds, however remotely familial. Instead, given its commonly understood range of meaning, \u201crelative\u201d seems to target offenders whose personal relationship with the victim arises from a blood or legal tie. For reasons we now explain, both the legislative history and <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, confirm our understanding of the disputed term.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These materials contradict the view of the Court of Appeal and defendant that he is the victims\u2019 \u201crelative\u201d trader section 1203.066(c)(1), as incorporated into the One Strike law by section 667.61(c)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">In crafting legislation that ultimately produced section 1203.066 and other provisions of the 1981 Act, lawmakers relied on testimony from police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>officers, psychologists, prosecutors, victims, and community leaders concerned with child sexual abuse. The Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice (Assembly Committee) conducted a child molestation hearing on November 12, 1980 (Assembly Hearing). The Joint Committee for Revision of the Penal Code (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) (Joint Committee) held a child molestation hearing on December 16, 1980, and held more hearings on child molestation legislation on April 10, 1981, and April 24, 1981, respectively (Joint Hearings).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The Assembly and Joint Committees heard that mandatory imprisonment is the best means by which to deter and punish the sexual exploitation of children. According to witnesses, such crimes are typically committed by pedophiles who are \u201cfixated\u201d sexually on children, and who have no interest in sexual partners their own age. (Assembly Hearing, <em>supra, </em>p. 82; Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>p. 149.) Concern was expressed that because these offenders are adept at ingratiation and intimidation, their victims do not come forward, and their crimes go unpunished. A consensus emerged that attempts to treat and rehabilitate pedophiles usually fail, and that they habitually reoffend. (Assembly Hearing, <em>supra, </em>pp. 22, 46-47, 82-83; Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>pp. 149-151, 210-211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">However, the Assembly and Joint Committees were urged to consider the special problems posed by some incestuous or intrafamilial offenders. (Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>pp. 31, 151-153, 167-168.) Witnesses agreed that, unlike pedophiles who have an exclusive lifelong attraction to children, some adults with age-appropriate mates \u201cregress\u201d and molest young family members for situational and opportunistic reasons. (Assembly Hearing, <em>supra, </em>p. 83.) On the one hand, the testimony indicated that such molesters can successfully reform if they receive both punishment and treatment, particularly where the family supports recovery efforts. (Assembly Hearing, <em>supra, </em>pp. 72-75, 83-84, 103-104; Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>pp. 153, 173-177; Joint Hearing of Apr. 24, 1981, <em>supra, </em>pp. 33-34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">On the other hand, lawmakers were told that mandating prison, as opposed to offering jail time and probation, could do more harm than good in some intrafamilial cases. One stated reason was that young victims often feel intense guilt\u2014albeit irrationally so\u2014for implicating the molester, for thereby bringing shame on the family, and for possibly causing the household to dissolve. Witnesses further explained that loved ones who are emotionally and/or financially dependent on the molester may blame or even abandon the victim, particularly a mother risking loss of the molester as a life partner. (Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>pp. 72, 159-160; Joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Hearing of Apr. 10, 1981, <em>supra, </em>pp. 29, 31-32, 38, 47; Joint Hearing of Apr. 24, 1981, <em>supra, </em>pp. 8-9, 22, 59-60.) Thus, concern was expressed that mandatory imprisonment might deter victims and their families from reporting the crime, from cooperating with law enforcement officials, and from participating in counseling that could repair damaged relationships. (Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>pp. 156, 160-161, 164-165; Joint Hearing of Apr. 10, 1981, <em>supra, </em>pp. 32-33, 48-49; Joint Hearing of Apr. 24, 1981, <em>supra, </em>pp. 47, 60-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">During the hearings, both witnesses and lawmakers questioned whether mandatory imprisonment was appropriate for an incestuous father or stepfather. (Assembly Hearing, <em>supra, </em>pp. 71-72; Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>p. 163; Joint Hearing of Apr. 10, 1981, <em>supra, </em>p. 29; Joint Hearing of Apr. 24, 1981, <em>supra, </em>pp. 25, 30.) Examples of other intrafamilial molesters who might warrant special consideration were brothers and uncles (Joint Hearing of Apr. 10, 1981, <em>supra, </em>p. 30), grandfathers (Assembly Hearing, p. 93), and cousins (Joint Hearing of Apr. 24, 1981, <em>supra, </em>p. 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Finally, the Assembly and Joint Committees explored a so-called \u201cgray area\u201d in which the molester has a \u201cclose relationship [ ]\u201d with his young victim, but does not occupy a clearly incestuous or familial role. (Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>p. 162.) This theoretically limitless group was said to include teachers, babysitters, and doctors <em>(ibid.); </em>any next-door neighbor or boyfriend of the victim\u2019s mother who acts as a \u201cfather figure\u201d to the child (Joint Hearing of Apr. 10, 1981, <em>supra, </em>p. 51; Joint Hearing of Apr. 24, 1981, <em>supra, </em>p. 32); and <em>\u201csurrogate </em>grandparents[,] <em>mainly grandfathers\u201d </em>who have \u201cattached\u201d themselves to families with young children (Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>p. 168, italics added). While some witnesses favored treatment rather than prison in such cases, the notion of mandatory imprisonment for molesters in these more ambiguous categories did not trigger the same level of concern as it did with family or household offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Indeed, in drafting Senate Bill No. 586 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.), which enacted section 1203.066, the Legislature worked to limit the number of offenders who could avoid mandatory imprisonment based solely on a quasi-familial bond with the victim. The \u201chousehold member\u201d language ultimately included in section 1203.066(c)(1) was the focus of this concern. For instance, the broadest proposed formulation of such language appeared in the bill as passed by the Senate and sent to the Assembly. This version authorized probation for parents, relatives, and members of the victim\u2019s household; however, there was no express requirement that a nonrelative household member have lived with the victim. (Sen. Bill No. 586 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 4, 1981.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Once Senate Bill No. 586 arrived in the Assembly, various changes were proposed to further restrict the definition of a nonrelative household member. One amendment would have required such an offender to have lived in the victim\u2019s household for at least one continuous year while assuming the role of a parent. (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 586 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 10, 1981.) Another amendment would have retained the one-year residence requirement, and would have described eligible offenders as members of the victim\u2019s \u201cimmediate family,\u201d rather than as members of the same \u201chousehold.\u201d (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 586 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 25, 1981.) The bill passed the Assembly in the latter form (4 Assem. J. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) pp. 7829-7830), but was rejected by the Senate (4 Sen. J. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 6337). The final version of section 1203.066(c)(1) is the product of a conference committee compromise between the Senate and Assembly versions. (See 4 Sen. J. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) pp. 6612-6613; 5 Assem. J. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 8539.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">We analyzed these events in <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984. For reasons we now explain, <em>Jeffers </em>makes clear that it is the statute\u2019s nonrelative \u201chousehold member\u201d category\u2014not the \u201crelative\u201d category\u2014that defendant must but cannot satisfy in order to invoke section 1203.066(c)(1), and to escape One Strike sentencing trader section 667.61(c)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">In <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 988-990, the victim was a young girl who was being raised by her mother and grandmother. The victim and her family were close friends with the defendant, his wife, and his children. When the victim was between five and seven years old, the two families lived together on three separate occasions. The defendant became a father figure to the victim during this period, teaching her to bicycle and swim. After the two families shared living quarters for the last time, they agreed that the defendant would sometimes babysit the victim after school. It was during the latter period that the defendant molested the victim, who was then about eight years old. The girl\u2019s mother discovered the crimes, urged authorities to prosecute, and ended all contact with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">The defendant in <em>Jeffers </em>was convicted of several lewd conduct violations under section 288(a). The jury also found true allegations that he and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>victim engaged in \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d under section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(8). Such findings meant that the defendant was probation eligible only if he satisfied section 1203.066(c)(1). <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 988.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">In seeking probation, the defendant in <em>Jeffers </em>claimed that, as a surrogate father who had lived with the victim, he qualified as a \u201chousehold member\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1). The trial court denied the request, giving no indication as to how it interpreted or applied the statutory language. The judgment of imprisonment was subsequently affirmed on appeal. In so doing, the Court of Appeal essentially ignored the relationship between the defendant and victim before and during the time of the crimes, and focused on their estrangement at the time of sentencing. <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 990-991.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">This court rejected the Court of Appeal\u2019s approach and ordered resentencing. <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1000-1001.) In the process, our opinion in <em>Jeffers </em>construed section 1203.066(c)(1) and the \u201chousehold member\u201d clause as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\"><em>Jeffers </em>observed that in order to qualify as a \u201chousehold member,\u201d a defendant must meet two literal statutory requirements, namely, that he <em>\u201cis </em>a member of the victim\u2019s household,\u201d and that he <em>\u201chas lived </em>in the [same] household.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.066(c)(1), italics added.) We determined that the class of persons who are \u201cmember[s]\u201d of the household is broader than the class of persons who have \u201clived\u201d in the household; otherwise, the latter requirement would be surplusage. <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 992) <em>Jeffers </em>also found that the time at which the defendant lived in the household may precede the time at which he is a \u201chousehold member.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 993.) Based on the statutory history and purpose, the circumstances existing at the time of the crime (rather than at the time of sentencing) are of primary concern. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 997-998.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Critical here is the manner in which <em>Jeffers </em>characterized the substance of the \u201chousehold member\u201d relationship. \u201c \u2018[L]iving in the household\u2019 denotes physical presence under a common roof whereas being a \u2018member of the . . . household\u2019 denotes a quality of relationship. Being a household member refers not only to the relationships among members of a family, but also to <em>the bonds which may be found among unrelated persons adopting nontraditional and quasi-familial living arrangements. </em>Thus a member of the victim\u2019s household is one who has this quality of relationship with the victim.\u201d <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 992, italics added.) In other words, this court found that the disputed provision functioned as \u201c \u2018a <em>catch-all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>category\u2019 \u201d covering nonrelative members of the victim\u2019s \u201c <em>\u2018extended </em>family.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 991, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In light of <em>Jeffers, </em>and the history discussed both there and here, we draw the following conclusions about section 1203.066(c)(1). First, the statute applies to a molester claiming to be a surrogate family member only if he is \u201ca member of the victim\u2019s household who has lived in the victim\u2019s household.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Legislature has determined that except where <em>both </em>residential <em>and </em>emotional relationships exist, a nonrelative molester\u2014like a \u201csurrogate grandparent[ ]\u201d\u2014is not in the same position as a relative, such that mandatory imprisonment risks the same degree of disruption and harm. (Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>p. 168.) Thus, the statute preserves \u201cnontraditional and quasi-familial\u201d relationships <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, 992), but only insofar as the molester fits the definition of a \u201chousehold member\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Second, the existence of such a catchall category, imposing specific limitations on nonrelative \u201chousehold members,\u201d strongly suggests section 1203.066(c)(1) adheres to the boundaries that commonly define \u201crelatives.\u201d As we have seen, section 1203.066(c)(1) imposes no express residency requirement on the victim\u2019s \u201cnatural parent, adoptive parent, stepparent, [or] relative.\u201d (E.g., <em>People v. Gutierrez, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d 881, 883-884.) It would be unreasonable to infer that a defendant who is not a \u201chousehold member,\u201d because he has never lived with the victim, can nonetheless invoke the statute as a \u201crelative,\u201d even though the pair also shares no blood or legal relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">In particular, defendant\u2019s contrary construction would stretch the meaning of \u201crelative\u201d <em>beyond </em>the definition of \u201chousehold member.\u201d The former would effectively become the statutory catchall provision at the expense of the latter, contrary to both <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, and the clear legislative intent. Also, to find \u201crelative\u201d status under section 1203.066(c)(1) where no residential, blood, or legal relationship exists would risk benefiting molesters who have no personal relationship with their victims. It is inconceivable the Legislature intended that result. (Cf. <em>Groomes, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 84, 92-93 [finding that a defendant who did not know the victim before the molestation was not a \u201crelative\u201d under \u00a7 1203.066(c)(1), even though the defendant was married to the victim\u2019s distant blood relative].) Thus, we find that \u201crelative\u201d carries no broader range of meaning in section 1203.066(c)(1) than in common usage, and that the term does not describe molesters sharing only \u201cquasi-familial\u201d bonds with their victims. <em>(Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 992.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>These conclusions are consistent with themes expressed by the Legislature when drafting section 667.61, the One Strike law, under which defendant was sentenced. As first introduced in the Senate, the measure would have amended section 288 to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (LWOP) on persons convicted of substantial sexual conduct with a child under age 14. The same version of the bill also proposed repealing section 1203.066, and otherwise prohibiting probation for anyone convicted of violating section 288. (Sen. Bill No. 26X (1993-1994 1st Ex. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 2, 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 11, 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">However, subsequent versions of the same bill abandoned the LWOP proposal in favor of indeterminate life terms of the sort ultimately included in section 667.61. Lawmakers also decided that section 1203.066 should be retained, and that no meaningful change in subdivision (c)(1) would be made. (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 26X (1993-1994 1st Ex. Sess.) Aug. 22, 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3.) The latter decision apparently stemmed from continuing concern that long mandatory prison terms would \u201cimpede the prosecution\u201d of intrafamilial molesters by making victims and loved ones reluctant to report the crimes and to cooperate with authorities. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 26X (1993-1994 1st Ex. Sess.) as amended May 4, 1994, p. 12.) The statutory analysis in <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, was summarized and approved in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">These events further support our conclusion that defendant is not a \u201crelative\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1). It seems unlikely that lawmakers, in deciding to forgo both LWOP and an outright ban on probation, would have conditioned One Strike sentencing on section 1203.066(c)(1) if the latter statute applied in the manner urged by defendant. To interpret \u201crelative\u201d as a sizeable One Strike loophole benefiting almost any molester who betrays a position of trust is contrary to the purpose of both sentencing schemes. As noted, section 667.61 and section 1203.066 each assume that convicted child molesters are dangerous and generally deserving of harsh punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Moreover, nothing in the history of section 667.61 suggests that courts have too narrowly applied section 1203.066(c)(1). Indeed, lawmakers approved <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 984, which held that section 1203.066(c)(1) covers only those quasi-familial relationships involving a shared residential history. Defendant\u2019s \u201crelative\u201d claim essentially ignores the limits of the statute and the purpose of the \u201chousehold member\u201d provision as described in <em>Jeffers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Defendant counters by arguing that his expansive view of the term \u201crelative\u201d in section 1203.066(c)(1) is necessary to avoid absurd results. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Otherwise, he contends, sexual offenders who never knew their young victims could avoid One Strike sentencing under section 667.61(c)(7) and could invoke section 1203.066(c)(1), based solely on fortuitous blood or legal ties. Defendant claims such a scenario would not further the statutory aims of minimizing emotional trauma to victims, salvaging familial and quasi-familial relationships, and offering the chance for treatment to molesters most likely to reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Preliminarily, leniency is not guaranteed for a \u201crelative\u201d or nonrelative \u201chousehold member\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1). Such defendants are eligible for probation only if \u201call\u201d of the findings required by section 1203.066(c) are made. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Even then, the trial court \u201cis not precluded from sentencing the defendant to jail or <em>prison.\u201d (Id., </em>subd. (c)(5), italics added.) Existing case law discourages lenient sentencing treatment for molesters who lack a \u201cclose emotional relationship\u201d with the child, and who are only \u201cremotely related ... by blood or marriage.\u201d <em>(Groomes, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 84, 93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">In any event, fixing the range of punishment for crime rests on policy determinations that the legislative branch is specially empowered to make. <em>(Manduley v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 537, 552 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 168, 41 P.3d 3].) Lawmakers are entitled to sanction criminal conduct more or less severely based on the surrounding circumstances, including the dangerousness of the offender, the vulnerability of the victim, and the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Thompson </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 871, 876-884 [252 Cal.Rptr. 698] [applying statutory ban on probation to a defendant who befriended a child in order to sexually abuse him]; <em>People v. Acevedo </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 196, 204-205 [212 Cal.Rptr. 328] [applying statutory ban on probation for forcible rape against a nonspouse].)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Here, the Legislature could reasonably encourage young victims and other loved ones to break their silence concerning intrafamilial or household abuse by not requiring all offenders to be imprisoned for the rest of their natural lives. The pressures that might otherwise cause a victim to shun disclosure\u2014 damage to the family name, loss of the family breadwinner, and disruption in living arrangements and marital relationships\u2014are either missing or muted where the defendant is neither a \u201crelative\u201d nor a \u201chousehold member\u201d under section 1203.066(c)(1). In addition, surrogate or quasi-relatives are in a unique position to \u201cattachf ]\u201d themselves to families with young children for an improper sexual purpose. (Joint Hearing of Dec. 16, 1980, <em>supra, </em>p. 168.) Lawmakers could conclude that such an individual is more likely to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>dangerous <em>because </em>no blood, marital, or other legal connection to the victim exists. Thus, we see nothing irrational in the legislative decision to exclude defendant from section 1203.066(c)(1), and to subject him to One Strike sentencing under section 667.61, notwithstanding any grandfatherly bond with the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Defendant\u2019s final claim is that failure to apply section 1203.066(c)(1) to all close quasi-familial relationships violates his equal protection rights under the federal and state Constitutions. Here, as in the Court of Appeal (see <em>ante, </em>in. 4), defendant theorizes that providing special treatment for \u201crelative[sj\u201d and \u201chousehold members,\u201d while denying such treatment to close emotional relationships in general, does not adequately serve the purposes behind section 1203.066(c). For example, defense counsel emphasized in oral argument before this court that marriage was merely \u201ca piece of paper,\u201d and that defendant\u2019s eligibility for probation under this statute cannot constitutionally rest on whether he is related by marriage to the victims through their grandmother, Ruth P.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Broadly stated, equal protection of the laws means \u201cthat no person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in like circumstances in their lives, liberty and property and in their pursuit of happiness.\u201d <em>(People v. Romo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 189, 196 [121 Cal.Rptr. 111, 534 P.2d 1015].) In determining whether such a deprivation has occurred, the court\u2019s ultimate task is to examine the validity of the underlying purpose, and the extent to which the disputed statutory classification promotes such purpose. (E.g., <em>Romo, </em>at pp. 196-197 [finding ample justification for disparate sentences authorized under two criminal assault statutes]; see <em>Weber v. City Council </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 950, 958-959 [109 Cal.Rptr. 553, 513 P.2d 601] [describing the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny based on the classification or interest undergoing constitutional challenge].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">As a foundational matter, however, all meritorious equal protection claims require a showing that \u201cthe state has adopted a classification that affects two or more <em>similarly situated </em>groups in an unequal manner.\u201d <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 530 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549], original italics.) In other words, \u201cneither the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States nor the California Constitution [citations] precludes classification by the Legislature or requires uniform operation of the law [for] persons who are different . . . \u2018with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Gary W. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 296, 303 [96 Cal.Rptr. <em>1, </em>486 P.2d 1201]; accord, <em>Dobbert </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 282, 301 [97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>S.Ct. 2290, 2302, 53 L.Ed.2d 344] [capital defendant sentenced under a revised statute is not similarly situated to defendants whose death sentences were commuted when the predecessor statute was ruled unconstitutional]; <em>Tigner v. Texas </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 141, 145-147 [60 S.Ct. 879, 881-882, 84 L.Ed. 1124, 130 A.L.R. 1321] [retailers subject to criminal punishment under antitrust law are not similarly situated to farmers and ranchers, who are exempt under the same provisions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Defendant fails to consider that he is not similarly situated for sentencing purposes to the relatives and nonrelative household members covered by section 1203.066(c)(1). As we have seen, there is evidence of a unique dynamic between underage victims and the class of sexual offenders targeted by the statute, such that special measures are needed to prompt the reporting of such crimes in the first place. It also appears the features that define these statutory relationships make such offenders more amenable to treatment and less likely to reoffend once conviction has occurred. Hence, compared to someone who lacks the necessary statutory connection and who may have developed a quasi-familial relationship for perverse sexual purposes, the family and household offenders listed in section 1203.066(c)(1) are potentially less dangerous to society at large. Of course, the requisite blood, legal, or residential relationship not only gives rise to the kind of close familial bond the statute seeks to preserve, but also offers some tangible proof that it exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">In light of these differences, defendant is not similarly situated to, and need not receive the same sentencing treatment as, a \u201cnatural parent, adoptive parent, stepparent, relative, or . . . member of the victim\u2019s household who has lived in the victim\u2019s household.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.066(c)(1); accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d 871, 881-882 [rejecting equal protection challenge to \u00a7 1203.066, subd.

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">The Court of Appeal erred in finding that defendant \u201cqualifie[d] for probation under subdivision (c) of Section 1203.066\u201d within the meaning of section 667.61(c)(7).
