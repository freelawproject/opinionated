On the facts of this case, we agree with the Court of Appeal that the so-called good faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply. Because the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Appeal found the evidence admissible and affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction under a legal theory that the Attorney General concedes is erroneous, we reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On March 27, 1996, while working out of the Bakersfield Police Department as part of the Kern County Narcotics Enforcement Team, Officer Joseph Mullins received a telephone call from an employee of a Bakersfield motel. The motel employee advised Mullins of \u201ca high level of phone and foot traffic\u201d involving room 221, which was registered to defendant. This information was significant to Mullins because he knew from experience that narcotics dealers commonly conduct transactions at rented motel rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Mullins checked \u201cdepartment records,\u201d which indicated that defendant had several prior arrests and/or convictions involving narcotics. Mullins also checked \u201cthe local criminal justice information system,\u201d which indicated that defendant was required to register as a sex offender. Finally, Mullins \u201cchecked the parole book,\u201d or \u201cparole listing,\u201d \u201cin the Bakersfield Police Department,\u201d which indicated that defendant was on parole. According to Mullins, the \u201cparole book\u201d was \u201cprovided to the Police Department every month.\u201d The \u201clisting\u201d Mullins checked on March 27 was dated either March 6 or March 16. Mullins then conveyed all of this information to Diane Mora, a state parole officer from the California Department of Corrections (CDC), and showed her \u201cthe parole list.\u201d Mora told Mullins \u201cthe list indicated [that defendant] was on active parole,\u201d and she \u201cdirected\u201d Mullins \u201cto make a search\u201d of defendant\u2019s motel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Mora and Mullins then went to the motel \u201cto conduct a parole search,\u201d accompanied by Detective Hood of the Kern County Sheriffs Department and Officer Silvius of the Bakersfield Police Department. At the motel, Mullins confirmed from motel records that room 221 was registered to defendant and that there were \u201cseveral phone calls in and out of that motel room.\u201d Hood knocked on the door of room 221. Defendant asked who was there. Hood replied, \u201c[I]t\u2019s Bill.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cBill who, fuck you.\u201d Hood replied, \u201c[ijt\u2019s the police, open the door, please.\u201d Neither Hood nor anyone else announced their purpose. Defendant then opened the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">When the door opened, Mullins saw \u201ca large sheath knife\u201d on defendant\u2019s belt, a hypodermic syringe on a dresser in the room (which he later determined was empty), and a woman named Kathleen Moye. Accompanied by Mullins and Silvius, Mora and Hood entered the room and announced their intention to conduct a parole search. Defendant did not invite them in or give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>them permission to search. He informed them he had been discharged from parole in June 1995, and that they could not do a parole search. He directed their attention to a certificate of discharge from the CDC, which correctly showed that he had, in fact, been discharged from parole nine months earlier, on June 29, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Because \u201cthe parole listing indicated [defendant] was on parole,\u201d Mullins did not consider the certificate to be \u201cconclusive of [defendant\u2019s] parole status.\u201d Mullins asked Mora to use the telephone in the motel office to check defendant\u2019s parole status and he escorted defendant to a walkway outside of the room.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mullins felt that Mora was the proper person for this task because she had been a parole officer for several years and was \u201cbetter acquainted with the workings of the system and how to confirm through the [CDC] with their [szc] records in Sacramento the true status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">While Mullins and defendant were outside, Silvius, who had remained in the room with Hood and Moye, advised Mullins that Moye appeared to be under the influence of narcotics. Consistent with this information, Moye said that she had \u201cused this afternoon,\u201d and she identified a briefcase in the room that she said contained \u201ca speed pipe.\u201d Mullins then announced that he had enough information to obtain a search warrant and asked defendant to consent to a search \u201cto save us the time and trouble of obtaining a search warrant.\u201d According to Mullins, defendant eventually admitted the briefcase contained methamphetamine and consented to a search of both the room and the briefcase. After defendant and Mullins reentered the room, Silvius broke the briefcase\u2019s combination lock, opened the briefcase, and inside found narcotics, syringes, spoons and a set of scales. Defendant was then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Defendant was subsequently charged by information with possession of a controlled substance for purpose of sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11378) and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11364).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant moved to suppress the evidence discovered in his motel room, arguing that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In opposition, the prosecution argued that the search was valid for numerous reasons, primarily consent. Alternatively, the prosecution argued that even if the search was not valid, because the police \u201cacted in good faith reliance on Parole\u2019s representations,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>evidence should not be excluded. After argument, the trial court denied the suppression motion by a minute order that stated no reasons. A jury subsequently convicted defendant of possessing a controlled substance for sale and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the initial entry into the motel room was unconstitutional because the officers did not have a search warrant, defendant was not on parole, and he did not consent to the entry. It also rejected the Attorney General\u2019s argument that even though the search was constitutionally invalid, the exclusionary rule does not apply because the police relied in good faith on the information that defendant was on parole. The court reasoned that the inaccurate information regarding defendant\u2019s parole status was \u201cattributable to the police executing the search,\u201d because Mora was an \u201cadjunct of the law enforcement team\u201d in that she \u201cactively participated in the search\u201d and, as a state parole officer, is a \u201cpeace officer\u201d under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal affirmed the denial of the suppression motion, reasoning that the unconstitutional entry did not taint the police\u2019s subsequent reasonable actions that actually led to discovery of the evidence. According to the court, the police \u201cwere authorized to \u2018freeze\u2019 the motel room\u201d after the illegal entry while Mora investigated defendant\u2019s parole status, they obtained \u201cadditional information\u201d from their interactions with defendant and Mora during the freeze that \u201camounted to probable cause\u201d to obtain a search warrant, \u201cwere authorized to secure the room to prevent destruction of evidence until\u201d they obtained a warrant, and received consent to search the room and the briefcase before they could take steps to obtain a warrant. Thus, the court concluded, the evidence \u201cwas not the fruit of an unlawful parole search, but instead of prudent lawful police work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Both defendant and the People petitioned for rehearing. In the People\u2019s petition, the Attorney General repeatedly conceded that the police acted unconstitutionally in entering the motel room. However, he argued that the court erred in holding that the police\u2019s good faith reliance on the information regarding defendant\u2019s parole status did not render the exclusionary rule inapplicable. Defendant, in his petition, argued in part that the court\u2019s \u201cfreezing\u201d theory was both procedurally improper\u2014because the Attorney General had never raised it\u2014and substantively incorrect. The court denied the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Defendant and the People petitioned for review. We granted both petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Federal constitutional standards generally govern our review of claims that evidence is inadmissible because it was obtained during an unlawful search. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d); <em>People v. Woods </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 668, 674 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 88, 981 P.2d 1019].) The Attorney General concedes that under those standards, the initial entry into defendant\u2019s motel room \u201cwas unconstitutional\u201d because there was no search warrant, no valid parole condition in effect, and no other applicable exception to the warrant requirement to justify the warrantless search.  The Attorney General also concedes that the evidence recovered during the unconstitutional search is not admissible under the Court of Appeal\u2019s \u201cfreezing\u201d theory. He explains that because \u201ca Fourth Amendment violation occurred when the officers entered [the] motel room,\u201d \u201cit is irrelevant\u201d that the observations they made after the illegal entry \u201cduring the freezing period\u201d may have established probable cause to support issuance of a search warrant. The Attorney General\u2019s explanation is consistent with existing law. (See <em>Murray </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 533, 540 [108 S.Ct. 2529, 2535, 101 L.Ed.2d 472] [observations made after unlawful warrantless entry \u201ccannot be used to establish probable cause\u201d for a search warrant]; <em>Burrows v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 238, 251 [118 Cal.Rptr. 166, 529 P.2d 590] [consent to search given \u201cimmediately following an illegal entry or search\u201d is invalid because it \u201cis inseparable from the unlawful conduct\u201d]; <em>People v. Roberts (1956) 47 </em>Cal.2d 374, 377 [303 P.2d 721] [search warrant based on observations made after unlawful entry is invalid].) Accordingly, we need not and do not examine either of these questions further.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\"> However, the Attorney General argues that the evidence is admissible under what is commonly known as the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, which the United States Supreme Court announced and applied in a trilogy of cases, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 897 [104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677] <em>(Leon), Illinois v. Krull </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 340, 355 [107 S.Ct. 1160, 1170, 94 L.Ed.2d 364] <em>(Krull), </em>and <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 1 [115 S.Ct. 1185, 131 L.Ed.2d 34] <em>(Evans)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em> In these cases, the high court explained that the exclusionary rule does not, and cannot, cure the constitutional violation, which is fully accomplished by the illegal search itself. <em>(Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 10 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1190-1191]; <em>Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S at p. 906 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 3411-3412].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Rather, the exclusionary rule \u201coperates as a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard against future violations of Fourth Amendment rights through the rule\u2019s general deterrent effect. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 10 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1191].) Thus, its \u201c\u2018prime purpose\u2019\u201d is to \u201c \u2018effectuate\u2019 \u201d the Fourth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against unreasonable searches or seizures by \u201cdeter[ring] future unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>(Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 347 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1165-1166].) Moreover, because the exclusionary rule is a \u201cremedial device,\u201d its application is \u201crestricted to those situations in which its remedial purpose is effectively advanced.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, application of the exclusionary rule \u201c \u2018is unwarranted\u2019 \u201d where it would \u201c \u2018not result in appreciable deterrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 11 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1191].)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In <em>Leon, </em>the high court held that where police officers act in objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant that is issued by a detached and neutral magistrate but is later found to be invalid for lack of probable cause, the deterrent effect of exclusion is insufficient to warrant the exclusionary rule\u2019s application. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 900 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3409].) In reaching this conclusion, the court considered exclusion\u2019s potential effect first on judicial officers who issue warrants, and then on police officers who execute warrants and on the policies of their departments. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 916-918 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 3417-3418].) Regarding the former, the court concluded that for three reasons, the potential behavioral effect on judicial officers is insufficient to justify exclusion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 916 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3417].) \u201cFirst, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates. Second, there exists no evidence suggesting that judges and magistrates are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment or that lawlessness among these actors requires application of the extreme sanction of exclusion, [f] Third, and most important, [there is] no basis ... for believing that exclusion . . . will have a significant deterrent effect on the issuing judge or magistrate. Many of the factors that indicate that the exclusionary rule cannot provide an effective \u2018special\u2019 or \u2018general\u2019 deterrent for individual offending law enforcement officers apply as well to judges or magistrates. And, to the extent that the rule is thought to operate as a \u2018systemic\u2019 deterrent on a wider audience, it clearly can have no such effect on individuals empowered to issue search warrants. Judges and magistrates are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team; as neutral judicial officers, they have no stake in the outcome of particular criminal prosecutions. . . . Imposition of the exclusionary sanction is not necessary meaningfully to inform [them] of their errors, and . . . admitting evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant while at the same time declaring that the warrant was somehow defective will [not] in any way reduce [their] professional incentives to comply with the Fourth Amendment, encourage them to repeat their mistakes, or lead to the granting of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>colorable warrant requests.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 916-917 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 3417-3418], ins. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Regarding exclusion\u2019s potential effect on individual law enforcement officers and the policies of their departments, the high court explained generally that the deterrence rationale for the exclusionary rule \u201c \u2018necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 919 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 3418-3419].) Thus, exclusion is proper \u201c \u2018only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Given these underlying principles, the court concluded that exclusion will not further the exclusionary rule\u2019s ends where \u201can officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope. In most such cases, there is no police illegality and thus nothing to deter. It is the magistrate\u2019s responsibility to determine whether the officer\u2019s allegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. In the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination or his judgment that the form of the warrant is technically sufficient. \u2018[0]nce the warrant issues, there is literally nothing more the policeman can do in seeking to comply with the law.\u2019 [Citation.] Penalizing the officer for the magistrate\u2019s error, rather than his own, cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 920-921 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3419], fns. omitted.) Thus, \u201cthe marginal or nonexistent benefits produced by suppressing evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant cannot justify the substantial costs of exclusion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 922 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">However, suppression remains appropriate where an officer\u2019s reliance on a search warrant was not \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d i.e., the officer had \u201cno reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant was properly issued.\u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at pp. 922-923 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3420].) \u201c \u2018Grounding the [good faith exception] in objective reasonableness . . . retains the value of the exclusionary rule as an incentive for the law enforcement profession as a whole to conduct themselves in accord with the Fourth Amendment.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 919, fn. 20 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3419].) Thus, in determining whether the good faith exception applies, \u201c[i]t is necessary to consider the objective reasonableness, not only of the officers who eventually executed a warrant, but also of the officers who originally obtained it or who provided information material to the probable-cause determination.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 923, fn. 24 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3420].) For example, the court cautioned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201c[njothing\u201d in <em>Leon </em>\u201csuggests\u201d that an officer may use \u201ca \u2018bare bones\u2019 affidavit\u201d to obtain a warrant \u201cand then rely on colleagues who are ignorant of the circumstances under which the warrant was obtained to conduct the search. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, the good faith exception does not apply \u201cwhere the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his judicial role,\u201d where the affidavit was \u201c \u2018so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\u2019 \u201d or where the warrant was \u201cso facially <em>deficient\u2014i. e., </em>in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized\u2014that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 923 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3421].) Thus, courts must determine \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d whether the circumstances of an invalid search pursuant to a warrant require the exclusionary rule\u2019s application. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 918 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3418].) \u201c[T]he government has the burden of establishing \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 reliance [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Camarella </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 592, 596 [286 Cal.Rptr. 780, 818 P.2d 63] <em>(Camarella).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Three years after <em>Leon, </em>the high court in <em>Krull </em>used a similar analysis in finding the good faith exception applicable where \u201cofficers act in objectively reasonable reliance upon a <em>statute </em>authorizing warrantless administrative searches,\u201d and the statute is later \u201cfound to violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 342 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1163].) The court first reasoned that excluding evidence obtained under these circumstances \u201cwould have as little deterrent effect on the officer\u2019s actions\u201d as would excluding evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 349 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1167].) \u201cUnless a statute is clearly unconstitutional, an officer cannot be expected to question the judgment of the legislature that passed the law. If the statute is subsequently declared unconstitutional, excluding evidence obtained pursuant to it prior to such a judicial declaration will not deter future Fourth Amendment violations by an officer who has simply fulfilled his responsibility to enforce the statute as written. . . . \u2018Penalizing the officer for the [legislature\u2019s] error, rather than his own, cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 349-350 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1167].)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Nor, the court reasoned in <em>Krull, </em>is exclusion justified by its potential effect on legislators. <em>(Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 350 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1167].) First, \u201clegislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of the [exclusionary] rule,\u201d which is \u201caimed at deterring police misconduct.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Second, there is no \u201cevidence to suggest that legislators \u2018are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment.\u2019 [Citation.] Although legislators are not \u2018neutral judicial officers,\u2019 as are judges and magistrates [citation], neither are they \u2018adjuncts to the law enforcement team.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 350-351 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>[107 S.Ct. at p. 1167].) In performing their duty to establish a criminal justice system, \u201clegislators\u2019 deliberations of necessity are significantly different from the hurried judgment of a law enforcement officer \u2018engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 351 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1167].) Moreover, they must \u201ctake an oath to support the Federal Constitution\u201d and courts must presume that they act constitutionally. <em>(Ibid) </em>Finally, there is \u201cno reason to believe that applying the exclusionary rule will have\u201d a significant deterrent effect on legislators. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 352 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1168].) \u201cLegislators enact statutes for broad, programmatic purposes, not for the purpose of procuring evidence in particular criminal investigations. Thus, it is logical to assume that the greatest deterrent to the enactment of unconstitutional statutes ... is the power of the courts to invalidate such statutes. Invalidating a statute informs the legislature of its constitutional error, affects the admissibility of all evidence obtained subsequent to the constitutional ruling, and often results in the legislature\u2019s enacting a modified and constitutional version of the statute, as happened in this very case. There is nothing to indicate that applying the exclusionary rule to evidence seized pursuant to the statute prior to the declaration of its invalidity will act as a significant, additional deterrent.\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>In any event, any \u201cincremental deterrent\u201d effect of exclusion in this context, when \u201cweighed against the \u2018substantial social costs\u2019 \u201d of exclusion, is insufficient to justify the exclusionary rule\u2019s application. <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">As in <em>Leon, </em>the court in <em>Krull </em>stressed that the good faith exception does not apply if the officer does not act reasonably, and that \u201cthe standard of reasonableness . . . is an objective one; [it] does not turn on the subjective good faith of individual officers. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 355 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1170].) Thus, \u201ca law enforcement officer [cannot] be said to have acted in good-faith reliance upon a statute if its provisions are such that a reasonable officer should have known that the statute was unconstitutional. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>Nor can \u201c[a] statute . . . support objectively reasonable reliance if, in passing the statute, the legislature wholly abandoned its responsibility to enact constitutional laws.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">More recently, in <em>Evans, </em>the high court discussed the good faith exception as applied to court employees. There, upon entering the defendant\u2019s name into a computer terminal during a traffic stop, a police officer received notice of an outstanding arrest warrant. During the ensuing arrest, the officer found marijuana in the defendant\u2019s car. The police then reported the arrest to the justice court, which advised that the arrest warrant had been quashed 17 days before the arrest. The defendant later moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the good faith exception did not apply because police error, rather than judicial error, caused the invalid arrest. <em>(Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>at p. 4 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1187-1188].) Testimony at the suppression hearing indicated that the error in the police computer may have been caused by a court clerk in failing to inform the sheriffs office that the warrant had been quashed, rather than by a records clerk in the sheriffs office. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 5 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1188].) The trial court made no factual finding on this issue, holding that exclusion was required whether the error was caused by the court clerk or by the police. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Arizona Supreme Court agreed with the trial court and \u201crejected\u201d a \u201c \u2018distinction . . . between clerical errors committed by law enforcement personnel and similar mistakes by court employees.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 6 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1189].)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The high court in <em>Evans </em>held that the refusal of the Arizona courts to distinguish between errors of the police and errors of the court was \u201ccontrary to the reasoning\u201d of <em>Leon </em>and <em>Krull. (Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 14 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1193].) The court explained that under those cases, \u201c[i]f court employees were responsible for the erroneous computer record, the exclusion of evidence at trial would not sufficiently deter future errors so as to warrant such a severe sanction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under these circumstances, exclusion \u201ccould not be expected to alter the behavior of the arresting officer,\u201d because he \u201c \u2018[was] bound to arrest\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018would [have been] derelict in his duty if he\u2019 \u201d had not. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 15 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1193].) Nor, the high court reasoned, could exclusion be justified by its effect on court clerks. \u201cFirst, ... the exclusionary rule was historically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct, not mistakes by court employees. [Citations.] Second, [the defendant] offer[ed] no evidence that court employees are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment or that lawlessness among these actors requires application of the extreme sanction of exclusion. [Citations.] To the contrary, the Chief Clerk of the Justice Court testified at the suppression hearing that this type of error occurred once every three or four years. [Citation.] [f] Finally, and most important, there is no basis for believing that application of the exclusionary rule in these circumstances will have a significant effect on court employees responsible for informing the police that a warrant has been quashed. Because court clerks are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime [citation], they have no stake in the outcome of particular criminal prosecutions. [Citations.] The threat of exclusion of evidence could not be expected to deter such individuals from failing to inform police officials that a warrant had been quashed. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 14-15 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1193].) Because the Arizona courts ordered suppression without determining whether police or court employees were responsible for the computer error, the high court therefore reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 16 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1194].)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The Attorney General correctly contends that under these cases, application of the exclusionary rule depends on the source of the error or misconduct that led to the unconstitutional search and whether, in light of that source, the deterrent effect of exclusion is sufficient to warrant that sanction. (See <em>Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 360, in. 17 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1172-1173] [whether exclusionary rule applies \u201cin a particular context depends significantly upon the actors who are making the relevant decision that the rule is designed to influence\u201d].) As to the source of the error here, the Attorney General states that the \u201csparse record\u201d leaves \u201cthe precise duties and responsibilities of the person or persons responsible\u201d for the error \u201cunknown.\u201d However, he argues the evidence \u201cstrongly suggests that the source of the erroneous information was the Department of Corrections.\u201d In his initial briefing in the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General focused mainly on Mora, arguing that \u201cit makes no sense to apply the exclusionary rule . . . where the negligence or mistake was due to a parole agent\u2019s mistaken direction to police to conduct a search.\u201d As we have noted, the Court of Appeal disagreed, finding the good faith exception inapplicable because Mora was \u201can adjunct of the law enforcement team.\u201d The Attorney General now attributes the error to an \u201canonymous employee\u201d of the CDC, \u201cpresumably an unsworn data entry clerk\u201d who was \u201cresponsible for maintaining and updating the [parole] list.\u201d In making this argument, the Attorney General cites Mullins\u2019s testimony and several Penal Code provisions relating to the CDC\u2019s authority and duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We agree with the Attorney General that the \u201csparse record\u201d is inconclusive regarding the source of the error in this case. The testimony the Attorney General cites is of little help. Mullins testified that the \u201cparole book\u201d he checked was \u201cprovided to the Police Department every month.\u201d However, Mullins did not indicate who provided the parole book; his vague statement does not point to the CDC as the source any more than it points to some police agency other than the Bakersfield Police Department. Mullins also testified that Mora told him \u201cthe list indicated [that defendant] was on active parole, and directed [him] to make a search of [defendant\u2019s] motel room,\u201d and that he believed Mora was the proper person to determine defendant\u2019s parole status because she was \u201cbetter acquainted with the workings of the system.\u201d Again, this testimony does not identify the source of the parole listing or even exclude some other police agency as that source.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The statutes the Attorney General cites are of marginal help at best. Section 3056, which states merely that \u201c[prisoners on parole shall remain under the legal custody of\u2019 the CDC, provides little support for the conclusion that the CDC prepared the parole listing Mora and Mullins reviewed. Section 3058.5 requires the CDC to \u201cprovide within 10 days, upon request, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>to the chief of police of a city or the sheriff of the county, information available to the department. . . concerning persons then on parole who are or may be residing or temporarily domiciled in that city or county.\u201d However, the record contains no evidence that the Bakersfield Police Department made an information request pursuant to section 3058.5 or that the parole listing Mullins and Mora reviewed was prepared and provided by the CDC in response to such a request. Section 3003 requires the CDC to provide \u201clocal law enforcement agencies\u201d with available information \u201cregarding a paroled inmate who is released in their jurisdictions.\u201d However, section 3003 did not impose this requirement statewide until after the search in this case, so it is irrelevant to determining the source of the error here. (See Stats. 1997, ch. 680, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In any event, even if the record suggested that the CDC prepared the parole list, it does not indicate who was responsible for the parole list\u2019s error regarding defendant\u2019s parole status or how the error occurred. The record contains no evidence suggesting that a data entry clerk, rather than a parole officer, prepared the parole list, or that the error in the list was caused by the person who prepared it, rather than by a parole officer who failed to update defendant\u2019s file or forward the information to the appropriate person. The Attorney General recognized this ambiguity in his rehearing petition in the Court of Appeal, asserting that the source of the error here was \u201cthe anonymous parole agent (or, more likely, the unsworn data entry clerk) who failed to update the parole book sent to police departments.\u201d Indeed, the record does not even foreclose the possibility that Mora herself prepared the list, or that she failed to update the records in June 1995 when defendant was discharged from parole and then simply forgot about his discharge when she ordered and conducted the search of his motel room nine months later in March 1996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, we agree with the Attorney General that \u201cthe sparse record\u201d here fails to show \u201cthe precise duties and responsibilities of the person or persons responsible\u201d for the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">However, we do not agree with the Attorney General that defendant bore the burden of producing evidence on this question and, therefore, he is responsible for the record\u2019s inadequacy. Where, as here, the prosecution invokes the good faith exception, the government has \u201cthe burden ... to prove that exclusion of the evidence is not necessary because of [that] exception.\u201d <em>(People v. Turnage </em>(1994) 162 Ill.2d 299 [205 Ill.Dec. 118, 642 N.E.2d 1235, 1241] <em>(Turnage)) </em>Thus, \u201cthe government has the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>establishing \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 reliance\u201d under <em>Leon. (Camarella, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 596.) Establishing that the source of the error acted objectively reasonably is part of that burden. (See <em>Turnage, supra, </em>642 N.E.2d at p. 1241 [state failed to satisfy its burden where it relied only on arresting officer\u2019s good faith and offered no evidence that those who sought invalid warrant or signaled its vitality acted objectively reasonably]; cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Hecox </em>(1993) 35 Mass.App. 277 [619 N.E.2d 339, 341-344] (H<em>ecox) </em>[government failed to satisfy its burden where it offered no evidence that police were not at fault in failing to correct their records]; <em>Ott v. State </em>(1992) 325 Md. 206, 223, fn. 5 [600 A.2d 111, 119] [government failed to satisfy its burden where it offered no evidence of the length of time reasonably necessary to update information in sheriffs computer, which depends in part on who had responsibility for keeping information current].)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The Attorney General errs in asserting that in <em>Leon, Krull, </em>and <em>Evans, </em>the high court \u201crepeatedly hinted that it is the defendant who bears the burden of production\u201d regarding the source of the error and his or her duties. The discussion the Attorney General cites from those cases relates not to whether a defendant has offered evidence to identify the source of the error, but to whether the record contains evidence that the <em>identified </em>source of the error is inclined to subvert or ignore the Fourth Amendment. <em>(Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 14-15 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1193] [defendant \u201coffers no evidence that court employees are [so] inclined\u201d]; <em>Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 351 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1168] [\u201cThere is no evidence suggesting,\u201d and \u201cwe are given no basis for believing that legislators are [so] inclined\u201d]; <em>Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 916 [104 S.Ct at p. 3417] [\u201cthere exists no evidence suggesting that judges and magistrates are [so] inclined\u201d].) Moreover, in establishing the good faith exception, the high court stated in <em>Leon </em>that \u201c[w]hen officers have acted pursuant to a warrant, <em>the prosecution should ordinarily be able to establish objective good faith </em>without a substantial expenditure of judicial time.\u201d <em>{Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 924 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3421], italics added.) Numerous courts, including this one, have cited this statement from <em>Leon </em>in holding that the government has the burden to prove facts warranting application of the good faith exception. <em>(Camarella, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 596; <em>U.S. v. Corral-Corral </em>(10th Cir. 1990) 899 F.2d 927, 932; <em>United States v. Maggitt </em>(5th Cir. 1985) 778 F.2d 1029, 1034; <em>U.S. v. Conner </em>(N.D. Iowa 1996) 948 F.Supp. 821, 852; <em>U.S. v. Turner </em>(D.Vt. 1989) 713 F.Supp. 714, 721, fn. 6; <em>Hoay </em>v. <em>State </em>(2001) 75 Ark.App. 103 [55 S.W.3d 782, 785]; <em>Turnage, supra, </em>642 N.E.2d at p. 1241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Our conclusion regarding the burden of proof is also consistent with the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]. There, the court held in part that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>a person indicates before or during a custodial interrogation that he or she wants to consult with an attorney before speaking to police, then \u201cthe interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 474 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1628]; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 444-445, 473-474 [86 S.Ct. at pp. 1612-1613, 1627-1628].) The court also held that \u201c[i]f the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 475 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1628].) The court explained that this burden \u201cis rightly on [the] shoulders\u201d of the government because it \u201cis responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which the interrogation takes place and has the only means of making available corroborated evidence of warnings given during incommunicado interrogation . . . .\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 590, 604 [95 S.Ct. 2254, 2262, 45 L.Ed.2d 416] [prosecution bears \u201cburden of showing\u201d that evidence is not the fruit of illegal arrest or search and is therefore admissible].) Similarly, in this case, because the government is responsible for establishing the circumstances under which the error and the warrantless search occurred and is in a much better position to obtain evidence regarding those circumstances, the burden rightly falls on its shoulders. (Cf. <em>State v. Mance </em>(1996) 62 Wash.App. 539 [918 P.2d 527, 530] [state has \u201cburden of proving\u201d that police\u2019s delay in failing to correct their records \u201cwas reasonable,\u201d because the relevant facts are peculiarly within their knowledge and control].) We therefore disagree with the Attorney General\u2019s assertion that defendant bore the burden of producing evidence to identify the source of the error and his or her duties. The prosecution bore the burden of proof on this point, and it failed to sustain that burden. (Cf. <em>United States v. Hoffman </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 607 F.2d 280, 284 [government does not satisfy its burden of justifying warrantless search \u201cby leading a court to speculate about what \u2018may\u2019 or \u2018might\u2019 have been the circumstances surrounding the warrantless search\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"> In any event, we conclude that the exclusionary rule applies in this case whether the source of the error was Mora, as the Attorney General contended in the Court of Appeal, or a CDC data entry clerk, as the Attorney General now speculates. As to Mora, we begin, as <em>Leon, Krull, </em>and <em>Evans </em>direct, by considering exclusion\u2019s potential effect on the behavior of parole agents. According to the high court, the \u201cmost important\u201d question is whether there is a basis to believe that exclusion under the circumstances here will have a significant effect on parole agents. <em>(Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 15 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1193-1194]; <em>Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 916 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3417].) Under the high court\u2019s analysis, a key consideration in answering this question is whether parole agents are \u201cadjuncts to the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>enforcement team.\u201d <em>(Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 15 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1193-1194]; <em>Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at pp. 350-351 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1167-1168]; <em>Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 916 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3417].)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">On the record here, we agree with the Court of Appeal that Mora was, in fact, an adjunct to the law enforcement team. Like the Court of Appeal, we first find it significant that Mora, as a CDC parole officer, is \u201ca peace officerQ\u201d under California law. (\u00a7 830.5.) Her authority as a peace officer extends to \u201cthe rendering of mutual aid to any other law enforcement agency.\u201d (\u00a7 830.5, subd. (a)(5).) Thus, she often works hand in hand with police, as she did in this case. Her authority also \u201cextend[s]\u201d to parole conditions and transportation of any state parolee, escapes by any state inmates or wards, and \u201cviolations of any penal provisions of law which are discovered while performing\u201d her \u201cusual or authorized duties.\u201d (\u00a7 830.5, subd. (a)(4).) She may \u201ccarry firearms\u201d under specified terms and conditions (\u00a7 830.5), and may make arrests with or (under specified circumstances) without a warrant (\u00a7 836). Under section 3067, a California parolee must agree \u201cto be subject to search or seizure by a parole officer or other peace officer at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause.\u201d (\u00a7 3067, subd. (a); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a72511, subd. (b).) According to the relevant legislative history, the Legislature passed section 3067 \u201cto provide for search of parolees by <em>law enforcement officers </em>without cause\u201d and to \u201cgive . . . <em>local law enforcement officers </em>the tools they need to adequately supervise . . . parolees.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Sen. Com. on Crim. Proc., Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2284 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) June 25, 1996, p. 4, italics added.) Under state regulation, Mora must \u201cseize []\u201d any \u201ccontraband or evidence of illegal activity\u201d she discovers while \u201cconducting\u201d these searches and, under specified circumstances, may \u201cdelegate[]\u201d her \u201cauthority to search or arrest a parolee ... to another law enforcement agency.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3701.1, subds. (a), (d).) Before exercising her authority, she was required to \u201csatisfactorily complete an introductory course of training prescribed by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training.\u201d (\u00a7 832.) Finally, \u201cwhile engaged in the performance of [her] duties . . . and for the purpose of carrying out the primary function of [her] employment,\u201d Mora\u2019s authority as a peace officer \u201cextends to any place in the state.\u201d (\u00a7 830.5.) While transporting prisoners or apprehending escaped prisoners, she is a \u201cpeace officer\u201d even when acting outside of California. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3291, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Both this court and the United States Supreme Court have looked to these provisions in considering the nature of California parole officers. Citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>section 830.5, we have explained that a parole officer\u2019s \u201cstatus ... as a peace officer\u201d is one of the \u201csources\u201d of a parole officer\u2019s \u201cauthority to restrain [a] parolee.\u201d <em>(In re Law </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 21, 24, fn. 2 [109 Cal.Rptr. 573, 513 P.2d 621].) We have also explained that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of section 830.5 is \u201cto authorize the named persons to exercise the statutory powers of a peace officer.\u201d <em>(Dyas v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 628, 635-636, fn. 3 [114 Cal.Rptr. 114, 522 P.2d 674].) In <em>Cabell v. Chavez-Salido </em>(1982) 454 U.S. 432 [102 S.Ct. 735, 70 L.Ed.2d 677], the high court reviewed some of these California statutes and found that \u201cthe unifying character of all categories of peace officers,\u201d including \u201cparole . . . officers\u201d under section 830.5, \u201cis their law enforcement function.\u201d The court also reasoned that \u201c[t]he general law enforcement character of all California \u2018peace officers\u2019 is underscored by the fact that all have the power to make arrests, \u00a7 836, and all receive a course of training in the exercise of their respective arrest powers and in the use of firearms. \u00a7 832.\u201d <em>(Cabell, supra, </em>454 U.S. at pp. 443-444 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 741-742].) Thus, based on California statutes, the high court concluded that persons classified under California law as peace officers, including parole agents, serve a \u201claw enforcement function\u201d and have a \u201cgeneral law enforcement character.\u201d <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Like the Court of Appeal, we also find it significant that Mora took an active role in the search in this case. As we have explained, Mullins did not make the decision to search; Mora authorized the search and directed Mullins to carry it out after he presented her with the parole list and the information he had received. Mora then went to defendant\u2019s motel room with police to conduct a search for evidence of narcotics activity. She and the police officers were acting with a unity of purpose: investigating crime. Thus, as relevant to applying the exclusionary rule, Mora bears little resemblance to the neutral and detached judicial officers and court clerks in <em>Leon </em>and <em>Evans. </em>Nor does she resemble the legislators in <em>Krull, </em>who, the high court found, do not act \u201cfor the purpose of procuring evidence in particular criminal investigations.\u201d <em>(Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at pp. 352 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1168].) Unlike those actors, Mora is an adjunct to the law enforcement team when she, as a peace officer under California law, conducts or participates in a search, and the threat of exclusion can be expected to alter her behavior. (Cf. <em>Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at pp. 914, 923 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 3416, 3421] [good faith exception does not apply where \u201cthe issuing magistrate wholly abandon[s] his judicial role\u201d and becomes \u201c \u2018adjunct law enforcement officer\u2019 \u201d by acting as a member of search party that is essentially a police operation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The Attorney General asserts that this conclusion is inconsistent with the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole </em>v. <em>Scott </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>(1998) 524 U.S. 357 [118 S.Ct. 2014, 141 L.Ed.2d 344] <em>(Scott). </em>There, the court held that the exclusionary rule does not apply in parole revocation hearings where police officers or parole officers conduct an illegal search. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 362-369 [118 S.Ct. at pp. 2019-2023].) Specifically, the Attorney General quotes the following passage in the court\u2019s opinion: \u201cParole agents, in contrast to police officers, are not \u2018engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime,\u2019 [citation]; instead, their primary concern is whether their parolees should remain free on parole. Thus, their relationship with parolees is more supervisory than adversarial. [Citation.] It is thus \u2018unfair to assume that the parole officer bears hostility against the parolee that destroys his neutrality; realistically the failure of the parolee is in a sense a failure for his supervising officer.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 368 [118 S.Ct. at p. 2022].)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Unlike the Attorney General, we find that <em>Scott </em>supports our conclusion. Immediately after the passage the Attorney General quotes, the high court observed that \u201cin some instances parole officers may act like police officers and seek to uncover evidence of illegal activity . . . .\u201d <em>(Scott, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 369 [118 S.Ct. at p. 2022].) As we have explained, the record shows that Mora acted here in precisely that capacity. The high court then stated in <em>Scott </em>that when parole officers \u201cact like police officers and seek to uncover evidence of illegal activity, they (like police officers) are undoubtedly aware that any unconstitutionally seized evidence that could lead to an indictment <em>could be suppressed in a criminal trial.\u201d (Scott, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 369 [118 S.Ct. at p. 2022], italics added.) Accordingly, the court continued, any evidence the parole officers in <em>Scott </em>uncovered during an illegal search <em>\u201ccould have been inadmissible at trial if [the </em>defendant] <em>had been criminally prosecuted.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.) This statement necessarily implies the court\u2019s conclusion that as to parole agents who conduct searches, exclusion <em>in a criminal trial </em>would alter their behavior\u2014i.e., deter them\u2014 enough to justify applying the exclusionary rule <em>in a criminal trial, </em>otherwise, under <em>Leon, Evans, </em>and <em>Krull, </em>which predated <em>Scott, </em>exclusion would be improper even in a criminal trial. Thus, <em>Scott </em>directly supports the conclusion that if Mora made the error that led to the illegal search of defendant\u2019s motel room, the exclusionary rule applies in this <em>criminal </em>proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Indeed, our research indicates that both before and after <em>Evans, </em>courts have uniformly held that the exclusionary rule applies in a criminal proceeding where a parole officer obtains evidence during an unconstitutional search. For example, the federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals recently applied the exclusionary rule where parole officers, assisted by police whom the parole officers had invited along, conducted an unconstitutional search. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Payne </em>(6th Cir. 1999) 181 F.3d 781, 784 <em>(Payne).) </em>Regarding the exclusionary rule\u2019s deterrence objective, the court explained that the \u201czone of interest\u201d of the parole officers who \u201cprimarily\u201d conducted the search was \u201cdistinct from, but overlapped] with, an interest in enforcing the drug laws. Although the parole officer is interested in the parolee\u2019s rehabilitation, the officer is also charged with monitoring compliance with various restrictions, including restrictions on the use of drugs. As in this case, parole officers often work closely with the police. Exempting evidence illegally obtained by a parole officer from the exclusionary rule would greatly increase the temptation to use the parole officer\u2019s broad authority to circumvent the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 788.) Both this court and others have similarly applied the exclusionary rule in criminal proceedings where a parole officer conducts an unconstitutional search. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Stevens) </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 858, 860-861 [117 Cal.Rptr. 433, 528 P.2d 41]; <em>Commonwealth v. Gayle </em>(1996) [673 A.2d 927, 929-932]; <em>State ex rel. Corgan v. King </em>(1994) 1994 Okla. Crim. 7 [868 P.2d 743, 747-748]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliott </em>(Ky.Ct.App. 1986) 714 S.W.2d 494; <em>People </em>v. <em>Candelaria </em>(1978) 63 A.D.2d 85 [406 N.Y.S.2d 783, 786].) We have not found, and the Attorney General has not cited, a single case holding to the contrary. Thus, exclusion is required here if we focus on Mora as the source of the error, as the Attorney General did in his briefing in the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The discussion in <em>Payne </em>suggests another distinction between this case and <em>Leon, Evans, </em>and <em>Krull, </em>in terms of the deterrent effect of applying the exclusionary rule. In <em>Leon </em>and <em>Evans, </em>the court reasoned that exclusion for errors by judges, magistrates, and court clerks cannot be expected to alter the behavior of police officers, who are in no position to question court directives. <em>(Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 15-16 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1193-1194]; <em>Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at pp. 920-921 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3419].) As <em>Leon </em>more fully explains, an officer ordinarily \u201ccannot be expected to question the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination or his judgment that the form of the warrant is technically sufficient. \u2018[0]nce the warrant issues, there is literally nothing more the policeman can do in seeking to comply with the law.\u2019 [Citation.] Penalizing the officer for the magistrate\u2019s error, rather than his own, cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 921 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3419].) <em>La.Krull, </em>the court similarly reasoned that because arresting officers \u201ccannot be expected to question the judgment of [a] legislature that passe[s] [a] law\u201d authorizing warrantless searches, exclusion where an officer relies on such a statute cannot be expected to alter the officer\u2019s behavior. <em>(Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 350 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1167].)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">By contrast, in this case, Mullins could have done more than simply rely on Mora\u2019s review of the parole list. As the high court has explained, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Fourth Amendment \u201cwas in large part a reaction to the general warrants and warrantless searches that had so alienated the colonists and had helped speed the movement for independence.\u201d <em>(Chimel v. California </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 752, 761 [89 S.Ct. 2034, 2039, 23 L.Ed.2d 685].) Thus, a warrantless entry of the home is the \u201c \u2018chief evil\u2019 \u201d to which the Fourth Amendment is directed. <em>(Welsh v. Wisconsin </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 740, 748 [104 S.Ct. 2091, 2096-2097, 80 L.Ed.2d 732].) Nevertheless, Mora, who may not have even been defendant\u2019s parole agent (see in. 4, <em>ante), </em>apparently did nothing more than look at the parole list and confirm that it said what Mullins already knew it said: that defendant was on parole. Essentially, Mora \u201c \u2018serve[d] merely as a rubber stamp\u2019 \u201d for Mullins. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 914 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3416].) Although Mullins and Mora were not in the field dealing with an unfolding situation when Mullins first received the information about defendant and consulted Mora, neither made any further attempt to verify the information on the parole list\u2014by, for example, reviewing defendant\u2019s case file or checking the CDC\u2019s Sacramento <em>records\u2014before </em>going to the motel and entering defendant\u2019s room to conduct a search knowing they had no warrant. Thus, exclusion here is more likely to alter police behavior than it was in the high court cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As <em>Leon </em>explained, \u201c \u2018refusing to admit evidence gained\u2019 \u201d from \u201c \u2018negligent^ conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right\u2019 \u201d will \u201c \u2018hope[fully] instill in those particular investigating officers, or in their future counterparts, a greater degree of care toward the rights of an accused.\u2019 \u201d (Leon, supra, 468 U.S. at p. 919 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3418]; see also <em>Evans, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 17 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1194] (cone. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.) [police must \u201chave acted reasonably in their reliance on the recordkeeping system itself\u201d (italics omitted.)].) On the other hand, as the Sixth Circuit reasoned in <em>Payne, </em>declining to apply the exclusionary rule \u201cwould greatly increase the temptation to use the parole officer\u2019s broad authority to circumvent the Fourth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Payne, supra, </em>181 F.3d at p. 788.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Our conclusion regarding the exclusionary rule\u2019s applicability in this case is the same even if we assume, as the Attorney General now speculates, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the error was the fault of a CDC data entry clerk responsible for maintaining and updating the parole list. Again, the most important consideration is whether there is a basis to believe that exclusion under these circumstances will have a significant effect on such clerks, which turns in part on whether they are adjuncts to the law enforcement team. As a matter of logic, CDC clerks responsible for preparing or updating the parole list are adjuncts to the law enforcement. As we have explained, in California, all parolees are subject by law to warrantless search by parole officers. (\u00a7 3067; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2511, subd. (b).) As we have also explained, in carrying out such searches, parole officers from the CDC are exercising a law enforcement function and are part of the law enforcement team. Logically, then, employees <em>of the same department </em>who support parole officers in carrying out this law enforcement function\u2014by preparing and maintaining parole lists indicating who is on active parole and subject to warrantless search\u2014must be considered to be adjuncts to the law enforcement team.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Moreover, by statute, CDC employees responsible for parole records play a similar role in supporting the work of other California law enforcement officers\u2014including police\u2014who are also authorized by law (\u00a7 3067) to conduct warrantless searches of parolees. Since 1981, section 3058.5 has required the CDC to provide information about parolees to city police chiefs and county sheriffs on request. (See Stats. 1981, ch. 1111, \u00a7 5, p. 4340.) By 1986, the CDC was reporting that law enforcement agencies in most cities and in all counties were routinely requesting and receiving information under this statute. (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 3110 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 14, 1986, p. 2; Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 3110 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In 1997, the Legislature enacted section 3003, which greatly expanded the CDC\u2019s duty to provide parole information to police and other law enforcement agencies. (See \u00a7 3003, subd. (e); Stats. 1997, ch. 680, \u00a7 2.) That statute directs the CDC to \u201crelease [] ... to local law enforcement agencies\u201d available information, including date of parole and discharge, \u201cregarding a paroled inmate who is released in their jurisdictions.\u201d (\u00a7 3003, subd. (e)(1); Stats. 1997, ch. 680, \u00a7 2.) It also specifies that the released information \u201cshall come from the statewide parolee data base,\u201d \u201cshall be provided utilizing a computer-to-computer transfer in a format usable by a desktop computer system,\u201d and \u201cshall be continually available to local law enforcement agencies upon request.\u201d (\u00a7 3003, subd. (e)(2), (3); Stats. 1997, ch. 680, \u00a7 2.) The statute also provides that the CDC \u201cshall be . . . primarily responsible for, and shall have control over, the program, resources, and staff implementing\u201d the required computer transfer system, which is known as \u201cthe Law Enforcement Automated Data System (LEADS).\u201d (\u00a7 3003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>subd. (k); Stats. 1997, ch. 680, \u00a7 2.) In an uncodified section of the 1997 legislation that enacted these requirements, the Legislature declared its \u201cintent ... to establish a statewide Law Enforcement Automated Data System (LEADS) to provide up-to-date information regarding parolees to local law enforcement agencies . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1997, ch. 680, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The Legislature passed section 3003 as the culmination of a pilot project for computer transfer of parole information from the CDC to local law enforcement agencies in San Bernardino County. (See Stats. 1997, ch. 680, \u00a7 1; Stats. 1994, ch. 904, \u00a7 1, p. 4552; Stats. 1993-1994, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 56, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, pp. 8787, 8791.) In 1995, when the Legislature considered expanding the project, it was told that the information the CDC was providing through the computer link was proving to be a valuable and useful law enforcement tool for investigating and fighting crime. (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 752 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 12, 1995; Sen. Com on Crim. Proc., Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 752 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) July 11, 1995, p. 4; Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 752 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 4, 1995, pp. 1-2.) Two years later, when the project was made statewide, the CDC told the Legislature, among other things, that LEADS is \u201cvaluable to detectives\u201d because it \u201callows [them] to search parolee information if a parolee is a prime target in criminal investigations, as they historically have been.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Public Safety, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 1275 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) July 12, 1997, p. 5.) The Legislature was also told that LEADS \u201cenhances law enforcement\u2019s ability to carry out the mandate of . . . earlier legislation [giving] priority to the safety of the community . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In passing these statutes, the Legislature has thus made clear its view that CDC employees who provide police with parole information are integral parts of the law enforcement team, and it has acted to recognize, formalize, and facilitate that relationship. These considerations reinforce our conclusion that CDC employees who prepare and maintain parole lists intended for distribution to police and other law enforcement officers\u2014which indicate who is on parole and who may be searched without a warrant\u2014are adjuncts to the law enforcement team and that exclusion\u2019s deterrent effect is sufficient to justify applying the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Our conclusion is also supported by our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 541 [194 Cal.Rptr. 454, 668 P.2d 761] <em>(Ramirez). </em>There, we found the exclusionary rule applicable where a police officer arrested and searched the defendant based on a check with \u201cthe police computer system\u201d that showed an outstanding arrest warrant, and an inquiry after the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>showed that the warrant \u201chad been recalled some six months earlier . . . <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 543-544.) In reaching this conclusion, we \u201creject[ed] the People\u2019s argument that [the arresting officer\u2019s] good faith reliance on information communicated to him through \u2018official channels\u2019 should validate the arrest and search.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 544.) After reviewing numerous federal and state authorities, we concluded: \u201c[L]aw enforcement officials are collectively responsible for keeping [\u201c \u2018official\u2019 \u201d] channels free of outdated, incomplete, and inaccurate warrant information. That the police now rely on elaborate computerized data processing systems to catalogue and dispatch incriminating information enhances rather than diminishes that responsibility, ffl] . . . [Thus], [t]he test, under these circumstances, is not merely the good faith of the individual officer in the field, but the good faith of law enforcement agencies of which he is a part.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 552.) When \u201c \u2018the police ... are at fault in permitting the records to remain uncorrected,\u2019 \u201d they \u201c \u2018may not rely upon incorrect or incomplete information . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 545-546.) We then found that exclusion was required because the arrest that led to the search was \u201cmade on the basis of data [that] a law enforcement agency knew or should have known were in error because of inadequate or negligent record-keeping.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 552.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><em>Ramirez </em>fully supports application of the exclusionary rule in the case now before us. Under <em>Ramirez, </em>if, as the Attorney General contends, a CDC employee other than Mora\u2014either a parole officer or a clerk\u2014was responsible for the error here, then defendant\u2019s parole discharge nine months before the search was within the CDC\u2019s collective knowledge, and we cannot conclude that Mora acted in objective good faith in authorizing and conducting the warrantless search of defendant\u2019s motel room. Similarly, because, as we have found on the record here, the relevant CDC employees were adjuncts to the law enforcement team, we cannot conclude that the police officers acted in objective good faith in assisting Mora in that warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The Attorney General argues that \u201csubsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court have seriously undermined <em>[Ramirez\u2019s] </em>validity.\u201d Noting that <em>Evans </em>\u201cplaced great weight on the actual source of the error,\u201d he asserts that <em>Ramirez </em>\u201cis suspect\u201d because it did not focus on this question and did not consider who was responsible for updating the records or notifying the police about recalled warrants; instead, it \u201csimply assumed,\u201d without \u201carticulating] any [supporting] facts or evidence,\u201d that the police alone were responsible for the error. \u201cIndeed,\u201d the Attorney General speculates, \u201csince\u201d <em>Ramirez </em>involved \u201ca recalled bench warrant,\u201d \u201cthere exists at least the possibility that court personnel may have played some role contributing to the inaccuracy of the police database.\u201d The Attorney General also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>asserts that under <em>Evans, </em>\u201cpolice reliance upon erroneous information may establish a Fourth Amendment violation,\u201d but \u201cdoes not require strict application of the exclusionary rule,\u201d and that <em>Ramirez </em>is \u201cflaw[ed]\u201d in that \u201cit failed to appreciate this admittedly fine distinction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Unlike the Attorney General, we find nothing in <em>Evans </em>or in any other high court decision that undermines <em>Ramirez\u2019s </em>application in the case now before us. As the Attorney General correctly suggests, <em>Ramirez </em>would be inconsistent with <em>Evans </em>if <em>Ramirez </em>held that exclusion is required where a judge or a court employee commits an error. However, there is no basis for the Attorney General\u2019s speculation that <em>Ramirez </em>involved such an error, and our opinion there indicates otherwise. Analytically, we concluded in <em>Ramirez </em>that in determining an arrest\u2019s validity, we must \u201cexamine^ the relationship between the conduct of the arresting officer and the underlying source of the probable cause determination.\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 551.) We therefore disapproved a California Court of Appeal decision to the extent it \u201cassert[ed] that courts must look only to the perceptions of the officer in the field, rather than trace his [or her] probable cause determination to its source in the law enforcement system . . . .\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 550.) We also concluded that the governing test required inquiry into \u201cthe good faith of law enforcement agencies of which [the arresting officer] is a part.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 552.) Given this analytical framework, we undoubtedly would have noted that a judge or court employee, rather than a law enforcement agency, made the error had the record contained any evidence to support that conclusion. Instead, we first specifically noted that the error appeared in \u201cthe police computer system.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 543.) We then applied the exclusionary rule notwithstanding the good faith of the arresting officer, because he acted on data \u201ca law enforcement agency knew or should have known were in error because of inadequate or negligent record-keeping.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 552.) We also explained that the defendant\u2019s arrest was invalid because \u201c \u2018the police may not rely upon incorrect or incomplete information when they are at fault in permitting the records to remain uncorrected.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 545-546.) Thus, the Attorney General\u2019s speculation about the source of the error in <em>Ramirez </em>is groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In any event, even were the Attorney General correct that we merely assumed in <em>Ramirez </em>the police caused the error, the principles we applied there based on that understanding are fully consistent with <em>Leon, Krull </em>and <em>Evans. </em> As we have explained, those cases teach that for purposes of the exclusionary rule, we must distinguish between errors of law enforcement and those of judges, court employees, and legislators. In <em>Ramirez, </em>we drew precisely this distinction in rejecting the People\u2019s reliance on <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 31, 37-38 [99 S.Ct. 2627, 2632-2633, 61 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>L.Ed.2d 343], which affirmed the validity of an arrest under an ordinance later declared unconstitutional. We found <em>DeFillippo </em>\u201cdistinguishable,\u201d explaining that an arrest for violating an ordinance later found unconstitutional is \u201cfundamentally different from\u201d an arrest \u201cmade in reliance on the erroneous police communication that a warrant [is] outstanding.\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 546.) In the former case, we reasoned, there is \u201cno <em>police </em>misconduct to deter,\u201d because the officer has a duty to enforce the ordinance until it is stricken. <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Thus, we explained, \u201cpenalizing the police for legislative errors\u201d would not \u201cadvance[]\u201d the exclusionary rule\u2019s goal of deterring \u201claw enforcement misconduct. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The high court cases also teach that \u201cthe standard of reasonableness\u201d for determining an officer\u2019s good faith \u201cis an objective one\u201d\u2014whether \u201c \u2018the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 919 &amp; fn. 20 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3419]; see also <em>Krull, supra, </em>480 U.S. at pp. 348-349 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1166-1167].) <em>Leon </em>further explains that in determining whether this standard was met, \u201c[i]t is necessary to consider the objective reasonableness, not only of the officers who eventually executed a warrant, but also of the officers who originally obtained it or who provided information material to the probable-cause determination.\u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 923, fn. 24 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3420].) For example, the court cautioned, \u201c[n]othing\u201d in <em>Leon </em>\u201csuggests\u201d that an officer may use \u201ca \u2018bare bones\u2019 affidavit\u201d to obtain a warrant \u201cand then rely on colleagues who are ignorant of the circumstances under which the warrant was obtained to conduct the search. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Again, <em>Ramirez </em>is in accord, reasoning: \u201c[A]n officer in the field may rely on information communicated to him by fellow officers to establish probable cause to arrest. [Citation.] However, if we impute to the arresting officer the collective knowledge of law enforcement agencies for the purpose of establishing probable cause, we must also charge him with knowledge of information exonerating a suspect formerly wanted in connection with a crime.\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Finally, <em>Leon </em>teaches that the exclusionary rule should not be applied where exclusion cannot be expected to serve \u201c \u2018as an incentive for the law enforcement profession <em>as a whole </em>to conduct themselves in accord with the Fourth Amendment.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 919, fn. 20 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3419], italics added.) Again, <em>Ramirez </em>is consistent; we there concluded that if police are collectively at fault for an inaccurate record that results in an unconstitutional search, then exclusion \u201cis consistent with the deterrence goal of the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>p. 547.) \u201c[F]ocus[ing] not on the actions of the arresting officer but on the conduct of law enforcement generally,\u201d we explained that \u201c[suppressing the fruits of an arrest made on a recalled warrant will deter further misuse of the computerized criminal information systems and foster more diligent maintenance of accurate and current records.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, we disagree with the Attorney General that the high court cases undermine <em>Ramirez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s suggestion, the California appellate decisions he discusses are consistent with our conclusion. All of them recognize that notwithstanding the high court cases, <em>Ramirez </em>remains good law insofar as it holds that the good faith exception does not apply where law enforcement is collectively at fault for an inaccurate record that results in an unconstitutional search. (See <em>In re Arron C. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1365, 1369, 1372 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 852] [citing <em>Ramirez </em>in reaffirming that the exclusionary rule applies \u201cwhere a police officer conducts a search on the basis of faulty information from police sources,\u201d and stating that a juvenile probation officer is an adjunct to the law enforcement team where he \u201cbecomes enmeshed in law enforcement activities\u201d by \u201cactively participat[ing] in a search\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Downing </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1641, 1654, fn. 19 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 176] <em>[Ramirez </em>is \u201cstill precedential and not conflicting with <em>Leon\u201d]; Miranda </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1628, 1636 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 858] <em>[Ramirez </em>was not \u201ceroded\u201d by <em>Leon </em>and \u201cremains precedential\u201d after <em>Leon </em>and <em>Krull </em>where \u201cerror [is] generated by the police department itself\u2019]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1985) 162 Cal.App.3d 8, 20 [208 Cal.Rptr. 353] [same result required by <em>Ramirez </em>and by <em>Leon, </em>which \u201crecognized] ... the \u2018collective knowledge of law enforcement\u2019 rationale\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Our conclusion is also in accord with numerous decisions from other jurisdictions holding that Ramirez's collective knowledge principle is fully consistent with both the exclusionary rule\u2019s deterrence objective and the high court\u2019s decisions on the good faith exception. In <em>State v. White </em>(Fla. 1995) 660 So.2d 664, 667-668, the Florida Supreme Court applied the exclusionary rule where the police\u2019s failure to update their records led to the defendant\u2019s arrest on a warrant that had already been served. The court held that the good faith exception was \u201cinapplicable\u201d under these circumstances because \u201cit was within the collective knowledge of the sheriffs office that the warrant was void\u201d and \u201cthe arresting officers are charged with knowledge that they had no authority to arrest the defendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 668.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>court reasoned: \u201cThis type of police negligence fits squarely within the class of governmental action that the exclusionary rule was designed to deter .... Suppression of evidence seized pursuant to police computer errors will encourage law enforcement agencies to diligently maintain accurate and current computer records.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 667, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In <em>State v. Gough </em>(1986) 35 Ohio App.3d 81 [519 N.E.2d 842, 846], an Ohio appellate court found the good faith exception inapplicable where police executed an arrest warrant issued on the basis of information that was incorrect due to \u201cnegligence, inaccuracies, or inadequacies in record-keeping procedure\u201d by \u201claw enforcement personnel at [a] jail.\u201d The court explained that in <em>Leon, </em>the high court recognized and affirmed the collective knowledge principle <em>Ramirez </em>applied. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 845.) The court also explained that where that principle applies, \u201cthere is police conduct to deter.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Finally, the court reasoned that failure to apply the exclusionary rule \u201cwould . . . encourage careless, perhaps deliberately neglectful, record keeping.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In <em>State v. Mayorga </em>(Tex.App. 1996) 938 S.W.2d 81, 83, a Texas Court of Appeals considered how the collective knowledge principle would apply where a police officer arrested the defendant based on incorrect radio information from a police dispatcher that there were outstanding arrest warrants for the defendant. After reviewing <em>Evans, </em>the court concluded that \u201cthe <em>Leon </em>analytical framework does not support a categorical exception to the federal exclusionary rule for mistakes made by police dispatchers. Unlike court clerks or judges, police dispatchers are in continuous radio contact with the officers on duty. They are adjuncts to the law enforcement team with a stake in the outcome of criminal prosecution. They directly provide the warrant information upon which an officer in the field depends to make an arrest; their misconduct or carelessness can be significantly affected by the threat of exclusion. Because we recognize the exclusionary rule as an important tool to help prevent impingement on Fourth Amendment rights, we decline to create another exception to the rule for errors caused by police personnel.\u201d <em>(Mayorga, </em>at pp. 83-84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Finally, in <em>Turnage, </em>the Illinois Supreme Court found the good faith exception inapplicable despite the subjective good faith of the officer who arrested the defendant on a duplicative and invalid warrant. <em>(Turnage, supra, </em>642 N.E.2d at p. 1241.) The court explained that \u201c[t]he appropriate focus\u201d under <em>Leon </em>\u201cis not on the conduct of the arresting officer, but on the conduct of those who obtained the warrant and informed the arresting officer of its continued vitality.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court further explained that the invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>warrant had been procured by \u201cthe State\u2019s Attorney,\u201d who is a \u201cmember[] of the law enforcement team . . . <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1240.) The court then found the good faith exception inapplicable because the government offered no evidence to show that \u201cthe State\u2019s Attorney who sought issuance of the warrant or the sheriffs department that signaled its vitality harbored an objectively reasonable belief that the warrant was valid.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1241.) The court reasoned that suppression on these facts \u201cwould further the deterrent purposes of the exclusionary rule. Specifically, exclusion of evidence where the State\u2019s Attorney or the sheriffs department may be charged with knowledge of the repetitive nature of a warrant will deter fishing expeditions and provide an incentive to keep accurate records.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>These cases all support the continued viability of <em>Ramirez's </em>collective knowledge analysis. (See also <em>Hecox, supra, </em>619 N.E.2d at p. 342 [\u201c[m]ost courts\u201d hold that the good faith exception \u201cdoes not apply\u201d where incorrect information leading to invalid arrest is due to police error, in which case \u201cthere is police misconduct to deter\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In summary, for the reasons discussed, we agree with the Court of Appeal that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In her concurring opinion, Justice Brown argues we should reach this conclusion on the ground that once defendant stated he was not on parole and offered what he claimed was a discharge certificate, the officers could not have had an objectively reasonable belief their conduct was lawful. For several reasons, we disagree. Neither the Court of Appeal in its opinion, nor the parties in their petitions for review or briefs, addressed this theory, which, no less than our analysis, would establish a constitutional principle. By contrast, the Court of Appeal decided, and the parties have fully briefed and argued, the issue we have addressed. Moreover, Justice Brown\u2019s theory is questionable under decisions of both this court and the United States Supreme Court. (See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 797, 799-805 [91 S.Ct. 1106, 1108-1111, 28 L.Ed.2d 484] [because false identifications are not uncommon, police had a reasonable, good faith belief that arrestee was the person they wanted, notwithstanding his claim he was someone else and his proffered identification]; <em>Michel </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1922) 188 Cal. 199, 208 [205 P. 113] [police need not \u201caccept the word of persons about to be arrested,\u201d because such persons \u201cmake whatever statements . . . best serve[] [their] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>purpose in escaping arrest\u201d].)

Nevertheless, we use the term because of its common acceptance by commentators and courts, including the high court itself.

In the absence of objective reasonableness, the prosecution cannot rely on the <em>Leon </em>good faith exception to avoid imposition of an exclusionary remedy for an illegal search. It is therefore unnecessary to make any generalized pronouncements as to the circumstances in which parole officers or California Department of Corrections (CDC) clerks might be \u201cadjuncts to the law enforcement team\u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 917 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3417]), thereby precluding application of <em>Leon\u2019s </em>good faith rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">In <em>Leon, </em>the United States Supreme Court emphasized that one predicate of any good faith exception is the objective reasonableness of the officer\u2019s conduct. (See <em>Leon, supra, </em>486 U.S. at p. 919, fn. 20 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3419].) \u201c[RJeliance on the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination and on the technical sufficiency of the warrant he issues must be objectively reasonable, [citation] and it is clear that in some circumstances the officer will have no reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant was properly issued.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 922-923 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3420], fns. omitted.) \u201cAccordingly, our good-faith inquiry is confined to the objectively ascertainable question whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate\u2019s authorization. In making this determination, all of the circumstances . . . may be considered.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 922, fn. 23 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>In the present context, this standard of reasonableness requires the officer to have a firm basis for believing the defendant is on parole and subject to a search condition. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Tellez </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 876, 880 [180 Cal.Rptr. 579], the evidence was \u201cuncontradicted that the officers were informed by appellant\u2019s parole officer and appellant, that he was in fact on parole [with a search condition]. Their reliance on this information was reasonable and they acted thereon in good faith.\u201d Therefore, the court refused to suppress evidence recovered in a subsequent search even though the appellant\u2019s parole status had terminated several months earlier. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>People v. Washington </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 434, 439 [186 Cal.Rptr. 3]; cf. <em>Hill v. California </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 797, 804 [91 S.Ct. 1106, 1111, 28 L.Ed.2d 484] [arrest and search incident thereto upheld even though officers arrested wrong individual because \u201cthe officers\u2019 mistake was understandable and the arrest a reasonable response to the situation facing them at the time\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In this case, the officers relied entirely on the \u201cparole listing\u201d provided by the CDC, which they made no attempt to verify through some primary source. (Cf. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>401 U.S. at pp. 802-803 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1110].) Although they contacted Officer Mora, she apparently was not defendant\u2019s parole officer and acted as no more than a \u201c \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 \u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 914 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3416]), merely confirming what little secondary information the officers already knew. Moreover, when they attempted to execute the search, defendant verbally challenged their authority to proceed without a warrant and in support of his assertions presented his certificate of discharge from the CDC, a document the officers had no reason to think was falsified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Hill v. California, supra, </em>401 U.S. at p. 803 &amp; fn. 7 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1110].) Mora had no definitive response to defendant\u2019s claim and apparently did not examine the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Given \u201call of the circumstances\u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 922, fn. 23 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3420]), no \u201creasonably well trained officer\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>would have proceeded without first confirming defendant\u2019s parole status, either prior to embarking for the motel or, at the latest, when informed of defendant\u2019s discharge. While defendant may not have been a disinterested source of this information, he certainly was a knowledgeable one the officers had no legitimate reason to disregard. The constitutional justification for subjecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>parolees to warrantless searches is predicated on the administrative needs of the parole system in \u201cmonitoring [the] transition from inmate to free citizen.\u201d (P<em>eople v. Reyes </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 743, 752 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 734, 968 P.2d 445].) Once an individual has successfully made this transition, he regains full Fourth Amendment protection, which law enforcement must recognize and respect. Other than a warrant issued on probable cause or some other exception to the warrant requirement, defendant\u2019s parole search condition provided the basis on which the officers could conduct a reasonable search of his motel room. It was therefore incumbent on them to resolve the uncertainty of his status to ensure a valid search.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Since the officers did not act \u201cin the objectively reasonable belief that their conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 918 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3418]), it is unnecessary to determine whether the statutory scheme delineating the duties and authority of parole officers renders them adjuncts of the law enforcement team when they accompany police officers in executing a parole search. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 39-40.) Notwithstanding these provisions, \u201c[p]arole agents, in contrast to police officers, are not \u2018engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime,\u2019 [citation]; instead, their primary concern is whether their parolees should remain free on parole.\u201d <em>(Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 357, 368 [118 S.Ct. 2014, 2022, 141 L.Ed.2d 344]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 752-753.) In discharging this responsibility during the transition period, parole officers must both assess the efficacy of rehabilitation and protect the public. <em>(People v. Reyes, </em>at pp. 752-753.) It is primarily for these reasons, not law enforcement purposes, that they have peace officer status\u2014with its attendant authority to carry firearms, make arrests, etc.\u2014in relation to their supervisory duties. Granted, in some instances they may assist or cooperate with law enforcement for the purpose of uncovering evidence of illegal activity. (See <em>U.S. v. Richardson </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 849 F.2d 439, 441; see also <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, </em>at p. 369 [118 S.Ct. at pp. 2022-2023].) But courts should suppress evidence only when the facts clearly establish that a parole officer has acted in a law enforcement capacity. (Cf. <em>Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 918 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3418] [\u201csuppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I similarly do not endorse the unqualified characterization of CDC clerks who prepare and disseminate the parole listings as adjuncts of law enforcement. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 44-46.) Nothing in the language or legislative history of Penal Code section 3003, or any other statute cited by the majority, supports the conclusion the Legislature intended\u2014simply by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>requiring CDC clerks routinely to provide department records to local law enforcement\u2014that they would become enmeshed in the \u201coften competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime\u201d <em>(Arizona v. Evans </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 1, 15 [115 S.Ct. 1185, 1193, 131 L.Ed.2d 34]) thereby narrowing the scope of the good faith exception. The legislation merely sought to regularize and make more efficient the previously ad hoc process of local agencies requesting the information as needed. The function of CDC clerks remains to assist in the department\u2019s discharge of its responsibilities to parolees and the public, not law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures was motivated by the abhorrence of the general warrants and writs of assistance that in England and the American colonies symbolized governmental overreaching and abuse of authority. (See <em>Steagald v. United States </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 204, 220 [101 S.Ct. 1642, 1651-1652, 68 L.Ed.2d 38].) In the criminal context, the courts have chosen to enforce this prohibition by the exclusionary rule, while at the same time recognizing the \u201csubstantial social costs\u201d it exacts. (See <em>Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 907 &amp; fn. 6 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3412].) For this reason, and because the rule \u201crenders the Fourth Amendment contemptible in the eyes of judges and citizens\u201d (Amar, <em>Fourth Amendment First Principles </em>(1994) 107 Harv. L.Rev. 757, 799) and \u201cmay well \u2018generate] disrespect for the law and administration of justice\u2019 \u201d <em>(Leon, </em>at p. 908 [104 S.Ct. at p. 3412]), we should avoid formulating overbroad Fourth Amendment principles that ultimately are \u201coblivious or hostile to the common sense of common people\u201d and \u201coften abandoned] ... to avoid absurdity.\u201d (Amar, <em>Fourth Amendment First Principles, </em>at p. 759.) Here, however, the officers\u2019 unreasonable conduct falls squarely within the intended scope of the Fourth Amendment. Assuming the exclusionary rule is a constitutionally appropriate remedy (see <em>id. </em>at pp. 785-800), suppression of the evidence seized here vindicates rather than breeds contempt for constitutional rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">It is clear from the record that defendant immediately informed the officers he had been discharged from parole when they came to his motel room. While it is somewhat less clear exactly when he presented his certificate of discharge, it reasonably appears he did so at a point when the officers could have suspended their activities and resolved his parole status before searching. In any event, since the prosecution had the burden to justify the search <em>(People v. Camarella </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 592, 596 [286 Cal.Rptr. 780, 818 P.2d 63]), any deficiency in this regard would not be defendant\u2019s responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
