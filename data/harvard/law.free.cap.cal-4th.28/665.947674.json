Prior to his death, the deceased orally instructed his daughter to sign his name on a grant deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>that vested title to his residence in himself and her as joint tenants; she did so outside of his presence and he later orally ratified the conveyance. We granted review to decide whether the transfer was valid. As discussed herein, we conclude the transfer was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In 1978, Austin David Stephens (Austin) and his wife, Thelma, executed crossover wills, which provided that when they passed away all their real and personal property would be equally divided between their children, Lawrence Stephens (Lawrence) and Shirley Williams (Shirley).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In 1983, Thelma became seriously ill with cancer. Shirley drove her mother to every chemotherapy treatment and gave her around-the-clock care for five years. Shirley, who lived just two houses from her parents, installed an intercom linking their bedrooms so her mother could reach her at any time. At the same time, Shirley held two jobs. She worked in the daytime as a switchboard operator and in the evening as a cocktail waitress.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Soon after Thelma died in 1988, Austin\u2019s health began to suffer. Over the next six years, he had over 170 doctor visits and was hospitalized several times as a result of diabetes, a heart attack, prostate cancer, lip cancer, high blood pressure, glaucoma, and ear and eye surgeries. Shirley, as she did with her mother, took care of her father. She fixed him three meals a day, cleaned his pool and house, washed his clothes, watered his plants, purchased his groceries, gave him daily insulin shots, arranged his medical appointments, purchased his prescriptions, completed his insurance paperwork, medical forms and tax returns, paid his bills and cared for his pets.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Unlike Shirley, Lawrence was not involved in the daily activity of caring for his father. In August of 1989, Lawrence moved from California to Colorado to retire. Thereafter, he visited his father once or twice a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Austin began to lose his eyesight from glaucoma. In 1989, he executed a durable power of attorney, naming Shirley his attomey-in-fact. The document specified that she had the power to sell, convey, and transfer his real property. By 1990, Austin was blind and relied on Shirley to read documents for him. In 1991, Austin decided to make a gift of his home to Shirley due in part to her caring for him as well as Lawrence\u2019s departure to Colorado at a time when Austin felt he needed help.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">A grant deed was typed by Agnes Stephens, who was Lawrence\u2019s ex-wife and Shirley\u2019s coworker. The deed vested title in Austin and Shirley as joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tenants. Austin\u2019s name and address were typed on the deed for return by mailing after recording. Following preparation of the deed, Austin verbally instructed Shirley, in the presence of Austin\u2019s best friend and neighbor, Delbert Catron, to sign his name to the deed. Shirley followed her father\u2019s instructions. She executed the deed and had it notarized. Austin was not present at the time Shirley signed the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The trial court determined that, after the deed was executed, Austin \u201corally and expressly\u201d ratified Shirley\u2019s signing of his name to the deed. The trial court stated: \u201ca. Shirley immediately told Austin of each step of the execution, notarization, forwarding of the deed to the County Recorder\u2019s office for recording, and return of the deed to him after recording. At each of these steps Austin verbally acknowledged to Shirley that that was what he wanted to happen and instructed her to proceed with the next step, ffl] b. While the deed was with the County Recorder\u2019s office for recording, Austin personally received a telephone call from a person from the County of Orange who inquired as to whether Austin intended the transfer of the real property to be a gift to Shirley. Austin told the caller that that was his intent, [f] c. After the deed was recorded it was mailed to Austin\u2019s residence, at which time he verbally acknowledged receiving it and instructed Shirley to place it in safekeeping. ffl] d. Subsequent to the recording of the deed, Austin had several conversations with Mr. Catron in which he told Mr. Catron that Shirley had followed his instructions and executed the deed. [f] e. Around Christmas 1991, subsequent to the recording of the deed, Austin traveled to Florida where he stayed for several weeks or months to visit his brother, James Franklin Stephens. During that visit he repeatedly told his brother that he was angry with Larry for leaving California, that he had nothing but praise for Shirley for taking care of him, and that he had \u2018disinherited Larry.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The trial court also determined that Austin was at all times thereafter mentally competent and capable of taking action to disavow the validity of the deed if that was his desire, but that he did not do so despite his knowledge of the execution, notarization, and recording of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Within a few weeks of Austin\u2019s death in 1994, Lawrence filed a petition for probate of the will and a petition to determine title and require transfer of the property to the estate pursuant to Probate Code former section 9860, subdivision (a)(4). Lawrence died before trial, but his daughter, Katherine Stephens Vohs (Katherine), continued with the litigation as his successor in interest (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7377.31 &amp; 377.32), and filed an amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">After a court trial, the trial judge declared Shirley the sole owner of Austin\u2019s property under the \u201camanuensis\u201d rule, which provides that where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the signing of a grantor\u2019s name is done with the grantor\u2019s express authority, the person signing the grantor\u2019s name is not deemed an agent but is instead regarded as a mere instrument or amanuensis of the grantor, and that signature is deemed to be that of the grantor. (See generally <em>Ledford v. Hubbard </em>(1926) 219 Ky. 9, 15 [292 S.W. 345, 348], and cases cited therein; <em>Lukey v. Smith </em>(1961) 77 Nev. 402 [365 P.2d 487, 488-489].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The trial court stated: \u201cShirley\u2019s signature of Austin\u2019s name was a purely ministerial, mechanical act and was not an exercise by Shirley of any authority under the power of attorney. The signature is therefore deemed to be that of Austin made by the hand of Shirley, and not the signature of Shirley as an authorized agent under the power of attorney or otherwise as a fiduciary. In so signing the deed, Shirley was not exercising any authority [under the power of attorney], and therefore did not exceed any authority. By virtue of Austin\u2019s antecedent instruction to Shirley and his subsequent ratification, the signature on the deed is deemed to be Austin\u2019s as a matter of law, meeting the requirement of [Civil Code section 1091] that a deed be executed by the grantor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Katherine appealed. During the appeal\u2019s pendency, Shirley passed away. Her children continued to defend the lawsuit. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 377.40; Prob. Code, \u00a7 58.) The Court of Appeal reversed. It held that under Civil Code section 2309, Shirley\u2019s authority to execute the deed as Austin\u2019s agent had to be in writing. As Shirley\u2019s written authority was derived from a durable power of attorney, Shirley could not convey the property to herself as a gift. Moreover, Austin\u2019s oral ratification of the deed was insufficient because Civil Code section 2310 requires that such ratification be in writing. Finally, the Court of Appeal rejected the amanuensis theory because the deed was admittedly not signed in Austin\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The Court of Appeal reached its decision reluctantly: \u201cThe record is clear [that] Austin desired to give his home to Shirley to thank her for all her selfless giving, continuous help and love. Sadly, Austin and Shirley failed to comply with legal formalities necessary to carry out Austin\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">We granted review; we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">The Court of Appeal correctly determined that Shirley was not authorized to sign the deed as Austin\u2019s agent.  A deed is a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>instrument conveying or transferring the title to real property; it is an executed conveyance and operates as a present transfer of the real property. (3 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2000) Deeds, \u00a7 8.1, p. 5 (Miller &amp; Starr).) As a deed is \u201can executed contract, it is subject to the rules applicable to contracts.\u201d (Ibid.; see also Civ. Code, \u00a7 1040; <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1917) 176 Cal. 479, 485-486 [168 P. 1047] [deeds must be read like any other contracts].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">An agent\u2019s authority to execute a deed on behalf of a principal must be conferred in writing. Civil Code section 1091 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAn estate in real property . . . can be transferred only by operation of law, or by an instrument in writing, subscribed by the party disposing of the same, or by his agent thereunto authorized by writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Moreover, the \u201cequal dignities\u201d rule of Civil Code section 2309 (section 2309) provides that a principal\u2019s <em>oral </em>authorization to an agent \u201cis sufficient for any purpose, except that an authority to enter into a contract required by law to be in writing can only be given by an instrument in writing.\u201d  The deed in this matter, as a present transfer of property, fell squarely within this rule. (See 3 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>supra, </em>Deeds, \u00a7 8.27, p. 52 [\u201cIn general, if some other person executes a deed on behalf of the grantor, the grantor\u2019s authorization must be in writing.\u201d].) Shirley did not have written authority to execute the deed as Austin\u2019s agent. The transfer was thus not authorized by section 2309.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">While Shirley had written authority from Austin in the form of a power of attorney, that document specified that she had only the power to sell, convey, and transfer his real property. By law, she lacked authority to convey the property to herself as a gift.  \u201cA power of attorney conferring authority to sell, exchange, transfer or convey real property for the benefit of the principal does not authorize a conveyance as a gift or without substantial consideration [citations]; and a conveyance without the scope of the power conferred is void.\u201d <em>(Shields v. Shields </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 99, 101 [19 Cal.Rptr. 129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Nor was the gift authorized by Probate Code section 4264, which provides that a power of attorney may not be construed to grant authority to an attomey-in-fact to \u201c[m]ake or revoke a gift of the principal\u2019s property in trust or otherwise\u201d unless such act is \u201cexpressly authorized in the power of attorney.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 4264, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Respondents concede that Shirley lacked written authority to execute the deed, but argue that Austin subsequently ratified her execution of the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>by his oral statements to others. This argument is not persuasive. To be valid, any such ratification must have been made in writing; oral ratification was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\u201cRatification is the voluntary election by a person to adopt in some manner as his own an act which was purportedly done on his behalf by another person, the effect of which, as to some or all persons, is to treat the act as if originally authorized by him. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rakestraw </em>v. <em>Rodrigues </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 67, 73 [104 Cal.Rptr. 57, 500 P.2d 1401] <em>(Rakestraw))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">However, the equal dignities rule of Civil Code section 2310 (section 2310) provides that a ratification of an agent\u2019s act \u201ccan be made only in the manner that would have been necessary to confer an original authority for the act ratified.\u201d In other words, just as an agent\u2019s authority to execute a deed must be in writing, so also must a principal\u2019s ratification of an invalid execution be in writing. \u201cA grantor cannot ratify and accept the execution of the [deed] instrument by the third party orally. Ratification by the grantor of the prior execution of the deed must be in writing.\u201d (3 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>supra, </em>Deeds, \u00a7 8.27, p. 52.) Our cases, going back more than a hundred years, have affirmed this rule. For example, in <em>Videau v. Griffin </em>(1863) 21 Cal. 389, 391 <em>(Griffin), </em>we held that where a deed is executed by an attorney without written authority, no subsequent parol acknowledgment by the principal will make that conveyance valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Respondents also urge that sections 2309 and 2310 are inapplicable because, even if Shirley acted as Austin\u2019s agent, her execution of the deed involved a claim solely between her and Austin, and claims between a principal and agent fall outside sections 2309 and 2310. In support, they cite two of our cases: <em>Sunset-Sternau Food Co. v. Bonzi </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 834 [36 Cal.Rptr. 741, 389 P.2d 133] <em>(Sunset-Sternau), </em>where we refused to apply section 2309 to an oral contract between a principal and agent; and <em>Rakestraw, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 67, where we refused to apply section 2310 to an oral ratification between a principal and agent. Their reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">In <em>Sunset-Sternau, </em>an agent sued its principal for refusing to execute a contract that it had negotiated on the principal\u2019s behalf. <em>(Sunset-Sternau, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at pp. 836-837.) In <em>Rakestraw, </em>the principal, whose signature was forged onto a promissory note, sued her former friend on the theory that he aided the purported agent (the principal\u2019s husband) in the forgery. <em>(Rakestraw, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at pp. 70-71.) In <em>Sunset-Sternau, </em>we held that the absence of a written authorization did not preclude a finding that the contract was valid because the proscription of section 2309 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u201cprohibit the enforcement of the agreement between the principal and the agent. . . <em>(Sunset-Sternau, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at p. 842.) In <em>Rakestraw, </em>we likewise stated, \u201csection 2310 was not intended to apply to [an oral] ratification as between a principal and agent.\u201d <em>(Rakestraw, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 76.) In other words, we held that sections 2309 and 2310 do not control if the principal or the agent is seeking to enforce (or void) an agreement vis-a-vis the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Application of this reasoning quickly disposes of respondents\u2019 contention that sections 2309 and 2310 do not apply to this transaction. Unlike in <em>Rakestraw </em>and <em>Sunset-Sternau, </em>there is no dispute between Shirley as agent and Austin as principal. As such, <em>Rakestraw </em>and <em>Sunset-Sternau </em>do not control.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">But Shirley had two independent roles in this transaction. Not only did she act as Austin\u2019s agent and execute the grant deed on his behalf, she was also the party who received an interest in the property through the grant deed. In this case, Shirley is simply asserting her rights as the party who received an interest in the property, not her rights as Austin\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Respondents insist that the transaction should be valid as a deed signed by Austin, because Shirley acted as Austin\u2019s amanuensis in that she performed a mere mechanical function in signing Austin\u2019s name to the deed.  The amanuensis rule has successfully been invoked as an exception to section 2309.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondents assert that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that Shirley did not qualify as an amanuensis because she did not sign the deed in Austin\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The sole authority cited by the Court of Appeal, <em>Pitney </em>v. <em>Pitney </em>(1921) 55 Cal.App. 22, 29 [202 P. 940] <em>(Pitney), </em>specifically requires that an amanuensis sign a deed in the presence of the grantor. In <em>Pitney, </em>the plaintiff, who was unable to read or write, had several deeds prepared for her. After they were read to her, she directed her attorney to sign her name, which he did in her presence. Such act \u201cconstituted and was in law the signature of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 30.) The court explained, \u201c \u2018The only exception to the rule that an authority to execute a deed must be conferred by writing, is where the execution by the attorney is in the presence of the principal. The exception arises from the doctrine that what one does in the presence of and by the direction of another is the act of the latter\u2014as much so as if it were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>done by himself in person. The attorney in such case, so far as the signature to the instrument is concerned, is a mere amanuensis of the grantor, and in the affixing of the seal is only the instrument, the hand, as it were, of the grantor. It is not sufficient that the attorney was directed to sign the name of the principal and affix his seal; the execution must be in the immediate presence of the principal, and this fact must be affirmatively established by the party who relies upon it as an excuse for the absence of a power in writing.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Griffin, supra, </em>21 Cal. 389, 392.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Subsequent cases have clarified, however, that application of the amanuensis rule is not confined to the situation in which an agent signs a contract in the principal\u2019s immediate presence. It may also apply when an agent, acting with merely mechanical and no discretionary authority, signs the principal\u2019s name <em>outside </em>the principal\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In <em>Mihelis, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 206, a land purchaser orally authorized his agent, by telephone, to sign a land contract on his behalf. The seller invoked section 2309 to void the contract. We held that a contract signed by an agent in the principal\u2019s name, outside of the principal\u2019s presence, was binding. The signature was \u201cpurely a mechanical act which did not involve the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>(Mihelis, supra, </em>at p. 214.) We explained: \u201c[W]here the signing by an agent is an act of this character the authorization by the principal is not required to be in writing and the signature is to be treated as that of the principal whether or not he was present at the execution of the agreement.\u201d <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Similarly, in <em>Munson, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 306, the Court of Appeal held that the principal\u2019s oral request to his agent, by telephone, to sign a document was \u201cperfectly valid, whether the name was signed in or out of his presence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 313.) The Court of Appeal explained that the amanuensis rule was an exception to section 2309 because \u201c \u2018there was no attempt to delegate authority to the amanuensis to exercise discretion with respect to the provisions of the [agreement], but merely to authorize him to sign the agent\u2019s name to the document.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Munson, supra, </em>at p. 312, quoting <em>Kadota Fig, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 815, 820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Likewise, <em>Kadota Fig, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 815, also held that an authorized agent\u2019s oral request that a third party perform \u201cthe mere mechanical act of signing\u201d that agent\u2019s name to an instrument, outside the agent\u2019s presence, was \u201cvalid and binding,\u201d even though the instrument was required to be in writing. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 819.) There, the authorization was conveyed to a judge, by telephone, who acted as the amanuensis for the duly authorized agent of the principal. <em>{Ibid) </em>The court held that section 2309, which requires a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>authorization \u201c <em>\u2018to enter into a contract </em>required by law to be in writing\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kadota Fig, supra, </em>at p. 821, quoting \u00a7 2309, italics added in <em>Kadota Fig), </em>was not applicable because the judge was given no authority \u201cto enter into a contract.\u201d <em>(Kadota Fig, supra, </em>at p. 819.) Instead, as the judge exercised no discretion or judgment, he acted merely as an amanuensis. Despite its acknowledgement of <em>Pitney, supra, </em>55 Cal.App. 22, the <em>Kadota Fig </em>court held there was no requirement that the signature be made in the agent\u2019s presence: \u201c[W]e . . . know of no authority which requires that the signature of the party shall be actually made in his presence.\u201d <em>(Kadota Fig, supra, </em>at p. 821.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">As in <em>Mihelis, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 206, we again reject the formalistic notion that an amanuensis must sign the document in the presence of the principal. Whether the principal directs the amanuensis by telephone or, as in the present case, the principal, in person, tells the amanuensis to sign the document and the actual signing is done outside the principal\u2019s presence, courts are required to determine whether the signing is a mechanical act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In the above cited cases, however, the amanuensis had no interest in the contract. Here, Shirley claims to be an amanuensis despite the fact that she is also the sole beneficiary of this transfer.  No prior California decision has addressed the issue of an \u201cinterested amanuensis.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Obvious concerns arise, namely, whether the transfer was the product of fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>duress, or undue influence. Accordingly, if the amanuensis will directly benefit from the transfer of title, the validity of the transfer must be examined under a heightened level of judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"> In an undue influence case, for example, \u201c[wjhere the relationship between the parties is that of parent and child and the parent relies on the child for advice in business matters, a gift <em>inter vivos </em>. . . which is without consideration and where the parent does not have independent advice, is presumed to be fraudulent and to have been made under undue influence.\u201d <em>(Sparks v. Mendoza </em>(1948) 83 Cal.App.2d 511, 514 [189 P.2d 43].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   The burden of proof then shifts to the child \u201cto show that the transaction was free from fraud and undue influence, and in all particulars fair.\u201d <em>(Sparks, supra, </em>at p. 515.) Put differently, this presumption may be rebutted by \u201cevidence that the act in question had its genesis in the mind of the parent and that he was not goaded to a completion by any act of such child.\u201d <em>(Goldman v. Goldman </em>(1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 227, 234 [253 P.2d 474].) The child\u2019s burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>(Estate of Gelonese </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 854, 862-863 [111 Cal.Rptr. 833].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The amanuensis rule is an exception to Civil Code sections 2309 and 2310 and also operates as an exception to Probate Code section 4264, subdivision (c), which prohibits attomeys-in-fact from making gifts of property to themselves.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because unscrupulous parties could attempt to use the amanuensis rule to sidestep the protections contained in these code sections, we hold that the signing of a grantor\u2019s name by an interested amanuensis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>must be presumed invalid. In such a case, the interested amanuensis bears the burden to show that his or her signing of the grantor\u2019s name was a mechanical act in that the grantor intended to sign the document using the instrumentality of the amanuensis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Given that Shirley was an interested party to the deed, it is presumed that her signing of Austin\u2019s name was invalid. However, this presumption has been successfully rebutted in this case. The trial court found, based on overwhelming evidence, that Shirley acted as a mere amanuensis, signing the deed at Austin\u2019s direct request, albeit not in his immediate presence. Because her signature was a mere mechanical act, and not an exercise of judgment or discretion, Austin\u2019s oral instruction to Shirley was sufficient. \u201cIt is perfectly natural for a parent to be more bountiful to one of his children who has assumed the greatest burden of care and lavished the highest degree of solicitude upon him.\u201d <em>(Camperi </em>v. <em>Chiechi, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.2d at p. 505.)

These fears are unfounded. In the present case, based upon the testimony of several disinterested witnesses, the trial court overwhelmingly found that Shirley acted as Austin\u2019s amanuensis. On the other hand, it is unlikely that a \u201cswindler\u2019s\u201d testimony, without corroboration, will rebut the presumption of invalidity. Indeed, as seen in undue influence cases <em>{ante, </em>at p. 677) upon which our rule is patterned, the presumption of invalidity effectively acts as a safeguard against unscrupulous relatives who would otherwise seek to take advantage of an aging and infirm relative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b722-8\">KENNARD, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AsJ\">Under California law, an interest in real property can be transferred only in writing.

I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Civil Code section 1091 states: \u201cAn estate in real property . . . can be transferred only by operation of law, or by an instrument in writing, subscribed by the party disposing of the same, or by his agent thereunto authorized by writing.\u201d This provision is part of California\u2019s statute of frauds, which is based on the Statute of Frauds enacted in England in 1677, and which also applies to other important transactions such as contracts not to be performed within the lifetime of the promisor (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1624, subd. (a)(5)), agreements to lend amounts greater than $100,000 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1624, subd. (a)(7)), creation of a suretyship (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2793), contracts for the sale of goods worth more than $500 (Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 2201), and agreements to arbitrate a dispute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1281, 1281.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The preamble to the English Statute of Frauds stated that its purpose was the \u201cprevention of many fraudulent Practices which are commonly endeavoured to be upheld by Perjury and Subordination of Perjury.\u201d (See Smith, A Treatise on the Law of Frauds and the Statute of Frauds (1907) p. 323.) By requiring that the specified transactions be in writing and signed by the parties, the statute of frauds avoids the likelihood that permitting oral proof of such transactions would encourage fraudulent claims by swindlers gambling that they can glibly persuade a jury to enforce a nonexistent oral agreement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Although generally a party to a transaction protected by the statute of frauds must <em>personally </em>sign the document implementing the transaction, the signature of an agent with written authorization (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1091, 2309) or an amanuensis <em>(Kadota Fig Assn. v. Case-Swayne Co. </em>(1946) 73 Cal.App.2d 815, 821 [167 P.2d 523]) will also suffice. But <em>no one who stands to benefit by the transaction implemented in the document </em>may sign on another\u2019s behalf. Section 24 of the Restatement Second of Agency states: \u201cOne party to a transaction can be authorized to act as agent for the other party thereto, <em>except for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the Statute of </em>Frauds.\u201d (Italics added.) The author of a noted treatise agrees: \u201cIn the making of an ordinary written contract, the signature of either party can be validly inscribed by the other party if the latter is authorized by the first to do so. The decisions have established an exception to this rule in the case of contracts within the statute of frauds; they hold that the signature is not sufficient to bind a party if it is inscribed by the other party, even though the latter acted with the express authority of the former, at least if it is orally given.\u201d (4 Corbin on Contracts (rev. ed. 1997) \u00a7 23.6, p. 815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">A rule permitting an interested party to sign another party\u2019s name to a document covered by the statute of frauds creates an exception to the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>that is so broad as to defeat its purpose, which is to prevent perjury by requiring that important transactions be in writing and signed by the parties. Otherwise, a party could write a document implementing such a transaction, sign the other party\u2019s name, and then enforce it by falsely testifying that the signature was authorized. (See 4 Corbin on Contracts, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 815-816.) As one court has stated, if a party to a contract or conveyance for which a signature is required by the statute of frauds could sign the other party\u2019s name to the implementing document, \u201cthe Statute of Frauds would be deprived of its meaning and reduced to an absurdity.\u201d <em>(Tate v. Shober </em>(E.D.Pa. 1941) 41 F.Supp. 478, 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The rule described in the previous paragraph is recognized not only by the Restatement (Rest.2d Agency, \u00a7 24, p. 96) but also by one of the most prominent treatises on the law of contracts (4 Corbin on Contracts, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 815-816) and by legal encyclopedias (37 C.J.S. (1997) Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 134, p. 440; 72 Am.Jur.2d (2001) Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 297, pp. 792-793), as well as more than a dozen decisions <em>(Woodruff Oil &amp; Fertilizer Co. v. Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining Corp. </em>(4th Cir. 1917) 246 Fed. 375, 375; <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Shober, supra, </em>41 F.Supp. 478, 481; <em>Happ Bros. Co. v. Hunter Mfg. &amp; Commission Co. </em>(1916) 145 Ga. 836, 836 [90 S.E. 61, 61]; <em>Lowe v. Mohler </em>(1914) 56 Ind.App. 593 [105 N.E. 934, 936]; <em>Wingate v.

Keeling </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1942) 160 S.W.2d 310, 311).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">At issue here is the validity of a deed conveying an interest in real property from Austin Stephens to his daughter, Shirley. The latter, who cared for her blind and aging father before he died, signed his name to the deed, and the testimony of an independent witness supports Shirley\u2019s claim that Austin told her to do so. But under the rule described above, Shirley was not allowed to sign her father\u2019s name to the deed because she was a party to that transaction. Thus, the deed does not comply with the statute of frauds and Shirley\u2019s heirs, who became parties when Shirley died while this appeal was pending, may not rely on it to support their claim to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The majority acknowledges that its rule permitting an interested party such as Shirley to act as an amanuensis may be an invitation to fraud. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 677.) To circumvent this problem, the majority proposes a \u201cheightened level of judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The majority holds that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>signing of a grantor\u2019s name by an interested amanuensis shall be \u201cpresumed invalid,\u201d and any interested amanuensis shall \u201cbear[] the burden to show that his or her signing of the grantor\u2019s name was a mechanical act. . . <em>(Id. </em>at p. 678.) According to the majority, Shirley rebutted this presumption of invalidity by evidence that Austin asked her to sign the deed on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">This rule may look good at first glance, but in practice it will have little effect. Any swindler who signs an aging and infirm relative\u2019s name to a deed without the relative\u2019s permission can easily defeat the presumption of invalidity by falsely testifying that the relative asked the swindler to sign as an amanuensis. And contrary to the majority\u2019s claim that it is subjecting claims by interested amanuenses to \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny, its standard of proof\u2014by preponderance of the evidence\u2014is no different from the standard used in any civil case. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 115 [\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">My sympathies lie with Shirley, because the evidence at trial suggests that she was a loving and caring daughter who acted in accord with the wishes of her ailing father when she signed his name to the deed conveying to her a joint tenancy interest in her father\u2019s home. That, however, is beside the point. The result in this case cannot depend on personal sympathies toward the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In the words of <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Mohler, supra, </em>105 N.E. 934, 936: \u201cIt is doubtless true that in some instances the application of this doctrine [that an interested party may not sign the name of another party to a document required by the statute of frauds] may work a hardship, and innocent parties may be required to suffer therefrom; but the aggregate good which comes from its strict enforcement so far overshadows the evil that the courts uniformly adhere to the rule as announced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which held that the deed purporting to transfer an interest in Austin Stephens\u2019s house to his daughter Shirley violated the statute of frauds.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
