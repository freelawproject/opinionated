During an investigation of his wife\u2019s homicide, defendant agreed to take a polygraph test. At the police station, he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waived his rights, but then said he wished to consult a lawyer before speaking further. Rather than cease questioning immediately, as <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards v. Arizona </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 477 [101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378] <em>(Edwards) </em>require in a custodial setting, the polygraph operator encouraged defendant to keep talking. During this interlude, defendant admitted he killed his wife, claiming an assisted suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">Defendant was allowed to leave the station. Two days later, detectives came to his home. After assuring him he would not then be arrested, they interviewed him again without new <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Defendant provided a more detailed version of his assisted-suicide story. The detectives then departed as they had promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">Defendant was charged with premeditated minder. The trial court excluded all his station house statements made after he first requested counsel, but it admitted the later home interview. Defendant took the stand. Contrary to his prior claims, he testified that he \u201csnapped\u201d and killed his wife when, during an argument, she disparaged his sexual performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">Defendant was convicted as charged. On appeal, he asserted that admission of the home interview was prejudicial error. He argued that the police violated <em>Edwards </em>by recontacting him for questioning after he had invoked his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel in custody. He insisted that any \u201cbreak in custody\u201d exception to the <em>Edwards </em>no-recontact rule was inapplicable in this case, because the police released him from custody on a mere \u201cpretext\u201d to avoid <em>Edwards, </em>and because they failed to give new <em>Miranda </em>warnings before requestioning him at home. The Court of Appeal rejected these arguments and affirmed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">We agree with the Court of Appeal that the break-in-custody exception to the <em>Edwards </em>no-recontact rule governs here. The special protections of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards </em>apply only to persons questioned in the coercive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>atmosphere of <em>police custody. </em>The <em>Edwards </em>no-recontact rule guards against police badgering designed to wear down a suspect who <em>remains in custody </em>after invoking his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel during custodial questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Insofar as defendant\u2019s first statement was obtained in violation of <em>Edwards, </em>it was inadmissible in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. But when the police realized their mistake, they released him, and they recontacted him only after a two-day interval during which he had ample time, opportunity, and incentive to consult counsel outside the coercive atmosphere of custody. Many cases recognize that such a break in custody vitiates the particular danger addressed by <em>Edwards, </em>and new police questioning is permitted. Moreover, defendant was not rearrested before requestioning, but was re-interviewed, with his permission, in the noncustodial setting of his own home. Hence, no new <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waivers were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">We also agree with the Court of Appeal that by releasing and later reapproaching defendant, the police were not engaged in an improper ruse or pretext to avoid the strictures of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards. </em>Accordingly, we need not decide whether the Court of Appeal was correct insofar as it suggested that the existence of such deliberate police misconduct would be irrelevant in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the home interview was the <em>tainted product </em>of an earlier <em>Edwards </em>violation at the police station. Even if defendant\u2019s statements at the police station were elicited in violation of <em>Edwards, </em>there was no actual police coercion, and the record amply demonstrates that defendant spoke of his own free will. The two-day interval between interviews, during which defendant was free from custody, served to further attenuate any taint. The statement obtained at defendant\u2019s residence was itself entirely voluntary. As before, no coercive tactics were used. The evidence belies any inference that defendant\u2019s primary motive for talking was a realization that the \u201ccat\u201d was already \u201cout of the bag.\u201d Finally, because the home interview occurred in a noncustodial setting to which <em>Miranda </em>protections do not apply, new <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required to dissipate the taint from any prior <em>Edwards </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">Accordingly, we will affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">\n<em>Charges and trial evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">An information charged defendant with the premeditated murder of Gloria Andrade. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The information further alleged, for purposes of sentence enhancement, that defendant had personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, a knife (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)), and that he had previously been convicted of a forcible lewd act upon a child (\u00a7 288, former subd. (b) (now subd. (b)(1)), a serious felony (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (a)-(i), 1192.7, subd. (c)). The trial evidence indicated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">On November 2, 1996, around 7:00 a.m., the body of Andrade, defendant\u2019s wife, was found in the brush beside a roadside turnout near Julian, in rural San Diego County. The body exhibited multiple stab wounds to the throat, chest, and back. Around 10:00 p.m. that evening, defendant telephoned the San Diego Police and reported Andrade missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">On November 4, 1996, San Diego County Sheriffs homicide detectives Rowe and Heilig went to defendant\u2019s apartment to interview him about the report. Defendant stated he last saw Andrade around 9:00 p.m. on November 1, 1996, awoke the next morning to find her gone, made inquiries to try to find her, and then contacted the police. The detectives noticed personal effects on the dining room table; defendant confirmed they were Andrade\u2019s driver\u2019s license and rings. He claimed she had left them behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">On November 21, 1996, after Andrade\u2019s body had been identified, Detectives Rowe, Moreno, and Jopes returned to defendant\u2019s home to interview him about her death. The jury heard a redacted audio recording of this interview, in which defendant claimed he helped Andrade to commit suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Defendant\u2019s November 21 statement was as follows: He met Andrade while both were living in a recovery hotel for people with drug and alcohol problems. They later married, and he tried to give her the will to live, but she could not control her drinking and fell into a deep depression. In the weeks before her death, she frequently asked him to help her commit suicide. For a time, defendant resisted, and he finally told her it would have to be on the spur of the moment, because he could not think about it in advance. On the evening of November 1, 1996, she announced the time had come. He grabbed a knife from a kitchen drawer, and they departed in her car. After driving around in search of an isolated site, they arrived at the turnout near Julian. There he inflicted the knife wounds that caused her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">As related by defendant on November 21, the sequence of wounds is somewhat unclear. However, defendant appears to have said that as he and Andrade exchanged a final kiss at her request, he sliced her throat. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>smiled and guided the knife as he did so. Then he stabbed her in the chest as she sighed in relief. Finally, to make sure she was dead, he rolled her over and inflicted the wound in her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Defendant said he moved Andrade\u2019s body to where it was found because \u201cI knew eventually things would come up,\u201d and \u201cI figured ... if she was found within three to five days I might have a better chance of them not findin\u2019 anything.\u201d Defendant brought home the knife, the gloves Andrade had been wearing, her jewelry, and, by mistake, her identification, but he \u201cknew\u201d he might have left behind such traceable evidence as hair samples, fingerprints, and cigarette butts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Defendant declared he had \u201ctold [Andrade] . . . over and over, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna get away with this.\u201d Indeed, defendant said, though he attempted the missing person coverup, he \u201chad no intent of really ever gettin\u2019 away with it. ... I, I made a, made an effort but I, I r\u2014, I absolutely <em>when the first night you </em>[i.e., the detectives] <em>were here </em>. . . , [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]/ <em>knew, I knew it was over.\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) Defendant insisted that now \u201cmy only thing is you know tellin\u2019 you the absolute truth and tryin\u2019 to convince you. <em>I really felt </em>obligated.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">An autopsy suggested that the order of wounds was different than defendant had indicated in his November 21 statement. Based on the medical evidence, the pathologist opined that Andrade was stabbed in the back before she was stabbed in the chest, and that the nonfatal throat wounds were inflicted near the time of death, after the wound to her heart. Of the 12 knives consensually seized from defendant\u2019s apartment on November 21, the knife most consistent with Andrade\u2019s wounds was the one defendant had indicated to Detective Rowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">The prosecution presented evidence that on November 1, 1996, the day Andrade was killed, she was offered a bookkeeping job. She was scheduled to begin on November 5, 1996, and was happy about starting work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">Defendant took the stand and admitted he killed Andrade, but he no longer claimed assisted suicide. He gave the following account: He and Andrade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>had a volatile relationship; they argued about money, her drinking problem, and their sex life. Andrade was drinking wine heavily during October 1996, and she had bathed only once in the three weeks before her death. However, she had many reasons to live and was pleased about her new job. On November 1, 1996, they decided to celebrate with a nighttime picnic. They departed around 10:00 p.m.; Andrade left her jewelry and identification at home. After arriving at the turnout near Julian, they stargazed and picnicked happily for two hours, but then began to argue. After about 15 minutes, as defendant was packing the food and utensils, Andrade hurled the \u201cfinal insult,\u201d screaming that defendant was \u201cno good in bed.\u201d Defendant, who had a kitchen knife in his hand, \u201csnapped\u201d and \u201cjust lost it.\u201d He first grabbed Andrade by the collar and stabbed her in the back. As she struggled to push him away, he stabbed her in the chest, and she collapsed. Then he stood over her and began slashing her throat in a \u201cfrenzy.\u201d From beginning to end, the process may have taken a couple of minutes. Defendant did not intend to kill, but \u201cwas just lashing out with full anger.\u201d He dragged Andrade\u2019s body down the embankment, put the knife in the picnic basket, and departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">In rebuttal, the prosecution offered evidence that the autopsy showed no food in Andrade\u2019s stomach; that the clothing on her body was not suitable for a nighttime outing in cool weather; that she was unlikely to leave her identification and jewelry at home; that she was happy with her marriage and sex life but recently believed defendant was losing interest in her; and that defendant had been violent in his relationship with a former wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">The jury found defendant guilty of premeditated murder and found the knife-use allegation true. Defendant admitted the prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">The court sentenced defendant to 25 years to life for the murder, doubled under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law in consequence of the prior forcible lewd conduct conviction. The court imposed an additional consecutive one-year enhancement for the use of a knife, and an additional consecutive five-year serious felony enhancement for the prior forcible lewd conduct conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">\n<em>Suppression issues:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">On November 19, 1996, two days before the November 21, 1996, police interview at defendant\u2019s home, he was interviewed at a police station. Before trial, he moved to suppress (a) certain portions of the November 19 interview and (b) the entire November 21 interview. At the suppression hearing, the following evidence was adduced:</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">On November 4, 1996, while investigating defendant\u2019s missing person report, Detective Heilig asked if defendant was willing to take a polygraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>test, and he agreed. On November 19, 1996, the date scheduled for the examination, defendant drove himself to the police station. According to Detective Rowe, defendant looked like he had not slept much and seemed \u201ca little bit stressed,\u201d but he did not appear nervous or uneasy about taking the test. Rowe administered a <em>Miranda </em>advisement, standard procedure for polygraph examinations. The subsequent interview was videotaped, and Rowe monitored it from an adjacent room.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">In the examination room, polygraph examiner Redden readvised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; defendant said he understood and waived these rights. Redden then chatted at length with defendant about defendant\u2019s background, the case, and the test methodology. During this conversation, defendant reiterated his claim that he had awakened on the morning of November 2, 1996, to find Andrade missing, and he insisted he had no idea who was responsible for killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Redden then administered the examination. While connected to the machine, defendant again denied involvement in Andrade\u2019s death. During the test, defendant mentioned, as he had earlier in the interview, that he felt tired from lack of sleep. However, he did not request cessation of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">When the test was over, Redden invited defendant to view the computer results. Redden said these indicated a \u201cgreater than ninety-nine percent\u201d probability that defendant was lying, about his role in Andrade\u2019s death. Redden suggested they should \u201cchat\u201d and \u201ctry [to] figure out what happened,\u201d because defendant would have to face the truth at some point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">Defendant agreed, then stated, \u201cI wanna help you guys close your case but um, uh, I better talk to an attorney first. Seriously. Yo\u2014, you can understand that.\u201d Redden said he \u201c[could] understand that,\u201d whereupon defendant interjected, \u201cI\u2019d like to say somethin\u2019 off the record but I know that\u2019s impossible right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">When Redden suggested that defendant talk for his own comfort, defendant blurted, \u201cShe begged me to.\u201d Redden asked, \u201cWhy is that,\u201d and defendant responded that Andrade \u201cwas tired [of] this world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">Thereafter, sometimes interrupted by questions from Redden, defendant explained that Andrade, plagued by chronic depression, nightmares, and alcoholism, had \u201cgiv[en] up\u201d and lost the will to live, and had been \u201caskin\u2019 me, beggin\u2019 me for two or three weeks. Everyday, everyday, everyday.\u201d Defendant suggested that \u201cany of these people [apparently Andrade\u2019s friends and acquaintances] will tell you the same thing, <em>but it would kill them if they </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number><em>knew I did it. And I\u2019m not sayin \u2019 I did it until I\u2019ve had a chance to talk to </em>somebody.\u201d (Italics added.) When Redden further encouraged defendant to get it off his chest, defendant replied, \u201cI, I honestly can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. You know, / <em>[jeopardized] myself. </em>. . . [U] <em>I\u2019ve said too much </em>already.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Redden responded that he was willing to listen. Defendant then launched into a rambling and emotional tirade, declaring, \u201cGod, I wouldn\u2019t wanna do this again. She said make sure that it\u2019s finished, don\u2019t look back, make it as quick as possible. . . . And [she said] don\u2019t ever tell anybody, [but] here I am telling. . . . [S]he was so scared that I was gonna get caught. <em>... I knew I couldn\u2019t lie. </em>I shoulda just refused to take this test, but how does that look. That\u2019s just as bad, right.\u201d (Italics added.) Redden agreed that such a refusal might arouse suspicion. Momentarily recovering himself, defendant then reminded Redden that \u201c[l]ike I say[,] I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that I did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">Redden asked what defendant <em>was </em>saying. Defendant answered by reciting a litany of troubles, including his prior prison term for molesting his daughter and his difficulties with his registration as a sex offender. Defendant indicated he had hoped for a fresh start somewhere else. But \u201c[n]ow I\u2019m stuck here. Now I\u2019m gonna be here the rest [of] my life. I know it now. And I\u2019m gonna die [in] prison\u201d because the inmates would know he was a child molester.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">Redden professed sympathy and said talking was the best way to deal with problems. Defendant responded, \u201cOkay. But seriously[,] I think I shouldn\u2019t talk about it until I\u2019ve consulted with somebody, you understand that.\u201d Redden said he did understand, but \u201cif you wanted to talk, I was gonna sit here and listen.\u201d The following exchange then occurred: \u201c[Defendant:] I told you, you know I want you guys to be able to close this case but God help me. God help me. Anything else that she would have wanted. Anything else I would\u2019ve done it for her. But she begged me, she begged me, she begged me. [|] [Redden:] What was she begging you to do? [H] [Defendant:] To help her die. Help her die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">At Redden\u2019s prompting, defendant recounted various ways he and Andrade had discussed ending her life. Then defendant lamented, \u201cOh man. How could I do it.\u201d When Redden asked again what defendant and Andrade talked about doing, defendant responded, \u201cLike, like I say, I better stop. I better stop. I, I\u2019ve asked to talk to an attorney. I better stop. <em>I\u2019ve already told you too much and it\u2019s on tape.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">When Redden said \u201cOkay,\u201d defendant continued, <em>\u201cYou guys are gonna book me, you \u2019re gonna book me. </em>If you\u2019re gonna give me a chance to talk to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>an attorney, you\u2019re gonna give me a chance to talk to an attorney.\u201d (Italics added.) Redden offered to go speak to \u201cthem\u201d (apparently, to the detectives, in reference to defendant\u2019s request for counsel), but said that if defendant wanted to talk, Redden understood his position and was willing to listen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Defendant asked that, \u201cbefore deciding what to do,\u201d the authorities should check Andrade\u2019s body for signs of a struggle, though <em>\u201cI know I\u2019m gonna have to at least face the charges for assisted suicide, at the least. At the most I\u2019m lookin \u2019 at homicide. I know that. I know that.'\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) Defendant also urged that Detective Rowe talk to Andrade\u2019s acquaintances about her mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">At this point, Detective Rowe paged Redden because he was concerned about defendant\u2019s references to counsel and felt the interview should end. Redden left the examination room. Rowe entered and chatted briefly with defendant. Defendant said something that ended with \u201cwanna talk to these people anymore.\u201d He requested a cup of coffee and mentioned again that he was \u201cexhausted\u201d because he had been up all night looking for a place to scatter Andrade\u2019s ashes. Rowe said he would check on the coffee, and defendant was momentarily left alone. He said, apparently to himself, \u201cFuck. Oh God. Shit. You did one . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">Detective Moreno entered and asked defendant for his identification cards, including his driver\u2019s license. Defendant apparently handed these over, and Moreno departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">Defendant then remained alone in the interview room for up to one hour. Meanwhile, Detective Rowe telephoned the district attorney\u2019s office for legal advice. Rowe eventually decided he would have to let defendant leave the station. No physical evidence linked defendant to the crime, and in light of defendant\u2019s references to counsel during the interview, Rowe doubted whether defendant\u2019s statements provided a basis for arresting him. Rowe concluded that the investigation should continue with the object of obtaining clearly admissible evidence, and that \u201cit was going to be a couple of days before we [rejcontacted [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">Rowe returned to the examination room and told defendant that although it appeared defendant wanted to say some things, he had requested counsel, so the police could not speak with him \u201cright now.\u201d Accordingly, they were going to let him go home. Rowe gave defendant his pager number in case defendant wanted to talk further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Defendant volunteered the names of people for Rowe to contact, and he promised to keep Rowe apprised of his whereabouts. The following colloquy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>then occurred: \u201c[Rowe:] \u2018Kay. <em>And don\u2019t think this is over with by any </em>.... [If] [Defendant:] <em>I know </em>....[][] [Rowe:] <em>means. </em>[|] [Defendant:] It\u2019s not. It ne\u2014, it\u2019s not gonna be over until I\u2019m laid to rest, [f] [Rowe:] Okay. [W]ell uh, you know how [to] get a hold [of] me if you wanna talk so. [f] [Defendant:] I really do .... [f] [I] really wish I could so you could just close the case but it\u2019s not that simple you know, I, I know I\u2019m not gonna get away clean, I wish I hadn\u2019t said anything. <em>But I can\u2019t live with the guilt either.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Defendant then left the station. <em>It is </em>not clear whether his identification cards were returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Between November 19 and November 21, defendant was not placed under surveillance, and he was free to move about at will. The investigators recontacted him at home on the late afternoon of November 21. Defendant \u201cinvited [them] in\u201d; whereupon Rowe explained that they wanted to hear \u201c[his] side [of] the story,\u201d but that they would leave when the conversation was over, and defendant could go about his business. Rowe did not re<em>Mirandize </em>defendant because the setting was noncustodial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">Though the officers left defendant\u2019s residence after speaking with him on November 21, Rowe admitted he intended to arrest defendant if he confessed to Andrade\u2019s murder during that interview. Defendant was immediately placed under surveillance. The next morning, the officers obtained a warrant, returned to defendant\u2019s apartment, and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">The trial court suppressed all statements made by defendant at the police station on November 19, 1996, after he first mentioned a desire to consult with counsel. However, the court ruled that the November 21, 1996, residential interview was fully admissible. The court reasoned as follows: Because defendant appeared voluntarily at the station and was free to leave at any time, the November 19 station house interview was not custodial, and <em>Miranda </em>rules were thus not technically applicable. Still, once defendant said he wanted to consult a lawyer, Redden\u2019s persistent and skillful questioning should not have occurred. However, because (1) the November 19 interview did not directly implicate <em>Miranda, </em>(2) defendant was free from custody between November 19 and November 21 in any event, and (3) the November 21 interview was itself noncustodial, the <em>Edwards </em>rule did not preclude the police recontact and did not require new <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">The Court of Appeal affirmed. It reasoned as follows: The November 19 station house interview was initially voluntary, but it became custodial once the polygraph operator accused defendant of lying about Andrade\u2019s death, thereby suggesting that defendant, who had already received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was a suspect and was not free to leave. Hence, from that point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>forward, defendant was entitled to <em>Miranda </em>protections, including the rule of <em>Edwards, supra, </em>451 U.S. 477, that once a suspect under custodial interrogation requests counsel, questioning must cease and may not be reinitiated by the police so long as custody continues. Accordingly, all statements elicited by Redden on November 19 after defendant expressed the desire for counsel were properly excluded. But the <em>Edwards </em>no-recontact rule does not apply after a substantial intervening break in custody, however \u201cpretextual.\u201d Thus, having released defendant on November 19, the police were not precluded from recontacting him on November 21. Moreover, because the November 21 interview was conducted at defendant\u2019s home, and the detectives fulfilled their promise that he was not under arrest, the interview was noncustodial, and no new <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waivers were required. Hence, all statements elicited from defendant on November 21 were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Discussion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">\u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination provided by the Fifth Amendment of the federal Constitution is protected in \u2018inherently coercive\u2019 circumstances by the requirement that a suspect not be subjected to <em>custodial </em>interrogation unless he or she knowingly and intelligently has waived the right to remain silent, to the presence of an attorney, and, if indigent, to appointed counsel. <em>(Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-445 473-474 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 1613, 1627-1628]; see <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States </em>[(2000)] 530 U.S. 428, 439-440 [120 S.Ct. 2326, 2333-2334, 147 L.Ed.2d 405] <em>[(Dickerson)] . . . </em>.) \u2018If a suspect indicates \u201cin any manner and at any stage of the process,\u201d prior to or during questioning, that he or she wishes to consult with an attorney, the defendant may not be interrogated. <em>(Miranda </em>. . . , <em>supra, </em>... at pp. 444-445 . . . ; <em>id., </em>at pp. 470, 472-474, 477-479 [citations].)\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">\u201cA suspect, having invoked these rights, is not subject to further interrogation by the police until counsel has been made available to him or her, unless the suspect personally \u2018initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations\u2019 with the authorities. <em>([Edwards, supra,] </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-485 [101 S.Ct. 1880, 1884-1885 68 L.Ed.2d 378], ..;... see also <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 171, 176-177 [111 S.Ct. 2204, 2207-2209, 115 L.Ed.2d 158] <em>[(McNeil)]; Arizona v.

He urges that a break-in-custody exception to the <em>Edwards </em>rule is inappropriate.

Defendant urges there was no intervening independent event to dispel the presumption that the second statement was obtained by exploiting the prior illegality. He asserts the November 21 statement was not voluntary, because he realized he had already \u201clet the cat out of the bag\u201d on November 19, and was not knowing and intelligent, because he received no new <em>Miranda </em>warnings before being questioned on November 21.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">\u201cIn reviewing constitutional claims of this nature, it is well established that we accept the trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts and inferences, and its evaluations of credibility, if supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>evidence.

The United States Supreme Court has since described <em>Edwards </em>as providing that, once a suspect in custody invokes his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, his or her subsequent statements to police are presumed involuntary and inadmissible if obtained pursuant to an \u201cencounter [initiated by the police] in the absence of counsel <em>(assuming there has been no break in </em>custody).\u201d <em>(McNeil, supra, </em>501 U.S. 171, 177 [111 S.Ct. 2004, 2208], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">While the high court has never directly addressed whether a break in custody vitiates the <em>Edwards </em>no-recontact rule, California cases uniformly have held or assumed that the rule barring police recontact after a <em>Miranda </em>request for counsel applies only during continuous custody. <em>(In re Bonnie H. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 563, 579-585 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 513] <em>(Bonnie H.); People </em>v. <em>Scaffidi </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 145, 152-153 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 167] <em>(Scaffidi); </em>see <em>Cunningham, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th 926, 992-993 [citing McNeil]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 128 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887] [citing <em>McNeil].)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The instant Court of Appeal concurred in these decisions.  It held that \u201c[w]hen there is a break in custody of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>sufficient length such that the suspect has time to consult with counsel or other advisors, the police may on their own initiative re-contact the suspect. This is so since the break in custody dissipates the inherently coercive effect of custody that is the basis for <em>Miranda. </em>[Citations].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">We agree. The bright-line rule of <em>Edwards </em>was \u201cdesigned to protect an <em>accused in police custody </em>from being badgered by police officers\u201d in an effort to wear the suspect down and persuade him to incriminate himself notwithstanding his earlier request for counsel\u2019s assistance. <em>(Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 1039, 1.044 [103 S.Ct. 2830, 2834, 77 L.Ed.2d 405], italics added; see also <em>Arizona v. Roberson, supra, </em>486 U.S. 675, 685 [108 S.Ct. 2093, 2100].) \u201cIf [the defendant, during custodial interrogation, invokes his or her <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, but] the police [then] release the defendant, and if the defendant has a reasonable opportunity to contact his attorney,\u201d there appears no reason under <em>Edwards </em>to forbid subsequent police contact. <em>(Dunkins v. Thigpen, supra, </em>854 F.2d 394, 397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">\u201cOnce released, the suspect is no longer under the \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 of continuous custody where there is a reasonable possibility of wearing the suspect down by badgering police tactics to the point the suspect would waive the previously invoked right to counsel. A break in custody between the first and second interrogations also provides the suspect the opportunity to speak with an attorney, family member or any person the suspect cares to consult without police constraints.\u201d <em>(Bonnie H, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 563, 583.) We therefore adopt the premise that \u201c \u2018a . . . break in custody where the defendant has a reasonable opportunity to contact his attorney [while free of custodial pressures] dissolves an <em>Edwards . . . </em>claim. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Id., at p. 582.)* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The narrow nature of our holding should be emphasized. We conclude only that <em>Edwards </em>is not violated when the police recontact a suspect after a</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>break in custody <em>which gives the suspect reasonable time and opportunity, while free from coercive custodial pressures, to consult counsel if he or she wishes to do so. </em>We do not suggest the police can avoid <em>Edwards </em>simply by allowing the suspect to step outside the station house at midnight on a Saturday, then promptly rearresting him without affording any realistic opportunity to seek counsel\u2019s assistance free of the coercive atmosphere of custody.  We are persuaded, however, that the two-day midweek hiatus at issue here, from Tuesday, November 19, 1996, to Thursday, November 21, 1996, was amply sufficient to dissipate custodial pressures and permit defendant to consult counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Defendant urges that any break-in-custody exception cannot apply when the suspect\u2019s release is a mere ruse or pretext, undertaken in bad faith, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>avoid the consequences of a prior <em>Miranda </em>violation. The Court of Appeal intimated that such considerations are irrelevant. However, we need not decide whether our analysis would change in the face of evidence of deliberate police misconduct because, as the Court of Appeal also observed, there is no such evidence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">At the outset, there is no indication the police had an advance plan to disregard defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. On the contrary, Detective Rowe\u2019s undisputed testimony indicates he \u201cbelatedly realiz[ed] that [the station house interview] was tainted\u201d (dis. opn. of Chin, <em>J,,post, </em>at p. 1041) by the failure to heed defendant\u2019s requests for counsel. Rowe halted the interview in midprogress, consulted the district attorney\u2019s office, and concluded the interview should end. Because the police had no other evidence linking defendant to the homicide, Rowe saw no legal basis to detain defendant further and concluded he <em>had no choice </em>but to release defendant. Thus, the record contains no hint that the police <em>deliberately </em>elicited an invalid confession in hopes it would help them obtain a valid confession after a break in custody, or that they released defendant <em>for the purpose </em>of manipulating the break-in-custody exception to their advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">But despite their mistakes at the station house, the police remained obligated to press their investigation of an unsolved homicide. So long as there was a true break in custody, affording defendant reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel while free of custodial influences, the police thereafter had the right to recontact him without undue delay. Hence, no \u201cbad faith\u201d or \u201cpretext\u201d arises simply because Detective Rowe had formed such an intent at the time of defendant\u2019s release. Nor was defendant misled into a false sense of security. He knew he was the prime suspect, and the police said nothing to suggest he was permanently immune from further questioning. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.) </em>Indeed, before leaving the station house, defendant acknowledged Rowe\u2019s warning that the matter was not concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">Thereafter, defendant remained at liberty, without interference by the police, for two midweek days (see fn. 8, <em>ante), </em>which gave him ample time and opportunity to rest, regroup, and obtain legal or other advice free of custodial pressure. He had the incentive to seek such help, and he had already indicated a desire for counsel\u2019s assistance. The authorities, in turn, took the risk that such a consultation would occur, and might effectively prevent them from obtaining defendant\u2019s further cooperation. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">Detectives subsequently conducted a consensual interview at defendant\u2019s apartment, at which the incriminating statements here at issue were elicited. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>Because, as defendant himself concedes, this was a <em>noncustodial </em>interview, <em>Miranda </em>procedures did not apply (see text discussion, <em>post), </em>and the interviewers thus committed no ruse or pretext by failing to obtain a new <em>Miranda </em>waiver before they questioned him. We therefore reject any suggestion that the admissions elicited at his home were obtained by deceitful or improper means.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Defendant asserts that a break-in-custody exception to <em>Edwards </em>cannot apply unless the suspect received new <em>Miranda </em>warnings before responding to police questioning following the custodial lapse. However, <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards </em>apply only to <em>custodial </em>interrogation (e.g., <em>McNeil, supra, </em>501 U.S. 171, 176-177 [111 S.Ct. 2204, 2208]; <em>Edwards, supra, </em>451 U.S. 477, 481-482 [101 S.Ct. 1880, 1883]; <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-445 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612]), and defendant concedes the November 21 interview was noncustodial. <em>Bonnie H., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 563, and <em>Scaffidi, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 145, which defendant cites for this proposition, both involved <em>custodial </em>reinterrogations after lapses in custody, and are thus inapposite.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Finally, defendant insists that no break-in-custody exception should apply where, as here, the police recontacted him after they had already obtained incriminating statements in violation of <em>Edwards. </em>But for reasons we have already discussed in other contexts, a prior <em>Edwards </em>violation, even one that produced damaging admissions, does not mandate a bright-line rule that further police contact be forbidden (or as the dissenters suggest, artificially deferred) even after a break in custody sufficient to permit contact with counsel. Instead, the admissibility of statements defendant made when the police recontacted him must be determined under rules which apply to any claim that a later statement was the <em>tainted product </em>of an earlier one obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>procedures. We proceed to a discussion of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">2. <em>Tainted product.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">Invoking the broad \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine developed in such cases as <em>Wong Sun v. United States </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 471 [83 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441] <em>(Wong Sun), </em>defendant insists his November 21 statement is the tainted \u201cfruit\u201d of the <em>Edwards </em>violation at the police station on November 19. He urges that no intervening circumstance dispelled the coercive impact of the earlier refusal to honor his request for counsel, or interrupted the chain of causation, so as to rebut the presumption that the November 21 statement was obtained by exploiting the prior illegality. Indeed, he asserts, his November 21 statement must be deemed the involuntary product of the <em>Edwards </em>violation that produced his earlier admissions.  This is so, he contends, because he had already \u201clet the cat out of the bag\u201d on November 19, thus removing all psychological incentive to remain silent on November 21. We reject these contentions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">In <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 298 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222] <em>(Elstad), </em>the high court considered whether a suspect\u2019s voluntary incriminating statement in custody, made pursuant to a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, was nonetheless inadmissible because it followed an earlier incriminating statement obtained by custodial questioning without a <em>Miranda </em>warning.  Finding that the subsequent statement need not be excluded, the <em>Elstad </em>majority held that (1) a <em>Miranda </em>violation does not require full application of the <em>Wong Sun </em>\u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine developed for Fourth Amendment violations; (2) instead, if an unwarned custodial statement was otherwise voluntary, a later statement must be deemed untainted if also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>voluntary <em>and </em>in compliance with Miranda; and (3) in determining whether the second statement was voluntary, the suspect\u2019s awareness that he had already \u201clet the cat out of the bag\u201d is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">As <em>Elstad </em>explained at length, the exclusionary rule serves different purposes under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Exclusion of statements or evidence obtained as the fruits of an unreasonable search or seizure prohibited by the Fourth Amendment is necessary to deter direct violations of that constitutional guarantee. Thus, even if a confession arising from a Fourth Amendment violation is \u201cvoluntary,\u201d that is only a \u201cthreshold requirement\u201d in determining its admissibility; \u201cthe prosecution must [further] show a sufficient break in events to undermine the inference that the confession was <em>caused </em>by the Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 306 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1291], italics added; see also <em>Taylor v. Alabama </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 687, 690 [102 S.Ct. 2664, 2667, 73 L.Ed.2d 314]; <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 590, 602 [95 S.Ct. 2254, 2261, 45 L.Ed.2d 416].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">On the other hand, the Fifth Amendment, at bottom, protects against <em>compelled </em>testimonial self-incrimination. <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny are designed to allow <em>full understanding and exercise </em>of this constitutional right in the inherently custodial atmosphere of police custody. Flowever, \u201c[t]he failure of police to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not mean that the statements received have actually been coerced, but only that courts will presume the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination has not been intelligently exercised. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 310 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1293].) Thus, such statements must be excluded even if they were <em>\u201cotherwise voluntary </em>within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 307 [105 S.Ct. at p. 1292], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">But it does not follow that the <em>fruits </em>of such an \u201cotherwise voluntary\u201d statement are invariably tainted and inadmissible. For example, according to the <em>Elstad </em>court, <em>Michigan v. Tucker </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 433, 445 [94 S.Ct. 2357, 2364, 41 L.Ed.2d 182], had held that \u201cneither the general goal of deterring improper police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence\u201d would be served by suppressing the testimony of a witness whose identity was discovered as the result of a suspect\u2019s statement in custody which, though elicited without <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was otherwise uncoerced. <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 308 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1292-1293].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">\u201cWe believe that this reasoning applies with equal force when the alleged \u2018fruit\u2019 of a noncoercive <em>Miranda </em>violation is neither a witness nor an article of evidence but the accused\u2019s own voluntary testimony. . . . Once warned, the suspect is free to exercise his own volition in deciding whether or not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>make a statement to the authorities. The Court has often noted: \u2018 \u201c[A] living witness is not to be mechanically equated with the proffer of inanimate evidentiary objects illegally seized. . . . [T]he living witness is an individual human personality whose attributes of will, perception, memory and <em>volition </em>interact to determine what testimony he will give.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 308-309 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1293], italics in <em>Elstad.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Under these circumstances, the \u201cbreak in events\u201d analysis applied to the fruits of Fourth Amendment violations is inapposite.  Where a prior custodial statement, though obtained without <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was otherwise uncoerced, any taint upon a second statement is dissipated by a determination that the second statement was itself voluntary and obtained without a <em>Miranda </em>violation. <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 310-311 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1293-1294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">Moreover, a later statement obtained in compliance with <em>Miranda, </em>and without coercive methods of interrogation, is not to be presumed involuntary simply because the suspect has already incriminated himself. \u201c \u2018[A]fter an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing, no matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed. . . . But this Court has never gone so far as to hold that making a confession under circumstances which preclude its use, perpetually disables the confessor from making a usable one after those conditions have been removed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 311 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1294], quoting <em>United States v. Bayer </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 532, 540-541 [67 S.Ct. 1394, 1398, 91 L.Ed. 1654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">Indeed, the <em>Elstad </em>majority observed, \u201c[t]his Court has never held that the psychological impact of voluntary disclosure of a guilty secret qualifies as state compulsion or compromises the voluntariness of a subsequent informed waiver. . . . When neither the initial nor the subsequent admission is coerced, little justification exists for permitting the highly probative evidence of a voluntary confession to be irretrievably lost to the factfinder. []|] There is a vast difference between the direct consequences flowing from coercion of a confession by physical violence or other deliberate means calculated to break the suspect\u2019s will and the uncertain consequences of disclosure of a \u2018guilty secret\u2019 freely given in response to an unwarned but noncoercive question . . . .\u201d <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 312 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1294-1295].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">Under such circumstances, \u201cabsent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>made an imwamed admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion. A subsequent administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement ordinarily should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement. In such circumstances, the finder of fact may reasonably conclude that the suspect made a rational and intelligent choice whether to waive or invoke his rights.\u201d <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 314 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1296].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Defendant, and the dissenters, insist <em>Elstad </em>is distinguishable. As they note, the <em>Elstad </em>majority limited its holding to cases in which the <em>Miranda </em>violation was a mere failure to provide <em>warnings </em>of the rights to silence and counsel, and expressly declined to decide whether similar rules might apply where \u201c[suspects\u2019] invocation of their rights to remain silent and to have counsel present were flatly ignored while police subjected them to continued interrogation.

Defendant and the dissenters urge that where the police elicited incriminating statements by ignoring a custodial suspect\u2019s request for counsel, the more stringent <em>Wong Sun </em>analysis must apply, and any later confession, even if otherwise valid, must be presumed the tainted product of the earlier illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">In a 1993 decision on which both defendant and the dissenters heavily rely, we applied <em>pre-Elstad </em>California precedent to conclude that when the police improperly elicit incriminating statements from a custodial suspect who has invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights, any subsequent statement by the suspect must be \u201cpresumed\u201d the tainted product of the first because the suspect has already \u201c \u2018 \u201clet the cat out of the bag by confessing.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Sims, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 405, 444-445, citing <em>People v. Johnson </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 541, 547 [75 Cal.Rptr. 401, 450 P.2d 865, 43 A.L.R.3d 366] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Spencer </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 158, 167 [57 Cal.Rptr. 163, 424 P.2d 715].) We said that, to overcome the presumption and show sufficient attenuation to dissipate the taint, the People must demonstrate \u201c \u2018at least an intervening independent act by the defendant or a third party\u2019 to break the causal chain in such a way that the second confession is not in fact obtained by exploitation of the illegality.\u201d <em>(Sims, supra, </em>at p. 445, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Sesslin </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 418, 425 [67 Cal.Rptr. 409, 439 P.2d 321] and <em>People v. Rich </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1036, 1081 [248 Cal.Rptr. 510, 755 P.2d 960].) Despite a brief reference to <em>Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298 <em>(Sims, supra, </em>at p. 446), our <em>Sims </em>opinion made no effort to address how the sharply different analysis of <em>Elstad </em>might pertain to facts like those presented by <em>Sims </em>and this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">More recently, we considered that issue. Undermining <em>Sims, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th 405, we unanimously concluded that the less stringent <em>Elstad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>\u201ctainted product\u201d analysis applies when a prior confession was obtained despite the custodial suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>request for counsel. <em>(People v. Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005, 1039-1040 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544], cert. den. <em>sub nom. Bradford v. California </em>(1997) 522 U.S. 953 [118 S.Ct. 377, 139 L.Ed.2d 293] <em>(Bradford).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">The facts of <em>Bradford </em>are instructive. In the early morning of April 19, 1988, suspect Bradford was in custody after his arrest for murder. When Detective Riehl sought to question Bradford, he refused to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights and stated he wanted a lawyer. But Riehl persisted. Riehl urged Bradford to unburden his guilty conscience, assured Bradford their conversation was off the record, and advised Bradford he was \u201csafe\u201d from a \u201clegal standpoint\u201d because he had requested an attorney. <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1026.) Bradford confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Later the same morning, while Bradford remained in custody, he was approached by Detective Hooks. Hooks again interviewed Bradford \u201coff the record,\u201d and Bradford again confessed. During the interview, Hooks pressed the theme that Bradford would feel better if he talked. Hooks also professed sympathy for Bradford\u2019s \u201cproblems,\u201d including drug and alcohol abuse, that might have contributed to the crime. Hooks suggested that, although no promises could be made and Bradford must pay for what he did, his best chance to get help for his problems was to tell his side of the story on the record. Hooks urged Bradford to contact him if he wished to do so. <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 1029-1030.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">Bradford remained in custody overnight. The next morning, April 20, 1988, he sent for Detective Arnold, indicated a willingness to talk on the record, waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and confessed once more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">Bradford moved to suppress all three confessions. The trial court found that the Riehl confession, though uncoerced, was obtained in violation of <em>Edwards. </em>The court therefore excluded this confession from the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. The court concluded that the Hooks confession stemmed from coercive police tactics, and therefore suppressed it entirely. However, the court admitted the Arnold confession for all purposes, reasoning that it was properly obtained after Bradford himself initiated contact and volunteered to talk. Bradford was convicted of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">On appeal, Bradford urged that the Arnold confession should also have been suppressed as the tainted product of the earlier <em>Edwards </em>violations. We conceded that the Riehl and Hooks interviews were improper under <em>Edwards, </em>and the confessions thereby obtained were thus properly excluded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>However, we held, this did not mean the Arnold confession also must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Noting the factual distinction between <em>Elstad </em>and Bradford\u2019s case, we nonetheless reasoned that \u201cjust as a failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not in and of itself constitute coercion <em>([Elstad], supra, </em>470 U.S. [298,] 307, fn. 1 [84 L.Ed.2d 222, 230-231]), neither does continued interrogation after a defendant has invoked his right to counsel, or an <em>Edwards </em>violation, inherently constitute coercion. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 1005, 1039.) As we explained, the <em>Edwards </em>rule simply \u201c \u2018ensures that any statement made in subsequent interrogation is not the result of coercive pressures. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>at p. 1040, quoting <em>Minnick v. Mississippi, supra, </em>498 U.S. 146, 151 [111 S.Ct. 486, 489].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Yet \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court itself has observed that \u2018the <em>Edwards </em>rule cannot be said to be a <em>sine qua non </em>of fair and accurate interrogation.\u2019 <em>(Solem v. Stumes </em>[(1984)] 465 U.S. [638,] 644.) \u2018. . . <em>Edwards </em>did not confer a substantive constitutional right that had not existed before; it \u201ccreated a protective umbrella serving to enhance a constitutional guarantee.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 644 &amp; fn. 4 [79 L.Ed. 2d at p. 588], citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">\u201cThus, we cannot conclude that an <em>Edwards </em>violation, \u2018unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period.\u2019 <em>([Elstad], supra, </em>470 U.S. [298,] 309 [84 L.Ed. 222, 232].) Rather, if the statement made after an <em>Edwards </em>violation is voluntary, \u2018the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn . . . solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 1005, 1040.) <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">We then proceeded to determine, under the totality of circumstances (see <em>Moran v. Burbine </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 412, 421 [106 S.Ct. 1135, 1140-1141, 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>L.Ed.2d 410]), whether the Riehl and Hooks confessions, though obtained in violation of <em>Edwards, </em>were voluntary. In doing so, we cautioned that while a police violation of <em>Miranda </em>is a circumstance bearing on voluntariness, a <em>Miranda </em>violation does not invariably <em>constitute </em>coercion for purposes of determining whether a subsequent statement was voluntarily given. <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 1005, 1041, citing <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1993) 507 U.S. 680, 693-694 [113 S.Ct. 1745, 1754, 123 L.Ed.2d 407]; <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly </em>(1986) 479 U.S. 157, 164, fn. 2 [107 S.Ct. 515, 520, 93 L.Ed.2d 473]; and <em>Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. 298, 307, fn. 1 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 1292].) We also admonished that \u201c[t]he Fifth Amendment is not \u2018concerned with moral and psychological pressxxres to confess emanating from soxxrces other than official coercion.\u2019 <em>([Elstad], supra, </em>... at pp. 304-305 [84 L.Ed.2d at p. 229].)\u201d <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>at p. 1041.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">After independently reviewing the evidence xxnder these standards, we concluded that defendant had voluntarily confessed to both Riehl and Hooks. We noted, as had the trial coxxrt, that the tapes of both the Riehl and Hooks interviews indicated defendant\u2019s willingness, even eagerness, to talk once told his statements were off the record. We further observed that, though the trial coxxrt was concerned about Hooks\u2019s \u201c \u2018almost outrageous\u2019 \u201d conduct in reapproaching Bradford after he requested counsel, the court had noted it was \u201c \u2018not going to the extent of saying there was coercion in the sense of a person\u2019s will was broken down.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 1005, 1042.) We agreed that though Hooks\u2019s conduct was unethical and must be \u201cstrongly disapproved,\u201d it did not \u201cdeprive [ ] [Bradford] of the ability to freely and deliberately choose to speak to either detective.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Finally, we concluded that Hooks\u2019s extensive efforts to establish rapport with Bradford did not constitute coercion. As we noted, Hooks\u2019s empathetic references to Bradford\u2019s substance abuse problems were not interrogation techniques \u201c \u2018 \u201cso offensive to a civilized system of justice that they must be condemned.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 1005, 1043.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">We further determined that in the subsequent interview with Detective Arnold, also xxndertaken in custody, Bradford had knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>right to coxmsel, and had confessed of his own free will. On the latter point, we stressed that Bradford himself had reinitiated contact with Arnold. Moreover, we pointed out, at the outset of the Arnold interview, Bradford said he had some questions, and would \u201cprobably\u201d talk, though he was not sxire. \u201cThis statement indicates, as the trial coxxrt observed, that [Bradford] did not feel that his prior statements had made his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>current confession a foregone conclusion. [Moreover,] ... the tape of this interrogation \u2018clearly indicate[d] [Bradford\u2019s] eagerness to talk . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 1005, 1043.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Similarly here, we conclude that despite any <em>Edwards </em>violation on November 19, 1996, the statements defendant made on that date were otherwise voluntary. The trial court found that though polygraph operator Redden engaged in \u201cskillful\u201d questioning after defendant expressed the need to consult counsel, Redden\u2019s tactics were not \u201covertly threatening.\u201d Indeed, the court noted, \u201c[v]iewing the videotape [of the interview], [defendant] seemed ready to talk. There were no lengthy pauses. He volunteered a lot of information to Mr. Redden at the time . . . .\u201d Moreover, the court observed, at the end of the interview, defendant expressed \u201can interest in having the detectives look at the case from his standpoint utilizing witnesses he [said] he [had], which were witnesses he repeatedly had made references to in the preceding pages. And clearly he\u2019s indicating he wants some further work done . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">The record amply supports this assessment. None of the circumstances of the November 19 interview suggest that defendant\u2019s free will was overborne by state compulsion. Defendant arrived at the station on his own, was treated courteously, was not deprived of human comforts or necessities, and was not worn down by lengthy interrogation. Though Redden did not honor defendant\u2019s request for counsel, Redden employed no interrogation techniques involving actual physical or psychological coercion. He merely offered a sympathetic ear and encouraged defendant to keep talking.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">Little encouragement was needed. Though emotional and disjointed, defendant\u2019s statement emerged in narrative form. Defendant expressed an understanding of his predicament, and he tried on several occasions to restrain himself before more damage was done, but once told he had failed the polygraph examination, he displayed a manifest eagerness to unburden his conscience. He told Redden he should not have agreed to the test, because he knew he could not lie. He insisted at several points that he wanted to help the authorities close the case. Indeed, he seemed motivated in large part by a desire to put forth a self-serving version of his role in Andrade\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Before leaving the station on November 19, defendant pressed Detective Rowe to contact witnesses who would corroborate his claims about Andrade\u2019s depressed mental state. He also told Rowe that while he wished he had not said anything, \u201cI can\u2019t live with the guilt either.\u201d Thus, there seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>no doubt that defendant\u2019s statements on November 19 stemmed not from police coercion but from his own troubled conscience, his assumption he would inevitably be caught, and a desire to minimize his culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Defendant points to his several complaints, during the November 19 interview, that he had gotten no sleep the previous night. But defendant\u2019s lack of rest was not the result of state compulsion. We have little difficulty in concluding, as the trial court implicitly did, that defendant\u2019s November 19 statement was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">The same is true of the November 21 statement. Defendant stresses that he did not recontact the detectives between November 19 and November 21, but all other signs are that he spoke with them freely. On November 19, Detective Rowe had admonished him that the matter was not concluded. Defendant had responded he realized this was so, and he had urged Rowe to investigate and confirm Andrade\u2019s suicidal depression. The trial court viewed this latter action as \u201cclearly ... an effort on [defendant\u2019s] part to reinitiate some contact with the police.\u201d Thereafter, defendant had been free for two days, with ample opportunity to consider his situation and seek help, including legal assistance, if he wished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">On November 21, the officers approached him at his home. As the trial court recited, \u201cthey knock[ed] at the door, [and] contacted] [defendant] who invite[d] them to come in and agree[d] to talk to them.\u201d \u201cThey [told] him they [would] leave . . . [a]t the conclusion of the interview, [and] they [did] leave, and he [was] free to go about his business.\u201d The interview itself lasted slightly over one hour. The detectives used no coercive tactics. As on November 19, defendant did most of the talking, while the officers interrupted only occasionally to clarify points he had made. In the interview transcript, defendant displays no agitation or hesitancy. He appears calm, prepared, and intent on presenting a coherent and sympathetic version of his claim that he assisted Andrade to commit suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">Moreover, defendant made clear on November 21 that he was not confessing simply because he had already incriminated himself on November 19. On the contrary, he said he assumed he had left telltale evidence behind, always knew he could not get away with it, and never really intended to escape, but attempted a feeble coverup only because of a human instinct for \u201cself-preservation.\u201d Indeed, defendant remarked, \u201cthe first night you were here and said you\u2019d probably want me to come down for a polygraph, . . . <em>I knew it was over.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) He indicated that his motive in talking to the officers was simply to \u201ctell[ ] you the absolute truth and try[ ] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>convince you. <em>I really felt </em>obligated.\u201d (Italics added.) Under these circumstances, we are amply persuaded that defendant\u2019s November 21 statement, like the one he gave on November 19, was voluntary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Defendant urges that the November 21 statement nonetheless fails to meet an additional requirement of <em>Elstad </em>and <em>Bradford. </em>Under those decisions, he insists, when a prior statement was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>the state must show not only that a subsequent confession was voluntary, but also that the suspect received new <em>Miranda </em>warnings and expressly rewaived the <em>Miranda </em>rights to silence and counsel. Defendant emphasizes again that the police did not <em>re-Mirandize </em>him before he was questioned on November 21, and he did not explicitly agree to give up the rights provided by <em>Miranda. </em>The dissenters, too, cite the failure to give new <em>Miranda </em>warnings as a factor weighing against any conclusion that the November 21 statement was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">However, defendant was <em>not in custody </em>on November 21. As we have previously observed, <em>Miranda </em>procedures apply only in the custodial setting. In both <em>Elstad </em>and <em>Bradford, </em>suspects requestioned by the police after prior <em>Miranda </em>violations <em>remained in custody. </em>Any suggestion in those decisions that new <em>Miranda </em>advisements and waivers were necessary must be understood in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Indeed, in <em>Elstad, </em>the suspect <em>had not </em>heard and waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights before first giving an incriminating response to custodial police questioning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>It was thus logical to hold that a <em>second </em>custodial interrogation was <em>also </em>invalid unless it was preceded by explicit <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Here the police <em>did </em>give defendant full <em>Miranda </em>warnings before they first questioned him on November 19. During that interview, defendant evidenced his understanding of his <em>Miranda </em>rights by attempting to invoke them. Moreover, he knew on November 19 that he should expect further contact with the police, and he had two intervening days to consult the lawyer he then said he wanted. A competent attorney would undoubtedly have further stressed defendant\u2019s right to silence. We conclude no new warnings and waivers were necessary here. Defendant\u2019s November 21 statement is not tainted by any <em>Edwards </em>violation that occurred two days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">The dissenters lament that, by finding defendant\u2019s November 21 statement admissible, we \u201cremove any incentive\u201d for police to honor suspects\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>rights to stop custodial questioning (dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 1040) and \u201cencourage precisely the sort of subterfuge by . . . law enforcement investigators . . . that <em>Miranda </em>sought to end\u201d (dis. opn. of George, C. J., <em>post, </em>at p. 1040.). For several reasons, we are not persuaded by these criticisms. First, as indicated, <em>we have found no evidence of ruse, subterfuge, or pretext in this case, and have limited our holding accordingly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Moreover, schemes to violate <em>Miranda </em>deliberately, then to manipulate the break-in-custody exception in hopes of obtaining valid confessions, are fraught with risks and difficulties that diminish their allure. After all, any such scheme necessarily involves the suspect\u2019s <em>release. </em>This, in turn, leaves the suspect free to learn information (including the invalidity of his prior statement) that would encourage him to refuse further cooperation when recontacted. (Indeed, in this case, defendant, who was not being observed by the police, was at large and presumably free to take flight.) Moreover, even if a later statement is obtained, the issue will inevitably arise whether its validity is tainted by the prior illegality. Considerations of this kind lead us to believe the dissenters exaggerate the enthusiasm with which police would embrace the \u201csubterfuge\u201d they envision.  Accordingly, the concerns they express do not dissuade us from our result.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Like the Court of Appeal, we conclude that the trial court did not err by admitting in evidence defendant\u2019s November 21, 1996, statement to the police. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">Werdegar, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">All unlabeled statutory references are to this code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">In the <em>unredacted </em>version of the November 21 interview, defendant referred at this point to a request by officers, made on November 4, 1996, that he take a polygraph examination. As is discussed in greater detail below, during defendant\u2019s first police interview on November 4, 1996, Detective Heilig had asked if defendant would take a polygraph examination, and defendant had agreed. On November 19, 1996, defendant came to the police station, received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and submitted to a polygraph test, in which he denied involvement in his wife\u2019s death. At a later point in the November 19 interview, after being told he had failed the test, defendant invoked his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel. All statements he thereafter made on November 19 were excluded from evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">The California Attorneys for Criminal Justice has filed an amicus curiae brief in support of defendant.

Mississippi </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 146 [111 S.Ct. 486, 112 L.Ed.2d 489], the court ruled that <em>Edwards </em>is not satisfied merely by allowing a suspect to <em>consult </em>with counsel before he is recontacted for new questioning, but that interrogation must cease until an attorney is <em>present. (Id., </em>at pp. 150-156 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 489-492].) Defendant urges <em>Minnick </em>thus undermines any conclusion that a break in custody vitiates <em>Edwards </em>so long as the suspect has a mere opportunity to contact an attorney. Several decisions have rejected the contention, noting that <em>Minnick </em>was concerned with the pressures bearing upon a suspect who had remained <em>continuously in custody </em>at the time he was reapproached by the police. <em>(Bonnie H., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 563, 583; see also, e.g., <em>Keys v. State </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1992) 606 So.2d 669, 672; <em>Com. v. Galford, supra, </em>597 N.E.2d 410, 414, in. 8; <em>Willie </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>585 So.2d 660, 667.) Again, we agree. Indeed, as we have seen, <em>McNeil, supra, </em>501 U.S. 171, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>case decided after <em>Minnick, </em>suggested that the <em>Edwards </em>no-recontact rule applies \u201cassuming there has been no break in custody.\u201d <em>(McNeil, supra, </em>at p. 177 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2208].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">Defendant also suggests that the recent decision in <em>Dickerson, supra, </em>530 U.S. 428, casts doubt on any break-in-custody exception to <em>Edwards. </em>In <em>Dickerson, </em>the high court confronted a congressional statute that purported to overrule <em>Miranda </em>in federal prosecutions. The <em>Dickerson </em>majority held that the law was invalid, because <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny are not mere prophylactic rules, adopted under a judicial supervisory power subordinate to legislative will, but are founded directly in the Fifth Amendment. <em>{Dickerson, supra., </em>at pp. 432-443 [120 S.Ct. at pp. 2330-2336].) However, nothing in <em>Dickerson </em>indicates that <em>Edwards </em>must apply to one who has not been in continuous custody. Indeed, as the <em>Dickerson </em>majority noted, the fact that judicial decisions have both expanded and contracted the <em>Miranda </em>rule over the succeeding decades \u201cillustrate[s] the principle\u2014not that <em>Miranda </em>is not a constitutional <em>rule\u2014but that no constitutional rule is immutable. </em>No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.\u201d <em>(Dickerson, supra, </em>at p. 441 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2335], italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">Justice Chin argues that \u201c[a]. . . two-day break in custody could hardly relieve defendant of the pressure of knowing he had already admitted to participating in a homicide.\u201d (Dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 1042.) But there was ample time to learn, by consultation with competent counsel, that the statements defendant had already made at the station house might well be inadmissible as proof of his guilt, and that he would thus have good reason to refuse to speak further with the police. Defendant urges he had no incentive to seek counsel\u2019s assistance because (1) Detective Rowe told him, at the conclusion of the station house interview, that the police could not legally speak to him without an attorney present, and (2) he had already \u201clet the cat out of the bag.\u201d But Rowe told defendant only that they were going to let him go home because, in light of his request for an attorney, \u201clegally . . . we can\u2019t. . . talk to [you] <em>right now.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Rowe did not state or imply that the police must avoid contact with defendant even after he left the station. Defendant knew he was the prime suspect in his wife\u2019s homicide; indeed, Rowe warned, and defendant agreed, that the matter was not concluded. We are not persuaded that, because defendant had made incriminating statements during the station house interview, he would reasonably assume there was no point in consulting a lawyer because he was beyond all legal help.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">Defendant also claims he had no reasonable opportunity to consult an attorney because he was indigent and thus without funds to pay a lawyer. But by proposing, in effect, that the break-in-custody exception should not apply to indigent persons, defendant\u2019s argument sweeps far beyond the purpose of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards </em>to dispel the <em>coercive pressures </em>of <em>custodial </em>interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Defendant notes two federal decisions which, when applying the break-in-custody exception, appeared to find it significant that renewed questioning, even in arguably noncustodial settings, was preceded by new <em>Miranda </em>advisements and waivers. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Hines, supra, </em>963 F.2d 255, 257; <em>Dunkins </em>v. <em>Thigpen, supra, </em>854 F.2d 394, 396, 398-400.) But defendant cites no case, and we are aware of none, in which a court <em>refused </em>to apply the break-in-custody exception to a <em>clearly noncustodial </em>new interview on grounds that no new <em>Miranda </em>waivers occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">Defendant briefly reasserts his theory that the detectives affirmatively <em>misled </em>him on November 21 because, by withholding <em>Miranda </em>warnings and promising he would not then be arrested, they implied that whatever he said would <em>not </em>be used against him. However, the trial court expressly found there was no \u201caffirmative misleading,\u201d because the police simply said they would leave; they made no claims that \u201ceverything [would] be okay legally speaking.\u201d We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">It must be noted that defendant did not raise this particular theory at any stage below. In the trial court, he sought to suppress his November 21 statement only on grounds that (1) the break in custody between November 19 and November 21 was a pretext to avoid the <em>Edwards </em>no-recontact rule, and (2) the detectives <em>misled </em>him on November 21 (see discussion <em>ante, </em>fn. 9). Thus, although the trial court agreed with defendant that questioning should have ceased on November 19 after he requested counsel, the court made no findings on whether the statements subsequently elicited on November 19 tainted the November 21 admissions. Similarly, defendant did not pursue this issue in the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">\u201c[A] claim [that a confession or admission to the police should be excluded from evidence] generally will not be addressed for the first time on appeal\u201d when, because of the defendant\u2019s earlier failure to raise the theory now asserted, \u201cthe parties had no incentive to fully litigate this theory . . . , and the trial court had no opportunity to resolve material factual disputes and make necessary factual findings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 339 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846]; see also <em>People v. Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 392, fn. 1 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 142, 172 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 836, 852 P.2d 331]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 519 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].) As we explain below, the question whether defendant\u2019s November 21 statement was the tainted product of his November 19 admissions centers around whether each of these statements was <em>voluntary. </em>No theory presented to the trial court directly required it to focus on these mixed questions of fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">Nonetheless, it appears the trial court did expressly or impliedly determine that each statement was voluntary, and the record amply supports those determinations. (See text discussion, <em>post.) </em>The People do not argue in this court that the tainted product theory was waived, or that they are prejudiced by defendant\u2019s failure to raise it below. We therefore proceed to consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">Defendant argues that in light of <em>Dickerson, supra, </em>530 U.S. 428, <em>Elstad </em>and <em>Bradford </em>are no longer good authority for the proposition that a less stringent tainted-product analysis applies to <em>Miranda </em>violations than to Fourth Amendment violations. Defendant asserts that <em>Elstad </em>and <em>Bradford </em>relied heavily on the traditional notion that <em>Miranda </em>procedures are not <em>direct </em>constitutional requirements, but are mere prophylactic measures designed to assure protection of Fifth Amendment rights in a custodial setting. <em>Dickerson </em>laid this erroneous premise to rest, defendant urges, by holding that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>announced a <em>constitutional </em>rule\u201d which legislation cannot supersede. <em>(Dickerson, supra, </em>at p. 444 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2336], italics added.) In fact, however, <em>Dickerson </em>laid to rest defendant\u2019s contention that <em>Elstad </em>does not survive. As the <em>Dickerson </em>majority noted, \u201c[o]ur decision in [Elstad]\u2014refusing to apply the traditional \u2018fruits\u2019 doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment cases\u2014does not prove that <em>Miranda </em>is a nonconstitutional decision, but simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment are different from unwarned interrogation under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Dickerson, supra, </em>at p. 441 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2335].) <em>Bradford, </em>of course, recognized a similar difference between Fourth Amendment and <em>Edwards </em>violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">Indeed, unlike the <em>Bradford </em>interrogators, Redden made no claim that his conversation with defendant was off the record, thereby lulling defendant into a false sense of security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The dissenters stress <em>People </em>v. <em>Montano </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 914 [277 Cal.Rptr. 327], as support for their argument that neither of defendant\u2019s statements was voluntary. We do not find <em>Montano </em>persuasive here. <em>Montano </em>relied to a considerable degree on the premise that police failures to honor a custodial suspect\u2019s invocations of his right to silence were themselves a form of actual coercion which likely carried over to a subsequent custodial confession. <em>(Montano, supra, </em>at pp. 933-937.) After <em>Montano </em>was decided, <em>Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 1005, made clear that failures to heed a suspect\u2019s invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights, standing alone, do not necessarily constitute actual coercion. <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>at pp. 1039-1041.) Moreover, <em>Montano\u2019s </em>facts differ from those of the instant case in several crucial respects. Montano, an 18-year-old illegal immigrant who spoke poor English, was arrested after midnight and grilled in the early morning hours by two skilled interrogators (one acting as interpreter). <em>(Montano, supra, </em>at pp. 920-921, 936-937.) The officers <em>agreed in advance </em>to disregard his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>(id, </em>at p. 935, &amp; fn. 6), and they used multiple psychological ploys, including an appeal to his Catholic religion, to get him to talk. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 921-929, 936-937.) He held out for an hour and a half, volunteering nothing and stating consistently, to no avail, that he did not want to discuss the crime. The interrogators said that even if the current interview ended, officers would want to talk to him again, and they pressured him into a promise that he would talk \u201ctomorrow.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 921-929.) Finally, just before 5:30 a.m., he answered \u201c \u2018[n]o\u2019 \u201d when asked whether \u201c \u2018there [is] a person . . . still in the streets that we should be looking for.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 928.) He was then booked and placed in a cell; <em>there was no break in custody. (Id., </em>at p. 929.) Less than <em>five hours </em>later, while still in custody, he gave up, summoned his jailer, and said he wanted to talk; an interview was immediately arranged, and he confessed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">It is established, of course, that statements obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>procedures, if actually voluntary, are admissible for <em>impeachment </em>in the event the defendant gives inconsistent testimony at his trial (e.g., <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Hass </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 714, 722 [95 S.Ct. 1215, 1221, 43 L.Ed.2d 570] [refusal to honor suspect\u2019s request for counsel]; <em>Harris v.

Peevy </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 1184, 1191-1205 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 865, 953 P.2d 1212]). Thus, the differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>ence between deliberate and merely negligent <em>Miranda </em>violations does not necessarily upset the delicate balance between protection of a custodial suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights on the one hand, and the legitimate use of voluntary, and thus presumably trustworthy, confessions on the other. (Cf., e.g., <em>U.S. v. Orso </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 266 F.3d 1030, 1034-1039 [officer\u2019s extraction of deliberately unwarned statement from suspect in custody does not require suppression of second, <em>Mirandized </em>custodial statement where both statements were actually voluntary].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1083-7\">KENNARD, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajk\">I concur in the majority\u2019s holding that defendant\u2019s second confession was not obtained in violation of <em>Edwards v. Arizona </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 477, 484-485 [101 S.Ct. 1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378] <em>(Edwards), </em>which requires that once a suspect in custody invokes the right to counsel, the police must cease all interrogation unless the suspect initiates further conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">Unlike the majority, however, I would not address defendant\u2019s additional claim that even if his second confession was not obtained in violation of <em>Edwards, </em>that confession was involuntary because it was the tainted product of his earlier, custodial confession. Because, as the majority concedes, defendant did not raise this claim below (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1028, fn. 10), he has not preserved it for our review. <em>(People v. Michaels </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 486, 511-512 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 285, 49 P.3d 1032]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 339 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846].) Therefore, I see no need here to apply the voluntariness analysis this court articulated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544].</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">I would apply the voluntariness analysis of <em>People v. Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pages 1039-1040, only if a defendant claims that a prerelease custodial confession taken in violation of <em>Edwards, supra, </em>451 U.S. at pages 484-485 [1015 S.Ct. at page 1885], was actually, rather than presumptively, coerced. Only then would it be necessary to apply <em>Bradford </em>to determine whether the defendant\u2019s postrelease confession is the illegal fruit of the earlier coerced confession. Here, defendant has failed to preserve a claim of actual coercion, thus obviating any need for the majority\u2019s discussion of whether his first confession was voluntary.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1083-10\">GEORGE, C.

Beyond what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>he has written, there is little to add. I write separately simply to emphasize that, regardless of the degree of one\u2019s enthusiasm concerning the prophylactic protections afforded by <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(165) 384 U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974] <em>(Miranda), </em>we are obligated to follow that decision as long as it remains the law. We should not countenance a ruse whereby <em>Miranda </em>is given judicial lip service\u2014obeyed in name but not in fact. Unfortunately, the court\u2019s opinion today will encourage precisely the sort of subterfuge by some law enforcement investigators, with the ensuing violation of constitutional rights, that <em>Miranda </em>sought to end. (See <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at pp. 454-455 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1617] [noting the various techniques in which law enforcement interrogators are trained to deflect, if not defeat, a subject\u2019s professed desire to speak with an attorney]; <em>People v.

The court\u2019s holding departs from <em>Miranda </em>and its case law progeny, in favor of approving an investigatory approach that is totally artificial in its protection of the constitutional rights accorded an accused. For these reasons, I have joined Justice Chin\u2019s dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1084-5\">CHIN, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AmG\">Few persons would welcome the prospect of suppressing a murderer\u2019s uncoerced confession. Often, and quite possibly in this case, such a confession affords the primary evidence linking the suspect to his crime. But cases do occur in which suppressing such a confession becomes not only an unwelcome and distasteful option but a constitutional necessity. This is such a case. As I will explain <em>(post, </em>at pp. 1046-1047), the majority\u2019s contrary holding will remove any incentive on the part of law enforcement officers to comply with federal constitutional decisions requiring them to terminate an interrogation once the suspect requests counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">The United States Supreme Court long ago admonished that once a suspect invokes his right to counsel, <em>further interrogation must cease </em>until counsel is afforded him, or until the suspect himself initiates further communication. <em>(Edwards v. Arizona </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 477, 484-485 [101 S.Ct. 1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378] <em>(Edwards); Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 474 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 1627, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974] <em>(Miranda)) </em>Indeed, <em>Miranda </em>could hardly be clearer on the point: \u201cIf the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>(Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 474 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>Here, the officers (acting through a police polygraph operator, Redden) read to defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights but then proceeded to ignore his continual requests for counsel and exacted statements deeply implicating him in his wife\u2019s murder, statements which, as the majority acknowledges, were inadmissible against him. After belatedly realizing that the interrogation was tainted, the officers temporarily terminated the interview, only to resume it, <em>at their own initiative, </em>at defendant\u2019s home two days later. Without providing defendant with counsel or reminding him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the officers had no difficulty whatever in exacting from him additional statements confirming his central role in his wife\u2019s murder. As the saying goes, by that time \u201cthe cat was out of the bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">The majority finds these subsequent statements, made after defendant had already confessed during an unlawful interrogation, were admissible against him because they were voluntary and noncustodial in nature, being made following a \u201cbreak in custody.\u201d (E.g., <em>In re Bonnie H. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 563, 579-585 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 513] <em>(Bonnie H.).) </em>The brealc-in-custody cases the majority cites for support are distinguishable, as each case involved defendants whose interrogations were discontinued upon their requests for counsel, <em>without ignoring those requests and eliciting any incriminatory statements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">For example, in <em>Bonnie II., </em>police officers questioned the minor concerning an apparent suicide/murder. Immediately after hearing a recitation of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, the minor requested an attorney, the interrogation stopped, and she was released from custody. Approximately a month later, the officers rearrested the minor and, after being reread her <em>Miranda </em>rights, the minor agreed to talk and made incriminating statements. <em>(Bonnie H., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at pp. 566-567.) The court found that \u201cthere was a <em>good faith </em>break in custody between this [second] police-initiated custodial session and the first. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 567, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">The <em>Bonnie H. </em>court observed that \u201cin light of the remedial purpose for the <em>Edwards </em>rule <em>[(Edwards, supra, </em>451 U.S. 477)] in preventing police badgering during custodial questioning, many jurisdictions have declined to apply the <em>Edwards </em>rule where a defendant has not been in continuous custody but is instead reinterrogated after being released from custody.

As the <em>Bonnie H. </em>court stated, \u201cOnce released, the suspect is no longer under the \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 of continuous custody where there is a reasonable possibility of wearing the suspect down by police badgering tactics to the point the suspect would waive the previously invoked right to counsel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 583.) <em>Bonnie H. </em>indicated, however, that the break in custody should be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>\u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cnot contrived or pretextual.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 584.) The court concluded that the good faith break in custody dissolved the bar to admission of the minor\u2019s statements at the second interview. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 584-585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Similarly, in <em>People v. Scaffidi </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 145 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 167], the defendant requested an attorney upon being arrested and the interrogation ceased. After release on bail, he was rearrested the next day on unrelated charges and agreed to talk to the officers without counsel. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 149.) The court, noting the temporary break in custody, invoked the \u201cnoncontinuous custody\u201d exception to the rule that all interrogation must cease once a suspect invokes his right to counsel. The <em>Scaffldi </em>court found that \u201cthere is no indication in the record that the break in custody was contrived or pretextual. ... On these facts, we hold that the <em>Edwards </em>ban was dissolved by the break with respect to defendant\u2019s request for counsel during his first custody.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 152; see also <em>Dunkins v. Thigpen </em>(11th Cir. 1988) 854 F.2d 394, 397, fn. 6 [suggesting break in custody cannot be contrived or pretextual]; Shapiro, <em>Thinking the Unthinkable: Recasting the Presumption of Edwards v. Arizona </em>(2000) 53 Okla. L.Rev. 11, 23-25, 32 (Shapiro) [critically analyzing break-in-custody rule]; Strauss, <em>Reinterrogation </em>(1995) 22 Hastings Const. L.Q. 359, 386-392 (Strauss) [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">By contrast, in the present case, defendant\u2019s first interview was terminated only after he had unsuccessfully requested counsel and thereafter had implicated himself in his wife\u2019s death by admitting he had abetted her suicide. A subsequent two-day break in custody could hardly relieve defendant of the pressure of knowing he had already admitted to participating in a homicide. As defendant himself said near the close of the November 19 interview, \u201cI\u2019ve already told you, told you too much and it\u2019s on tape. . . . ffl] You guys are gonna book me, you\u2019re gonna book me.\u201d Defendant undoubtedly realized that, having let the proverbial cat out of the bag at the November 19 interview, any break in custody would be only temporary until further interrogation, and probable arrest, ensued. Under these circumstances, we should decline to hold that defendant\u2019s statements during the resumed interview, <em>unaccompanied by renewed Miranda warnings or other intervening circumstances such as consultation with counsel, </em>were admissible merely by reason of the two-day break in custody necessitated by the officers\u2019 breach of defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. Instead, our <em>Sims </em>case should govern, and the burden pass to the prosecution to show the taint of the first confession was dispelled by some \u201cintervening independent act\u201d not present here. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 405, 445 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 853 P.2d 992], cert. den.

L.J. 1061 [noting distinction between mere failure to read suspect his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and later violating those rights once he tries to invoke them].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">In <em>Sims, </em>we addressed a similar situation, stating the applicable rules as follows: \u201cPrevious decisions have acknowledged that where\u2014as a result of improper police conduct\u2014an accused confesses, and subsequently makes another confession, it may be presumed the subsequent confession is the product of the first because of the psychological or practical disadvantages of having \u2018 \u201clet the cat out of the bag by confessing.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Notwithstanding this presumption, \u2018no court has ever \u201cgone so far as to hold that making a confession under circumstances which preclude its use, perpetually disables the confessor from making a usable one after those conditions have been removed.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Thus, the foregoing presumption is rebuttable, with the prosecution bearing the burden of establishing a break in the causative chain between the first confession and the subsequent confession. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Sims, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 444-445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\"><em>Sims </em>continued by observing that \u201c[a] subsequent confession is not the tainted product of the first merely because, \u2018but for\u2019 the improper police conduct, the subsequent confession would not have been obtained. [Citation.] As the United States Supreme Court has explained: \u2018[N]ot ... all evidence is \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u201cwhether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] The degree of attenuation that suffices to dissipate the taint \u2018requires at least an intervening independent act by the defendant or a third party\u2019 to break the causal chain in such a way that the second confession is not in fact obtained by exploitation of the illegality. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Sims, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">The <em>Sims </em>court concluded the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements in that case were \u201csufficiently attenuated\u201d from the earlier interrogation so as to be free of the taint of the earlier impropriety: The subsequent confession was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>elicited only after <em>defendant unilaterally initiated </em>further communication the following day, specifically requesting to speak with the officers. <em>(Sims, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 445-446.) Furthermore, before the renewed interrogation occurred, the defendant in <em>Sims </em>was <em>readvised of his Miranda rights, </em>and he expressly waived those rights, \u201cthereby further dissipating any taint of the improper police conduct that had occurred the preceding day. (See <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 298 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222] <em>[(Elstad)].)\u201d (Sims, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 446.) Neither of these circumstances was present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">The majority in the present case argues that <em>Sims\u2019s </em>\u201ctainted product\u201d analysis has been called in question by the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Elstad. </em>Not so. First, <em>Sims </em>was well aware of <em>Elstad </em>and cited it in its opinion. <em>(Sims, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 446.) Second, <em>Elstad </em>expressly limited its holding to <em>unwarned </em>statements and indicated the rule might well be different if the police had exacted a confession <em>after improperly ignoring the suspect\u2019s requests for counsel. </em>(See <em>Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at pp. 312-313, fn. 3 [105 S.Ct. at p. 1295].) The majority, relying on <em>People v. Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544] <em>(Bradford), </em>suggests that <em>Sims\u2019s </em>\u201ctainted product\u201d analysis has been replaced by a simple \u201cvoluntary confession\u201d test that asks whether, despite the initial <em>Miranda </em>violation, the subsequent confession was knowingly and voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">In <em>Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at page 1040, relying on <em>Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at page 309 [105 S.Ct. at page 1293], we qualified <em>Sims </em>by observing that \u201cif the statement made after an <em>Edwards [(Edwards, supra, </em>451 U.S. 477)] violation is voluntary, \u2018the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d We noted that <em>Sims </em>had used a more stringent \u201c\u2018tainted product\u2019\u201d analysis, but we stated that after <em>Elstad </em>\u201cit is not necessary to do so when the statement immediately following the <em>Edwards </em>violation is voluntary.\u201d <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1041, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">Relying on <em>Bradford </em>and <em>Elstad, </em>the majority assumes that the \u201cpoisonous tree\u201d and \u201ccat-out-of-the-bag\u201d doctrines have no application to <em>Miranda </em>violations. (See <em>People v. Carpenter </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1016, 1040 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 988 P.2d 531] [acknowledging but not deciding issue].) As we noted in <em>Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pages 1039 to 1041, <em>Elstad </em>did question whether these Fourth Amendment doctrines necessarily applied to every police interrogation in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>(See <em>Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at pp. 306-313 [105 S.Ct. at pp. 1291-1296].) But <em>Elstad\u2019s </em>actual holding is not so broad as the majority assumes. <em>Elstad </em>merely held that a suspect who has once incriminated himself in response to \u201cunwarned\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>uncoercive questioning is not thereby forever disabled from waiving his rights and confessing \u201cafter he has been given the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d (El<em>stad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at p. 318 [105 S.Ct. at p. 1298]; <em>see People v. Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 831 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2] [\u201cadmissions made pursuant to full <em>Miranda </em>waivers may not be suppressed because of prior <em>Miranda </em>violations unless the later admissions were <em>in fact </em>involuntary,\u201d citing <em>Elstad].) </em>In other words, in <em>Elstad, </em>the high court deemed that the proper and timely administration of these warnings presumably would disperse any lingering coercive pressures on the suspect arising from his initial unwarned statement. <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at pp. 311-314 [105 S.Ct. at pp. 1294-1296].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">As <em>Elstad </em>stated, \u201cIt is an unwarranted extension of <em>Miranda </em>to hold that <em>a simple failure to administer warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, </em>so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary <em>and informed </em>waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period. Though <em>Miranda </em>requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at p. 309 [105 S.Ct. at p. 1293], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Significantly, the majority in <em>Elstad </em>expressly distinguished cases involving continued interrogation after a request for counsel, suggesting the rule would be different in such a case. <em>(Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at pp. 312-313, fn. 3 [105 S.Ct. at p. 1295].) As the <em>Elstad </em>majority observed \u201cinapposite are the cases the dissent cites concerning suspects whose invocation of their rights to remain silent <em>and to have counsel present </em>were flatly ignored while police subjected them to continued interrogation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 313, fn. 3 [105 S.Ct. at p. 1295], italics added.) Accordingly, I seriously question <em>Bradford'' </em>s suggestion that, following <em>Elstad, </em>continued interrogation after invocation of right to counsel is not \u201cinherently\u201d coercive. <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 1039-1040.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">We have uncovered several cases from other states that support the foregoing conclusion regarding <em>Elstad </em>and its limits. <em>(State v. Hartley </em>(1986) 103 N.J. 252 [511 A.2d 80, 90-93]; <em>State v. Crump </em>(Tenn. 1992) 834 S.W.2d 265, 270-271; cf. <em>State v. Fuller </em>(1990) 118 N.J. 75 [570 A.2d 429].) In <em>Hartley, </em>for example, the New Jersey Supreme Court, in a well-reasoned opinion, stressed the important \u201cqualitative difference\u201d between a mere failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings and a failure to honor them once the suspect has attempted to assert them. <em>(Hartley, supra, </em>511 A.2d at pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>90-91.) <em>Hartley </em>carefully analyzed <em>Elstad </em>and explained that its holding was inapplicable to cases involving suspects whose invocation of their <em>Miranda </em>rights was flatly ignored while police continued to interrogate them. <em>(Hartley, supra, </em>at pp. 92-93.) <em>Hartley </em>likewise recognized that Elstad\u2019s reluctance to apply the \u201ccat-out-of-the-bag\u201d principle was limited to cases involving mere failures to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings and not actual refusals to honor the invocation of those rights. <em>(Hartley, supra, </em>at pp. 96-97.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">The majority\u2019s analysis is not only unsupported by the pertinent case law, but it is wholly unacceptable as a rule of law because it removes any incentive on the part of law enforcement officers to comply with <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards </em>by terminating the initial interrogation once the suspect requests counsel. Henceforth, thanks to today\u2019s holding, police officers will have carte blanche to ignore <em>Miranda/Edwards, </em>having nothing to lose, and a useable confession to gain, if they simply disregard the suspect\u2019s requests for counsel, continue until they procure an unlawful confession, terminate the interrogation, and resume it soon thereafter in a supposedly \u201cnoncustodial\u201d setting, without giving the suspect the benefit of fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">We would be naive to assume that law enforcement agencies will not take advantage of the new evidentiary door the majority\u2019s holding would helpfully open for them. As Justice Brown observed in her concurring and dissenting opinion in a recent search and seizure case, \u201c[f]rom what we know of human nature, this observation seems unassailable: for every inch given, a mile will be taken.\u201d <em>(People v. McKay </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 601, 628 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 41 P.3d 59] (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Brown, J.); see also <em>U.S. v. Orso </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 275 F.3d 1190, 1194, 1196-1197 (dis. opn. of Trott, J.) <em>(Orso).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">As Judge Trott explained in his dissent in <em>Orso, </em>involving a suspect who was tricked by police into making an unwarned statement followed shortly by a warned one, by reason of the <em>Orso </em>majority decision, \u201cthe practice of purposefully interrogating a suspect without advising her of her rights may become commonplace. The message from <em>Orso </em>will resonate far and wide: violate the Constitution, do so intentionally, flout the dictates of the Supreme Court, and nevertheless, the targeted plunder of your purposefully lawless behavior can be used against the victim of the glaring official transgression.\u201d <em>(Orso, supra, </em>275 F.3d at p. 1194 (dis. opn. of Trott, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Judge Trott continued by observing that \u201c[a]fter our limited en banc court\u2019s decision, there will be reduced incentive for trainers to instruct students at the academies to comply with <em>Miranda. </em>Rather, <em>Orso </em>provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>strong incentive for law enforcement to ignore <em>Miranda, </em>interrogate a suspect without overbearing her will, and then rely on <em>Orso </em>to sanitize the transgression. [f] Indeed, <em>Orso </em>provides bullet-proof armor to\u2014and may embolden\u2014some determined police trainers who have for years sought to circumvent <em>Miranda </em>with impunity. See Charles D. Weisselberg, <em>In the Stationhouse after Dickerson, 99 </em>Mich. L.Rev. 1121 (2001) (cataloging myriad ways police have devised over the years to defeat <em>Miranda)\u201d (Orso, supra, </em>275 F.3d at p. 1196 (dis. opn. of Trott, J.).) Predictably, the majority\u2019s holding in the present case will provide even stronger disincentives to complying with <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Let me stress what the present case is <em>not </em>about. This is not a case, such as <em>Orso </em>or <em>Elstad, </em>involving mere failures to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings, or even a failure to terminate questioning once the suspect had invoked his right to remain silent. In this case, the officers exacted defendant\u2019s initial confession <em>after he had requested the assistance of counsel, </em>a far more serious violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, and one which the high court in <em>Elstad </em>expressly found beyond the scope of its holding (see <em>Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at pp. 312-313, fn. 3 [105 S.Ct. at p. 1295]). In my view, we must recognize and deal with the taint arising from the earlier unlawful confession. Although the cat-out-of-the-bag clich\u00e9 may seem trite, it also seems quite apt here, for defendant certainly would not have so readily confirmed his earlier confession had he never made it in the first place, and he never would have made it had the officers honored his initial request for counsel and terminated their interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">I do not propose a rule that would forever bar police from reinitiating an interrogation once a break in custody has occurred. The correct test, under <em>Sims, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at pages 444-445, is whether any intervening independent act occurred sufficient to dissipate the taint of the earlier interrogation and demonstrate that the second confession was indeed knowing and voluntary. A reasonably long break in custody would be a relevant factor. So would the fact that the suspect initiated the interview, or that the officers gave fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings, including the right to counsel\u2019s presence, before the interview commenced. Various other factors are likewise relevant to the inquiry. But the mere fact the reinterrogation occurred in a noncustodial setting should be only one such factor in the voluntariness equation, not the conclusive one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Here, the \u201cvoluntariness factors\u201d strongly point to a finding of involuntariness as a matter of law. Under the circumstances here, including defendant\u2019s repeated and unavailing requests for counsel during his initial interview, his highly incriminating and inadmissible statements made at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>time, and the subsequent failure to readvise him, the subsequent resumption of interrogation two days later clearly was strategically aimed at gathering new, admissible incriminatory statements in a supposedly noncustodial setting without readmonishing defendant of his right to counsel. Having already \u201clet the cat out of the bag\u201d regarding his wife\u2019s murder, defendant\u2019s subsequent admissions to the officers, made without the benefit of fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings, should be deemed either involuntary (see <em>Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1040) or the tainted fruit of the poisonous tree <em>(Sims, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 444-447).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Moreover, the record shows no intervening independent act sufficient to dissipate the taint of the earlier interrogation or break the causal chain, or the \u201cinherent pressures\u201d arising from the initial <em>Miranda </em>violation, so that we may say with confidence that defendant\u2019s second confession was voluntary and not obtained by exploiting his earlier admissions. Although the subsequent interview occurred in defendant\u2019s home rather than at the police station, it occurred only two days after the earlier interrogation, and the record fails to indicate that in the meantime defendant had contacted an attorney or conferred with friends or family. (See <em>Montano, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 937-939 [stressing importance of such factors as (1) the giving of renewed <em>Miranda </em>warnings, (2) the temporal proximity of the unlawful coercive police tactics and the new confession, (3) the presence of intervening circumstances such as the defendant\u2019s initiation of renewed contact or his ability to consult with an attorney or others, and (4) the officers\u2019 purpose to secure an admissible confession]; see also <em>People v. Beardslee, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 109.) Each of the <em>Montano </em>factors tends to lead to the conclusion that the challenged statement was involuntary and illegally obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">As stated in <em>Montano, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at page 939, \u201cBased on the circumstances detailed above, the psychologically coercive illegalities of the first interrogation were the motivating cause of the damaging admissions, and of the subsequent confession. [Citations.]\u201d (See also <em>Minnick v. Mississippi </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 146, 153 [111 S.Ct. 486, 491, 112 L.Ed.2d 489] [subsequent consultation with counsel is no substitute for presence of counsel at interrogation]; Shapiro, <em>supra, </em>53 Okla.

As I have observed, the majority\u2019s contrary holding will render wholly ineffective the prophylactic protections afforded by <em>Miranda/Edwards, </em>eliminating any inducement on the part of law enforcement officers to comply with those decisions despite the suspect\u2019s request for counsel.
