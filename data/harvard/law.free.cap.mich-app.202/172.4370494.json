He was sentenced to three to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for the former conviction and eight to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for the latter conviction. He appeals as of right. We affirm. This case has been decided without oral argument pursuant to MCR 7.214(E)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Given the circumstances of the offense and the offender, we hold that defendant\u2019s eight-year minimum sentence for his child sexually abusive activity conviction does not violate the principle of proportionality. <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Defendant\u2019s failure to challenge the accuracy of the information contained in the presentence report at sentencing precludes appellate review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>this issue. <em>People v Sharp, </em>192 Mich App 501, 503-504; 481 NW2d 773 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Likewise, defendant\u2019s failure to challenge the constitutionality of the child sexually abusive activity statute before the trial court also normally would preclude appellate review. See <em>People v Ghosh, </em>188 Mich App 545, 546; 470 NW2d 497 (1991). However, because an important constitutional question is involved, we will review the issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Defendant claims the child sexually abusive activity statute, MCL 750.145c(2); MSA 28.342a(2), is unconstitutional because it is overbroad. Specifically, he asserts that the statute\u2019s prohibition against \"erotic nudity\u201d involving children is over-broad because it could encompass protected forms of free speech, such as the innocent photograph of a nude child by its parents. We disagree. The statutory definition of erotic nudity does not encompass the depiction of all child nudity. Rather, it is narrowly defined to exclude those depictions that have a \"primary literary, artistic, educational, political, or scientific value\u201d and that do not appeal to the prurient interests in sex. MCL 750.145c(1)(d); MSA 28.342a(1)(d). Because the definition is narrowly drawn so that protected forms of free speech are not punished, the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad. <em>New York v Ferber, </em>458 US 747; 102 S Ct 3348; 73 L Ed 2d 1113 (1982); <em>Broadrick v Oklahoma, </em>413 US 601; 93 S Ct 2908; 37 L Ed 2d 830 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
