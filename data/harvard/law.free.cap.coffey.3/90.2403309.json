The will, set forth in the opinion below, was admitted to probate on October 5, 1891.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">On May 11, 1892, Charles L. Fair filed a petition wherein he alleged that his brother, James G. Fair, Jr., had died on February 12, 1892, under the age of thirty years, and without wife or lawful issue surviving him. He further alleged that by the terms of the will the testatrix bequeathed the sum of $500,000 to James G. Fair, Jr., and directed that the same be paid to him when he shall have attained the age of thirty-five years, and that, in case he should die without wife or lawful issue surviving him, the portion by said will so allotted to him should be paid to petitioner, and that petitioner is entitled to receive said sum of $500,000, and he prayed for distribution thereof to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-10\">At the time this petition was filed Charles L. Fair was twenty-five years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-11\">In the answer to the petition the executors alleged that it was the intention of the testatrix, by her will, to prohibit petitioner from receiving any portion of her estate, and the executors from paying to him any portion of her estate, prior to his attaining the age of thirty years, except the monthly allowance of $500 specified in the will.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>W.

Fair, Jr., as his portion of the estate of Theresa Fair, deceased, their mother, the said James having died long before his portion or that of Charles could by the terms of the will become due and payable had James lived?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The petitioner claims that under the will the portion allotted to James should be paid at once to him, while the respondents contend that immediate payment thereof is forbidden by its terms, and that the trustees cannot comply with the demands of the petitioner without violating their trust as defined by the testatrix in her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The petitioner, Charles L. Fair, bases his claim of the right to have paid to him without delay the share primarily allotted to James upon two clauses of the will as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">\u201cI give and bequeath to my son, James Graham Fair, Jr., the sum of $500,000, and direct the same to be paid to him when he shall have attained the age of thirty-five years, but not before then, and that meantime there shall be paid to him monthly the sum of $500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\u201cIn case my said son, James Graham Fair, Jr., die without wife or lawful issue surviving him, the portion hereby allotted to him shall be paid to my said son, Charles Lewis Fair, if living, and, if not living, then to his surviving wife or lawful issue, if any there be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The will of the testatrix reads in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">\u201cIn the name of God, Amen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">\u201cI, Theresa Fair, of the City and County of San Francisco, and State of California, of the age of forty years and upwards, and being of sound mind and memory, do make, publish and declare this my last will and testament in manner following, that is to say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201cI hereby give, bequeath and devise all my real and personal estate, of what nature or kind soever and wheresoever situated, to John W.

(Seal.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Attestation clause and witnesses\u2019 subscription follow in due form of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The intention of the testatrix, as gathered from the whole scheme of the will and all its provisions, must prevail; and such a construction must be put upon that instrument as will uphold all its provisions and enable the trustees to perform each and all of the trusts imposed upon them thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The scheme of the testatrix was to make provision for each of the children in the form of a temporary monthly allowance, and to give them full possession of the principal sum bequeathed to them when they should attain a certain prescribed age. The one purpose of the testatrix appears to have been to make adequate provision for the children and their maintenance in life. The postponement of possession of their legacies was a precautionary measure to guard against the principal sum being lost or wasted, and the legatees being left without provision for their maintenance. This purpose is manifested in the will, and forms its prominent feature; but although the attention of the testatrix was bent upon this subject, petitioner\u2019s counsel contends that she did not think proper to continue to apply the same protective measures to legacies payable over to a survivor, and counsel conjectures that her reason may have been that such measures were not necessary, inasmuch as such survivor had already been protected to the extent of his original legacy, which would be preserved in any event, and so no disastrous consequence would ensue, even if the original legacy should be lost or wasted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">This will is in writing, and is required by law so to be. Its phraseology, as well as extrinsic evidence, shows that it was prepared by an attorney. The intendment must be that the will, as written, correctly manifests the intention of the testatrix, and the whole thereof. The express words of the will are that in case of the death of James \u201cthe portion allotted to him shall be paid to my son, Charles Lewis Fair, if living,\u201d and counsel for petitioner claims that to annex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the further condition\u2014\u201cand if he be then of the age of thirty years\u201d\u2014would be manifestly to add-to and vary the terms of the will. This cannot be done, says the counsel, even if it were conceded or absolutely demonstrated as an ' extrinsic fact that the testatrix intended the gift to be so conditioned or limited. It is not the intention simply, but the expressed intention, of the testatrix to which effect must be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\">There are here two separate legacies; one is given to James directly, the other is given to Charles directly. By virtue of subsequent clauses of the will, in the ease of death, the one succeeds to the other\u2019s legacy. Charles claims this $500,0.00, not under the clause making original provision for him, but under the subsequent clause substituting him for his brother as to the latter\u2019s legacy. By what authority, asks the counsel for petitioner, can a limitation annexed to the first legacy only be engrafted upon the second also? Such, the counsel asserts, is not the expressed will of the testatrix\u2014to say that she so intended, or that such would be in harmony with her general purpose, is to indulge in mere conjecture. It may or may not have been <em>so; </em>the actual intent cannot now be positively ascertained. The court is confined to the will as it is \u25a0 written.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The court cannot agree with counsel for petitioner in his contention that the actual intent of the testatrix cannot be ascertained from the will as it is written. On the contrary, the design and scheme of the testatrix are ascertainable and expressed with sufficient clearness, if not with absolute accuracy of verbal expression. The design and scheme were, without doubt, as gathered from the entire instrument, to secure to the children, upon attaining a certain age, the full possession and enjoyment of the portion of the estate allotted to them, and meanwhile to secure to them an income'sufficient to support their station in society.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It is clear to the court, from the study of the whole will, that James was not to enter into the enjoyment of his portion until he should have reached the age of thirty-five years, nor Charles until thirty years, and that neither was to have more than a monthly allowance until the expiration of either period. To give to either before that point of time any por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>tion of the capital would be to violate the intention of the testatrix. In carrying this intention into effect it is permissible to resort to any reasonable intendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">It should seem unnecessary to quote the commonplaces of construction in this connection, as, for example, that the interpretation of a will must depend upon the intention of the testator, to be ascertained from a full view of everything contained within the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the instrument; or, that all the parts of a will are to be construed in relation to each other, and so as, if possible, to form one consistent whole; or, that an intent inferable from the language of a particular clause may be qualified or changed by other portions of the will evincing a different intent, for the substance and intent, rather than words, are to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The intention of the testatrix is the first and great object of inquiry, and to this object technical rules to a certain extent are made subservient.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">It is a cardinal rule of construction that effect must be given, if possible, to every part of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">There is, perhaps, no rule of construction of wider application of wills, or which oftener requires to be acted upon, than that every portion of the instrument must be made to have its just operation, unless there arises some invincible repugnance, or else some portion is absolutely unintelligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">. Applying these familiar principles and rules to this will, it is manifest that the testatrix imposed upon each of the legatees a period of waiting for the enjoyment of -their legacies, except the monthly allowances, which is not only binding upon the legatees, but also upon the trustees whose duties under the will are therein defined with as much precision as the rights of. the legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">No reason can be imagined why the testatrix should have been less solicitous concerning the $500,000 in question than concerning the $500,000 primarily given by her to the petitioner, or why she should intend to make any distinction between the two sums as to the term of waiting. It seems to the court that in order to' set aside or modify the rule of waiting imposed by the will, plain and specific language should be discovered in that instrument manifesting an intention on the part of the testatrix so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The clause in the will upon which the petitioner relies for immediate payment of the legacy in question contains no word indicating when the trustees shall pay the amount. Nor does that clause define the time when the death of the legatee, James, must occur in order that his share may become payable to Charles. The clause is elliptical both in respect of when the death of James must occur and when the share upon the occurrence of his death must be paid by the trustees to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\">It is certain that the testatrix did not intend that in ease James died after having attained the age of thirty-five years, and after having been put in possession of the legacy by the trustees, it should ever revert to the petitioner or be called back into the hands of the trustees. The time when the death of James must occur to entitle Charles to be paid this share becomes necessarily a matter of construction and interpretation upon the reading and consideration of every other clause in the will. So, it may be said of the time when the trustees should pay to the petitioner the share allotted to James, it is a matter to be gathered from all the provisions contained in the will, and its general purport and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">It seems to the court that no one can read the clauses of the will preceding that upon which the petitioner relies without being convinced that the testatrix had no intention of authorizing the payment to Charles of anything mentioned in the will, except the monthly allowance, prior to his attaining the age of thirty (30) years; and that the will must .be read as an entirety, and the conditions and limitations which precede the clause relied upon must be applied thereto, and, when so read, the will is destructive of the claim of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">It is the opinion of the court that the clause relied upon by the petitioner cannot be isolated from the context and construed as a separable section of the testament, but that it must be read and construed as an integral portion of that instrument, to be interpreted with the other constituents of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">It follows that the petition for partial distribution filed herein is prematurely presented, and should be and it is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The Principal Case was Affirmed in 103 Cal. 342, 37 Pac. 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">In Construing a Will the Intention of the Testator should govern, and that intention should be ascertained from the words of the will itself: Estate of Hale, 2 Cof. Pro. Dec. 191; Estate of Pearsons, 2 Cof. Pro. Dec. 250; Estate of Berton, 2 Cof. Pro. Dec. 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">All Parts of a Will Should be Considered in relation to each other, so as to form one consistent whole. Every portion of the instrument should be made to have its just operation, if possible: Estate of Maxwell, 1 Cof. Pro. Dec. 145; Estate of Behrmann, 2 Cof. Pro. Dec. 513; Estate of Berton, 2 Cof.
