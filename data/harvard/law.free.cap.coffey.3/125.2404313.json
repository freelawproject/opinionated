The judgment debtor died on January 26, 1890, leaving a will, and on February 26, 1890, letters testamentary were- issued to Ellen Mallon, his widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-13\">On November 11, 1890, the judgment creditors filed their claim on the judgment, which claim had theretofore been duly presented, allowed and approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>On May 29, 1893, the judgment creditors filed a petition for an order requiring the executrix to pay their claim with interest, alleging that the claim was unpaid, and that she had sufficient money of the estate in her hands to pay the same, and that it is a preferred claim. After a hearing the claim was established as a preferred claim, and the executrix was ordered to pay the same, with interest from January 11, 1890.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-3\">Roger Johnson, for the petitioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-4\">M.

Hall, 19 Cal. 98; Estate of Glenn, 74 Cal. 567, 16 Pac. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">So that, in order to ascertain the amount of a claim at any particular date, we add to its face the accrued interest to the desired date, limiting that interest to seven per cent when the estate is insolvent: Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1494.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">In consequence of this the \u201cdebt\u201d which is preferred by section <em>1643 is </em>the judgment or mortgage plus interest to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>date of payment. And this \u201cdebt\u201d must be paid in full, if it is preferred, before any \u201cdebt\u201d of a lower class is paid either partially or at all: Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1645.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The word \u201cdebt\u201d used in those two sections has a settled meaning, and always includes interest on interest-bearing obligations: Brown v. Lamb, 6 Met. 203; Gray v. Bennett, 3 Met. 522, 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In Quivey v. Hall, 19 Cal. 98, it was held, where a judgment rendered against decedent in his lifetime was presented as a claim against his estate and rejected and suit brought on it, the judgment against the administrator was properly given for the amount of the judgment and interest to date of rendition of judgment as administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">So that if this claim had been rejected, and claimant had sued the executrix, he would have recovered what he claims now, with the right to priority over the general debts of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">It will be conceded that claimant would be entitled to this accrued interest if the estate was solvent, and it seems that the burden devolves on the executrix to show a different rule, if there be one, regarding an alleged insolvent estate\u2014the only distinction appearing from the statute to be that debts of all classes shall bear but seven per cent interest if the estate is insolvent: Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1494.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
