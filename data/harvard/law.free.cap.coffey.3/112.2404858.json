The witnesses to the will were J. D. Sullivan (subsequently, and since, and now the attorney for the executor), and W. F. Empey. Mr. Sullivan, as subscribing witness, testified upon the probate of the will; and upon the same occasion the executor named in the will, Daniel Sylvester, testified that the decedent testator left personal property valued at $11,275 within the jurisdiction of the court, and the order admitting the will to probate so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On December 28, 1881, it was ordered that notice to the creditors of said decedent, \u201cpursuant to section 1490 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\u201d be published once a week for ten weeks. This order was made, entered and filed on the day of its date. It does not appear from the record that any notice was ever published; nor does it appear that any claims were ever presented to or allowed by the court, or that any order of the court was ever made for the payment of any claims, debts or bequests.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">On May 29, 1882, there was filed a paper indorsed \u201cInventory,\u201d and signed \u201cDaniel Sylvester, Administrator of the Estate of John Sylvester, Deceased,\u201d which, after the title of the court and the estate, was in the following words and figures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201cInventory of property belonging to the estate of said John Sylvester, deceased, which has come into the hands of the administrator:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\"Cash on deposit in the Bank of California......$11,521.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">Three horses, value of two estimated at $150 each 300.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">One of the value of.......................... 25.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Two wagons and harness for the same, valued at</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">$100................................... <em>100.00</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">And one valued at........................... 75.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">$12,021.75\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">It does not appear that any appraisement was ever made as required by law: Code Civ.

This form of order lacks the signature of the judge. The written part is in the same handwriting as the account, and was evidently prepared by the same person for the judge\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">No further proceedings appear to have been had in said estate until the sixth day of April, 1892, when Susannah Sylvester, widow of the decedent testator, and one of the residuary legatees named in the will, and as such interested therein, prayed this court for a citation compelling said executor forthwith to file a full and final account of his administration of said estate, whereupon the court ordered citation to issue, and the same did issue upon the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In apparent obedience to this citation, there was filed on April 18, 1892, a paper indorsed \u2018 \u2018 Second Account of Executor,\u201d which recited that \u201cthe whole estate which has come to hands of executor, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\u201cAn interest in the partnership existing between the said deceased and the undersigned executor as per inventory this day filed herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201c1881.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">Or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">Dee. 15.

On the same day, April 18, 1892, there was filed what purported to be a \u201cReport of Administration by Executor,\u2019\u2019 which recited that at the time of the death of said deceased, and for some time prior thereto, said deceased was engaged in the cattle butchering business in said city and county as a partner of this affiant; that the only property left by said deceased consisted of an interest in said business; that the only property belonging to the said partnership is described in the inventory this day filed herein; that after the death of the said deceased the executor, as surviving partner, continued for some time to conduct the said business, and, in conducting the same, paid a number of claims contracted by the said partnership <em>before </em>the death of said deceased, including the claim of James Duncan for the sum of $900. and the claim of George Metzger for the sum of $1,100, and also other claims against the said partnership; that the claims of the Odd Fellows \u2019 Association for the sum of $350, and the claim of G. Y. Metzger for the sum of $1,100, have been presented to the executor and allowed by him, and filed herein on the twentieth day of July, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">It is not stated, and it does not appear, that the claims mentioned were ever presented to the court, and it is the fact that they were not approved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">On the same day, April 18, 1892, there was filed a paper entitled \u201cAmended Inventory of Estate of said Deceased,\u201d which stated that \u201cthe whole of the estate of said deceased at the time of his death consisted of an interest as partner in a cattle butchering business conducted by said deceased and the executor as partners. The said John Sylvester invested in said business the sum of $1,100, and the executor the sum of $8,000. There was no time mentigned during which the said partnership should continue; but the profits thereof were to be divided between the partners in proportion to the amount invested by each. At the time of the death of said deceased the said partnership was the owner of the following property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u201cCash on deposit in the Bank of California......$11,521.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">Three horses; two horses; harness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">This \u201cAmended Inventory\u201d was verified in usual form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">On April 30, 1892, Susannah Sylvester, the widow, and one of the heirs at law and residuary legatees as aforesaid of deceased, filed a contest and exceptions to the account filed April 18, 1892, upon the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">1: That the executor did not charge himself with the cash sum of $11,521.75, received by him, belonging to said estate, as shown by the inventory of said estate filed herein on the twenty-ninth day of May, 1882, or with any of the other property of the said estate mentioned in said inventory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">2. That the executor did not in said account\u2014\u201cSecond Account\u201d\u2014charge himself with the sum of $10,077.75, the balance of cash in his hands belonging to said estate on June 12, 1882, as shown by the account filed by him on that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">3. That the executor did not, in said \u201cSecond Account,\u201d charge himself with the proceeds of any settlement or liquidation of the partnership interest therein mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">4. That the executor did not, in said account, charge himself with any interest upon any of the money received by him belonging to said estate, whereas all of such money so received by-him, except such portion, if any, as may have been expended by him in the payment of proper charges against said estate, was, as believed and alleged, appropriated by him to his own use, and he is chargeable with interest thereon, at legal rate, compounded annually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">5. That the executor, in said \u201cSecond Account,\u201d improperly claimed credit for disbursements for which he produced no voucher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">6. The contestant further objected to the item of $3,000, for which credit is claimed in said account, as cash paid to contestants Susannah- and Louis Sylvester, upon the ground that, so far as the same was made up of money paid to Louis, it was not a proper charge against the estate, and upon the further ground that no such sum of money, and no sum of money whatever in excess of the sum of $710, has ever been paid to said contestant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">7. Contestant finally contested the item of the claim of the Odd Fellows\u2019 Association, $350, and G. Y. Metzger for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the sum of $1,100, as mentioned in the report accompanying said \u201cSecond Account,\u201d as not proper charges against the said estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">After many days of trial upon the said \u201cSecond Account\u201d and the exceptions, the same were submitted for the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Each of the respective counsel\u2014Edward C. Harrison, Esq., for contestant, and Jeremiah D. Sullivan, Esq., for executor \u2014presented his view in writing of what he considered the result of the evidence and proof. These views are widely variant and impossible of reconcilement. The executor claims that the estate is in debt to him, and that he, a man of acknowledged integrity and standing in the community, is the victim of a good heart, of unbounded confidence in his own kindred, giving them money when they needed it, and now, that he has refused to pay any further, they have brought this proceeding. To \u201cpay\u201d implies obligation and indebtedness, and if the executor owed nothing to contestant he has used an inapt term.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Executor\u2019s counsel asserts that \u201cthe staleness of this claim of contestant is an argument against it,\u201d and the counsel exclaims that \u201cit is inconceivable how she should have allowed this matter to go for ten years without \u00e1 settlement. \u201d This is a curious contention for so competent a counsel in this forum, and one who has been, from the inception of the administration of this estate, continuously the attorney of record for the executor. The record discloses that, so far from culpability attaching to contestant, the executor fell far short of his duty in not closing up the estate within a reasonable period and liquidating the aifairs of the partnership alleged to have subsisted between him and the deceased. At any rate, staleness of claim of contestant is a novel plea in defense of a delinquent executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">It might be said, rather, that his allegation that the estate is partnership assets savors of staleness, coming ten years after his petition for probate, proof upon probate, first \u201cInventory,\u201d and first account, in all of which the property is treated as the personal property and assets of the deceased, John Sylvester, and no suggestion of partnership interest is made. It is too late now, it seems to me, when his adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>tration is challenged, and when he is by compulsory process brought into court, to set up a claim of partnership as to the assets returned in his first inventory and first account. I am convinced that he was correct when he made his first inventory and account, which, if it had received the approval of the judge, would have concluded him at this time, and that his present plea is an afterthought designed to defeat contestant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">It was the duty of the executor to proceed promptly to administer the estate, and he has shown no valid legal excuse for his dilatoriness, nor can he escape censure for his own laches by accusing contestant of negligence in prosecuting her right to a settlement, for manifestly she must have relied upon him to discharge his duty according to law. But, nevertheless, as there is so much that is obscure to the investigator in this class of cases, I am disposed to view as leniently as possible the conduct of the executor, and to give him the benefit of any and every doubt that may arise upon the evidence, as I do not wish to inflict a penalty, but to secure, if possible, what is justly due to the heirs and legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">As a conclusion, from my examination, I find that the total amount of money received by the executor belonging to the estate was $12,021.75; that he should be allowed as paid out, according to the statement in contestant\u2019s statement of account, including payment to widow of $710, as proved, $3,692.50; that he should be allowed one-half judgment in Coekburn v. Sylvester (and of this, although I allow it, I have had very serious doubts, and still retain them, but conclude in favor of the allowance), $1,956.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">As to interest upon the balance to be computed, I think, all things considered, justice would be served in this case by the allowance of simple interest, and the account when so stated may be settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The Principal Case was Affirmed in 105 Cal. 189, 38 Pac. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">An Administrator Who Accounts for Money as the property of the estate of his intestate cannot afterward be heard to say that it was held by another in trust for certain of the heirs, and that he collected it under a power of attorney for them: Estate of Edward Ford, 2 Cof.
