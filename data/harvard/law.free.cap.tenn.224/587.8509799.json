Defendant Judkins pled not guilty and, upon trial on January 28, 1969, the jury returned a verdict against him and fixed punishment at a fine of $250.00' and a jail term of sixty (60) days. Motion for a new trial was filed and denied. Defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals, and this Court granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>As the ease is posed here, the primary question, before this Court is whether the trial judge\u2019s allegedly erroneous instruction to the jury was a prejudicial and reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">As stated above, the defendant was indicted under T.C.A. sec. 57-117, captioned Retailer\u2019s Licenses \u2014 Pees\u2014 Permits for employees \u2014 Renewal. The penalty for violating T.C.A. sec. 57-117 is set out in T.C.A. 57-148 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cAny person who shall violate any provision of secs. 57-106 \u2014 57-151 shall be g'uilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500), and, in the discretion of the court, imprisoned not less than thirty (30) days, nor more than six (6) months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">As the record shows, however, the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury with regard to defendant\u2019s punishment, was based upon an entirely different statute; T.C.A. sec. 39-2502, captioned, Sale of Intoxicating Liquor \u2014 Penalty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cIt shall not be lawful for any person to sell or tipple any intoxicating liquors, including wine, ale, and beer, as a beverage; and any one violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine for each offense of not less than one hundred dollars ($100) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500), and imprisonment for a period of not less than thirty (30) days nor more than six (6) months. (Acts 1909, Ch. 1, sec. 1; Shan., sec. 6795; Mod.Code 1932, sec. 11208.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>It is clear that the trial judge instructed the jury under the old \u201cbone-dry\u201d statute, making it unlawful to sell intoxicating liquors with or without a license; This statute has been superseded in Williamson County by resolution (Williamson County Quarterly Court, October term, 1939), pursuant to Public Acts of Tennessee 1939, Chapter 49, Section 1, now codified as T.C.A. sec. 57-107. Defendant was indicted for the violation of T.C.A. sec. 57-117 (Public Acts of Tennessee 1939, Chapter 49, Section 8), selling whiskey \u201cwithout having first applied for and procured a retailer\u2019s license * * The Court of Criminal Appeals recognized this error but ruled it harmless because the amount fixed by the jury, $250.00, was \u201cwithin the limits authorized for the offense in the instant case, and the defendants were not prejudiced by the fact that the trial judge instructed the jury an incorrect amount for the minimum allowable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Also, the State\u2019s argument supports the Court of Criminal Appeals, supra, that the trial judge\u2019s instruction was not excepted to as erroneous by defendant\u2019s counsel at the time the charge was given. However, the State does admit in its brief the \u201cstrong possibility\u201d that this case may be reversed \u201con the authority of <em>Bowmer v. State </em>(1928), 157 Tenn. 124, 6 S.W.2d 326.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In <em>Bowmer v. State, </em>supra, the defendant was indicted under Section 6451 of Shannon\u2019s Code for the crime of rape. This Court found that \u201cthe trial judge charged the jury that the indictment for rape founded on Section 6451 of Shannon\u2019s Code included \u2018an attempt\u2019 to have carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.\u201d The trial judge concluded then that punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>should be assessed \u201cat not less than ten (10) years nor more than twenty-one (21) years in the Penitentiary\u201d as set ont in Section 6459 of Shannon\u2019s Code. Justice Cook, writing for this Court, held that the jury was charged erroneously; that Section 6471 of Shannon\u2019s Code correctly prescribes the punishment for an \u201cattempt to commit rape\u201d, and not Section 6459.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cThe offense disclosed by the proof and found and reported by the jury was an attempt, and was punishable by confinement in the penitentiary not exceeding 5 years. The verdict and judgment thereon assessing 10 years\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary was not authorized by the statute, and, because the trial judge, by the instruction given, caused the jury to assess punishment not authorized by the statute, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Prior decisions of this Court on the subject generally of variance between the indictment and the instruction to the jury are to the same effect. <em>Huffman v. State </em>(1956), 200 Tenn. 487, 292 S.W.2d 738; <em>Church v. State </em>(1960), 206 Tenn. 336, 333 S.W.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In the instant case, the defendant was convicted and punished for an offense different from that for which he was indicted. Further, T.C.A. sec. 39-2502, the basis of the trial judge\u2019s instructions and this section makes mandatory a fine <em>and </em>a period of imprisonment; whereas, T.C.A. sec. 57-148, the section prescribing the penalty for violation of 57-117 under which defendant was indicted, makes mandatory only a fine; a period of imprisonment being within the discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Under the authority of <em>Bowmer v. State </em>and other eases cited, this case must he reversed and remanded for new trial. Having decided this question, it is not necessary to respond to other questions raised by the defendant in his appeal and petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b610-6\">Dyer, Chief Justice, and Chattin and Humphbeys, Justices, concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b610-7\">McCanless, Justice, not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
