Chiee Justice Dyee</author>\n<p id=\"Al8\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">This is a declaratory judgment action brought by the insured, hereinafter referred to as the complainant, for a construction of certain provisions of the defendant Allstate\u2019s uninsured motorist endorsement and the Uninsured Motorist Act of Tennessee (T.C.A. Sections 56-1148 through 56-1153). The Chancellor held that the \u201cphysical contact\u201d requirement contained in the defendant\u2019s policy is valid under the Uninsured Motorist Act; and that the so-called set-off provision of the uninsured motorist endorsement is likewise valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The case was tried on a stipulation of facts, which are as follows: On May 25,1968, the complainant was run off the road by an unidentified vehicle, causing his automobile to strike a rock wall and utility pole; and the \u201cunidentified motor vehicle did not come into \u2018physical contact\u2019 with the complainant\u2019s automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Medical payments were made to the complainant, his wife and son under the \u201cAutomobile Medical Payments\u201d provision of his policy. However, the complainant seeks additional coverage under the uninsured motorist endorsement of his policy and a declaration that the endorsement\u2019s definition of \u201chit-and-run automobile\u201d is void to the extent that it required \u201cphysical contact\u201d between the unidentified car and the car which the insured is occupying. The defendant denied liability under the above endorsement on the ground that there was no \u201cphysical contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u201cFurther, the complainant insists that the <em>* * </em>* defendant has no' right to deduct payments already under the medical payments provision of said policy from any payments which may be made under the Coverage \u2018S\u2019 endorsement,\u201d that being the uninsured motorist provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">T.C.A. Section 56-1148 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\"><em>\u201cAutomobile liability insurance </em>\u2014 Uninsured <em>motorist \u2014Required </em>coverage.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">\u201cNo automobile liability insurance, covering liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any other motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto, in not less than limits for bodily injury or death described in sec. 59-1206, subject to provisions filed, with and approved by the insurance commissioner, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death, resulting therefrom * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The complainant\u2019s policy, which was in force at the time of the accident, includes an uninsured motorist endorsement, providing for \u201cProtection Against Bodily Injury by Uninsured Automobiles.\u201d In the policy the defendant agreed to \u201cpay all sums which the insured <em>* * * </em>shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile.\u201d One of the meanings ascribed to \u201cUninsured automobile\u201d is a \u2018\u2018hit-and-run automobile,\u201d which in turn is defined in the policy as \u201can automobile which causes bodily injury to an insured arising out of physical contact of such automobile <em>* * * </em>with an automobile which the insured is occupying at the time of the accident * * *\u201d Pursuant to Section 56-1148, this endorsement was submitted to and approved by the insurance commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Although the complainant has raised numerous issues in his assignments or error, the stipulations entered into between the parties provided that there were only two issues to be adjudicated by the Chancellor, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\u201c1. Whether the \u2018physical contact\u2019 requirement of the \u2018Coverage S\u2019 endorsement in the definition of a \u2018hit- and-run\u2019 vehicle * * * is valid under the Uninsured Motorist Act of Tennessee, being Section 56-1148 through Section 56-1153, Tennessee Code Annotated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">\u201c2. Whether the provisions of said \u2018Coverage S\u2019 endorsement providing as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">\u20186 (d) the company shall not be obligated to pay under this Coverage that part of the damages which the insured may be entitled to recover from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>owner or operator of an uninsured automobile which represents expenses for medical services paid or payable under the Medical Payments Coverage of the Policy\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">is valid under said Uninsured Motorist Act. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The issue relating to the validity of the \u201cphysical contact\u201d requirement is the determinative question on this appeal, for if the Court concludes that the requirement is valid there will be absolutely no coverage under the uninsured motorist endorsement; and consequently, consideration of the second issue will be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The complainant insists that the defendant cannot limit its liability under the Uninsured Motorist Act by inserting conditions (\u201cphysical contact\u201d) in its policy which are more restrictive than the Act; and that even though the insurance commissioner approved such conditions, his approval was nevertheless a nullity because it conflicts with the legislative intent. The defendant, on the other hand, contends that the \u201cphysical contact\u201d requirement is valid because it was contained in the endorsement which was submitted to the insurance commissioner and approved by him in accordance with T.C.A. Section 56-1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The Tennessee Uninsured Motorist Statute, T.C.A. Section 56-1148, makes no mention of a requirement of physical contact between the insured vehicle and the uninsured or unknown vehicle. But, in other jurisdictions where there is no statutory authorization for such a requirement the majority of appellate courts which have considered the question have generally recognized the validity of such a provision inserted in an uninsured motorist endorsement. <em>Lawrence v. Beneficial Fire </em>&amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1968), 8 Ariz.App. 155, 444 P.2d 446; <em>Frager v. Pennsylvania General Ins. Co. </em>(1967), 155 Conn. 270, 231 A.2d 531. <em>Roloff v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(La.App.1966), 191 So.2d 901; <em>Amidzich v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1969), 44 Wis.2d 45, 170 N.W.2d 813. We feel compelled to follow these judisdictions, not only for reasons of public policy, but also because the Tennessee Insurance Commissioner approved this endorsement containing the \u201cphysical contact\u201d requirement and thereby effectuated its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Although the Legislature delegated to the Insurance Commissioner the authority to approve or reject policy provisions filed with his office, his approval will not render policy endorsements invulnerable if they are violative of existing law. But since there is no apparent conflict between the provisions of the Uninsured Motorist Act and the policy requirement of \u201cphysical contact,\u201d the endorsements involved herein are not contrary to any existing law. Thus, when filed with and approved by the insurance commissioner the endorsements became a part of the laws of the State. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Universal Underwriters, Inc., </em>223 Tenn. 80, 442 S.W.2d 614 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Neither is it difficult to fathom the commissioner's reasons for approving an endorsement containing a \u201cphysical contact\u201d requirement. Such a limitation is a valid attempt by the insurer to prevent the insured from recovering damages in a case where his injuries resulted from his own negligence, without the intervention of another vehicle; but it is alleged that an unknown vehicle caused the accident and fled. The insurer, by inserting such a provision in its uninsured motorist endorsement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>is merely attempting to protect itself against fraudulent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">There is no doubt that our ruling -will work a hardship and likewise seem inequitable in cases, such as the instant one, where it is undisputed that there was no attempt to defraud the insurer. But, when this is weighed against the fact that insurers need some protection against fraudulent claims, the reason for the rule becomes apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Accordingly, the chancellor\u2019s decree is affirmed insofar as it upheld the validity of the \u201cphysical contact\u201d requirement contained in the defendant\u2019s policy.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-5\">Creson and McCanless, Justices, and Smith, Special Justice, concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b447-6\">Jenkins, Special Justice, not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
