The ordinance in question was adopted pursuant to the recommendation of the city manager and the city attorney submitted in writing on February 13th, 1934, to the mayor and council and embodied in the minutes. The recommendation of the city manager reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-15\">\u201cUpon assuming office I found that certain departments of the government of the City of Asbury Park are not operating in accordance with the best principles of the City Manager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>form of government; that these departments are not operating as efficiently and economically as desired and that there is no proper co-ordination between the various departments as should be established under our present form of government * * *. Therefore, I am respectfully submitting my recommendations for reorganization of all departments which are assigned to my management by law. I have submitted to the city clerk ordinances covering repeal of inconsistent ordinances, as well as an ordinance covering the recommended reorganization.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">This writ was obtained by William S. Taggart, who is the ranking officer in the fire department. Prior to the adoption of the ordinance his title was that of \u201cChief of the Fire Department.\u201d Since the adoption of the ordinance his title has been changed, by resolution hereinafter referred to, to captain of the fire department and acting chief, and on May 1st, 1934, he took the oath of office as such official. His salary and position as ranking officer in the fire department remains the same as it was prior to the adoption of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">The first point made by the prosecutor is that \u201cthe resolution reducing the officers and men of the fire department in rank was adopted for purely political reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">It will be noticed that this point deals with the resolution adopted by the mayor and council on March 37th, 1934, and not with the ordinance brought up by the writ, which was adopted February 37th, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">It is therefore questionable whether such resolution is open to the attack made under point one; but in any event the point is without merit. The resolution recites that the city \u201cis facing a serious financial crises,\u201d that public welfare demands the adoption of necessary economic measures, and that economy and greater efficiency require that the fire department be reorganized in the manner provided in the resolution. As we have pointed out the effect of the resolution, in so far as we are now concerned with it, was to reduce the prosecutor from the rank of chief, which he held before the adoption of the resolution, to the rank of captain. Apart from the express terms of the resolution, the record discloses that the city manager testified that although the adoption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the resolution would not be productive of immediate savings to the city, it would lay the foundation for savings in future years. An examination of the record fails to disclose to us any contradiction of that testimony. It is therefore evident that the resolution was adapted for the purposes of economy and greater efficiency, and not for \u201cpurely political reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">The next contention is that \u201cthe action of the City of Asbury Park in adopting the two ordinances and the resolution under attack has deprived the city of any legally constituted fire department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">It will be observed that this contention does not point out any lack of authority in the city to adopt the ordinance here under review, nor lack of authority to adopt the ordinance on the same day establishing certain departments and departmental divisions, among others \u201cDivision of Fire.\u201d The authority is ample. The statute provides that \u201cthe governing body of every municipality shall have power to make * * * or repeal ordinances to establish * * * a fire department.\u201d <em>Cum. Supp. Comp. Stat. </em>1911-1924, <em>p. </em>2160, \u00a7 *136-1701. See, also, the provision of the Municipal Manager act that \u201cthe municipal council shall continue or create, and determine and define the powers and duties of such executive and administrative departments, boards and offices in addition to those provided for'herein, as it may be necessary for the proper and efficient conduct of the affairs of the municipality by law. Any department, board or office so created may at any time be abolished by the municipal council. <em>Gum. Supp. Gomp. Stal. </em>1911-1924, <em>p. </em>2518, \u00a7 ***136-702. The state of the case discloses that the resolution heretofore mentioned, and the ordinance brought up for review, and the ordinance last mentioned were adopted, not for purely political reasons, but for the purpose of economy and greater efficiency; and we conclude that the city had the right to pass them, and that is the only question that presently concerns us on this phase of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">The court will not substitute its judgment on matters of. this kind that concern the regulation of the internal affairs of municipal departments for the judgment of those selected by the people and charged by law with the duty of regulating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>such affairs in the absence of a clear showing of bad faith. <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>11 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>854; 168 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>668.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">To establish a charge of fraudulent conduct or lack of good faith against a legislative body, the proof of such fraudulent conduct must be clear and convincing. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Guttenburg, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>434; 95 <em>Atl. Bep. </em>120. Of course the chief of the fire department may be reduced to the rank of captain if done in good faith and for the purpose of economical administration of governmental affairs of the city. <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Commissioners, Newark, </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>468; 99 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>432.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The last point is: \u201cThe pension rights of the prosecutor are destroyed by the action of the defendant in abolishing its fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">The sole argument under this point, as we see it, is that the city has abolished its fire department. We think it has not done so, as we have hereinbefore indicated, and so we can see no merit in this point. As a matter of fact the record discloses that the prosecutor is a fireman and a member of the fire department of the city of Asbury Park, which department was established by the ordinance, lie is performing the duties of the ranking officer in the division of fire in the department of public safety and is receiving a salary from the city for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">The writ will bo dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
