With that contention we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">It is next argued that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury might find the defendant was negligent and that the negligence was the proximate cause of the injury. It is not contended that there was any negligence in the construction of the steps or the placing of the handrail, but it is argued that the presence of the children playing on the steps and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>around the handrail constituted a menace to those entering or leaving the bank, and that the defendant had had constructive notice of the fact that children played there and that this constituted actionable negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The court, before granting the nonsuit on the gronnd mentioned above, stated that in its opinion the bank had had constructive notice of the fact that the children were wont to play there. As to this, the only proof in the case is the testimony of Miss Brooks, who said one could see these steps and railing \u201cfrom the center of the bank when you go in.\u201d But, passing that, we do not believe that as a matter of law the defendant bank, in the discharge of its duty to use reasonable care for the safety of those using its premises, was obliged to maintain a watchman or guard over the steps so that children would neither tarry nor play on the steps or about the handrail. To hold that it had such duty would he to burden it with a degree of care that the law does not place upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In the cases upon which appellant relies to maintain its theory of liability, the facts are materially different. For instance, in <em>Exton </em>v. <em>Central Railroad, </em>62 <em>N. J. L. </em>7; 42 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>486, the plaintiff was injured in the railroad station close to the baggage room by cabmen who were indulging in \u201chorseplay.\u201d The facts of that case are similar to those in <em>Flint v. Norwich, Trans. Co., </em>344 <em>Conn. </em>554, which case is referred to in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>West Jersey, &amp;c., Railroad Co., </em>71 <em>N. J. L. </em>363; 59 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>13. In <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic and Pacific, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>694; 133 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>172, plaintiff was injured in the store of the defendant by its negligence in having a defective floor board in the premises. We do not perceive how the cases support the appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">From the proofs before us, we think that there was no evidence that the bank had any notice of any existing danger, <em>as such,, </em>arising out of the presence of the children on the steps. Nor is there in the record before us any evidence of how long the children, on the afternoon in question, had been playing around the handrail, or that they had been there for a sufficient length of time to have afforded a reasonable opportunity to the defendant to stop them in their play on the steps. Nor is there any proof that the presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>children, from past experience, was reasonably liable to canse injury to anyone. This view, we think, follows the reasoning of our Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Seckler </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>Railroad, &amp;c., 113 <em>N. J. L. </em>399; 174 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>501.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The judgment of nonsuit is affirmed, with costs</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
