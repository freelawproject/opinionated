L. </em>1934; <em>N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1934, \u00a7 52-43r (15). The convictions were had under section 4 which defines as a gangster any person not engaged in any lawful occupation, known to be a member of any gang consisting of two or more persons, who has been convicted at least three times of being a disorderly person, or who has been convicted of any crime, in this or any other state.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">We are of the opinion that the convictions must be reversed because of the failure of proof of one of the necessary elements set -out in this section, namely that the accused must be \u201cknown to be a member of any gang consisting of two or more persons.\u201d A careful reading of the record fails to disclose any evidence from which a jury might properly find that the plaintiffs in error were known to be members of a gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">The judgments are reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
