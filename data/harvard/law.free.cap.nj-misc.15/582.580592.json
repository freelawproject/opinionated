Rafferty (James J.

The sole point presented is that one affiant avers that the defendant, Conway, said at the time of the accident, that he was assuming full responsibility therefor, and that he would see to it that the damages would be paid. This is denied in the defendant\u2019s affidavit, but if accepted, there is a counter-affidavit of one Anderson, an investigator for the insurer, that the plaintiff Eiehter had told him, long before the trial, that this statement was made by the defendant. It is manifest that this, therefore, was not newly discovered evidence in the legal sense; that it was available before trial and could have been procured by the exercise of reasonable diligence. The court was well within its discretion in concluding not to interfere with the verdict. The rule on matters of this kind is thoroughly settled, some of the late decisions being <em>Plaskon </em>v. <em>National Sulphur Co., </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>109; 176 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>112; <em>Paradise </em>v. <em>Great Pastern Stages, Inc., </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>365; 176 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>711. Compare <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Goerke-Kirch Co., </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>207; 192 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>238.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
