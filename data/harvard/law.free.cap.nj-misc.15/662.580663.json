The statutory limitation to review a court order by writ of <em>certiorari </em>is eighteen months. 1 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>403, \u00a7 3. This court recognizes that limitation to the extent that it is rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>sonable in a given case. <em>Red Oaks, Inc., </em>v. <em>Dorez, Inc., </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>280; 187 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>737. The period of eighteen months from probate expired on February 1st, 1937. We are satisfied that with reasonable expedition a writ to review the probate could have been sought well within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Prosecutor would raise the question of jurisdiction of the surrogate to probate, alleging that there were doubts on the face of the instrument and that thereupon it became the duty of the surrogate, section 13 of the Orphans Court act (3 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>3816, as amended, chapter 370, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1931; <em>N. J. Slat. Annual </em>1931, \u00a7 146-13), to cite the parties to the Orphans Court \u2014 there to try the issue. But the Court of Errors and Appeals has already considered this will <em>(Christian Orphan Home </em>v. <em>Guaranty Trust Co., </em>121 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>257; 190 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>103) and determined the question of doubt arising on the face of the instrument contrary to prosecutor\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The motion to vacate will be granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
