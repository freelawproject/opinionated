Shepherd to the office of school janitor. The board of education appeals from an order of the state board of education directing Shepherd\u2019s reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">The claim is that Shepherd was appointed for a definite term; that he violated a rule of the board; that his salary was reduced and he refused to accept office thereunder, and finally that he was guilty of such neglect of duty as to justify his dismissal for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Under the proofs Shepherd was holding by an indefinite term and protected by the Civil Service law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">As to the dismissal for cause. The charge was failure to be on his joh one afternoon during school hours in violation of a new rule adopted by the board. Of this rule Shepherd was not apprised.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">We think the proofs did not justify dismissal and the judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
