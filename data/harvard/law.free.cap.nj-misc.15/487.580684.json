Scott in the latter\u2019s automobile along a public highway about eight o\u2019clock on a rainy evening. Coming from the opposite direction was an automobile owned by the defendant Jennie Giacona, and driven by defendant Nell Giacona. There was a collision between the two automobiles as a result of which plaintiff was injured. This action is to recover for those injuries, and the District Court judge, sitting without a jury, granted a nonsuit as to Jennie Giacona and made an award in favor of the plaintiff against both of the other defendants. Scott appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The single point argued is that the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict in favor of defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Three witnesses testified to the happening. Plaintiff put herself and defendant Scott upon the stand. Nell Giacona, one of the co-defendants, testified in her own behalf. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tiff, by her own testimony, knew nothing about the accident. She testified: \u201cWell, it was a rainy, miserable night. I couldn\u2019t see a thing; in fact, I saw nothing of the accident whatsoever. I couldn\u2019t see through the windshield. I just felt the car was either swerving or something had happened to the car and we stopped. I knew nothing whatsoever. I couldn\u2019t see anything. * * * There was just a crash and that is all I knew. * * * My attention was diverted * * *. Something must have happened to the car. I didn\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In reply to the question, \u201cwhat caused the diversion?\u201d she answered, \u201ceither the brakes were applied and I was thrown forward, or the car swerved.\u201d In response to leading questions, the witness was led to say what she \u201cthought,\u201d what she \u201cimagined,\u201d and what her \u201cimpressions\u201d were; but we find no competent evidence of negligence by appellant. The witness Giacona testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u201cI was going about twenty miles an hour, and I don\u2019t recall anything except that as I approached the other car my car seemed to swerve as if it was being pulled, and then I came to a standstill. * * * I was proceeding at the rate I had been going; that was from twenty to twenty-five; I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t look at my speedometer, and I don\u2019t know what happened until the two cars came together. Whether I skidded before or after I don\u2019t know, because it happened so quickly;\u201d and this excerpt may fairly be taken as a synopsis of her entire testimony on the subject. Scott testified that as he was driving along the avenue at a fairly low rate of speed he saw the Giacona car suddenly loom up in front of him, that the latter ear seemed to be in a swirling skid, and that it struck his car forward and then in the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Where the evidence, with all fair and legitimate inferences arising therefrom, is insufficient to sustain a verdict for the plaintiff the court should direct a verdict for the defendant. <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Meyer Bros., </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>120; 176 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>187. Negligence must be proved; it is not presumed. This is not a case where, in our opinion, the principle of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>may be applied, and no contention is made that it should be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The essential proofs to sustain a verdict are lacking. The disposition of the case depends, not upon the relative credibility of the witnesses, but upon the absence of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The motion for a direction in favor of the appellant should have been granted, and the judgment against him will therefore be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
