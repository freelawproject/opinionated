The state of the case is largely stipulated, but, as appears, by the prosecutor and the city of Newark only. The defendant Di Donato has not consented thereto. In this situation, we conclude there is no state of the case before us upon which we may determine the rights of all the parties to the writ and who have rights which must be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Further, it appears that there is pending in the Court of Chancery a proceeding to determine the right of the defendant Di Donato to construct a store building on the land in question, by reason of certain alleged restrictive covenants in her deed and other deeds to lands in the neighborhood. It is possible that the Chancery proceeding may be dispositive of the questions sought to be determined under the writ in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that the writ of <em>certiorari </em>presently pending should be dismissed, without prejudice, however. Such will be the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
