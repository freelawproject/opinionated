Plaintiff was the single witness in his own behalf. He testified to facts from which it might be inferred but was not demonstrated that the snow fell from some portion of the defendant\u2019s building. He also testified that he did not in fact know where it came from. It was within the fact-finding power of the judge to determine that the plaintiff had not proved that the snow came from the defendant\u2019s premises. If it be assumed that the snow did fall from the defendant\u2019s building, the next question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>is whether defendant had done or failed to do something whereby lie became chargeable. The contention of the plaintiff in this respect was that the snow had fallen because of the improper construction of the cornice on defendant\u2019s building. That was a controverted question of fact inasmuch as there was expert testimony introduced by the defendant to the effect that the construction was proper, normal and standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The findings of fact by the trial judge are supported by the evidence and therefore are not reviewable on appeal. <em>Lapayowker </em>v. <em>Levitzky, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>164; 130 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>627. Further, the specification of determinations failed to point out the precise judicial action complained of, and the appeal therefore presents no point for the consideration of this court. <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>538; 159 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>402.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
