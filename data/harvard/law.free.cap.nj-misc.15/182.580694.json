Those applications were made by other counsel, but their merits, or demerits, were substantially the same. We are unable to perceive any good reason for taking a different course at this time, and think it advisable to place our refusal on record with the foregoing recital of its antecedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The applications are denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
