This rule is universally applied by the authorities. . Under a similar provision of a building contract, we held that the final certificate of the architect was \u201cadmissible to show that a condition in the contract precedent to a right to have payment, had been satisfied, to wit, the presentation of the architect\u2019s certificate, and that his approval of the plaintiff\u2019s work, as being in conformity to the drawings and specifications according to their construction and meaning, had been given.\u201d <em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>v. <em>Poli, </em>82 Conn. 427, 436, 74 Atl. 763; <em>Beattie </em>v. <em>McMullen, </em>82 Conn. 484, 74 Atl. 767; cases cited in note to <em>City Street Imp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Marysville, </em>23 L. R. A. (N. S.) 317 (155 Cal. 419, 101 Pac. 308); and in note to <em>Boettler </em>v. <em>Tendrick, </em>5 L. R. A. 273 (73 Tex. 488, 11 S. W. 497).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In this case the decision of the architect as to most items did not determine whether the items were within or without the plans and specifications. His mere statement that the items were allowed or disallowed does not apprise us of the basis of their allowance or disallowance. As to other items, it clearly appears that the architect did decide that they were within the plans and specifications, and hence were not extras. If this were all that the finding revealed, we should be obliged to hold that the court\u2019s ruling was erroneous and harmful. The court finds that the decision of the architect was not fair, nor made upon reasonable grounds. This is far from finding that the architect decided in fraud or bad faith. Indeed, the trial court negatives fraud or bad faith on the part of the architect, for it finds that the architect \u201c was in no position to make a fair and reasonable award, and did not do so although he honestly tried within his limitations.\u201d This is the equivalent of a finding that the architect acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The trial court improperly held that the decision of the architect was not made on reasonable grounds because, through his neglect and inefficiency, delay and expense in the construction of the building were entailed. The mere incompetency or negligence of the architect will not avoid the effect of a decision by him, unless his negligence be so gross as to amount to fraud or bad faith. <em>Chicago, S. F. &amp; C. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Price, </em>138 U. S. 185, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The trial court further held that the defendant had waived and abandoned his right to require a literal compliance with this provision of the contract, through the numerous changes and alterations in the contract made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>by the parties. No motion to correct the finding in these particulars is made. We cannot revise this finding, for a finding of waiver or abandonment is one of fact. We so held, as to waiver, in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Appel, </em>67 Conn. 585, 35 Atl. 524; <em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>v. <em>Poli, </em>82 Conn. 427, 436, 74 Atl. 763; <em>New Haven Wire Co. Cases, </em>57 Conn. 352, 387, 18 Atl. 266; and as to abandonment, in <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>New York &amp; N. E. R. Co., </em>59 Conn. 250, 259, 22 Atl. 37; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>86 Conn. 252, 258, 85 Atl. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We must presume that the trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s claim that the decision of the architect was final and conclusive upon the parties, in view of its finding that this provision of the contract, by reason of a waiver and abandonment, was no longer in existence. This finding makes harmless the erroneous rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In this opinion the other judg\u00e9s concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
