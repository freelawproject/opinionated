The fourth, which has been pursued, questions the correctness of the court\u2019s action in permitting the State\u2019s Attorney, upon cross-examination of the defendant, to examine him concerning his expulsion from the Medical Society. His counsel, in closing his examination in chief, had asked him the following questions: \u201cHave you ever been prosecuted, Doctor? Or arrested?\u201d\u2014to which he answered, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Thereupon, in beginning the cross-examination by the State\u2019s Attorney, the following occurred:\u2014\u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cQ. Weren\u2019t you prosecuted in the Medical Society?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">Mr. Barbour: I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">Mr. Alcorn: I claim it. He has opened the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">Mr. Barbour: Any hearing before the Medical Society is not a prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">The Court: Admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">Mr. Barbour: Note an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">Q. Weren\u2019t you prosecuted in the Medical Society in the middle of nineteen hundred and ten? A. I did not respond to any communication I had to that effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">Q. Did you get a summons upon the complaint of Dr. McKnight who is chairman of the Committee on Public Health and Legislation, against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">Mr. Barbour: I object to that\u2014whether he got a summons to appear on somebody else\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-15\">The Court: The door was opened, in my opinion, by the question put to him whether he had ever been arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-16\">Mr. Barbour: Arrested or prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-17\">The Court: I don\u2019t know whether this was a prosecution or not. I don\u2019t know what you meant by prosecution when you used the word. I think the door is open now for a reasonable investigation of that phrase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-18\">Mr. Barbour: If your Honor thinks it is admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>under the words prosecuted or arrested. Your Honor will have an exception noted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">The Court: Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">Q. In response to that summons and complaint of Dr. McKnight, were you prosecuted in the County Medical Society? A. I don\u2019t know what they did there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">Q. You knew afterwards you were expelled, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">Q. You knew what the subject of that investigation was, did you not? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">Q. Weren\u2019t you notified it was because of an abortion you had performed on a young woman named McClary, who lived on Albany Avenue? A. No, sir, I did not know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">Q. You don\u2019t know what it was for? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">Q. You didn\u2019t try? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-13\">Q. But they served notice on you and you were expelled? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-14\">Q. Did you get notice of your expulsion? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-15\">Q. From whom did you get it? A. It came from the Society\u2014I don\u2019t know who was the Secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">The defendant, having offered himself as a witness, could not complain of any inquiry upon cross-examination which tended to question his character for veracity. Manifestly the inquiries complained of were not calculated to question the defendant\u2019s general character in this respect, and were not claimed or permitted upon this ground. They were permitted upon the ground that the door for such inquiries had been opened because the witness had been asked whether he had ever been arrested or prosecuted, and had answered that he had not. The cross-examination was proper as tending to contradict the witness, if a proceeding against him in the medical society looking to his expulsion was <em>\u201ca </em>prosecution.\u201d It is apparent, from the connection in which the word \"prosecuted\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>used in the witness\u2019 direct examination, that it was not calculated nor intended to convey to the witness, the court, or the jury, the impression that a proceeding before a medical or other professional or social society was referred to. When one is asked if he has ever been arrested or prosecuted, we can only understand that it is intended to refer to a prosecution before a court of law for a criminal offense. In the present case the jury could have understood only that such a prosecution was referred to. It was wrong, therefore, to permit the State, by a cross-examination, to show by the witness that he had been expelled from the medical society, and to permit the attorney to insinuate by one of his questions that the cause of the expulsion was an operation of the character which is alleged to have resulted in the death for which the defendant is now prosecuted. This must have been most harmful to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The defendant complains of improper conduct on the part of the State\u2019s Attorney in conducting the examination of the defendant, but no foundation for this claim is raised in the reasons of appeal, or by the finding of facts, and the questions are not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
