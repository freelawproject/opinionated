The other named defendants, with the exception of Benson M. Smith. Superintendent of Building and Loan Associations of the State of Ohio, are directors and officers of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">On August 8, 1949, at a special meeting called for the purpose a Resolution was adopted by the stockholders to convert The Security Savings &amp; Loan Company into a Federal savings and loan association pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of $9660-1 and $9660-2 GC.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">George F. Opdyke and Frank Schulte, partners, doing business as Ledogar-Horner Company and George F. Opdyke, individually, bring their action in case No. 607237 as Stockholders of The Security Savings &amp; Loan Company and set up three causes of action in an amended petition. In the First Cause of Action they claim:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">, (a) That the proposed plan of conversion is inequitable as far as present stockholders are concerned;</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">(b) That the actions of the defendants in their promotion of the plan were both actually and constructively fraudulent;</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">(c) That the corporate action taken by Security in adopting the plan was illegal; and pray</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">\u201cthat the defendants and each of them be permanently restrained and enjoined from carrying out the terms and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>visions ol the Resolution and Plan of Conversion purporting to have been adopted at the-said meeting.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In the Second Cause of Action they say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201cthat they did not vote in favor of the aforesaid Resolution and Plan of Conversion at the said special meeting of shareholders held on August 8, 1949,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">and have complied with all requirements set out in \u00a78623-72 GC of the General Corporation Act of Ohio in demanding the Pair Cash Value of $455.19 per share for the stock owned by them. They further aver that the company within the time specified and in compliance with said section refused the aforementioned demands and</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u201coffered to pay plaintiffs the sum of $135.00 per share, subject to it being determined by a court of competent jurisdiction * * * that plaintiffs were entitled to be paid the Fair Cash Value of their said shares.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Plaintiffs did not agree to accept the Company\u2019s offer and ask, in the alternate, that if relief be denied them on their First Cause of Action that</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u201cthis court proceed to determine in a manner specified in \u00a78623-72 GC, the Fair Cash Value, as of August 7th, 1949, of each of the shares of the permanent capital stock owned by them and each of them * *</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">In the Third Cause of Action they again plead in the alternative and say that if relief is denied them in the First and Second Causes of Action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">\u201cthe plan of conversion and \u00a79660-2 GC are unconstitutional in that they authorize and permit the taking of plaintiffs\u2019 property without due process of law and are violative of the 5th amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article 1 Section 16 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">Elta H. Jerger, in Case No. 607315; Orrin C. Sabin, in Case No. 607529; Charles T. Minshall, et al., in Case No. 610603, and S. Chester Hutchinson, in Case No. 610256, are plaintiffs and stockholders of The Security Savings &amp; Loan Company who did not vote in favor of the Plan of Conversion at the special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose and held on August 8, 1949, and aver compliance with all the requirements set up in \u00a78623-23 GC in demanding a Fair Cash Value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>of $455.19 for each share owned by them in The Security Savings &amp; Loan Company which demand was refused-in writing within the required 10 days by the defendant, The Security Savings &amp; Loan Company. They further say that they believe that the Plan of Conversion or reorganization is unconstitutional and amounts to a taking of plaintiffs\u2019 property without due process of law under Federal law and under the laws of the State of Ohio, unless they are entitled to the rights of a dissenting stockholder granted under \u00a7693-1 and \u00a78623-72 GC. They pray that this Court proceed to determine in the manner specified in \u00a78623-72 GC, the Fair Cash Value, as of August 7th, 1949, of their respective shares of stock and render judgments to them accordingly and for such other and further relief in law or equity as they may be entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The George F. Opdyke Company, et al. case was tried separately. The Sabin and Jerger cases were consolidated as allowed under \u00a78623-72 GC and tried jointly. The Minshall, et al. and Hutchinson cases, by Stipulation between all the parties concerned, were stayed and continued until final judgment on the Opdyke, Sabin and Jerger cases at which time judgments similar to final judgments in the Sabin and Jerger cases, with such variations, respectively, as may be required by the facts in each case, will be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Briefs were filed by George Opdyke, et al; The Security Savings &amp; Loan Company, et al; Elta H. Jerger and Orrin C. Sabin; and The Ohio Savings &amp; Loan League, Amicus Curiae. Oral arguments were presented to the Court after all briefs had been submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Hereafter in Case No. 607237, George Opdyke, et al. will be referred to as \u201cplaintiffs\u201d; The Security Savings &amp; Loan Company, as \u201cSecurity\u201d and the officers and directors of \u201cSecurity\u201d as \u201cdefendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">All emphasis throughout this Opinion is ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Benson M. Smith, Superintendent of the Building and Loan Associations of the State of Ohio, is a nominal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Security is owned by approximately 180 stockholders, holding 1826 shares in all. The officers and directors at the special meeting of August 8th, 1949, owned 22% or about 418-8/20\u2019s shares. The plaintiffs at that time owned 589.1 shares, 182 of which were in the name of Opdyke and 407.1 in the name of Opdyke and Schulte. In addition, they claim ownership of some 22 shares of the permanent capital stock of Security not transferred upon the books of the company. All shares have a par value of $100. The permanent stock and running stock as of the same date amounted to around $200,000. The deposits, however, amounted to $7,343,000. Deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Federal body requires a ratio of 25 to 1 as between deposits and stocks and 10 to 1 as to reserves and stocks. When this ratio is out of balance 20% of the earnings has to be put into the reserve before computing the interest on savings. This materially reduces the amount of money available to be paid as dividends to stockholders on their shares. In recent years the deposits were on the upgrade and as a result a substantial part of the earnings had to be allocated to reserves. Because of this situation dividends declared on the outstanding stock were only somewhat better than the rate of interest paid depositors (2%%). The market price of the stock as a result was depressed and sold under par except for a short period of time, a matter only of months, when shares were purchased in contemplation of conversion. These conditions, together with the payment of double' liability in case of disaster, prompted the officers and directors to consider converting into a Federal loan association by which the shares of Security with a par value of $100 are converted into share accounts on the basis of $135 of share accounts in the Federal association for each share of par value of $100. The deposits of Security are also converted into share accounts of the Federal association on a dollar for dollar basis. These share accounts are then withdrawable and are to be insured by The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation up to the aggregate amount of $5,000 as to each owner of share accounts. They see other advantages to the Federal set-up; the right to borrow 50% of the aggregate of deposits from The Federal Home Loan Bank; (as a State institution it is allowed to borrow only 30% of its deposits and capital stock); public acceptance; ability to allow loans up to 80% of the appraised value of property; (75% as State institution); right to make loans up to $1500 at 6% interest without the requirement of three-fourths of one percent for F. H. A. insurance; (only 5% interest as state institution); elimination of the requirement and incidental expenses of two independent examinations by the State Superintendent of Building and Loan Companies and The Federal Home Loan Bank. (Security is a member of The Federal Home Loan Bank.) In general, they believe that the conversion of Security into a Federal savings and loan association \u201cwill improve the financial business structure and the competitive position of Security.\u201d Pursuant to these considerations the Board of Directors, by unanimous vote, passed a Resolution on April 28th, 1949, directing the president and secretary to apply to The Federal Home Loan Bank for conversion into a Federal Savings and Loan Association. A part of the Resolution was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u201cBe it further resolved that the proposed plan of conversion to be submitted for approval by said Home Loan Bank Board shall provide, among other things, for the conversion of the capital stock of The Security Savings and Loan Company into share accounts of the Federal savings and loan association, into which this Company shall be converted, on the following basis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">\u201cThe holders of shares of permanent stock of this Company shall be given share accounts of said Federal association at the rate of $135.00 of share accounts for each $100.00 of the par value of the shares of said permanent stock held by such holders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Following the action taken a \u201cPreliminary Application For Conversion Into A Federal Savings and Loan Association\u201d was filed with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington, D. C., by the president and secretary on May 4, 1949, in which they incorporated a \u201cCertified Copy of Resolution of Board of Directors of The Security Savings and Loan Company.\u201d With it they also filed the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201cThe Security Savings &amp; Loan Co.

Wade, 89 Arkansas, 357:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">A share of stock is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201c* * * a right to participate, in a certain proportion, in the immunities and benefits of .the corporation; to vote in the choice of their officers, and the management of these concerns; to share in the dividends of profits; and to receive an aliquot part of the proceeds of the capital on winding up and terminating the active existence and operations of the corporations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Plaintiffs say that the proposed Plan of Conversion is \u201cinequitable as far as the rights of the present stockholders are concerned,\u201d because as of June 30, 1949, each share of stock had a book value of $372.95, which included capital of $100.00 per share, reserves of $178.55 per share, and undivided profits of $59.40 per share and that the price of $135.00 per share \u201cis an arbitrary figure fixed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in order that the amount of capital assets to be transferred by the present corporation to the new association would be sufficient to satisfy the arbitrary requirements of that Board \u2014 and without any consideration whatsoever to the book value, capital assets, undivided profits, reserves, Fair Cash Value, or any other value.\u201d They introduced in evidence charts, graphs and statements depicting these factors as well as factors of earnings, dividends and depositors protection. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>also say that the stockholders in this conversion not only lose their undistributed profits, their interest in reserves and the earning power of the stock of Security which earned $26.78 per share in the first half of 1949 but their control as well since it drops from 100% to a mere 4% because of the host of depositors becoming holders of share accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Furthermore, they question the so-called advantages claimed by Security as to enlarged borrowing power and less strict mortgage loan requirements and claim that the depreciation of reserves, smaller reserve requirements and freer control by directors of net earnings are a detriment rather than a benefit to sound banking practices. They then claim that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cthe real fruits from the consummation of the Plan will be enjoyed by the present officers and Directors of Security who are virtually assured of perpetuation in office by the fact that they are no longer answerable to a small group of stockholders * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">and having freer control of undistributed profits can very easily divert them to the payment of higher salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Plaintiffs also fail to see that any advantage will accrue to the company, to depositors or the public by the federalization of Security and say further that the company in its present status will continue to be \u201ca sound and growing savings and loan company wholly acceptable to the general public\u201d and suggest that the lack of balance between deposits and capital stock be remedied either by declaring stock dividends from undistributed profits or by reducing the interest rate on deposits which would stem their increase and permit higher dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The defendants claim that under Chapter II of the Federal Savings and Loan System, Section 202.29 the plaintiffs had the right to complain to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board before resorting to the courts for relief as to their First Cause of Action, and that not having exhausted its administrative remedy can now have no relief in this court as to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Pertinent parts of Section 202.29 read, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">\u201cRight of hearing \u2014 (a) Date, place, notice and rules of hearings.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">\u201cAt any time after the filing of an application or petition to the Board by any person and before consideration thereof by the Board in accordance with these rules and regulations, any interested person (hereinafter referred to as a \u2018protestant\u2019) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>may request a hearing provided such protestant shall simultaneously file with the Board specific objections to the granting of the application or petition.

If the Board fixes such hearing date and the place of such hearing, a certified copy of such resolution shall be forwarded to the applicants and to the protestants by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary to the Board.

The third claim in the main calls for the clarification of the law generally as to the specific vote required in the conversion of a state corporation into a Federal association. This only a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>law can do with any degree of finality. The court, therefore, comes to the conclusion that under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs have the right to appeal directly to a court of law despite the fact that they have not exhausted the administrative remedy allowed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">42 American Jurisprudence, 582:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine operates where an administrative agency has authority to pass on every question raised by a party resorting to judicial relief, and enables the court to withhold its aid entirely until administrative remedies have been exhausted, and is inapplicable to defeat a right of election which a party may have between an administrative and judicial remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">42 American Jurisprudence, 699:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyC\">\u201cThe doctrine does not apply in relation to a question which, while properly determinable by an administrative tribunal, does not involve a question of fact, but one of pure law, is determinable apart from the exercise of administrative discretion, and the requisite uniformity of determination is attainable otherwise than by confining determination of the question to the administrative tribunal.\u201d Doctrine of Primary Administrative Jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">In the early case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v.

Subsequently, most states by constitutional or statutory provision have reserved the power to alter, amend or repeal corporate powers granted in a charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Ohio did so in 1851 and its provisions, incorporated in the Constitution, under Article XIII, Section 2, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">\u201cCorporations may be formed under general laws; and all such laws may, from time to time, be altered or repealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">Ohio adheres to the rule that the relationship of stockholders to the corporation is one of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Geiger, et al. v.

At that moment also its property and interests of whatever kind become vested in the successor federal association \u201cwithout any conveyance or transfer, and without any further act or deed.\u201d All liens against the Ohio corporation at the time of conversion are preserved against the Federal association.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>All rights as to pending actions and existing substantive rights of action are preserved and minor details necessary for the final consummation of the conversion established.</p>\n<p id=\"AWv\">By the conferring of such plenary powers, the delineation in such exacting language of every step to be taken for conversion and the explanation in such conclusive language of the legal effect and legal status of every conceivable phase of the subject matter under consideration, the legislature obviously intended that these sections of the General Code by themselves completely accomplish and fulfill the objectives sought by this legislation. By the reading of them it is clear that there is no necessity to look to any other section of the General Code for authorization or guidance to effectuate the conversion of an Ohio savings and loan corporation into a Federal savings and loan association or to determine the rights, privileges and obligations of any one in any way concerned with or affected by a conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Plaintiffs claim that by the conversion of Security a dissolution occurs, a reorganization takes place and a sale of its assets is effected, and that consequently the respective statutes dealing with these matters apply and should be invoked. Under Ohio law that is not so. Dissolution means the entire demise of the corporation \u2014 its ceasing to continue in business and distribution of net assets among stockholders; reorganization means, revamping of the corporation, but its continuation as the same corporation. Sales of assets means the divorcing of assets from further use of them by the corporation. Conversion, on the other hand, imports a change or transformation into another and entirely new entity with all of its assets giving the life blood to the new corporation in the furtherance of the same business as originally undertaken by the corporation, however under a new name and under new laws and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Plaintiffs say that the language in paragraph 2 of \u00a79660-2 GC.</p>\n<p id=\"AG7\">\u201c* * * a resolution * * * shall be adopted as provided in the home owners\u2019 loan act of 1933 and amendments thereto\u201d refers generally to procedural matters and leaves the percentage vote to be controlled to other sections of the General Code dealing with the particular phases of corporation activity occuring in this transaction. This claim is untenable. What other sections of the Ohio General Code could be referred to? Security is effecting a conversion in pursuance to and in accordance with the sections of the General Code mentioned above. It does not have in mind a dissolution, reorganization, or a sale of assets. The law pertaining to those matters can have no application to the vote required in the proposition here under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Paragraph 202.23 of Chapter II Federal Savings and Loan System, captioned \u201cFormal Application for Conversion, (a) shareholders affected on conversion * * *\u201d reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201c* * * applicant shall proceed forthwith to obtain vote of its shareholders required by state law, if any, which expressly authorizes the conversion, or in the obsence of such a state law, the vote of the shareholders required by Section V (i) of Home Owner\u2019s Loan Act of 1933, as amended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The \u201cState law which expressly authorizes the conversion\u201d is \u00a79660-2 GC and the only part of it which can be construed as indicating the vote of its shareholders required for the conversion is the expression \u201chome \u25a0 owner\u2019s loan act of 1933 and amendments\u201d which language significantly is the same word for word which appears in the Federal law.

There is also no question but what all the necessary proceedings required by Security to take to effectuate its conversion into a Federal savings and loan association have been taken in strict compliance with all the provisions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>with the exception of the convening of a final special meeting of all of its members for the purpose of obtaining authorization to take the last necessary technical steps to perfect and complete the conversion of Security into the Federal body.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Is the proposed plan inequitable as far as stockholders are concerned because the value fixed for a share of stock is not based on the book value, which is estimated from capital assets, reserves, undivided profits and earnings, rather than on the value allowable from the company\u2019s assets after providing for the reserves and undivided profits required by the rules and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank-Board to permit the concern to continue as a going business after conversion into the Federal association?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In advancing the position that it is inequitable plaintiffs lose sight of the fact that Security is a banking concern demanding for its existence the depositing of large sums of monies which must have protection through allocating the major part of its net earnings to reserves adequate for the purpose. They also fail to realize that under the law stockholders have no property rights in reserve and undivided profits of a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">13 American Jurisprudence, 465:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cThe earnings and profits of a corporation remain the property of the corporation until severed from corporate assets and distributed as dividends. Until that time stockholders have no property interest therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Boardman, et al. v. Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, 84 N. Y., 157:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">\u201cA shareholder in a corporation is not entitled to any of the property or profits until a division has been made or a dividend declared.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">In Lamb v. Lehman, 110 Oh St, 66, Chief Justice Marshall has the following to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">\u201cThe authorities are quite harmonious upon the proposition that the earnings and profits of a private corporation are the property of the corporation free from all claims of stockholders unless and until distributed as dividends.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">The conversion price of $135 per share for the stock of Security was proposed and approved by the Board of Directors by unanimous vote. They then submitted the same in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Plan of Conversion to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board who approved it subject to approval of it by the stockholders. This Board consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">\u201cFederal Home Loan Bank Act, Title 12, Section 1437.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201c* * * flve citizens of the United States appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Not more than three members of the board shall be members of the same political party. Each member shall devote his entire time to the business of the board. * * * Each of the members of the board shall receive a salary at the rate of $10,000 per annum: * * * The Board shall supervise the Federal Home Loan Banks created by this chapter, and shall have power to adopt, amend, and require the observance of such rules, regulations, and orders as shall be necessary from time to time for carrying out the purposes of the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Before acting on the matter the Board of Directors conferred with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and tried to obtain a valuation of $150.00. The board, basing it upon a requirement of a reserve fund of 5% of total assets and an undivided profits fund of <em>2% </em>of total assets to assure the continuance in business of the Federal association on a safe and sound foundation, indicated that a valuation of $135 only was allowable. No one claims that these requirements are unreasonable to enable Security to continue as a going concern. In fact, plaintiffs make the point that the Plan of Conversion reduces the protection to depositors. The price of $135 thus is based on the business judgments of an experienced and well seasoned Board of Directors, a Federal Board of carefully selected individuals highly qualified for their office and politically balanced, and the majority of the stockholders acting entirely from self interest. Such complete circumspection in determining the fair and reasonable value of a share of stock on the part of all under the circumstances of conversion who are concerned about the matter should satisfy the most fastidious and allay the apprehensions of any who might be wary of a square deal in the matter. Certainly the procedures set out by law with respect to it have been fully complied with and the price, when one considers the history of stock sales (excepting sales in contemplation of conversion), the dividends earned, the availability of $135 in cash at any time, the insurance feature and the elimination of double liability in case of disaster, dees not appear to be unfair or unreasonable to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Allaun v.

The defendant Board of Directors and officers being in the business are highly qualified to pass judgment on the matter. The plaintiffs being in the investment business are highly qualified to pass on certain phases of it. However, the majority of the stockholders, in the exercise of their business judgment with respect to it voted to consummate the plan. They are the persons most directly to be affected by it and courts are loathe to substitute their judgment as to the policy and the best course that a business enterprise should follow for the judgment of men engaged in the business and having a personal interest in it as well as a vital concern about, it.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Davis, et al v.

It is conceded by all parties hereto that the procedures outlined in \u00a78623-72 GC have been followed and all requirements set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>forth therein complied with so that the only question involved for the adjudication of this cause of action is the question whether the plaintiffs have such appraisal rights under the facts and circumstances of this case and pursuant, to the sections of the Code mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Sec. 8623-72 GC, in part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201cUnless the articles otherwise provide, any dissenting shareholder, who shall not have voted in favor of the proposals herein mentioned and by the provision of any section of this act is entitled to relief when the articles of the corporation have been amended, and when all or substantially all of the property and assets of the corporation have been authorized to be sold, leased, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, or when a consolidation or reorganization of the corporation has been authorized, shall be paid the fair cash value of his shares as of the day before the vote was taken authorizing any such action, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">This section grants appraisal rights in the case when</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201c(1) articles of the corporation have been amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u201c(2) all or substantially all of the property assets of the corporation have been authorized to be sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of,</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\u201c (3) a consolidation or reorganization of the corporation has been authorized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">The Court has hereinbefore determined that the nature of the proceedings planned by Security has no pertinency to sections of the General Code dealing with these mentioned matters. Security contemplates a complete transformation of the corporation \u2014 lock, stock and barrel into an entirely new legal entity as- enunciated by the legislature in \u00a79660-1 and \u00a79660-2 GC. No appraisal rights can accrue to plaintiffs on the basis of this part of \u00a78623-72 GC.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Sec. 8623-72 GC also authorizes the determination and allowance of Fair Cash Value</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">\u201cby the provision of any section of this act.\u201d (Secs. 8623-1 to 8623-138)</p>\n<p id=\"AAs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Conversion in this case is based squarely on \u00a79660-1 and \u00a79660-2 GC which sections the Court finds to be complete and all-inclusive in accomplishing its purpose requiring no im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>plementation from any other section of the Code. No appraisal rights can accrue to plaintiffs from this part of \u00a78623-72 GC.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Sec. 693-1 GC deals with the reorganization of savings and loan associations. It contains a provision, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cAll dissenting shareholders shall be entitled to relief in the manner and under the conditions provided in \u00a78623-72 GC.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">This section likewise can bring no benefaction to plaintiffs as far as appraisal rights are concerned. The legislature in its enunciation of corporate law has made \u201creorganization\u201d and \u201cconversion\u201d different concepts with respect to their application to changes in Ohio corporations as hereinbefore explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Plaintiffs further assert that \u00a79660-2 GC expressly provides for Fair Cash Value by the use of the following language:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201c* * * shall be held or construed to deprive any person, firm or corporation of any substantive right heretofore existing against such association\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">and that Fair Cash Value is a substantive right which the stockholders of Security have by virtue of \u00a7693-1.GC and other sections of the General Code including \u00a78623-72 GC. This it seems to the Court is not so. In the opinion of this Court this provision merely intends to preserve the rights of all claimants having judgments or rights of action against Security before conversion. The legislature in its opening sentence in \u00a78623-72 GC says \u201cunless the articles otherwise provide\u201d which clearly indicates that it did not look upon Fair Cash Value to dissenting shareholders as something in the nature of a basic right. However, more persuasive than that is the fact that in every instance throughout the General Code wherein appraisal rights are intended to be given dissenting stockholders it is granted by express language and never by inference, implication or deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Sec. 8623-15a, GC.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">\u201cIf the reorganization is effected pursuant to this act alone, dissenting shareholders shall be entitled to relief in the manner and under the conditions, and to the extent prescribed in \u00a78623-72 GC, in respect of, the particular action, if any, which, if taken separately, would have entitled them to dissent and demand relief under this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">Sec. 8623-65 GC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cDissenting shareholders of any class, whether or not entitled to vote, shall be entitled to relief under the conditions, in the manner and to the extent provided in this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Sec. 8623-67 GC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201cDissenting shareholders of any constituent domestic corporation, whether or not entitled to vote, shall, if substantially prejudiced by such merger or consolidation, be entitled to relief under the conditions, in the manner and to the extent provided in this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Sec. 8623-72 GC (Quoted above)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Sec. 693-1 GC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\u201cAll dissenting shareholders shall be entitled to relief in the manner and under the conditions provided in \u00a78623-72 GC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Sec. 710-86 GC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">\u201cAny shareholder of the transferror bank who shall deem himself aggrieved by reason of such transfer, shall be paid the Fair Cash Value of his shares * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">Sec. 9546 GC.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">\u201cBut a stockholder in either of the companies so consolidating who refuses to agree thereto, shall be entitled to receive for the stock by him owned its just market value at the time thereof, to be paid to him previous to such consolidation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Sec. 8810 GC.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">\u201cA stockholder who refuses his assent to such sale, lease, or aid by subscription, * * * shall be entitled to receive * * * the average market value of his stock. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">Sec. 9034 GC.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">\u201cA stockholder who refuses to convert his stock * * * shall be paid * * * either the full market value thereof * * * or damages, if any to him because of the proposed consolidation or merger, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-17\">Besides \u00a78623-132 GC of the General Corporation Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u201cWhen special provision is made in the General Code for the incorporation, organization, conduct or government of corporations formed for any specified purpose, this act shall not apply, but the special provision shall govern unless it clearly appears that the special provision is cumulative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">\u201cSpecial provisions\u201d on which Security bases its claim herein \u2014\u00a79860-1 and \u00a79660-2 GC \u2014 are complete and all-inclusive as shown above. No part of it can be designated as cumulative. It is therefore clear that no provision of the General Corporation Act need be invoked to consummate the conversion planned by Security. These sections do not provide for the determination of the Fair Cash Value for dissenting stockholders. None therefore can be allowed under the law of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In Cases No. 607315 and No. 607529, plaintiffs Elta H. Jerger and Orrin C. Sabin, are stockholders of The Security Savings and Loan Company. Each disseflted at the special meeting of August 8th, 1949, and has since complied with all the steps required under \u00a78623-72 GC to perfect his demand for the determination of the Fair Cash Value of his respective shares of stock. They say that the Plan of Conversion in fact is \u201ca reorganization or merger\u201d and contemplates the dissolution of Security as an Ohio corporation, a transfer of its assets and the surrender and cancellation of its stock upon payment of $135, and enumerate 17 corporate structural changes which they claim this conversion in effect authorizes, each of which by express language of the General Corporation Act, or \u00a7693-1 GC allows appraisal rights. The plaintiffs in the Opdyke case stress the same proposition. It is manifest that if the defendant company were proceeding under any of the sections designated that appraisal rights would be in order. However, the defendant is not acting under any of the enumerated sections. It is not invoking certain sub-sections of the General Corporation Act and \u00a7693-1 GC and by separate and disjointed maneuvers attempting to effectuate a conversion by the application of such apparently pertinent parts of the Code. The Court repeats that they are proceeding pursuant to and in accordance with \u00a79660-1 and 9660-2 GC which set out all the steps necessary to a consummation of conversion without the need to invoke any other section or sections of the General Code of Ohio. It seems to this Court that if the legislature had intended to provide appraisal rights in the sections of the law relating to conversion it would have done so in express language similar to that used in the corporal changes noted above, and that not having done so is conclusive proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>that it had no intention to attach appraisal rights to \u00a79660-1 and \u00a79660-2 GC.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">II Atlantic (2) 337:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cIt is for the Legisuature not for the court, to declare the public policy of the state; and it is not, therefore, the function of the court to graft an exception on the plain and positive terms of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Plaintiff further say that if the Ohio statutes fail to give relief under these circumstances that then the dormant common law rights of plaintiffs should be invoked and the conversion enjoined on the basis of equitable relief in lieu of dissenting stockholders\u2019 rights. &gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">As determined in the Opdyke case plaintiffs here likewise have rights in the premises which are circumscribed by their contract with the defendant. That contract includes all pertinent legislative enactments so that their rights, if any, with respect to the allowance of the Fair Cash Value for their \u25a0stock, must be found in the Sections of the Code which apply and which are the only sections on which the Security Savings and Loan Company base their prerogative to convert. Those sections enunciate the law which governs the rights of the parties involved in this Conversion. The rights of dissenting stockholders under them have not been contravened and this Court can see no grounds to invoke its equitable powers. To \u25a0enjoin defendants under such circumstances would amount to judicial tyranny.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">One of the maxims of equity is \u201cEquity follows the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">In Magniac, et al. v. Thomson, 15 Howard (U. S.) 281:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">\u201cWherever the rights or the situation of parties are clearly defined and established by law, equity has no power to change or unsettle those rights or that situation, but in all such instances the maxim Equitas Sequitus Legum is strictly applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">In Rambo, et al. v. First State Bank of Argentine, 128 Pacific, 182, Syl. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">\u201cEquity must follow the law in all cases in which the legislature has intervened and prescribed rules of law which govern the rights of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Third Cause Of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">The expression \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in the discussion hereunder includes the plaintiffs of the Opdyke case as well as the Jerger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>and Sabin cases. All challenge the constitutionality of \u00a79660-1 and \u00a79660-2 GC, in the event the Court construes such sections in such a way as to deny them the Fair Cash Value for their stock, on the ground of the impairment of the obligation of contract (U. S. Constitution, Article I, Section 10; Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section 28) and of the deprivation of property without due process of law (U. S. Constitution, Amendment V and XIV, and Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 16).</p>\n<p id=\"AzW\">The Court has studied and considered all the authorities cited in the briefs relating to this subject and has come to the clear conclusion that \u00a79660-1 and \u00a79660-2 GC do not impair the obligations of Security\u2019s contract with the stockholders nor do they deprive the plaintiffs of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The relationship of the stockholders to Security is one of contract. The charter of the corporation, its constitution and by-laws and all applicable provisions of law are a part of such contract as though written in and made a part thereof and under Article XIII, Section 2 of the Constitution of Ohio, the legislature is permitted to enact laws providing for structural changes and transformations of corporations so long as the principal purpose and object of the corporation is not departed from and vested property rights of stockholders are not affected or nullified.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Yoakam v.

Such amendment would effect a retroactive application of the provisions of \u00a78623-14 GC, and would constitute an impairment of the constitutional rights of such shareholders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Under the Plan of Conversion the Board of Directors by unanimous vote proposed a price to be allowed a share of stock in the new association which the Federal Home Loan Bank Board approved subject to approval by the stockholders of Security. The stockholders then gave their approval. All of these steps were taken in strict compliance with the law. The plaintiffs when they became stockholders of Security under the law of Ohio in effect agreed that the procedure outlined by the statutes would be binding upon them since in contemplation of law these provisions of the law are a part of their contract with Security. These laws do not divest them of any vested property interest and provides for the determination of the value of their stock by qualified men in an orderly way including a vote on the part of the stockholders themselves. How then can they with good reason assert that the obligation of their contract has been impaired because another method for the determination of the value of their stock is not provided for when the provisions of the law they agreed to abide by have been complied with faithfully?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Hill, et al. v.

Mississippi, excepted, grant power to sell, exchange or lease or merger or consolidate upon a specific vote of the stockholders (Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and West Virginia).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">It would seem from all above that the allowance of the Fair Cash Value for the stock of dissenting stockholders is not an absolute prerequisite for a valid, subsisting and constitutional law respecting their rights, in fundamental corporate changes, and that, accordingly \u00a79660-1 and 9660-2 \u2019GC do not violate the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and are constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">8 O.

The corporation may fail and he get nothing or much less than the purchase price for it. The laws under which the corporation was formed may be changed or repealed and the value of his stock greatly affected. Moreover, its value fluctuates as the business of the corporation or even that of the country prospers or wanes. In other words his stock does not represent any vested right as far as its value is concerned unless his contract with the corporation so provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The plaintiffs herein have no vested rights concerning the value of their stock. Their contract with the corporation with respect to their stock is subject to amendment or change by the enactment of law or by a specific vote of the stockholders as declared by law or the constitution of the corporation. The price established for their stock under the Plan of Conversion was strictly in accordance with the mandate of law.

Minority stockholders, therefore, should not have the power to thwart their honest efforts to effectuate changes which they believe are for the best interests of their company and all parties concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Such powers, the Court feels, the minority stockholders in this instance do not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">There is no sound reason why corporate laws should not keep abreast of the times and give to corporations the fluidity of action necessary to meet successfully the day by day competition of business life and to grapple effectively with the ever-changing and varying conditions of the economic world.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">This is what the Court believes the legislature of Ohio intended in the laws herein directly involved and this is what the Court decides in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">For the reasons hereinabove stated the Court finds for the defendants on all three causes of action in Case No. 607237 and dismisses the Amended Petition of plaintiffs at their costs; for the defendant in Case No. 607317, and for the defendant in Case No. 607529, and in each case dismisses the petition of the plaintiff at his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Entries in Cases Nos. 610603, and 610256 are stayed until the further order of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">A Journal Entry may be drawn accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
