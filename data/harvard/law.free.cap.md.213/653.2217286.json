Part-low, that he is twenty-nine years of age and was convicted as accessory after the fact in a murder case, tried before a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, and sentenced to ten years in the Maryland Penitentiary in 1953, by Judge Con-well Smith. He was acquitted of the murder charge. The application for <em>habeas corpus </em>was addressed to Judge Horney, in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The twenty-one grounds for the writ fall into three general categories: allegations of innocence, alleged errors committed during the trial, alleged improper treatment by the Warden. Judge Horney considered each point in a careful opinion, and found that many of them could not be raised on <em>habeas corpus, </em>and that none of them added up to a deprivation of constitutional rights. We agree. Moreover, most of the contentions were considered by us in a prior application for leave to appeal. <em>Randall v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 667. We have repeatedly held that complaints as to prison management cannot be considered on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
