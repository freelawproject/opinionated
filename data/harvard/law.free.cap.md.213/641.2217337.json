He was released on parole to live in New York and he under the supervision of the New York State Parole Department. However, he violated his parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>and was returned to the Maryland House of Correction. After a hearing his parole was revoked. He complains that no credit has been given for the time spent on parole. It is perfectly clear that he is not entitled to credit under the circumstances. Code (1956 Supp.), Art. 41, sec. 91H; <em>Forrester v. Warden, 207 </em>Md. 622. <em>\u201cA </em>failure of the Board [of Parole and Probation] to exercise its discretion so as to grant credit does not deprive the petitioner of any constitutional right, even if we assume, without deciding, that such a point could be raised on <em>habeas corpus!\u2019 Williams v. Warden, </em>209 Md. 627, 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
