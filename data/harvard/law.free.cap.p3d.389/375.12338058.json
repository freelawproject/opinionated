BARNES, JUDGE:</author>\n<p id=\"b410-23\">\u00b6 1 This action arises from tragic circumstances involving the murder of a child placed in the custody of her biological father. Plaintiffs/Appellants Charles and Annette Deal (Plaintiffs) appeal the trial court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant/Appellee State of OMahoma ex rel. Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS). Although the Order does not address all issues and Defendants, the Order states that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay,\u201d and it expressly directs that the Order \u201cbe filed as a final order and judgment as to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against [DHS] pursuant to 12 O.S. 2011 994.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\u00b6 2 The first issue presented on appeal is whether DHS is exempt from tort liability under the Oklahoma Governmental Tort Claims Act, 51 O.S. Supp. 2013 151-172 (GTCA), In particular, 155 of the GTCA provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he state or a political subdivision shall not be liable if a loss or claim results from: ...; 29. Any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee in the placement of children[.]\u201d Because the claims asserted against DHS are based on acts or omissions of DHS employees in the placement of a child with her biological father, the plain and ordinary meaning of 155(29) requires that we find that a cause of action is unavailable under the GTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b6 3 The second issue presented on appeal is whether the facts\u2014when viewed on summary judgment in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs\u2014require that this case be remanded for further proceedings on a <em>\u201cBosh </em>claim\u201d against DHS. As this Court recently explained in <em>GJA v. Oklahoma Department of Human Services, </em>2015 OK CIV APP 32, 347 P.3d 310, the Oklahoma Supreme Court, in <em>Bosh v. Cherokee County Building Authority, </em>2013 OK 9, 305 P.3d 994, held \u201cthat section 30, article 2 of the Oklahoma Constitution provides a private cause of action for excessive force against an arrested and detained person, <em>notivithstanding the immunities under the GTCA[.]\u201d GJA, </em>\u00b623 (emphasis added). In <em>GJA, </em>we confronted the issue of whether the <em>Bosh </em>case recognizes a broader scope of actionable claims based upon violations of constitutional rights. <em>GJA, </em>\u00b626. We concluded in <em>GJA </em>that the facts alleged did not state a constitutionally-based claim against DHS under Bosh; among other things, the custody arrangement that led to the harm to the children in <em>GJA </em>was the result of a custody order in a divorce decree rather than the result of actions undertaken while the children were in the custody of DHS. However, we did not exclude the possibility that a claim may exist against DHS under circumstances where the constitutional rights of a child have been violated by state employees. Indeed, the Oklahoma Supreme Court stated in <em>Bosh </em>that the GTCA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">cannot be construed as immunizing the state completely from all liability for violations of the constitutional rights of its citizens. To do so would not only fail to conform to established precedent which refused to construe the [GTCA] as providing blanket immunity, but would also render the Constitutional protections afforded the citizens of this State as ineffective, and a nullity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\"><em>Bosh, </em>\u00b623.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u00b64 In the'present case, we conclude that genuine disputes of material fact exist as to whether the child\u2019s \u201csubstantive due process interest in safe conditions, personal security, and bodily integrity for persons in state custody,\u201d <em>Yvonne L. ex rel. Lewis v. N.M. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>959 F.2d 883, 891 (10th Cir. 1992)\u2014an interest protected by the minimum requirements of the Oklahoma Constitution and the Constitution of the United States\u2014was violated by DHS employees acting recklessly in conscious disregard of a known or obvious risk of serious, immediate, and proximate harm to the child, <em>Currier v. Doran, </em>242 F.3d 905, 918 (10th Cir. 2001). The constitutional right at issue\u2014described in <em>GJA </em>as a child\u2019s \u201cclearly established constitutional right to be reasonably safe from harm when placed in the state\u2019s custody,\u201d <em>GJA, </em>\u00b637 (footnote omitted)\u2014is, as explained in greater detail below, guaranteed by the substantive component of the due process clause. As in <em>Bosh, </em>where the GTCA did not immunize the state from liability for excessive force inflicted <em>on a prisoner </em>while in its custody, we conclude the GTCA does not immunize DHS from liability for reckless and deliberate acts that deprive <em>a child </em>of her due process rights while in state custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u00b6 5 Therefore, we affirm that portion of the trial court\u2019s Order finding that a cause of action under the GTCA is unavailable. However, because genuine disputes of material fact remain regarding a violation of the child\u2019s constitutional rights under the due process clause\u2014in particular, whether certain DHS employees, acting within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>of their employment, acted recklessly in conscious disregard of a known or obvious risk of serious, immediate, and proximate harm to the child, and whether their conduct, when viewed in total, is conscience shocking'\u2014we reverse the trial court\u2019s award of summaiy judgment, and we remand for further proceedings against DHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b6 6 In November 2013, Plaintiffs filed their second amended petition asserting they are the maternal grandparents of a minor child who, on or about June 4, 2011, \u201cwas beaten to death by [Defendant Sean Devon Brooks],\u201d her biological father. Indeed, Brooks is now serving a life sentence for murder in the first degree at the Joseph Harp Correctional Center in Lexington, Oklahoma. Plaintiffs assert the child, who was born in May 2006, did \u201cnot meet [Brooks] until she was four years old,\u201d and that, until that time, the child lived with her mother and Plaintiffs. They assert that in June 2009, \u201cDHS received a referral relating to [the child\u2019s mother],\u201d and that, in September 2010, \u201cthe [district court] placed [the child] in [the] emergency custody of [DHS].\u201d Plaintiffs assert they filed a petition to adopt the child and, \u201c[p]ursuant to Oklahoma Statute, Brooks was given notice of the proceedings, and a paternity test confirmed that he was the biological father of the child.\u201d They assert Brooks refused to consent to the adoption by Plaintiffs, and, subsequently, the district court ruled Plaintiffs could not adopt the child over the objection of Brooks. Plaintiffs acknowledge they appealed this ruling and \u201cthe Supreme Court affirmed ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b67 Plaintiffs assert that in April 2010, Brooks filed a petition seeking sole custody of the child. They further assert that after the child was placed in the emergency custody of DHS, DHS failed to make proper recommendations, and also withheld vital information, relating to the child\u2019s placement. They assert that \u201c[i]n the two months prior to DHS\u2019s placement of [the child] with Brooks, DHS workers\u201d\u2014i.e., certain DHS workers not named as defendants in this case\u2014\u201cexpressed serious concerns about the placement,\u201d They assert, however, that these serious concerns, in addition to information evidencing abuse of the child by Brooks during unsupervised visitation, \u201cwas not released\u201d to the district court or the district attorney prior to the placement determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b6 8 Plaintiffs further assert that Defendants Jennifer Shawn (Shawn) and Randy J. Lack (Lack) are former DHS workers who both ultimately \u201cpled guilty ... to a charge of suppressing evidence in violation of 21 O.S. 546\u201d in connection with the placement determination. Plaintiffs further assert that both of these Defendants were then terminated by DHS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">\u00b6 9 As against DHS, Plaintiffs assert tort theories of negligence, negligence per se, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and wrongful death. Plaintiffs also assert they complied with the notice requirements of the GTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">\u00b6 10 In the Answer of DHS, DHS asserts, among other things, that Plaintiffs\u2019 action against it \u201cis barred by the [GTCA],\u201d and, in particular, it asserts it is shielded from liability \u201cpursuant to the applicable exemptions\u201d set forth in 155 of the GTCA. DHS also asserts that the child\u2019s death was \u201cthe result of intervening and supervening criminal acts of third persons\u201d for which DHS should not be held responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">\u00b6 11 Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment in February 2015, seeking summary judgment against what it refers to as \u201cthe DHS Defendants\u201d\u2014i.e., Shawn, Lack, and DHS. In its response, DHS requests that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion be denied, and they request that summary judgment instead be granted in favor of DHS. DHS argues, among other things, that even if its employees were acting within the scope of their employment and were negligent, DHS is nev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ertheless exempt from tort liability as a matter of law under the exemptions set forth in 155 of the GTCA, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\">51 O.S. 155(3) (losses resulting from execution or enforcement of a court order); 51 O.S. 155(4) (losses resulting from enforcement of or failure to enforce a statute or \u2022written policy); and 51 O.S. 155(29) (losses resulting from acts or omissions of an employee in the placement of children).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b6 12 Pertinent to this appeal, the trial court, in its Order filed in May 2015, denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion as to DHS and, instead, granted summary judgment in favor of DHS. As stated above, the tidal court then ordered that, \u201cas to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against [DHS],\u201d there is no just reason for delay and it expressly directed that the Order be filed as a final and appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b6 13 Prom this portion of the Order awarding summary judgment in favor of DHS, Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b6 14 The standard of review applicable to this case is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">Summary relief issues stand before us for <em>de novo </em>review. All facts and inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. Appellate tribunals bear the same affirmative duty as is borne by [trial] courts to test for legal sufficiency all evidentiary material received in summary process in support of the relief sought by the movant. Only if the court should conclude there is no material fact (or inference) in dispute and the law favors the movant\u2019s claim or liability-defeating defense is the moving party entitled to summary relief in its favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\"><em>Reeds v. Walker, </em>2006 OK 43, \u00b69, 157 P.3d 100 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">I. <em>The Availability of a Cause of Action Under the GTCA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">\u00b6 15 The parties do not dispute that DHS constitutes a political subdivision under the GTCA, and, as a consequence, DHS can ordinarily be held liable in tort only to the extent set forth in the GTCA. Generally, \u201c[t]he GTCA is the exclusive remedy for an injured plaintiff to recover against a governmental entity in tort. Subject only to the GTCA\u2019s specific limitations and exceptions, governmental immunity is waived under the GTCA.\u201d <em>Tuffy\u2019s, Inc. v. City of Okla. City, </em>2009 OK 4, \u00b67, 212 P.3d 1158 (footnotes omitted). <em>See also Speight v. Presley, </em>2008 OK 99, \u00b611, 203 P.3d 173 (The GTCA \u201cis the exclusive remedy by which an injured plaintiff may recover against a governmental entity for its negligence,\u201d and \u201c[i]f an employee is acting outside the scope of employment, the GTCA does not apply.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">\u00b6 16 We conclude that the following exemption, pertaining to \u201cthe placement of children,\u201d clearly operates to exempt DHS from tort liability in this case under the GTCA. Title 51 O.S. Supp. 2013 155(29) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-17\">The state or a political subdivision shall not be liable if a loss or claim results from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAuI\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-18\">29. Any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee in the placement of ehildren[.]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">\u00b6 17 Indeed, this Court recently acknowledged in <em>GJA, </em>2015 OK CIV APP 32, 347 P.3d 310, that 155(29) pertains to acts or omissions of DHS employees in the placement of children. <em>GJA, </em>\u00b620. In <em>GJA, </em>the plaintiff/father alleged in his petition that his children were abused while in their mother\u2019s (i.e., his former spouse\u2019s) custody. He alleged that DHS was informed about the abuse but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>did nothing. DHS filed a motion to dismiss which the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b6 18 As to the applicability of 155(29), we stated in <em>GJA </em>that because \u201cboth children were living with their mother at the time and in accordance with the Decree of Divorce,\u201d because \u201cthe children were not \u2019placed\u2019 by DHS employees,\u201d and because there was no \u201cclaim based upon an act or omission in the placement of the children,\u201d that the exemption set forth in 155(29) did not apply. <em>GJA, </em>\u00b620-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b6 19 However, in the present case, all of the tort theories asserted against DHS are based upon acts and omissions of DHS employees in the placement of the child with Brooks. As stated above, Plaintiffs assert in their petition that after the child was placed in the emergency custody of DHS, DHS failed to make proper recommendations, and also withheld vital information, relating to the child\u2019s ultimate placement with her biological father. In Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, they elaborate that \u201cthe DHS Defendants committed numerous breaches of duty\u201d as a result of a failure to provide the district court with the proper documentation relating to the child\u2019s placement; as a result of a failure to properly scrutinize the appropriateness of the child being placed with Brooks; and as a result of a \u201cfailure to cheek Brooks\u2019 criminal record\u201d prior to the placement decision. Clearly, these constitute acts or omissions of one or more DHS employees in the placement of a child. 155(29).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b620 Somewhat more ambiguously, the breaches, as elaborated by Plaintiffs in their motion for partial summary judgm\u00e9nt, also include a \u201cfailure to investigate why Brooks did not seek medical cafe for [the child] when the severity of her bruising became apparent,\u201d a \u201cfailure to inquire why Brooks did not call the foster parent or case worker when he \u2019dropped\u2019 [the child],\u201d and a \u201cfailure to appreciate the inconsistency in Brooks\u2019 explanations for [the child\u2019s] bruises and other injuries.\u201d However, as to these alleged failures, the evidentiary materials attached to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion reveal that they also occurred prior to the decision to place the child with Brooks, and Plaintiffs have set them forth as reasons why the decision to place the child with Brooks was, at least, a negligent one. No assertion has been made that DHS was negligent <em>after </em>the placement decision was made, nor is any support for such an assertion contained in the evidentiary materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">\u00b6 21 In this regard, a brief overview of the timeline of events is instructive. As stated above, Plaintiffs assert that in June 2009, \u201cDHS received a referral relating to [the child\u2019s mother],\u201d and, in September 2010, the child was placed in the emergency custody of DHS. The evidentiary materials reveal that, by January 2011, the child had not yet been placed with Brooks, but had, instead, been placed in a foster home. The evidentiary materials reveal that pre-placement visits between the child and Brooks began soon after the child was taken into DHS custody, and visitation with Brooks \u201cprogressed from supervised visits to unsupervised day visits to overnights and into extended overnights.\u201d However, by early 2011, the placement decision had not yet been made and the child remained in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">\u00b622 In late March 2011, serious concerns about the potential placement of the child with Brooks were expressed by non-defendant DHS employees, as stated above. In fact, \u201c[f]or the period of time from March 15, 2011, through May 9, 2011, there were multiple emails expressing concerns of the foster parents....\u201d However, the evidentiary materials reveal that the decision to place the child with Brooks was not made until May 11, 2011. A certain DHS report then \u201cinformed the court,\u201d at a hearing held \u00f3n May 25, 2011, \u201cthat the child ... was placed with [Brooks] on May 11, 2011, and that the recommendation from [DHS] was that the child ... remain in the home of [Brooks].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">\u00b6 23 The timeline of events thus reveals that after the decision to place the child with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Brooks was made, and after the May 25, 2011 hearing, the child\u2019s death occurred just ten days later, prior to, for example, any scheduled review of the placement or other opportunity to intervene. No assertion has been made by Plaintiffs that DHS was negligent <em>after </em>the placement decision was made in May 2011; instead, all of the claims asserted against DHS are based upon the acts and omissions of the DHS Defendants in the placement of the child with Brooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b6 24 In conclusion, the Legislature, under 155(29), has exempted DHS from tort liability under the GTCA for \u201c[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee in the placement of children[.]\u201d Because the tort claims asserted against DHS are based solely on acts or omissions of DHS employees in the placement of the child with Brooks, the plain and ordinary meaning of 155(29) requires that we find a cause of action under the GTCA to be unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>II. Bosh Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b6 25 In <em>Perry v. City of Norman, </em>2014 OK 119, 341 P.3d 689, the Oklahoma Supreme Court explained that a <em>\u201cBosh </em>claim\u201d is limited to those circumstances where a cause of action under the GTCA is unavailable. Having concluded that a cause of action is unavailable under the GTCA in this case, we turn to the issue of whether a <em>Bosh </em>claim\u2014based on a violation of the child\u2019s constitutional rights\u2014may be available.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u00b6 26 We first note that although the parties and the trial court do not appear to have entertained the possibility of a <em>Bosh </em>claim in the proceedings below, \u201c[w]hen rendering summary judgment ... [the court is] not only authorized <em>but required to rule out all theories of liability </em>fairly comprised within the evidentiary materials before [it].\u201d <em>Hadnot v. Shaw, </em>1992 OK 21, \u00b625, 826 P.2d 978 (emphasis in original). <em>See also Parris v. Limes, </em>2012 OK 18, \u00b63, 277 P.3d 1259 (\u201cIt is well-settled that in determining the propriety of granting a summary judgment, the trial court <em>is not only authorized but required </em>to rule out all theories of liability fairly encompassed within the evidentiary material presented.\u201d) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Furthermore, this Court is required under 12 O.S. 2011 2201(A) to take judicial notice of fundamental rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Okla. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Lobaugh, </em>1988 OK 144, 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>n.7, 781 P.2d 806. <em>See also Pettit v. Am.

Lack of due process claims are an exception to that rule.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b627 As this Court recently explained in <em>GJA, </em>the Oklahoma Supreme Court, in <em>Bosh, </em>held \u201cthat section 30, article 2 of the Oklahoma Constitution provides a private cause of action for excessive force against an arrested and detained person, <em>notwithstanding the immunities under the GTGA[,]\u201d GJA, </em>2015 OK CIV APP 32, \u00b623, 347 P.3d 310 (emphasis added). In <em>GJA, </em>we confronted the following question: \u201cShould the <em>Bosh </em>case be limited to its facts and specific holdings or does the decision stand for the proposition that the Supreme Court recognizes a broader scope of actionable claims based upon violations of constitutional rights?\u201d <em>GJA, </em>\u00b626. We concluded in <em>GJA </em>that the facts alleged failed to state a valid <em>Bosh </em>claim. However, we did not exclude the possibility that such a claim against DHS may exist under circumstances where the constitutional rights of a child have been violated. Indeed, as quoted above, the <em>Bosh </em>Court stated that the GTCA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2C\">cannot be construed as immunizing the state completely from all liability for violations of the constitutional rights of its citizens. To do so would not only fail to conform to established precedent which refused to construe the [GTCA] as providing blanket immunity, but would also render the Constitutional protections afforded the citizens of this State as ineffective, and a nullity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><em>Bosh, </em>2013 OK 9, \u00b623, 305 P.3d 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b6 28 In the present case, at issue is the child\u2019s \u201csubstantive due process interest in safe conditions, personal security, and bodily integrity for persons in state custody,\u201d <em>see Yvonne, </em>959 F.2d at 891, and whether that interest was violated by DHS employees acting within the scope of their employment. The constitutional right at issue\u2014described in <em>GJA </em>as a child\u2019s \u201cclearly established constitutional right to be reasonably safe from harm when placed in the state\u2019s custody,\u201d <em>GJA, </em>\u00b637 (footnote omitted)\u2014is guaranteed under the minimum protections afforded by the due process clause of the Oklahoma Constitution, which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,\u201d Okla. Const. art. 2, 7, and by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution\u2014which provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,\u201d U.S. Const. amend. XIV, 1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">\u00b6 29 As in <em>Bosh, </em>where the Oklahoma Supreme Court declined to construe the GTCA so as to immunize the state from constitutionally-based liability for excessive force inflicted <em>on a prisoner </em>while in its custody, we conclude the GTCA does not immunize DHS from liability for certain reckless and deliberate acts that deprive <em>a child </em>of due process rights while in state custody.

Otherwise, [the child] was free to do whatever he wanted, including voluntarily leaving his house. Banning a student from the school grounds does not rise to the same level of involuntary restraint as arresting, incarcerating, or institutionalizing an individual.

This court determined that this decision could be \u201cconstrued as conscience-shocking, depending on context as determined after a full trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1264.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><em>Currier, </em>242 F.3d at 920. The <em>Currier </em>Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">The allegations in Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against Doran, if true, are at least as eon-science-shocking as the facts in <em>Armijo. </em>It is important to remember that Doran\u2019s conduct must be \u201cviewed in total,\u201d and thus the cumulative impression of Doran\u2019s conduct should be considered. <em>Id. </em>In light of the initial information Doran had about [the father\u2019s] financial irresponsibility, and in light of the numerous bruises and allegations of abuse, Doran\u2019s failure to investigate the bruises and allegations and his subsequent responsibility for the court order granting [the father] legal custody could be conscience shocldng, depending, of course, on further context as provided by discovery. <em>See id. </em>Thus, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a danger creation claim against Doran.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\"><em>Currier, </em>242 F.3d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">\u00b6 54 Pursuant to <em>Currier, </em>genuine disputes of material fact exist regarding a \u201cdanger creation theory\u201d against DHS. In the present case, and viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs on summary judgment, the child <em>was </em>placed in a worse position than that in which she would have been had the state not acted at all. In the present case, it appears the child never even knew her father (i.e., for the first four years of her life) until after she was removed from the custody of her mother and placed in the emergency custody of DHS. The child was introduced to her father while in the custody of DHS and in foster care, and the various indications of the father\u2019s abusive tendencies toward the child became manifest following his visitations with the child and while the child was otherwise living with a foster family. Despite the fact that DHS knew or should have known that the child was a special needs child who had a pace maker; despite the fact that it became apparent that Brooks was abusing the child during his visitation periods with the child; despite the fact that Brooks was, among other things, inflicting severe injuries near the child\u2019s pace maker and leaving scars and bruises on other parts of the child\u2019s face and body; despite the fact that other DHS workers and the foster parents raised multiple concerns on multiple occasions regarding Brooks, including the fact that the child was terrified of Brooks; <em>nevertheless, </em>the DHS workers knowingly withheld all this information from the court and recommended placement of the child with Brooks. Viewing the facts in their present, undeveloped state, we conclude genuine disputes of material fact exist and that summary judgment was improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">\u00b6 55 There can be no doubt that, as to children in state custody, Oklahoma\u2019s due process clause prevails over the GTCA with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>regard to placement decisions that are made recklessly in conscious disregard of a known or obvious risk of serious, immediate, and proximate harm to the child. Where state actors, acting within the scope of their employment, create a danger to a child in state custody, or increase a child\u2019s vulnerability to a danger in some way; where the state\u2019s conduct puts a child at <em>substantial risk of serious, immediate, md proximate harm; </em>where the risk was <em>obvious or known; </em>where defendants acted <em>recklessly in conscious disregard of that risk; </em>and where such conduct, <em>when viewed in total, is conscience shocking, </em>respondeat superior serves as a basis for liability against DHS under a cause of action arising from the due process clause of the Oklahoma Constitution. <em>See Bosh, </em>\u00b632.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b6 56 \u201c[Established precedent\u201d in Oklahoma has \u201crefused to construe the [GTCA] as providing blanket immunity,\u201d especially where that immunity would \u201crender the Constitutional protections afforded the citizens of this State as ineffective, and a nullity.\u201d <em>Bosh, </em>\u00b623. Thus, although we affirm that portion of the trial court\u2019s Order finding that a cause of action under the GTCA is unavailable, we reverse the tidal court\u2019s award of summary judgment because genuine disputes of material fact remain regarding a possible violation of the child\u2019s constitutional rights under the due process clause of the Oklahoma Constitution. In particular, disputes of fact exist as to whether certain DHS employees, acting within the scope of their employment, acted recklessly in conscious disregard of a known or obvious risk of serious, immediate, and proximate harm to the child, and whether their conduct, when viewed in total, is conscience shocking.

We note that in April 2014, after the issuance of <em>Bosh, </em>the Legislature amended 153(B) of the GTCA. Prior to 2014, and following the Oklahoma Supreme Court\u2019s Opinion in <em>Bosh, </em>51 O.S. 2011 153(B) provided: \u201cThe liability of the state or political subdivision under this act shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of the state, a political subdivision or employee at common law or otherwise.\u201d In April 2014, 153(B) was amended to state the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">The liability of the state or political subdivision under [the GTCA] shall be exclusive and shall constitute the extent of tort liability of the state, a political subdivision or employee arising from common law, statute, the Oklahoma Constitution, or otherwise. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds tort liability on the part of the state or a political subdivision of the state based on a provision of the Oklahoma Constitution or state law other than [the GTCA], the limits of liability provided for in [the GTCA] shall apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">51 O.S. Supp. 2014 153(B). <em>See also </em>Supp. 2015 153(C). Thus, the April 2014 amendment may constitute an attempt by the Legislature to diminish or destroy constitutionally-based causes of action against the state or political subdivision. However, we need not, and do not, address this amendment because it is not applicable to the present case. The 2014 amendment went into effect after Plaintiffs filed this case (and, indeed, several months after Plaintiffs filed their second amended petition in November 2013). \"Statutes are typically not given retroactive effect unless the Legislature has made its intent to do so clear. Any doubts must be resolved against a retroactive effect,\" <em>CNA Ins. Co. v. Ellis, </em>2006 OK 81, \u00b613, 148 P.3d 874 (citation omitted).

Further discussion supporting this conclusion is also found in <em>Bosh, </em>where the Supreme Court discussed the following case:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">In <em>Baker v. Saint Francis Hospital, </em>2005 OK 36, \u00b618, 126 P.3d 602, a jury question was presented whether a daycare caregiver was acting within the scope of employment so as to hold her employer liable for intentionally striking a child's head on corner of shelf. The Court noted at \u00b612 that:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Oklahoma case law provides examples of cases involving torts for which the employer was held liable and those in which the employer was not held liable. Early in statehood the Court held that a railroad company was liable for the actions of the train auditor, who falsely imprisoned a passenger arising out of a controversy over the payment of a fare. The Court stated the general rule that a corporation, like an individual, is liable for any tort committed by its agent in the course of his employment, <em>\"even though the act is done wantonly and recklessly, or was against the express orders of the company.\" Chicago R.I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Radford, </em>1913 OK 7, \u00b64 [36 Okla. 657], 129 P. 834, 837. Other cases holding the employer liable for the tort of the employee include: <em>Ada-Konawa Bridge Co. v.

We note it appears the child was still in the \"legal'' custody of DHS. However, we need not. and do not, decide this issue at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\">. The court further explained as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The limited caselaw does not support Defendants' theory that they are shielded by <em>DeShaney </em>because [the children] were placed in the custody of their natural father. In <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania considered the constitutional claims of the mother of a child who had been beaten to death by his father. <em>See </em>899 F.Supp. 227, 233 (E.D. Pa. 1995). The child had been in state custody before being placed with her father by court order after an investigation and recommendation by local social workers. <em>See id. </em>The court decided that the mother had stated a constitutional claim by alleging that the social workers failed to investigate the father and failed to report information to the juvenile court which would have disqualified the father from gaining custody. <em>See id. </em>at 232. The court stated that just because \"the child is placed with a parent as opposed to a foster parent should not change the standards by which social agencies and their employees conduct their investigations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">Similarly, in <em>Tazioly v. City of Philadelphia, </em>the same court held that the \"state-created danger theory may apply in cases where a state actor has rendered a minor more vulnerable to injury at the hands of the minor\u2019s biological parent.\" No. CIV.A. 97-CV-1219, 1998 WL 633747, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 10, 1998) (unpublished disposition). In <em>Tazioly </em>the City Department of Human Services removed a child from a foster parent and placed him in the custody of his mother. The court distinguished <em>DeShaney </em>by noting that in <em>DeShaney </em>there was insufficient evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>abuse to retain the child in state custody, while defendant social workers in the <em>Tazioly </em>case had actual knowledge that the biological mother was \"unfit and dangerous,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *9.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">While language in the Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>K.H. v. Morgan, </em>914 F.2d 846, 852-53 (7th Cir. 1990), suggests that placing a child with a family member might insulate the state from constitutional liability, the Seventh Circuit seems to have since reconsidered its earlier dicta. In a recent case involving a suit brought against social workers as the result of injuries suffered while a child was abused at her father's home, the court stated that \"[i]f the [social workers] knowingly placed [plaintiff] in a position of danger, they would not be shielded from liability by the decision in <em>DeShaney.\" Bank of Ill. v. Over, </em>65 F.3d 76, 78 (7th Cir. 1995). Furthermore, the reasoning used by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Morgan </em>actually supports constitutional liability when custody is transferred from one parent to another. The court stated that \"[t]he state could have left [plaintiff] to the tender mercies of her parents without thereby violating her rights under the Constitution. But having removed her from their custody the state assumed at least a limited responsibility for her safety.\u201d <em>Morgan, </em>914 F.2d at 849. Under this reasoning it would be arbitrary to allow the state to avoid this responsibility merely by placing the child with another relative. <em>See S.S. v. McMullen, </em>225 F.3d 960, 968 (8th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (Gibson, J., dissenting) (\"These distinctions ... between foster parents and natural parents [] are arbitrary.\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>69 U.S.L.W. 3410 (U.S. Dec. 8, 2000) (No. 00-946)[, <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 904, 121 S.Ct. 1227, 149 L.Ed.2d 137(2001)].</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\"><em>Currier, </em>242 F.3d at 918-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">. See also <em>Binette v. Sabo, </em>244 Conn. 23, 710 A.2d 688 (1998), wherein the Supreme Court of Connecticut explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">the United States Supreme Court [has] concluded that federal courts possess the power to create a private damages action directly under the federal constitution; <em>and the great majority of state courts that have considered the question have recognized their authority to do so under their state constitutions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 693 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b424-9\">THORNBRUGH, P.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqkD\">concurring specially:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\u00b6 1 I concur entirely with this opinion and its reasoning. I write separately only to emphasize two points: Fust, I emphasize the clear fact that the Oklahoma Constitution and its protections and restraints on state power are <em>above the statutory law. </em>Imposing no penalty for state-sponsored violations of fundamental constitutional rights would allow the state to act with complete impunity. The matter is very well stated in \u00b623 of <em>Bosh, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">The OGTCA cannot be construed as immunizing the state completely from all liability for violations of the constitutional rights of its citizens. To do so would not only fail to conform to established precedent which refused to construe the OGT-CA as providing blanket immunity, but would also render the Constitutional protections afforded the citizens of this State as ineffective, and a nullity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">\u00b6 2 This simple truth cannot be evaded by urging a doctrine that a state actor automatically ceases to act with the authority of the state if he or she breaches a fundamental constitutional right of a citizen. <em>If an act is forbidden to the King, it may not be carried out by those acting on behalf of the King.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">\u00b6 3 Second, I write to note a current lack of clarity in the procedure regarding the type of claim presented in this case. If the OGT-CA purports to grant the state immunity from violation of a fundamental constitutional right, a court may either (1) declare that the OGTCA immunity in this area is not absolute, or (2) declai\u2019e that the OGTCA does grant absolute immunity, but that a cause of action is available outside the OGTCA. <em>Bosh </em>appears to take the latter view\u2014that a claim resulting from the violation of a fundamental constitutional right \u201cdoes not arise from the OGTCA,\u201d and hence represents a separate, common-law claim that is not subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>notice and limitations provisions of the OGT-CA. I note, however, that further procedural clarification of whether such claims are (or are not) subject to the various procedural requirements of the OGTCA would be of enormous value to the judges and practitioners in state courts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
