(UPS), a privately owned company, appeals from a final administrative action of respondent New Jersey Casino Control Commission (Commission) that denied its petition for an exemption from the casino service industry licensure requirements pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-92(c) and from an order that denied its motion for rehearing pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-107(d)(1). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-92(c) authorizes the Commission to grant exemptions from the casino service industry licensure requirements when an entity proposing to do business with a casino demonstrates that it is regulated by a \u201cpublic agency.\u201d The Commission found that UPS\u2019s regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission was not a sufficient substitute for regulation under the Casino Control Act (Act). We affirm the Commission\u2019s decision denying UPS an exemption from the licensure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Briefly, the procedural history giving rise to this appeal is that on August 8, 1990, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-92(c), UPS filed a request for an exemption from the casino service indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>try (CSI) licensure requirements. UPS contended that it was a common carrier engaged in interstate operations and, as such, was subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 10101 <em>etseq. </em>(Supp.1991). Further, UPS maintained that the ICC regulation constituted a \u201csufficient substitute\u201d for the regulatory scheme of the Act. Specifically, it noted that the ICC required that UPS rates be established by tariff, reviewed the tariffs to ensure that the rates charged were reasonable, and prohibited UPS from engaging in discriminatory pricing practices such as providing rebates or drawbacks. Additionally, UPS noted that ICC regulations also require a common carrier to demonstrate financial capability in order to receive an ICC certificate. UPS explained that granting an exemption to it would not be adverse to the public interest because the economic relationship between UPS and casino hotel operators was not so close as to afford either UPS or the gaming operator the opportunity to exert improper influence over the business decisions of the other. UPS also emphasized that the services provided by it were not directly related to actual gaming operations, and that UPS personnel were not a constant physical presence at casinos and, indeed, were required to pick-up and deliver goods promptly. Finally, UPS maintained that the local interests advanced by requiring regulation under the Act were insufficient to justify the excessive burden imposed on interstate commerce, and that requiring it to comply with CSI licensure requirements would violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On September 12, 1990, a Deputy Attorney General (Deputy) representing the Division of Gaming Enforcement (Division) advised the Commission that the Division did not object to the requested exemption. The Deputy noted that although, unlike the Act, the ICC did not provide for disqualification of enterprises, employees or agents due to criminal convictions, \u201cthe existence of established tariffs, coupled with a competitive marketplace, should preclude the possibility of undue influence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>economic or otherwise, over casino licensee customers and protect the public interest so as to satisfy the policies of the Casino Control Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On September 26, 1990, the Commission held a hearing on UPS\u2019s petition. At the hearing, a Deputy from the Division expressed the view that there was no necessity for regulation under the Act, although he also acknowledged that the ICC did not perform the \u201cgood character, honesty and integrity\u201d reviews of potential licensees which are a part of the Act. The Deputy considered that the ICC rate-setting process, coupled with competition with UPS, \u201cwill ensure a character and integrity standard because of the fact that simply nobody could exert an undue influence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Commissioner Waters declined to support a motion in favor of granting the exemption and commented that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">COMMISSIONER WATERS: I can\u2019t support the motion. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that one of our primary concerns has to do with the way in which another agency regulates an entity to see that it\u2019s similar to that which we look for in the State of New Jersey. One of the prime factors I always thought was good character, honesty and integrity issues that needed to be examined by the Division to make sure that no one unsavory in any way received any economic benefit from the industry, not the fact that just might have a transitory relationship and might just be delivering packages and moving on. I don\u2019t think the question related to the drivers and their ability to satisfy any character requirements. That\u2019s never been the issue as far as I know. I think heretofore and in the case of Sprint and MCI we came to the conclusion that we were granting the exemption because the system of regulation as carried out by the Board of Public Utilities was virtually equivalent to the CSI licensing requirements of the Act. I know the argument has been made by UPS that this constitutes a burden on interstate commerce. I think that has been dealt with over the years dating back to 1970 that the state if it has a legitimate local interest can end up with requirements that suit that interest and as has been indicated by Federal Express, they are licensed, hasn\u2019t constituted any undue burden from that standpoint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">So I think for those reasons I don\u2019t quite agree that every one of these things has to be looked at individually if they are in the same industry that there should be a common thread that we can look to to determine licensing, and I think, Madam Chair, you have raised the issue about garbage haulers. If they are engaged in interstate activities, are licensed by the ICC, and I think we all are aware of some of the unsavory people involved in that activity over the years and may still be there. For that reason I would exempt [sic] from licensure anyone of this type. I would certainly want to know what their good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>character, honesty and integrity was and whether it would meet the requirements of our Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The majority of the Commission endorsed Commissioner Waters\u2019 reasoning, and a motion denying the exemption was passed three-to-two. On October 5, 1990, an order denying the exemption and directing UPS to submit a CSI license application before October 26, 1990, was entered. Additionally, UPS also filed a notice of motion for a rehearing on its petition for an exemption from the CSI licensure requirements on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In support of its motion for rehearing, UPS argued that the Commission had improperly denied the exemption because it had mistakenly believed that approving the UPS request would set a precedent for exempting solid waste collectors, who were also regulated by the ICC. UPS also maintained that the policy issues underlying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-92(c) had not been fully addressed, and that the Commission failed to accord due deference to the Division\u2019s recommendation to grant the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">On October 26,1990, the Commission held a hearing on UPS\u2019s motion for reconsideration at which time UPS emphasized that the primary basis for seeking a rehearing was that the Commission had been split on whether each exemption petition should be considered on an individual basis, or whether that approach was not practicable. UPS emphasized that the statute itself required a case-by-case analysis. Commissioner Armstrong volunteered that her comment about garbage haulers was not material to her earlier vote to deny the exemption. She explained that she had referred to the industry only because the argument about UPS\u2019s employees having minimal contact with casino employees did not seem to her to be a basis for granting the exemption and had intended to point out that garbage haulers also had only minimal contact with casino employees, yet no one questioned that garbage haulers had a long-standing \u201cunsavory\u201d reputation and thus needed to comply with CSI licensure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>At the close of argument, Chairman Perskie, appointed during the period between the first and second hearings, expressed his view that he would have voted for the exemption if he had been a member of the Commission at the time of the initial hearing. However, he believed it was inappropriate to re-visit a decision made before his tenure and concluded that the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>should control. He reasoned that the earlier decision was not grounded in any confusion, any consideration of inappropriate circumstances, or any failure to consider facts that should have been considered. The Commission voted unanimously to deny the motion for reconsideration, and on November 2, 1990, the Commission entered an order formalizing that decision which directed UPS to file a CSI application on or before November 30, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">On November 15, 1990, UPS filed a notice of appeal from the Commission\u2019s October 5 and November 2, 1990, decisions and a notice of motion requesting a stay of the Commission\u2019s order pending the resolution of the appeal. On November 26, 1990, the Division indicated that it \u201chad no objection to the grant of a casino service industry license exemption to UPS, [and therefore took] no position on UPS\u2019s petition for a stay.\u201d On November 29, 1990, the Commission denied the stay and directed UPS to file a completed CSI license by the earlier of December 5,1990, or the date on which UPS was able to appear before the Appellate Division for emergent relief. On December 4, 1990, we granted UPS\u2019s emergent application for a stay of the November 2 order pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">UPS contends generally on this appeal that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-92(c) is unreasonable as \u201cthe standard applied by the Commission is neither explicitly expressed nor implied in the language of the statute.\u201d Further, UPS argues that \u201cthe Commission's argument that regulation by a public agency is equivalent to regulation by an agency with a statutory scheme sufficiently similar ... to [the] Division of Gaming Enforcement oversight deprives the second prong of the test [in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-92(c)] of any meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Pursuant to the 1976 amendment to the <em>N.J.

To this end, a non-gaming CSI license will be denied if an applicant has been convicted of any one of several enumerated criminal offenses, or if the applicant has failed to cooperate with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Commission or to disclose material facts. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-86c; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-92d. By regulation, a non-gaming CSF must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence its good character, honesty and integrity. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:43-1.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">As such, of primary concern when applying the \u201cregulated by a public agency\u201d criterion, the Commission consistently inquires into whether an alternative regulatory scheme includes investigations into character and honesty. <em>See, e.g., In the Matter of the Application of AT &amp; T Communications of New Jersey, Inc. and Petition of U.S. Sprint Communications Co., L.P., For Exemption From Casino Service Industry Licensure, </em>(April 12, 1989) [hereinafter <em>AT &amp; T/Sprint </em>]; <em>In the Matter of the Petition of Galaxy Airlines, </em>(May 29, 1985) [hereinafter <em>Galaxy Airlines </em>]; <em>In the Matter of the Petition of Cape Transit Corp. For A Declaratory Ruling That It Is Not A Casino Service Industry Or For An Exemption From Casino Service Industry Licensure, Order No. 87 45-8 </em>[hereinafter <em>Cape Transit]. </em>While the Commission has recognized the heightened level of scrutiny over character and honesty imposed by the Act, it has granted exemptions where other regulations may not meet the heightened standard of the Act, but where the \u201coverall effect\u201d or combination of other relevant factors provide \u201cvirtually equivalent protection for the public\u201d as does the Act. <em>AT &amp; T/Sprint </em>(Commission Armstrong); <em>see also </em>New Jersey Casino Control Commission Staff Memorandum regarding Travel Industry Exemption (July 7, 1978) [hereinafter Travel Industry Exemption Memorandum], Thus, \u201cthe importance of such regulation depends upon the subject matter of the proposed exemption.\u201d Travel Industry Exemption Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In <em>AT &amp; T/Sprint, </em>the Commission granted AT &amp; T and Sprint exemptions because of the absence of direct contact between the companies and their casino customers, coupled with the extensive financial, managerial, and operational regulation of the industries by the Board of Public Utilities (BPU), which obviated the Commission\u2019s need to regulate the compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>nies under the Act in order to prevent unsavory persons from infiltrating and gaining control of the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Similarly, the Commission has denied exemptions for companies which were not subject to regulation equivalent to that under the Act regarding good character and lack of criminal convictions. <em>See Galaxy Airlines; Cape Transit. </em>In <em>Cape Transit, </em>the Commission specifically concluded that ICC regulation was not a sufficient substitute for licensure under the Act as ICC investigates only the ability of a company to provide transportation services, and not its good character, honesty and integrity. As such, during the hearing Vice-Chair Zeitz, in part, commented that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Beyond [interpreting whether \u201cregular and continuing\u201d applies], Cape Transit had asked, if it is found to be a casino service industry required to file for licensure, it be exempted on the basis of its regulation by the I.C.C. and the D.O.T., asserting there are sufficient similarities in that regulation. I would agree with Mr. McDonough there really aren't. The I.C.C. and the D.O.T. regulate transportation, the provision of transportation services. They don\u2019t regulate the fundamental, that fundamental threshold question which is always before the agency which is good character, honesty and integrity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The Commission then unanimously voted to deny the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In <em>Galaxy Airlines, </em>the Commission unanimously voted to deny the application for exemption to an airline despite regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as the Commission found the FAA regulations were not comparable to the Act. During the hearing, Commissioner Zeitz, in part, commented that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">The C.A.B. and P.A.A. on the basis of the papers we\u2019ve seen and the arguments we\u2019ve heard, while they may examine it, as Mr. Stebbins indicated on some limited basis, the background of individuals and of corporations in the air industry, they do not do so apparently for the purpose of making specific findings on licensure as to good character, honesty and integrity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">Therefore I do not think their purpose is the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Finally, in 1978, the Commission granted a blanket exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>for the travel industry based in part on ICC regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> UPS urges that this ruling by the Commission indicates the precedent that regulation by the ICC has \u201cbeen deemed a \u2018sufficient substitute\u2019 for monitoring by the Commission and the Division of Gaming Enforcement.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The exemption the Commission granted to the travel industry is clearly distinguishable from UPS\u2019s application. In July 1978, an internal memorandum<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Commission recommended a limited exemption for the \u201cthousands of travel industry enterprises\u201d which deal with casino hotels. The exemption was granted only with respect to those enterprises which: (1) were regulated by the ICC; (2) provided standardized, routine services regulated by tariff; (3) rarely had representatives at casino hotels; and (4) experienced high levels of competition. Thus, in the memorandum supplied to the Commission, the Senior Assistant Counsel to the Commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">Notwithstanding the fact that an enterprise limits its business to that covered by the standard rates, an enterprise will not be exempted unless it is \u201cregulated by a public agency.\u201d <em>However, the importance of such regulation depends upon the subject matter of the proposed exemption. In this case, the limitation of the exemption to minimal, standardized contacts, the fact that such travel industry enterprises will rarely be physically present at the hotel, the large number of such enterprises and the resulting high level of competition within the industry combine to reduce the importance of independent regulations of these enterprises. Thus, the public agency regulation requirement would be satisfied here by regulation which is considerably less stringent than that which would otherwise be imposed by the Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>For these reasons, it is recommended that travel industry enterprises which are licensed or certificated by the Interstate Commerce Commission (motor bus carriers and motor bus tour brokers) be qualified for the proposed exemption if they otherwise conform to the stated restriction. Under federal law, an I.C.C. license or certificate may only issue to an enterprise which is \u201cfit, willing and able properly to perform\u201d the proposed service. 49 <em>U.S.C. </em>Sections 307 and 811. <em>While the I.C.C. concentrates primarily on the experience and ability of the enterprise and its fitness to provide the public with safe and convenient transportation, this form of regulation is sufficient in this instance to satisfy the public interest and Section 92c of the Act. </em>Similarly, autobus carriers holding certificates of public convenience and necessity from the New Jersey Public Utilities Commission should also be qualified for this limited purpose. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>48:4-3. [ (Emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Furthermore, unlike UPS, the retail travel agents associated with travel agencies were regulated by the International Air Transport Association and the Air Traffic Conference. Both of these entities disqualified agents who have been convicted of a felony, of a misdemeanor related to financial activities, or of a breach of fiduciary obligation, unless it can be shown that the agency can be relied upon to adhere to the obligations and duties of an approved agent. This regulation supplied the background check which the Commission found absent in UPS\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Moreover, UPS\u2019s argument that the Commission acted unreasonably and arbitrarily is without merit. First, the <em>AT &amp; T/Sprint </em>decision, upon which UPS relies in support of ICC regulation as a sufficient substitute, is distinguishable. There, the Commission focused on the extensive financial, management, and customer service regulations of the companies by the BPU, the lack of physical contact between the telephone companies and the casinos, the fact that their charges were established by tariff, and the impossibility of acquiring control of either company without obtaining BPU approval. Although UPS submitted that its charges were regulated by tariff and that any proposed merger or acquisition must be approved by the ICC, the cases are sufficiently different. <em>See </em>49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10701(a); 10741(a); 10762(a)(1); 11343 (Supp.1991). Most importantly, unlike the telephone companies, UPS employees have some contact with casino employees. Furthermore, UPS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>failed to present any evidence that the ICC monitors the financial and management aspects of its organization in the same way that the BPU regulates these matters with respect to public utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Second, the Commission\u2019s decision is wholly supported by the underlying intent and policy of the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12 \u2014 lb; <em>N.J.A. C. </em>19:41-3.2(f). In light of the Act\u2019s primary goal of preventing direct or indirect criminal infiltration of the casino industry, it appears eminently reasonable for the Commission to have interpreted the \u201cregulated by a public agency\u201d requirement in the context of the Act as a whole, and with an eye toward gauging whether that alternative regulatory scheme also screens an entity and its employees for absence of a criminal record and general good character. Therefore, the Commission\u2019s interpretation is a reasonable one and gives full effect to the \u201cregulated by a public agency\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In sum, we are satisfied from our study of the record and the arguments presented that the final administrative action of the Commission was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable; that it was supported by the evidence, and that it did not violate legislative policies expressed or fairly implied in the statutory scheme administered by the Board. <em>See Matter of Warren, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 296-97, 566 A.2d 534; <em>Henry v.
