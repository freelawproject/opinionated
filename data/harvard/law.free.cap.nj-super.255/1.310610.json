We have carefully reviewed this record in light of defendant\u2019s contentions as to equitable estoppel and public policy and have concluded that there is no warrant for our intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Neither J.W.P. nor J.H.P. undertook any action with respect to defendant or Z.P. which would warrant application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel. They did not interfere with his relationship with Z.P. nor did they delay inordinately in bringing this action. Absolutely no detriment to defendant was shown. Moreover, as the trial judge aptly noted, the doctrine of equitable estoppel \u201cwas not intended to compromise the natural parent\u2019s obligation____ Rather, equitable estoppel was used to provide a safety net for the child whose stepfather has affirmatively interfered with his right to be supported by his natural father.\u201d No such interference took place here. All that occurred was laudable behavior by J.H.P. who attempted to create a loving atmosphere for Z.P. Our Supreme Court has already emphatically stated that such conduct is no basis for estoppel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">To hold otherwise would create enormous policy difficulties. A stepparent who tried to create a warm family atmosphere with his or her stepchildren would be penalized by being forced to pay support to them in the event of a divorce. At the same time, a stepparent who refuses to have anything to do with his or her stepchildren beyond supporting them would be rewarded by not having to pay support in the event of a divorce. <em>[Miller v. Miller, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>154, 168, 478 A.2d 351 (1984)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">In addition, we see no public policy which is violated by the order of the trial judge directing that defendant, who is the natural father of Z.P., be required to support his son. The counsel fee award was based upon certifications of record; upon a finding of defendant\u2019s superior financial circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>and a finding that his actions here were a \u201cdisingenuous effort to evade the legal consequences of the paternity decision.\u201d We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by the trial judge, Judge Marianne Espinosa-Murphy, in her opinion of November 6, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
