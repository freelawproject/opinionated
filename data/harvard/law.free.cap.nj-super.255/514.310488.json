Therefore, only defendant proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">We accept and set forth verbatim the counter-statement of facts contained in the State\u2019s brief on appeal:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">On February 3, 1989, at approximately 6:00 p.m., members of the Special Investigations Unit of the Mercer County Prosecutor\u2019s Office executed a search warrant at 82 Norman Avenue, in Trenton. This was the residence of defendant\u2019s mother, Ester Milton. In addition to Mrs. Milton, codefendant (defendant\u2019s brother) and William Milton, Sr. (defendant\u2019s father) were on the premises when the law enforcement agents entered the dwelling. The agents also had a search warrant for defendant, but he was not home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">The officers searched the entire house, including the three bedrooms on the second floor. While searching codefendant\u2019s bedroom, the officers found a shoe box which contained two small ziplock bags with a white substance which the officers suspected was cocaine. Three pieces of identification bearing codefendant\u2019s name were found in the shoe box. Codefendant was arrested at the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">The officers then searched the middle bedroom which was defendant\u2019s bedroom. They retrieved several documents from the top of the dresser, one of which was a New Jersey State Department of Labor unemployment stub. The stub bore defendant\u2019s name (William Milton, Jr.), his social security number (148-52-8614), and his address (82 Norman Avenue). The remaining documents bore the name \"Wiiliam Milton.\u201d The officers discovered a brown paper bag hidden under the mattress of defendant\u2019s bed. The bag contained an off-white, rock-like substance which they suspected was crack cocaine. In the third bedroom, which was Mrs. Milton\u2019s bedroom, the officers discovered several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>documents with both her name and William Milton Sr.\u2019s (defendant's father\u2019s) name. No contraband was found in Mrs. Milton\u2019s bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">Investigator Eossi, who was assigned as the evidence officer, documented all the items seized during [sic ] raid and subsequently forwarded them to the state police laboratory for analyses. Laboratory analyses showed that the substances found in both bedrooms tested positive for cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">Based on the narcotics found in defendant\u2019s bedroom, a warrant was issued for his arrest. On February 23,1989, the police returned to the same residence they had previously raided to execute the warrant. This time defendant was present and was placed under arrest. He was then transported to the police station. As he was being processed, defendant disclosed his social security number. That number matched the social security number on the document that the police had previously discovered in defendant\u2019s bedroom during the search that uncovered cocaine under the mattress of the bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">At trial, Investigator Martin Levandowski, a qualified expert in the field of identification, use, packaging, preparation and distribution of controlled dangerous substance, testified that the 34.30 grams of cocaine found in the brown bag of [sic] middle bedroom was possessed with the intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">At trial, defendant and his brother, Nathan Barber (a/k/a Nathanial Milton and Soyica Gimbu) testified on behalf of the defense. Defendant admitted that he lived at the residence where the raid occurred. He also admitted that he occupied the middle bedroom where the cocaine had been found. Defendant, however, denied that the cocaine was his. Nathan Barber, defendant\u2019s brother who was presently serving a sentence on an armed robbery conviction, testified that the cocaine hidden in defendant\u2019s bedroom belonged to him, and not defendant. Barber claimed that he told defendant that the drugs were his (Barber\u2019s). However, defendant had been incarcerated for more than a month when his brother purportedly confessed to him. [Transcript references omitted; footnote omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Following the denial of defendant\u2019s acquittal motion at the end of the State\u2019s case, the defense presented evidence that the cocaine belonged to defendant\u2019s other brother, Nathanial Milton, and that defendant had no knowledge of the presence of the drug in the middle bedroom which he shared with Nathanial. Prior to testifying on defendant\u2019s behalf, Nathanial was advised by counsel of his right to refuse to testify and of the penal consequences of his testimony. Nathanial testified that the cocaine found in the bedroom was under the mattress of the bottom bunk which he used. He testified that as far as he knew defendant had no knowledge of the cocaine and was not in any way involved in the use or distribution of drugs. Nathanial asserted that he was addicted to crack at the time and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>stolen the drugs from a drug dealer. He maintained that he could himself consume the quantity of the drug found in only a couple of days and that he had no intent of distributing it. Nathanial, at the time of trial, was in custody in connection with unrelated armed robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We are satisfied that the State failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case against defendant. Nevertheless, we choose to address the issue raised in Point I of defendant\u2019s brief wherein he asserts that it was improper for the prosecutor to make reference to the existence of a search warrant for the person of the defendant. The prosecutor referred to a search warrant for the person of the defendant both in his opening statement and by eliciting evidence of its existence through the testimony of the State\u2019s investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Defense counsel objected following the opening statement of the prosecutor because the prosecutor had told the jury that the police \u201chad a search warrant for the residence, and they had a search warrant for William Milton, Jr., the defendant who sits before you.\u201d Defense counsel moved for a mistrial because of the prosecutor\u2019s remark and, throughout the trial preserved his objection to evidence of the personal search warrant and the court\u2019s limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The State\u2019s attempt to justify the prosecutor\u2019s references to the warrant to search the defendant personally is without merit. The defendant was not present at the premises when the State\u2019s investigators broke into the premises utilizing a no-knock search warrant for the residence. The record does not disclose that the search warrant for the person of the defendant was ever executed. After the search of the home, no arrest warrant for the defendant was issued for several days, and the arrest warrant itself was not executed until February 23, 1989, almost three weeks after discovery of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The prosecutor argued at trial \u201cthat the jury should be informed that the officers had proceeded to the house to execute valid search warrants to refute any suggestion that the officers had acted arbitrarily.\u201d This alleged purpose in mentioning the presence of a search warrant could have been fully accomplished by the prosecutor\u2019s reference only to the existence of a search warrant for the premises that were invaded. <em>See State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 268, 307 A.2d 65 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As noted in the State\u2019s brief, \u201c[t]he prosecutor further asserted that the jury could not reasonably infer defendant\u2019s guilt from the mere mention that warrants had been issued.\u201d This is not so. Rather, the defendant was unquestionably prejudiced by the mention of the existence of a warrant to search his person. The natural inference from the mention of the warrant itself, confirmed by the cautionary instruction of the trial judge, was that sufficient independent proof had been presented to a neutral judge to believe that defendant would be found in possession of drugs. The trial judge\u2019s explanation to the jury that the burden of proof for a search warrant was less than that required for conviction at trial served to support this prejudicial inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We are convinced that there was no materiality or relevance between the existence of a warrant to search the person of the defendant and the case which the State was required to present under its indictment. The State\u2019s argument that it was essential for it to prove that the officers were not acting arbitrarily is entitled to no weight since presentation to the jury of the fact that a search warrant for the premises had been issued fully satisfied the State\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The State argues \u201cthat defendant cannot control the State\u2019s presentation of its case to the jury.\u201d While that may be true, the court must control such presentation. Even if the evidence were material and relevant, here, <em>Evid.R. </em>4 required the exclusion of the evidence because of its potential to so severely prejudice the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>by the State\u2019s action denied his right to a fair trial, and, if for no other reason, his conviction would have to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s assertion that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in failing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case.\u201d We are required to sustain the trial judge\u2019s denial of a motion to acquit if, \u201cviewing the State\u2019s evidence in its entirety, be that evidence direct or circumstantial,\u201d and giving the State the benefit of all reasonable inferences, \u201ca reasonable jury could find guilt of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-59, 236 A.2d 385 (1967); <em>R. </em>3:18-1. In addition, we do not in applying the <em>Reyes </em>standard, consider any evidence adduced in defendant\u2019s case. <em>Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 459, 236 A.2d 385; <em>State v. Moffa, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>258, 261, 200 A.2d 108 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">As noted earlier, we accept, with one substantial exception, the State\u2019s recitation of the facts presented by it at the trial. We are satisfied that drawing all of the inferences favorable to the State from the State\u2019s evidence, a reasonable jury could find no more than that defendant occupied the middle unsecured bedroom of a home inhabited by several family members, and that a substantial quantity of cocaine was found hidden under the mattress of one of two bunk beds.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The issue presented is whether the State made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of possession of the contraband found hidden under the mattress of one of two beds in the room, where the most favorable inference that can be drawn from the proofs is that the defendant, not present in the home at the time the drugs were found, may have, at an undisclosed time, occupied the bedroom. Absent proof that defendant had exclusively occupied the bedroom or was present when the drugs were found or within a short time before, a reasonable jury could not, on these facts, find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>actual or constructive possession of the drugs found hidden in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We note, although it is not necessary to our decision, that the State did not present proof that the room was occupied exclusively by the defendant, or that the bed and mattress under which the drugs were hidden was the one occupied by the defendant. There was no testimony in the State's case regarding whether either or both of the bunk beds appeared to be in regular use, or whether only one person\u2019s clothes and belongings were present in the room. Further, no connection was made between the defendant and the plastic bag containing the crack or the paper bag in which the plastic bag was found. No attempt was made to obtain fingerprints or other forensic evidence from the plastic bag although the State\u2019s witness, an experienced narcotics investigator, testified that he personally knew that similar plastic bags had been tested for fingerprints on at least two occasions. No narcotics paraphernalia or other related evidence was found among defendant\u2019s belongings or identification, and there was no proof connecting defendant to anything in the room other than the identification found on top of the dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In <em>State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 594, 404 A.2d 1111 (1979), our Supreme Court held that in cases of this nature \u201ca meticulous and objective analysis of the evidence is imperative.\u201d The Supreme Court noted that defendant was present on the premises at the time when narcotics were found and that \u201c[tjhere were other evidential circumstances lending distinctive color to the character of defendant\u2019s presence at the scene.\u201d The Court distinguished the facts in <em>Brown </em>from the facts in <em>State v. Sapp, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>476, 366 A.2d 334 (1976), <em>rev\u2019g on dissenting opinion below, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455, 366 A.2d 335 (App.Div. 1975), in that the home in <em>Sapp </em>was three stories with several unrelated people, noting that this factor \u201cweaken[ed] the inference of knowledge and control over household contents otherwise drawable from the fact of occupancy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Here, defendant was neither present in the room, nor upon the premises. There was no evidence as to when he last occupied the room. Nor was there evidence that he occupied the room exclusively. In short, there was nothing in the State\u2019s case from which a jury could \u201creadily draw the inference that the occupant of such premises would have knowledge and control of its contents.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 594, 404 A.2d 1111. The <em>Brown </em>Court also noted that \u201c[t]he inference of knowledge and control of the concealed heroin is further strengthened by the presence of other heroin-related materials in the apartment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 404 A.2d 1111. There was no other drug-related material found in the bedroom here, and no showing of a likelihood that defendant would have knowledge of the hidden contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The <em>Brown </em>Court also noted that \u201cthe fact that drugs were found in a bedroom, an area usually only accessible to a resident,\u201d also distinguished its case from <em>Sapp </em>where the drugs were found in a dining room. <em>Id. </em>at 596, 404 A.2d 1111. Here, the presence of more than one bed in the unlocked room precludes an inference that defendant had exclusive control of the room. More importantly, no proof was presented here, nor can it be reasonably inferred from the facts presented, that defendant was ever in the bedroom at the same time that the drugs were present. <em>Cf. State v. Palacio, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>543, 554, 545 A.2d 764 (1988) (inference of constructive possession hinged upon proof of the presence of defendant in the area where the drugs were found).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The proofs offered by the State in this case were insufficient to satisfy the required elements for establishing actual or constructive possession of the drugs. Acquittal was therefore required at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case. <em>See Hudson v. Louisiana, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>40, 43, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>970, 972, 67 L.Ed.2d 30, 33-34 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-12\">We note one material omission from the State\u2019s recitation of the facts. The bed referred to as the defendant\u2019s was actually two bunk beds stacked one upon the other. The State did not prove which bed was defendant\u2019s. The crack-cocaine had been hidden under the mattress of the lower bed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
