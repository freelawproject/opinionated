These lots were acquired subject to certain restrictions, among which was one providing that no building or structure should \u201cat any time be erected or stand within less than four (4) feet of the northerly exterior side line of any lot\u201d. The addition which defendants caused to be erected not' only came within 4 feet of the northerly exterior side line of their lot, but extended over that line between 1 and 1% inches. The eaves of said addition extended over plaintiff\u2019s property between 1 foot <em>3y2 </em>inches and 1 foot <em>\u00e1y2 </em>inches at a distance of approximately 10 feet from the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The complaint was in three counts. The first count alleged a violation of the above-mentioned restriction; the second count alleged the encroachment on plaintiff\u2019s lot; and the third count alleged the maintenance of a nuisance by reason of the overhanging of the eaves. The trial court found that the allegations of the complaint were true and entered judgment as above indicated. Among other things, the court found that the total cost of the removal of said addition would not exceed $125, wrhereas the damage to plaintiff\u2019s property by reason of the maintenance thereof would be the sum of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Appellants first contend that \u201cthe encroachment alleged is within the maxim <em>de minimis\u201d </em>and argue that the trial court should have awarded only nominal damages and should not have ordered the removal. We find no merit in this contention. Appellants assume that the encroachment was one of only a \u201cfew inches or a foot\u201d and that there was \u201cno appreciable injury\u201d. While it is true that the eaves overhung respondent\u2019s property by only a little over 1 foot, appellants ignore their violation of the restriction prohibiting building a structure within 4 feet of the property line. Respondent had a right to insist that appellants\u2019 structure be not built within 4 feet of said line and the invasion of that right amounted to several feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>rather than a few inches. Furthermore, it cannot be said that there was \u201cno appreciable injury\u2019\u2019. The findings show that the .maintenance of said addition in violation of respondent\u2019s rights would result in damage to respondent in the sum of $1,000. Upon the record before us, which consists solely of the judgment-roll, we must presume that the evidence sustained the findings and accept the findings as true <em>(Shields </em>v. <em>Fee Title Co., </em>206 Cal. 789 [276 Pac. 350]), and we must ignore appellants\u2019 bald statement that there was \u201cno appreciable injury\u2019\u2019. We are therefore of the opinion that the maxim referred to by appellants has no application here and that the authorities cited by appellants <em>(Mertens </em>v. <em>Berendsen, </em>213 Cal. 111 [1 Pac. (2d) 440], and <em>McKean </em>v. <em>Alliance Land Co., </em>200 Cal. 396 [153 Pac. 134]) are not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Appellants further contend that the \u201ccomplaint docs not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in respect of any reservation, covenant or condition\u2019\u2019. Under this heading appellants argue that \u201cIn the complaint there is no description or designation of the land which is to be the dominant tenement in respect to the restricted provisions.\u2019\u2019 In our opinion this contention is likewise without merit. The allegations were lengthy and need not be set forth in full. It was alleged in substance that respondent was the owner of lot 8 and that appellants were the owners of lot 7 as designated on the amended map of Ingleside Terraces; that said land was part of the tract known as Ingleside Terraces and was acquired subject to certain reservations, covenants, conditions and easements set forth in an exhibit attached to the complaint. It further appears from the allegations of the complaint, as well as the exhibit attached thereto, that it was provided in said covenants that the same \u201cshall be and do constitute covenants real running with the land and each and every part thereof hereinbefore referred to as \u2018Ingleside Terraces\u2019 also constitute an easement appurtenant to each and every portion of said \u2018Ingleside Terraces\u2019; and that it shall be lawful for any person who is or shall become the owner of any portion of said \u2018Ingleside Terraces\u2019 to maintain a suit or action for a violation of any of the covenants or conditions contained against such person as may be the owner of said \u2018 Ingleside Terraces \u2019, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>or any part thereof, when the violation of such covenant is committed, for such relief in equity as may be proper in the premises\u201d. In other words, it appears from the allegations of the complaint that every part of the tract known as Ingleside Terraces, including plaintiff\u2019s lot which was described in the complaint, was a dominant tenement with respect to the restrictions to which appellants\u2019 land was subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Sturtevant, J., and Nourse, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
