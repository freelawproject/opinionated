The cancellation by the parties of a contract of exchange cancels the broker\u2019s contract for commissions contained therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The contract of exchange was unenforceable, and hence the agreement to pay a commission was without consideration.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">If for no other reasons, neither of the positions assumed by appellant is tenable; because, first, the appeal is presented on the judgment-roll only, and an inspection thereof fails to disclose that the contract for the exchange of the properties in question, upon the sale price of which the commission claimed by plaintiff is based, was ever canceled.  Secondly, by the terms of the exchange agreement (which is the only instrument by which an agreement to pay a commission is evidenced), the defendant not only agreed to pay to plaintiff the commission on the <em>execution </em>of the said exchange agreement, but also agreed that \u201cin the event any error cannot be corrected, this agreement shall be null and void, <em>except as to the payment of commissions, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>unless the title to the property affected is accepted subject thereto\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on April 7, 1933, and an application by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on May 8, 1933.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
