J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ake\">Petitioner seeks annulment of the award of the respondent Commission granting him the ordinary compensation prescribed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act but denying him additional compensation upon his claim of serious and wilful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Petitioner had been employed for many years as a boilermaker by respondent Western Pipe and Steel Company, a corporation. In 1929', the company was engaged in constructing a number of steel tanks for the storage of oil on a lease of the General Petroleum Company near Bakersfield. On December 5,1929, petitioner was injured on that job when a hoisting derrick collapsed while being used to complete the construction of one of said steel tanks. H. B. Ritchie was the \u201cforeman\u201d on said job while one Cordova was the \u201cassistant foreman\u201d directing the work on the particular tank when petitioner was injured. Petitioner was given medical treatment and was paid approximately $4,000 in compensation. A dispute apparently arose over an alleged loss of hearing resulting from the injuries and petitioner filed his application with the respondent Commission on February 1, 1932. No claim of serious and wilful misconduct had been made up to that time and none was made in said application. It was not until after a hearing on said application that petitioner on March 1, 1932, filed his claim with the respondent Commission for additional compensation because of alleged serious and wilful misconduct. On July 28, 1932, the Commission made its findings and award and subsequently amended the same in the order granting a rehearing, which order was made solely for the purpose of making such amendment. The findings and award as amended showed petitioner to be entitled to total compensation in the sum of $6,450, but the respondent Commission found that \u201cthe injury was not caused by serious and wilful misconduct on the part of any executive, managing officer, or general superintendent of the defendant corporation\u201d. It further found and concluded that petitioner\u2019s application for additional compensation on that ground was barred by the limitation found in section 11 (i) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of the act. We need not discuss the effect of said section 11 (i), which was enacted after the date of petitioner\u2019s injury, for we believe that the above-mentioned finding was supported by the evidence and is determinative in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Petitioner\u2019s claim of serious and wilful misconduct related solely to the conduct of the \u201cassistant foreman\u201d, Cordova. Under the terms of section 6 (b) of the act a corporate employer is liable for additional compensation only when there is serious and wilful misconduct \u201con the part of an executive or managing officer or general superintendent thereof\u201d. Petitioner therefore states the question involved as follows: \u201cWas 'assistant foreman\u2019 Cordova the \u2018managing officer \u2019 of respondent employer sufficient to meet the requirements of sec. 6 (b) of the act?\" The respondent Commission contends that Cordova was not \"an executive or managing officer or general superintendent\u201d of the respondent employer and in our opinion this contention must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The references by the parties to the evidence in the record bearing upon the status of Cordova are quite meager. Cordova designated his business as \u201cboiler worker\u201d and he was referred to in some of the testimony as the \u201cassistant foreman\u201d. He was working with and directing two other men, including the petitioner, in erecting and operating the hoisting derrick. It appears that Ritchie, the foreman, was at one of the other tanks on the lease when the accident occurred and was not directly supervising the work of Cordova and the other two men at the time. In refuting a statement of the respondent Commission to the effect that even Ritchie \u201cthe foreman also had a superior officer\u201d, we find several statements in petitioner\u2019s briefs as follows: \u201cH. B. Ritchie was the \u2018foreman\u2019 in charge of the construction of these steel tanks\u201d; \u201cthere was no \u2018general superintendent\u2019 by title, there was no \u2018manager\u2019, there was no other person having any title whatsoever superior to Ritchie in the construction of <em>all </em>of these tanks\u201d; \u201cSo far as the record shows, Ritchie was the supreme authority on that job\u201d; \u201cRitchie was in charge of the job of constructing a number of tanks on an oil lease near Bakersfield\u201d; \u201cIn actual fact, there was no one present who had any authority or control whatsoever except Cordova, the assistant foreman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the next man under Ritchie in charge of that construction job\u201d; Ritchie was the \u2018Foreman\u2019, so far as the record shows that there was nobody superior to him on that oil lease representing the Western Pipe and Steel in the construction of these steel tanks.\u201d With reference to the status of Cordova, the respondent Commission stated, \u201cThe evidence shows that Cordova was supervising the construction of this \u2018A\u2019 frame and had under him for that purpose two men, including the applicant. Cordova was not the foreman on the job, however, neither was he the superintendent nor the general manager. At the place of operation Cordova was only in charge of his small portion of detail and there was <em>in active charge </em>an authority over him, the foreman, H. B. Ritchie.\u201d In further discussing Cordova\u2019s status, the respondent Commission states that Cordova did not have the right \u201cto hire or fire\u201d any employees. Petitioner challenges this statement but only on the ground that the record <em>\u201cdoes not show </em>that Cordova could or could not hire or fire men working Linder him\u201d. Assuming that a showing of the existence of such right would have been helpful to petitioner in establishing the status of Cordova, the burden of proof in making that showing was upon the petitioner, but no such showing was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Petitioner has called our attention to several authorities where awards have been affirmed after the Commission had determined that the persons guilty of the serious and wilful misconduct were persons within the purview of said section 6 (b). <em>(E. Clemens Horst </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>184 Cal. 180 [193 Pac. 105, 16 A. L. R. 611]; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>199 Cal. 420 [249 Pac. 849, 58 A. L. R. 1374]<em>; Blue Diamond Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>188 Cal. 403 [205 Pac. 678]; <em>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>86 Cal. App. 182 [260 Pac. 578]; <em>First Nat. Pictures, Inc., </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>87 Cal. App. 537 [262 Pac. 38].) None of said authorities is directly in point. The history of this legislation is reviewed in <em>E. Clemens Horst </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>and <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Indv,strial Acc. Com., supra, </em>and while the terms of the section have been broadened with each amendment, the legislature has refrained from making the employer liable for the misconduct of every person exercising authority on the employer\u2019s behalf. On the contrary, the class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>persons whose misconduct will result in the imposition of such liability still remains limited. As we view the facts in the present case it would do violence to the terms of the act to hold that Cordova was \u201can executive or managing officer or general superintendent\u201d of the respondent employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We agree with petitioner that mere titles are not altogether conclusive in determining the question but they may be helpful. Prom the record it appears that the highest title given to Cordova by anyone was the title of assistant foreman and we have found no authority where anyone bearing a title below that of \u201cforeman\u201d has been held to fall within the class of persons described in said section. Aside from the title, it does not appear from the fragmentary evidence relating to Cordova\u2019s status, that he had any more authority than the ordinary \u201cstraw-boss\u201d, working under a \u201cforeman\u201d. While under the authorities above cited, Ritchie, the foreman, may have had sufficient power and authority on this particular job to bring him within the class of persons described in said section, we are of the opinion that the respondent Commission correctly concluded that Cordova did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Sturtevant, J., and Goodell, J., <em>pro iem., </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">An application by petitioner to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on May 11, 1933.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
