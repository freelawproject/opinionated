Porter was apparently secretary of the Universal Sales Corporation, which conducted a plumbing business in Los Angeles, and was a depositor in a branch bank in Hollywood conducted by defendant\u2019s assignor, Los Angeles-First National Trust &amp; Savings Bank, hereinafter referred to as \u201cBank\u201d. The manager of said branch bank at the times in question here was one C. L. Lamping. Said Sales Corporation becoming involved, applied to said Lamping for assistance. Plaintiff and his assignor, Dwight Lanning, advanced $1500 each to said Sales Corporation, through said Lamping, and such Sales Corporation gave to each its note payable on demand, for such sums. No interest was specified in the notes, but said Lamping was to be paid the sum of $200 per month, as salary, by said Sales Corporation, which was to be divided between those so advancing money. The first contributors apparently were plaintiff\u2019s assignor, one Van Dam, and said Lamping. The last-named contributed the sum of $1,000. Afterwards plaintiff came into the pool. Said Sales Corporation was to place in the hand of said Lamping as collateral security, to the contributors to said pool, notes and accounts due it. Said bank also advanced the Sales Corpora-. tion approximately $4,000 and was given notes and accounts to secure the same. It was the contention of plaintiff that certain of said securities, belonging to the individual creditors and in an amount in excess of their claims, were collected by the bank and applied on its own indebtedness. Plaintiff brought suit on his own claim and the assigned claim of Lanning, against defendant as successor of said bank, succeeding to its assets and liabilities. From an order granting a nonsuit, made on motion of defendant at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the latter has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">It is apparent from the evidence that a question had arisen between the bank and the individual creditors as to the ownership of certain of the collateral that had been deposited by the Sales Corporation, either with the bank or Lamping, its manager. A meeting was finally arranged at which Mr. Myers, assistant manager of the bank, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>plaintiff, Banning, William Scholfield and Mr. Porter of the Sales Corporation were present. Mr. William Scholfield, a brother of plaintiff, testified that he had a conversation with Mr. Myers and that he was \u201ctold to come to the bank and be in a meeting with Mr. Porter with regard to his account and collaterals that were to secure notes held by Mr. Scholfield, Mr. Banning and Mr. Bamping, as I understood, and Mr. Van Dam\u201d. The plaintiff himself was asked on cross-examination if such meeting \u201cwasn\u2019t an accommodation meeting whereby Mr. Porter was to be present and explain the amounts and balances due\u201d, to which the witness replied: \u201cNo, it came about through my going to see Mr. Hartcort of the bank, and Mr. Hartcort didn\u2019t want to listen to us at first; we made an appointment with him and he said he was very busy, and we took the matter up with Mr. Hartcort and Mr. Hartcort said he would have this matter straightened up, and that is how this thing happened.\u201d William Scholfield testified that at the meeting \u201cMr. Myers sat at the head of the table and said, \u2018 Excuse me, \u25a0 boys, I will get the papers, \u2019 and he went down and got the papers out of a little file in the front part of the bank, brought them back, and he said, \u2018we will list them\u2019; . . . and he had the stack before him . . . and asked me to look at my list and see if they agreed. He said, \u2018Now we will number them, and you put these numbers on your papers and we will see if they agree. \u2019 And he went to No. 1, and the amount of that was . . . $937.50, with a balance of $418.75, . . . and Mr. Porter gave us who those collaterals belonged to. Mr. Myers asked the question and Mr. Porter immediately said, \u2018That goes to secure Mr. Scholfield and Mr. Bamping and Mr. Van Dam.\u2019 . . . Mr. Myers finished that item and put it on a pile to one side.\u201d From the testimony it appears that two piles were made, one composed of the collaterals that were designated by Porter as belonging to \u201cthe men\u201d, and the other as belonging to the bank, which latter were designated \u201cIB\u201d, etc., and were so checked by William Scholfield on his list, which, as testified, was made by Porter. Among those put on the pile designated as belonging to plaintiff and his associates was an order by the \u201cEnglish Plumbing Co., endorsed by Paul Shapiro,\u201d which was No. 5, with a balance of apparently $1750 due, and another, numbered 6, \u201con F. E. Miner\u201d for $1960 due. Plaintiff testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>fied that Mr. Myers told him Shapiro had paid $1,025 to the hank. With regard to No. 6, which involved property on Stanley Avenue in Los Angeles, it was testified that this was paid by a check to the bank for $1838.38. There was no collateral of Shapiro or Miner designated \u201c IB \u201d, etc., on the list. The list so made and checked was not put in evidence, but was testified to by the two Seholfields and Dwight Banning. William Scholfield testified that after the making of the list he checked it with the one Mr. Myers made, at the latter\u2019s request, and that they corresponded, and that thereafter, at the instruction of Lamping, he investigated the properties covered by the collaterals, and frequently saw the collaterals. He said that Lamping had \u201cone list of securities of the bank\u2019s and one that belonged to these men. . . . He kept them in a metal file back of one of the teller\u2019s counters, and he had a rubber hand around each of them, separately.\u201d On cross-examination Myers testified that he was assistant branch manager and had charge of the notes due the bank, and that there were securities pledged with those notes. There is testimony from which one could conclude that the securities after being separated were kept in two places, the ones the bank claimed being attached to and kept with the notes of the bank, and those belonging to the individuals being kept in Mr. Lam-ping\u2019s desk. There is a conflict in the evidence as to whether the one described by the witnesses as No. 6, relating to the Stanley Avenue property, and which was for the sum of $1960, was in the list attached to the notes of the bank, or in the list on Lamping\u2019s desk. Plaintiff testified, however, that he saw the list in Lamping\u2019s desk several times, and that on one occasion Lamping told him to take them and collect them. However, he told Lamping that was his, Lamping's, job. Among the securities he was shown, according to the witness\u2019 testimony, he saw No. 6, but could not state definitely about the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\">There is evidence that some of the securities in the possession of Myers at the time of the meeting had been deposited with Lamping to secure the loans made by plaintiff and his assignor, and there seems to be no question about that fact. The receipts given them by Lamping show that the latter was to hold all securities deposited with him for plaintiff, Banning and Van Dam \u201cas their interests may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>appear\u201d. This transaction was clearly outside of Lamping\u2019s employment; but regardless of that, any securities so held by him, which came into the possession of the bank and of which the bank had knowledge, could not be retained by it. Respondent urges that Porter\u2019s statements as to whom the collateral belonged are mere conclusions, and that Myers said nothing to bind the bank as to the division made. Any knowledge Lamping may have had could not be charged to the bank, as the transaction was outside of the course of his employment and one in which the bank had no interest. <em>(Lothian </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>55 Cal. 159, 162; Casco <em>Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>139 N. Y. 307 [34 N. E. 908, 36 Am. St. Rep. 705].) But Lamping did not testify and we do not know what his knowledge was. Mr. Myers, however, was the officer of the bank having custody of its notes and their collateral, and he certainly knew what securities, if any, the bank claimed as collateral to its notes. He was present at the meeting called by someone in the bank. Mr. Porter, who seemed to be the only one appearing in the transactions of the Universal Sales Corporation with any of the parties involved here, designated each security named by Myers as belonging to either the bank or plaintiff and his associates, and Mr. Myers made two piles, one designated as the bank\u2019s and the other as plaintiff\u2019s and his associates\u2019. Those designated as belonging to the bank were later attached to the notes of the bank and the others were kept in Lamping\u2019s desk. It is true that Myers said nothing. But knowing, as he must have, whether any of them were attached to the notes of the bank, it is inconceivable that he would have sat silent if Mr. Porter had said any of such belonged to plaintiff. While ordinarily a statement that a certain security \u201cbelonged to \u2019 \u2019 the bank, or to plaintiff and his associates, would be a conclusion, we are of the opinion that in the connection and under the circumstances under which they were made here they were in effect the same as though Porter had given in detail the conversations had when he deposited the various items as security. It was his conclusion, having particular knowledge, that all present wanted, and we think the court might well draw the conclusion that the actions of Mr. Myers, both at the meeting and afterwards, as shown by the testimony favorable to plaintiff, amounted to a segregation of the securities by the bank, and that the evidence produced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>by plaintiff, with the aid of all legitimate inferences favorable to him and ignoring conflicts and inconsistencies, would support a judgment for him for the two-thirds of the two payments which such evidence shows were made to the bank. We anticipate defendant\u2019s evidence will give rise to other and possibly more serious conflicts, but such should be settled by a decision on the merits, which, in our opinion, should have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Order granting motion for nonsuit reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Craig, Acting P.
