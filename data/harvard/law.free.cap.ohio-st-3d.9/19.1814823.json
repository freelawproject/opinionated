R.C. 2101.24 states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u201cThe probate court shall have plenary power at law and in equity fully to dispose of any matter properly before the court, unless the power is expressly otherwise limited or denied by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Appellant argues that R.C. 2101.24 is a broad grant, and consistent therewith the probate court could exercise its discretion and impress a constructive trust for his benefit. This argument assumes that appellant\u2019s claim to the bonds was a \u201cmatter properly before the court.\u201d This assumption is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">As appellees note, \u201c[t]he sole matter before the trial court at the hearing on the exceptions was whether the bonds belonged in the estate. * * * The issue of the fraudulent appropriation of the purchase money for the bonds * * * was an improper presentment of a claim against the estate * * *.\u201d The basis for appellant\u2019s assertion of an equitable interest in the bonds was his late wife\u2019s allegedly fraudulent use of his funds to purchase the bonds. Appellant\u2019s claim is not directed at the bonds themselves, but is focused on one half of the funds and the increment thereon, of which he was allegedly defrauded. For this reason appellees\u2019 characterization of appellant\u2019s interest as an \u201cunliquidated tort claim\u201d is correct, as is their contention that an unliquidated tort claim against the estate by an executor or administrator should be presented pursuant to R.C. 2117.02.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Presentation of a claim in a hearing on exceptions under R.C. 2115.16 may not be substituted for the timely presentation of a claim against the estate consistent with the procedures set forth in R.C. Chapter 2117. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fraud claim was not properly before the court for purposes of R.C. 2101.24 in the hearing on exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Appellant would also rely on paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>Gottwald, supra, </em>which states that, \u201c[incidental to such hearing, the Probate Court can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>determine title to personal property included in such inventory, but it is a matter of discretion whether such summary proceeding shall be employed or the exceptor ordered to pursue other remedies.\u201d It is appellant\u2019s position that the court of appeals\u2019 ruling narrows <em>Gottwald </em>to the extent that it divests the probate court of the discretion afforded by paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>Gottwald. </em>This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">In the instant case, the probate court made two implicit preliminary findings before ordering the impressment of the constructive trust. The court necessarily determined (1) that the bonds were not estate assets, and (2) that the exceptors had title to the bonds prior to its consideration of appellant\u2019s asserted equitable interest. The first two steps of the probate court\u2019s analysis correspond to the first two paragraphs of the syllabus in <em>Gottwald. </em>The final step taken by the probate court, impressment of constructive trust on the bonds, transcends <em>Gottwald. </em>This court stated in <em>Gottwald, </em>at page 411, that R.C. 2115.16 \u201cdoes not expressly provide for the impressing of a resulting or implied trust * * * [and] [s]uch jurisdiction ought not to be implied * * *.\u201d Thus, the probate court was without authority under R.C. 2115.16 to impress a constructive trust on the bonds and, as we previously noted, the matter was not properly before the court under R.C. 2101.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
