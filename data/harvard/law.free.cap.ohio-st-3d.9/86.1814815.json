We cannot accept respondent\u2019s argument. As it is stated in EC 7-36 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">\u201cJudicial hearings ought to be conducted through dignified and orderly procedures designed to protect the rights of all parties. Although a lawyer has the duty to represent his client zealously, he should not engage in any conduct that offends the dignity and decorum of proceedings. While maintaining his independence, a lawyer should be respectful, courteous, and aboveboard in his relationship with a judge or hearing officer before whom he appears. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">In contrast to the above standard, the statement which respondent placed on the record in the <em>Morales </em>case was disrespectful, discourteous, and a serious breach of courtroom decorum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We concur with the board that respondent did violate DR 7-106(C). There is no doubt that the zealous representation of a client is possible while maintaining and preserving the dignity of the courtroom and remaining courteous to the tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">In <em>Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Carlin </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 311 [21 O.O.3d 195], this court imposed a one-year suspension for violation of DR 7-106(C)(6) after the board had recommended a public reprimand. In <em>Carlin, supra, </em>we quoted the following passage from <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 312, 314-315 [59 O.O. 2d 379]:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">\u201c '* * * No amount of provocation on the part of the judge can be permitted to excuse counsel from the obligation of his oath of office (\u201cI will maintain the respect due to courts of justice and judicial officers\u201d); to excuse him from his duties imposed by the Code of Professional Responsibility; or to condone the acts of counsel if in fact they are themselves contemptuous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">Thus, the focus of this inquiry is whether <em>respondent\u2019s </em>actions, standing alone, warrant disciplinary action. It is of no consequence that the trial court may have committed legal errors which, in respondent\u2019s view, caused his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>client to be found guilty. Respondent has practiced law for over a quarter of a century and should be well aware of the avenues available to review the conduct of the trial judge. The actions of respondent are inexcusable and will not be tolerated by this court. Notwithstanding the board\u2019s recommendation, it is our judgment that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year pursuant to Gov. Bar R. V(6)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-14\"> Respondent testified before the panel that:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">\u201cThere is no place in any justice system for a lawyer to say in a courtroom \u2018Fuck the system.\u2019 There is no place for it. I never had occasion to do it. I can\u2019t excuse it. I can only try to explain what happened, why it happened.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
