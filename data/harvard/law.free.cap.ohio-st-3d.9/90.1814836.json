Under the statute, not more than ninety-five percent of the expenses required to care for the residents may be borne by such residents or paid on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In claiming that it satisfied this requirement, appellant considered as revenue only that income received from those individuals admitted pursuant to a residency agreement, and excluded all income generated from those individuals admitted to the health care center pursuant to a patient\u2019s agreement. Appellant makes a distinction between income received from a resident and that received from a patient. It is with this distinction that the board disagreed and we concur in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The purpose of R.C. 5701.13(B) is to ensure that a home for the aged is to some extent operated in a charitable manner. The statute contemplates that at least five percent of the operating costs come from outside sources. If we were to uphold appellant\u2019s distinction, it would be receiving the required five percent from paying customers admitted to its health care facility. This is certainly not charitable in nature as envisioned by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">In addition, appellant operates an integrated complex with various facilities to meet the needs of the elderly. Appellant cannot be permitted to satisfy the requirements of R.C. 5701.13(B) by artificially creating a distinction in the services received. We, therefore, hold as a matter of law that a taxpayer must satisfy R.C. 5701.13(B) by including all income received from the aged who were provided any type of care or service from the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">After a review of the record, we agree with the finding made by the board for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1981. Appellant\u2019s income from residents and patients was $3,711,438, and the expenses incurred in caring for those individuals totaled $3,667,323. The income over expense ratio of 1.012 clearly demonstrates that the aged paid at least one hundred percent of the total cost of their care.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Finally, in case No. 83-841, we must determine whether appellant satisfies the requirements of R.C. 5701.13(D). This section expresses the legislative intent that a home for the aged shall provide certain basic services for the life of its residents without regard to their ability to pay for the full costs thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">Pursuant to the terms of the residency agreement, appellant possesses the right to terminate the occupancy of a resident for the failure to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>balance of the entrance endowment or monthly service fees. Appellant has the same right to termination with respect to a health care patient for nonpayment of any charges due the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We recently were faced with a similar situation in the case of <em>S.E.M. Villa II </em>v. <em>Kinney </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 67 [20 O.O.3d 60], In <em>S.E.M., </em>a nonprofit corporation operating a congregate living facility that could require residents to vacate the facility if they were not able to mentally or physically care for themselves. We found that the facility was not entitled for a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.12 as it did not satisfy the requirements of R.C. 5701.13(D), in that it was not obligated to provide the services for the life of each resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Based on our holding in <em>S.E.M., </em>we find that appellant\u2019s possession of the right to terminate the residency of an individual does not comply with R.C. 5701.13(D). Although there was testimony of appellant\u2019s policy to provide hardship discounts to residents, the mere possession of the right to terminate an occupancy violates the statute whether it is exercised or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Therefore, it appears from the record before us that the board was correct in its determination that appellant, Friendship Village, did not comply with the strict requirements of R.C. 5701.13(B) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In case No. 83-377, the board examined numerous financial statements belonging to appellant, Ohio Presbyterian Homes, and concluded that the statements were not entirely self-explanatory regarding compliance with R.C. 5701.13(B). In the absence of testimony explaining the statements, the board denied appellant\u2019s application for exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">This court has consistently held that \u201cin order for a taxpayer to derive the benefit of a statutory exemption from taxation, it must be proven that the property in question satisfies each and every requirement of the exemption statute.\u201d <em>Sun Oil Company </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 313, 317 [10 O.O.3d 439], citing <em>Dayton Sash &amp; Door Co. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 120 [65 O.O.2d 306], and <em>Ohio Children\u2019s Society </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St. 2d 30 [55 O.O.2d 17]. After an extensive review of the record, we are not convinced that appellant conclusively established that it complied with R.C. 5701.13(B). Therefore, we find the decision of the board to be neither unreasonable nor unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">As an alternative basis for denying appellant\u2019s application, the board concluded that appellant\u2019s facility could not be classified as a \u201chome for the aged\u201d because it does not provide several of the services mandated in R.C. 5701.13(D)(1) through (5). Specifically, the board found that appellant did not provide the food preparations, custodial care, and medical and nursing care required under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">R.C. 5701.13(D)(2) requires a \u201chome for the aged\u201d to make prepared food available to its residents. Appellant only offers an evening meal. Absent the availability of morning and noon meals, the board found that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>does not satisfy the statutory requirements. We find this conclusion to be within the spirit of R.C. 5701.13(D) and neither unreasonable nor unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The custodial care provided by appellant consists of general housekeeping services, floor communications and a nurse call system. The board reasoned that although these services are commendable, appellant does not provide personal services such as aiding its residents in dressing, eating, or bathing. Clearly, this conclusion is neither unreasonable nor unlawful in view of our affirmance of a similar conclusion by the board in <em>S.E.M., supra, </em>wherein the applicant did not provide these personal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Furthermore, in <em>S.E.M., </em>the taxpayer employed a nurse who worked forty hours a week and did not dispense medication. This court agreed with the board\u2019s conclusion that such services were insufficient to qualify as medical and nursing care pursuant to R.C. 5701.13(D)(4). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the record conclusively establishes that appellant employs one staff nurse who works between two and ten hours a week, and one physician who visits the facility one hour a week to provide health care instructions. The nurse and physician do not engage in medical treatment on the premises. In light of our holding in <em>S.E.M., </em>the board\u2019s conclusion that appellant provides little or no medical and nursing care was certainly justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Finally, appellant contends that the services contained in R.C. 5701.13(D) must only be made available as needed by residents. Appellant argues that the board erred by requiring that all residents receive the services enumerated within the aforementioned provision. Appellant\u2019s argument miscontrues the board\u2019s decision as the record is void of any determination by the board that all residents must receive the services set forth in subsection (D) of R.C. 5701.13. Instead, the board correctly concluded in accord with our decisions in <em>Toledo Retirement Living </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Appeals </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 255 [56 O.O.2d 153], and <em>S.E.M., supra, </em>that appellant does not make available to its residents several of the services required to be offered by a \u201chome for the aged\u201d seeking an exemption from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">We conclude, therefore, that the board was correct in its determination that appellant, Ohio Presbyterian Homes, did not comply with the mandates of R.C. 5701.13(B) and (D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the respective decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\n<em>Decisions affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-5\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

However, in view of our decision, it is not dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The board found, in part, that appellant\u2019s fifty-five year age requirement for occupancy of the ranch style apartments was too young to be considered \u201caged\u201d and, as such, appellant was not operating a \u201chome for the aged\u201d pursuant to R.C. 5701.13. The General Assembly chose not to define the term \u201caged\u201d in the aforementioned statute. This omission reflects the legislative intent to incorporate a certain degree of flexibility into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">In addition, the enactment does not require all persons residing in a facility to be aged. Instead, the statute requires certain mandatory services be made available in order to qualify for the exemption. These services directly relate to the care of elderly people. Therefore, analysis must focus on the satisfaction of these statutory requirements as opposed to an arbitrary definition of the term \u201caged.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b142-8\">Locher, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"At\">concurs in part and dissents in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Since I believe the majority misconstrues the purpose of the tax exemption as defined in R.C. 5701.13, I concur in the judgment only. I agree that neither home has established its compliance with 5701.13(B). I further agree that appellant Friendship Village has not complied with R.C. 5701.13(D). With regard to 5701.13(D) and appellant Ohio Presbyterian Homes, however, the majority and I part company.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">R.C. 5701.13(D) requires, <em>inter alia, </em>various listed services to be made available to residents as <em>needed. </em>This should not be interpreted as a requirement that the services be made available around-the-clock, regardless of need, as the majority\u2019s decision implies. To require constant medical and nursing care availability on the premises, for example, would be extremely cost-ineffective. Since the increasing costs of building and maintaining these homes are passed directly to the residents, such an unnecessary expense becomes an even greater burden to them. Many of these residents are on a fixed income as well. In the same vein, \u201c[c]ustodial care\u201d could not have meant constant aid in dressing, eating, and bathing, since the exemption is expressly made available to homes for <em>all </em>aged people, not just those in constant need of such personal assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">R.C. 5701.13 defines, <em>inter alia, </em>when a service is provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">\u201cA service is provided, within the meaning of this division, * * * [if] it can be secured without unreasonable inconvenience to the residents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">I believe that Ohio Presbyterian Homes (appellant) has met this standard. The majority determined that three of the five services listed in 5701.13(D) were not sufficiently provided by appellant, which I assert is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">R.C. 5701.13(D)(2) requires the availability of \u201c[prepared food.\u201d Appellant provides one meal a day for its residents, which is quite sufficient to satisfy the declining appetite of an elderly person. Again, I stress that the purpose of the exemption is to benefit <em>all </em>elderly, not to make a distinction between homes that serve three hot meals as opposed to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">For similar reasons I believe that appellant has met the subdivision (D)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>requirement of custodial care. Although, in <em>S.E.M. Villa II </em>v. <em>Kinney </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 67 [20 O.O.3d 60], this court implied that custodial care meant \u201cassisting a resident in dressing, eating, bathing or cleaning\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 69), upon reconsideration this court should not hold to such a strict standard. Nowhere did the legislature equate \u201caged\u201d with \u201cinfirm.\u201d The exemption is not limited solely to homes with infirm residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Finally, the subdivision (D)(4) \u201c[m]edical and nursing care\u201d requirement is satisfied here as well. The employment of a full-time medical staff would increase costs outlandishly without concomitant benefit. The availability of nearby health care without undue inconvenience to the residents is all that is required under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The regrettable underlying result of the majority\u2019s interpretation of this exemption is another example of our tendency to turn our backs on those people who have worked hard in paving the way for their successors. It is quite easy to look at our older folks in terms of the present and forget what has been accomplished in the past. It is hoped that the majority\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 5701.13(D) will not be the sole reason for denying future exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The statutory object in granting tax exemptions for facilities that provide care for our senior citizens is not achieved through the hypertechnical analysis promulgated by the majority. The care of our elder citizens is a matter of great public concern and should be reflected in public policy. The statute being interpreted herein represents legislation designed to exempt housing facilities for this state\u2019s older citizens. This type of housing is particularly important as a bridge for the older citizens, who must in many cases leave their abode and take intermediate residence until they are sufficiently infirm to require a nursing home. This is why reference has been made to the mistaken dichotomy between those citizens who are \u201caged\u201d and those who are \u201cinfirm.\u201d The majority herein, and the Board of Tax Appeals, apparently does not appreciate this important distinction, in their denial of benefits to the \u201caged\u201d in their twilight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">I honestly believe the great majority of our senior citizens would prefer the temperate climate of the water belt, with changing seasons, to the perpetual heat of the southern \u201cswelter\u201d belt. The court\u2019s actions today effectively consign our elder citizens to the swelter belt by removing any financial incentive to remain in our state. I do not, and cannot, believe the legislature meant to consign those citizens who have made the greatest contributions to our state to the harsh environment of the swelter-belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">The citizens whom I write of today have contributed and continue to contribute to the well-being of the state of Ohio. Those citizens who have gone through the crucible of living, the senior citizens, whose wealth lies foremost in their experience and whose character has developed through living in Ohio, deserve much better than what this court chooses to do today.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">The distinguished Judge Schneider in <em>Philada Home Fund </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Appeals </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 135, 140 [34 O.O.2d 262] (dissenting opinion), stated the crux of my dissent today:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u201cThere are many attitudes as to the office of a dissenting opinion. I employ it in this case not so much to fault the majority as to spread upon the record that the instant case * * * becloudfs] the tax exempt status, if they do not remove it completely, of every home for the aged * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">I urge the legislature to weigh the results of this decision against the contribution of this state\u2019s older citizens. I hope the result of this dissent will be to spur the legislature into remedying the technicalities that would negate the debt we owe our senior citizens. Therefore I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
