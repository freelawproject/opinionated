Warden, </em>211 Md. 647. Since he pleaded guilty, contentions based on the alleged lack of evidence are without merit. He now complains that he was precluded from taking an appeal because of his indigency. He was represented by counsel, and he does not allege that the State or any public official prevented him from taking an appeal. It is not shown that he attempted to take an appeal or made any application based on his alleged indigency. Cf. <em>Cooper v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 629; <em>Smith v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 666; and <em>Strosnider v. Warden, </em>216 Md. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
