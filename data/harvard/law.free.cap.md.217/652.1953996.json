Warden, </em>209 Md. 631. He was transferred to Spring Grove State-Hospital and his sentence expired on October 29, 1957. However, prior to that date, on October 25, 1956, he was committed on certificate of two doctors, and is now being detained under Code (1957), Art. 59, sec. 31. As we have repeatedly held, there is no right of appeal in a <em>habeas corpus\u25a0 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>case unless the confinement is a result of prosecution for a criminal offense. Code (1957), Art. 42, sec. 7; <em>Miller v. Superintendent, </em>198 Md. 659, and cases cited. His present detention is not of that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
