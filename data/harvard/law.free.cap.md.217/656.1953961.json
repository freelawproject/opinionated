Of the twelve mentioned, three were made for the first time on this application. He attacked the jurisdiction of the trial magistrate twice, and contended three times that the sentences were excessive and illegal. Tie asserted twice his lack of counsel to advise him and inform him of his rights. And he claims that his convictions were had without due process of law because he was not indicted and afforded a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Judge Raine properly ruled that the magistrate had jurisdiction. Code (1951), Art. 52, \u00a7 13 (a), specifically provides that the several trial magistrates of this State (excluding those in Baltimore City) are vested with and shall have \u201cjurisdiction to hear, try and determine all cases involving the charge of any offense, crime or misdemeanor, not punishable by confinement in the Penitentiary or involving a felonious intent, * * See also Code (1951), Art. <em>66J/2, </em>Sec. 287. Moreover, \u00a7 13 (b) of Article 52 provides that, in the trial of all charges of any offense, crime, or misdemeanor, the person charged shall have the right to demand a jury trial, except in <em>motor vehicle cases. </em>The misdemeanor of \u201ccausing the death of another as the result of the * * * operation * * * of an automobile * * * in a grossly negligent manner\u201d is not a \u201cmotor vehicle case,\u201d but a trial magistrate has jurisdiction to try \u201cmanslaughter by automobile\u201d cases under \u00a7 13 of Article 52, <em>supra. State ex rel. Byrd v. Warden, </em>191 Md. 670, 62 A. 2d 628 (1948). The trial magistrate\u2019s docket entries show that the petitioner was informed of his right to a jury trial on the manslaughter charges and that he \u201cfreely\u201d elected to be tried by the trial magistrate. Since the petitioner in all of the manslaughter cases was charged with manslaughter by automobile by a state warrant and elected to be tried by the trial magistrate, from whom he took no appeal to the circuit court upon his conviction of the charge, it was not necessary for him to be indicted by a grand jury. Moreover, his waiver of a jury trial and his failure to take an appeal from his conviction by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>trial magistrate of the manslaughter charges did not constitute denial of trial by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Judge Raine , also properly ruled that the prison sentences, aggregating fourteen years, were not excessive since they were within the maximum statutory limits. <em>Jones v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 656, 136 A. 2d 377 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The petitioner\u2019s contention that his lack of counsel at his trial before the trial magistrate was a violation of his constitutional rights is without merit. There is no requirement that a defendant must be provided with counsel in a magistrate\u2019s court. If the petitioner had wanted counsel, he could have elected a jury trial on the manslaughter charges, or appealed his conviction of all the charges to the circuit court. In either event, if requested, he could then have had counsel appointed for him, if it appeared to be necessary. <em>Smith v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 672, 119 A. 2d 364 (1956). He did neither, as the docket entries clearly show.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
