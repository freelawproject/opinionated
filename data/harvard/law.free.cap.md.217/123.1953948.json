The Swaleses were summoned within a month of the judgment but took no action until a fi fa was issued some ten months later. Then they paid into court all sums claimed and moved for satisfaction of the judgment, reciting that they had tendered the principal sum with interest and costs, except the 15% attorney\u2019s commissions; that the tender had been refused; and that since Weiner had not em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ployed an attorney to fde suit or to collect the judgment, he was not legally entitled to collect an attorney\u2019s fee. They requested the suspension of the sale of their property and distribution of the sum paid into court as the circumstances properly required. The court suspended the sale and Weiner answered the Swaleses\u2019 motion by saying \u201cthat he could engage any attorney and that he could legally engage himself and that the Attorney\u2019s Commission is due and owing and that the Defendants made no protest to the Attorney\u2019s Commission when they were summoned * * * and the said judgment, including the Attorney\u2019s Commission is valid and binding.\u201d After hearing, the court ordered that Weiner\u2019s claim for $473.55 attorney\u2019s commission be disallowed and that said sum be paid to the Swaleses, Weiner receiving the principal sum and interest and such costs as he had paid. Weiner appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Essentially the basis of the lower court\u2019s decision was that \u201cIt seems implicit in the provisions of the note that the 15% commission shall be payable only to an attorney employed in the case or to the plaintiff in reimbursement for his expenses in employing such an attorney, and that plaintiff is not entitled to collect such additional compensation when he acts in proper person.\u201d We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">All of the words used in relation to that which the borrowers were to pay, in addition to principal and interest, have generally been held to mean a right to reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses allowed by the law. Costs are \u201ca pecuniary allowance, made to the successful party (and recoverable from the losing party) for his expenses in prosecuting or defending a suit * * <em>Black, Law Dictionary </em>(4th ed.), 415. In <em>Hayman v. Morris, </em>37 N. Y. S. 2d 884, 891, the Court said that costs (which generally do not include attorney\u2019s fees) are given by law as an indemnity and are not imposed as a punishment upon one who pays them or as a bonus to the one who receives them, as well as that costs \u201care not awarded as a gratuity or emolument for inconvenience sustained, but constitute compensation for expense * * \u201cCharges\u201d are defined in <em>Black, op. cit., </em>295, as the \u201cexpenses which have been incurred, or disbursements made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>in connection with a contract, suit, or business transaction. Spoken of an action, it is said that the term includes more than that which falls within the technical description of \u2018costs\u2019.\u201d \u201cCommission\u201d is defined by <em>Black </em>as \u201cThe recompense, or reward of an agent, factor, broker, or bailee * * This Court said in <em>Webster v. People\u2019s Loan, Savings &amp; Deposit Bank, </em>160 Md. 57, 62-63, that attorney\u2019s commissions in a confessed judgment note are payable \u201cby way of indemnity, to the extent stipulated, for the expense of employing an attorney to collect by suit at law the principal debt. * * *\u201d and added that \u201cIf the plaintiff pays less for the services of his attorney than the amount stipulated, or allowed by the court * * *, then it is his duty to remit or credit the difference * * * \u201d In <em>Bowie v. Hall, 69 </em>Md. 433, 435-436, it was held that the effect of the provision for attorney\u2019s commission \u201cis clearly not to put any money above the legal rate of interest, into the pocket of the lender, but merely to enable him to get back his money with legal interest and nothing more.\u201d The Court, in <em>Gaither v. Tolson, </em>84 Md. 637, 642, in dealing with the covenant in a mortgage to pay attorney\u2019s commissions incurred in its collection, said: \u201cWe would not decide that the holder of a mortgage could employ himself as attorney, or could employ a firm of which he was a member as his attorneys, and charge the expense of such employment on the proceeds of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We think it clear that the note used the terms it did in their usual meaning and must be deemed to have intended the result that this Court had indicated would follow their use. So read, the agreement of the borrowers was only to reimburse Weiner for his actual monetary expenses or disbursements incurred in the collection of the note and no authority was given him to collect and retain as his own the attorney\u2019s commissions that would have been payable if he had employed and paid counsel. To construe the note otherwise would cause usury to rear its ugly head before us, and the indications in the cases are, although we need not decide the question, that the provision would be unenforceable if it meant that a lender, who is an attorney, is to receive attorney\u2019s fees for collecting the money he lent. <em>Bowie v. Hall; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>Webster v. People\u2019s Loan, Savings &amp; Deposit Bank, </em>both <em>supra; Sanders v. Nicolson </em>(Ga.), 28 S. E. 976; <em>Johnson v. Carter </em>(Miss.), 33 So. 2d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The borrowers did not challenge the propriety of the attorney\u2019s commissions until well alter the judgment had become enrolled. It is not clear whether Weiner\u2019s answer meant to challenge the right to do so for this reason, but, in any event, it is entirely clear that the contention was not made below nor did the trial court pass on it. We think that the borrowers had the right to ask the court in which the judgment was rendered to determine whether or not payment of the principal, interest, and costs other than the attorney\u2019s commissions constituted a satisfaction of the judgment. The authority to enter judgment is not by consent of the parties but by virtue of Maryland Rule 645 (the predecessor of which was Art. 26, Sec. 6, of the Codes, 1951, 1939 and 1924), and the entry must be strictly \u201cin accordance with the terms of the consent.\u201d <em>Webster v. People\u2019s Loan, Savings &amp; Deposit Bank, supra, </em>at page 60 of 160 Md. In <em>Forwood v. Magness, </em>143 Md. 1, 7-8, the Court adopted as the law the rule that \u201c* * * the only basis for the acts of the attorney entering an appearance and confessing a judgment against the party who signed the warrant is found in the warrant itself, * * *. * * * an attorney acting under a warrant cannot change its terms or enlarge its scope.\u201d In <em>Johnson v. Phillips, </em>143 Md. 16, the Court, in discussing an attack on a confessed judgment made after the term in which it was entered, noted that the same rule as to the term applied in a confessed judgment as in a judgment after trial, but held subject to attack, as void, that part of the judgment allowing an attorney\u2019s fee because the note authorized a reasonable fee (which the court would have to fix) and not a specified sum which the attorney had confessed. The Court adopted the language of 1 <em>Black, Judgments, </em>Sec. 75, and said that the attorney had acted \u201cin excess of his authority, and the judgment so entered, without the intervention of the court, is void\u201d (as to the attorney\u2019s fees). The Court, in <em>Webster v. People\u2019s Loan, Savings &amp; Deposit Bank, </em>cited above, said at page 63 of 160 Md., that if the attorney\u2019s fees exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>an indemnity for actual out-of-pocket expenses, its entry would be beyond the authority of the attorney and that \u201cFor the appropriation by the plaintiff of any part of the fees, or the payment of them without corresponding services, or the failure to allow proper credits, the errors can be corrected on motion made in the case by the defendant. <em>Gorsuch v. Thomas, </em>57 Md. 334. After an entry of satisfaction, the defendant may obtain relief by an accounting.\u201d In <em>Gorsuch v. Thomas, </em>the Court, in refusing equitable aid to enjoin the enforcement of judgment several years after it had been entered, said that it would be proper for the judgment debtor to file a motion in the law court' to stay execution until the matter of proper credits on the judgment were determined. We think that the lower court had power to require the attorney\u2019s fees entered by the clerk to be stricken from the judgment as void, and that its order must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
