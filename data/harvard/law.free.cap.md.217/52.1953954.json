The trial court thought not, and granted a directed verdict in favor of the defendant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The appellant testified that she boarded a bus of the defendant with the money for her fare in her hand. She dropped the money in the box and \u201cstarted to make the turn.\u201d The bus then started forward \u201cvery sudden, too unusual for a car [sic] to start, and it dropped me off my feet to the floor.\u201d She was still \u201cright close\u201d to the driver\u2019s seat when she fell; she tried to catch hold of the rod in the front, but fell with her body in a twist. On cross-examination she stated that the bus started \u201cvery fast, very sudden.\u201d While there were several passengers on the bus, there was no evidence that any other passenger was affected by, or noticed, the alleged unusual motion of the bus, the appellant being the only witness with reference to the claimed negligence of the bus driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">We think the appellant raises no novel question and all of her contentions are answered by these decisions of this Court: <em>Smith v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>211 Md. 529; <em>Jones v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>211 Md. 423; <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Sun Cab Co., </em>210 Md. 555; <em>Kaufman v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>197 Md. 141; <em>Przyborowski v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>191 Md. 63; <em>Baltimore &amp; Yorktown Turnpike Road v. Cason, 72 </em>Md. 377; <em>Callis v. United Rys. &amp; Elec. Co., </em>128 Md. 406.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
