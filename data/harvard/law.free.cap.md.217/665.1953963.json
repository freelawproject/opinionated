However, he now alleges several grounds upon which he claims he is entitled to his release, all of which we have ruled are not available in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Judge Gray ruled upon all of the contentions raised except one. The applicant claims he was \u201ctricked\u201d into waiving the requirement of an indictment. If we assume that this is a proper ground to form the basis for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>the bald allegation that he was \u201ctricked,\u201d without the^ allegation of supporting facts, is not sufficient to require the issuance of the writ. <em>Szukiewicz v. Warden, </em>213 Md. 636, 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">For the reasons assigned by Judge Gray in his opinion on the questions that he ruled upon and the reason that we have given concerning the petitioner\u2019s claim of \u201ctrickery,\u201d the application will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
