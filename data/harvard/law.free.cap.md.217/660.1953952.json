We find no showing of a departure from the terms of the statute or basis for the issuance of a writ on this contention. <em>Fisher </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>v. Swenson, </em>192 Md. 717, 64 A. 2d 124; <em>State ex rel. Ambrose v. Warden, </em>192 Md. 725, 64 A. 2d 557; <em>State ex rel. Butler v. Warden, </em>195 Md. 713, 72 A. 2d 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The complaints against counsel are based upon the claim that because of the irregularities which the petitioner asserts, counsel was incompetent and must have acted in collusion with State officials to deprive him of his rights. We find no warrant for the latter conclusion. The petitioner, according to his own statement, had given the police a voluntary statement that he had shot and killed a man, and he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Alleged incompetence of counsel has been held repeatedly not to be a ground for issuance of the writ. We may add that we find here no basis for the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
