This court lacks jurisdiction because Weregwe is removable by reason of his conviction of an aggravated felony and because Weregwe has not raised a colorable constitutional claim or question of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Although Weregwe contends that his right to due process was violated because the IJ would not permit him to call as a witness the victim of the state offense for which he is being removed, Weregwe has not shown that he was substantially prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s ruling. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Weregwe\u2019s arguments with respect to the denial of his request for withholding of removal under the CAT do not depend upon a constitutional issue or a question of law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The court also lacks jurisdiction over the discretionary decisions of the BIA and the IJ denying Weregwe\u2019s request for adjustment of status and a waiver and with respect to the IJ\u2019s sua sponte decision reopening the removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>452 F.3d 392, 395 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v.
