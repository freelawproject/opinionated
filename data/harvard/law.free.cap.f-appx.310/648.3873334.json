On reconsideration, the prior opinion of the court is withdrawn and this opinion is substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Powell\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is GRANTED for the limited purpose of assisting Powell in filing a motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, and in preparing a detailed statement of the issues to be raised on appeal so as to permit this court to review the district court\u2019s determination that Powell\u2019s appeal is frivolous. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 565, 566, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593 (1957); <em>United States v. Boutwell, </em>896 F.2d 884, 889-90 (5th Cir.1990).

The court may then proceed to review the district court\u2019s determination that Powell\u2019s appeal is not taken in \u201cgood faith\u201d and that Powell is thus not entitled to proceed IFP on appeal. <em>See Boutwell, </em>896 F.2d at 899-90.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
