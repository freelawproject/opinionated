The district court denied McCov-ery\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it found that the crack cocaine amendments did not lower McCovery\u2019s sentence range based on the calculations contained in the written judgment entered subsequent to the imposition of sentence at the sentencing hearing. The issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying McCovery\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion by recalculating his amended Guidelines sentence range using the calculations from the written judgment rather than the calculations stated during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Generally, a \u201ccourt may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). However, where a defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a sentencing range</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACY\">that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements for reducing a term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are located in U.S.C.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. The policy statements indicate that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if a retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.C.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">A district court must engage in a two-part analysis when determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). The court must: (1) recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, and (2) decide, in its discretion, whether it will choose to impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 780-81. When the court recalculates a sentence, it first determines \u201ca new base [offense] level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>range, and then using that new base [offense] level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u201cWhere there is a discrepancy between the orally imposed sentence and the written order of judgment and committal, the oral sentence controls.\u201d <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 977 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cIf the oral sentence is ambiguous, then, in an attempt to discern the intent of the district court at the time it imposed sentence, the reviewing court may consider extrinsic evidence, including the commitment order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In this case, there is an alleged discrepancy between the sentence handed down orally at the sentencing hearing and the written judgment in terms of McCovery\u2019s criminal history category and base offense level. We hold that the district court abused its discretion in denying McCov-ery\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the court used the incorrect \u201coriginally applied guideline range\u201d to determine McCovery\u2019s amended guideline range. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. After reviewing the sentencing transcript, we conclude that the court\u2019s oral sentence unambiguously changed McCovery\u2019s criminal history category to a I, but left McCovery\u2019s base offense level at 38. <em>See Khoury, </em>901 F.2d at 977. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for a recalculation of the amended sentence range consistent with this opinion. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
