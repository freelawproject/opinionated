He contends that the sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and, thus, it was substantively unreasonable. Lozano-Chavarria concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, - - -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because the 16-level enhancement he received under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported. Lozano-Chavarria points out that the instant offense did not involve violent conduct, did not pose a danger to others, and was no more than an international trespass. He also contends that the guideline range did not account for his motivation for reentering the United States, which was to help his mother and bedridden brother. As these guidelines arguments were not raised below, plain error review applies. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-19\">The question in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado. </em>The district court considered Lozano-Cha-varria\u2019s sentencing arguments and determined that a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guideline range was appropriate. Lozano-Chavarria\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-20\">Because Lozano-Chavarria has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, he has not shown plain error. <em>See Cam</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number><em>pos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
