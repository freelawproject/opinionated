Hinojosa challenges the district court\u2019s denial of IFP and its certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-17\">Hinojosa\u2019s pleadings in this court address only his financial eligibility to appeal. He has therefore abandoned any challenge to the reasons for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Thus, Hinojosa has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201c \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-20\">Moreover, we note that, during the pen-dency of this appeal, the district court barred Hinojosa from proceeding IFP pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Hinojosa v. Ivy, </em>No. 6:07-cv-00022 (WD.Tex. Oct. 6, 2008). Hinojosa has not filed an appeal in that case. Thus, we caution Hinojosa that he is barred under \u00a7 1915(g) from bringing a civil action or an appeal from a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under \u00a7 1915 unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; IMPOSITION OF 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR NOTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
