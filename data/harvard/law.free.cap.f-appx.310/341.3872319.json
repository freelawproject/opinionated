On appeal, Santos argues that the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a two-level sentence reduction in his case, and that the district court clearly erred when it found, in relation to his original \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, that he posed a danger to the community.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">We review application of the law of the case doctrine <em>de novo. United States v. Bobo, </em>419 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2005). We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce the sentence of a defendant pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">Pursuant to the law of the case doctrine, \u201ca legal decision made at one stage of the litigation, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal when the opportunity existed, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation.\u201d <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997) (quotations omitted). Accordingly, such a decision may only be challenged at a later time if (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made contrary decisions of law applicable to an issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tice. <em>Id. </em>at 1561. We have recognized the law of the case doctrine in the context of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>See id. </em>at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) grants district courts the discretion to reduce a previously imposed sentence where the Sentencing Commission lowers the applicable guideline range and has authorized retroactive application of the amendment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence, the court must recalculate the amended guideline range, and must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1); <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even so, the district court is not required to specifically articulate its consideration of each of the factors. <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines, effective November 1, 2000, reflected the Sentencing Commission\u2019s desire to avoid \u201cpunish[ing] substantially the same conduct twice,\u201d and provided, in pertinent part, that where a defendant is convicted of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) offense for using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime, the defendant cannot also receive a base offense level enhancement in the underlying offense for his use of a firearm during the commission of that offense. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 599. This amendment was given retroactive effect. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Because Santos filed a prior \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 599, which previously was rejected by the district court, and because we dismissed his untimely appeal of that decision, the district court\u2019s denial of his original \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion became the law of the case, No exception applied, because the district court\u2019s finding in relation to Santos\u2019s original \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u2014 that a sentence reduction from the low end of the original 188-to-235-month guideline range, to the low end of the amended 151-to-188-month guideline range, would be insufficient to provide a just punishment \u2014 was not clear error, in light of the fact that he intended to commit a large-scale armed robbery of 25 to 30 kilograms of cocaine and $1,000,000. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-13\">. The district court initially construed Santos\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as invoking Amendment 706 to the crack cocaine guidelines, and denied this motion on the basis that his convictions did not involve crack. <em>See </em>U.S. S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Upon the government\u2019s motion, it vacated this order and denied Santos\u2019s motion pursuant to Amendment 599, acknowledging that Santos had not requested relief under Amendment 706. Because Santos does not address Amendment 706 on appeal, any argument in this respect may be deemed waived. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2004). Regardless, Amendment 706 would not apply here, as noted by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the defendant's history and characteristics; (3) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (5) the protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
