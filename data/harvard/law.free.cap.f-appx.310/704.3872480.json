Cordova argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>a two-level reduction in his offense level because he was a minor participant. He argues that he was only a courier who never handled the narcotics and did not know the recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant in the criminal enterprise. In order to qualify for the adjustment, the defendant must have been \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d or peripheral to the success of the enterprise. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, n. 3(A)). Cordova had previously traveled from Mexico to Denver, Colorado, with two of the same co-conspirators to deliver vehicles loaded with narcotics in the same manner. Cordova admitted that he knew the vehicles were loaded with cocaine and that he was the driver on at least one of the trips. These facts suggest that Cordova was neither peripheral to the advancement of the offense, nor substantially less culpable than his co-conspirators. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203. Cordova has failed to show that the district court\u2019s conclusion was not plausible in light of the record as a whole and, therefore, has failed to show that the district court clearly erred. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
