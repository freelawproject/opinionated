California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Golden has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal in connection with the sentence imposed upon resentencing. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Counsel\u2019s alternative motion to remand for a ruling on a certificate of appealability is DENIED. <em>See Pope v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., </em>937 F.2d 258, 266 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b672-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
