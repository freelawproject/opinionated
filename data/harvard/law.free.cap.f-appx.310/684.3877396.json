Barnum was convicted of assaulting a federal officer and firearms offenses, and he was sentenced to a total of 240 months of imprisonment. He argues that Amendment 709, which clarified the manner in which misdemeanor and petty offenses are counted in determining the defendant\u2019s criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), reduces his criminal history score and the guidelines range that he should have faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-21\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Barnum\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28-29. As the district court determined, Amendment 709 has not been made retroactively applicable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c) (May 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-22\">Barnum does not affirmatively assert that Amendment 709 applies retroactively. Inasmuch as he argues that the amendment should apply retroactively because it is a clarifying amendment, his argument fails. Except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not retroactively applied unless it is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-23\">Barnum also relies on Amendment 706 in support of his motion. However, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the district court determined, because Barnum was convicted of assault and firearms offenses, the recent amendments to the crack cocaine Guidelines do not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Because Barnum does not rely on any retroactive amendment in support of his challenge to his criminal history, and because the recent retroactive crack cocaine amendments have no application to his case, he was clearly ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The appeal is without arguable merit and therefore frivolous. <em>See Hutchins v. McDaniels, </em>512 F.3d 193, 195-96 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b713-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
