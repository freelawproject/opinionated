Although Williams renews his challenge to his conviction and sentence and renews his claims against Chris Dorsey and Judges Rank and Flores, Williams does not challenge any of the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal. By failing to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal, Williams has abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Williams\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because it is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019s appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Williams is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Williams\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
