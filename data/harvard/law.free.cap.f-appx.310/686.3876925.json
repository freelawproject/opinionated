He contends in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that this court must review his sentence for reasonableness using the bifurcated approach set forth in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). DeLeon-Fuentes argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court procedurally erred when it failed to respond to two of the arguments he raised in mitigation of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"ArZz\">This court will review DeLeon-Fuentes\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 792 (5th Cir.2007). To establish plain error, DeLeon-Fuentes must show (1) that there was error, (2) that the error was clear or obvious, and (3) that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these factors are established, the decision to correct the forfeited error is within this court\u2019s sound discretion, which will not be exercised unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 735-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">The record reflects that the district court complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) by implicitly considering the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing De-Leon-Fuentes\u2019s revocation sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Moreover, to the extent that \u00a7 3553(c) may require a district court to state in open court its reasons for imposing a revocation sentence, the district court\u2019s statements were legally sufficient. The district court\u2019s references to DeLeon-Fuentes\u2019s recidivism and his role in the revocation offense provided sufficient explanation for the rejection of De-Leon-Fuentes\u2019s arguments in favor of a more lenient revocation sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court\u2019s statements indicated a reasoned basis for exercising its legal decision making authority. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">The 18-month term of imprisonment imposed in DeLeon-Fuentes\u2019s case fell within the 24-month statutory maximum term of imprisonment that the district court could have imposed upon revocation of his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3); \u00a7 3583(e)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). The sentence also fell within the range recommended by the policy statements in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.3(f), p.s., 7B1.4(a), p.s. DeLeon-Fuentes\u2019s appellate argument fails to establish that his sentence was unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. DeLeon-Fuentes cannot establish plain error. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 735-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
