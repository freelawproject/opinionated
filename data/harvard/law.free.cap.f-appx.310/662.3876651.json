Carter has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s certification, pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997), that his appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-20\">Because Carter\u2019s brief does not address the reasons for the district court\u2019s certification decision or the basis of the district court\u2019s dismissal, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The district court\u2019s certification that Carter\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, Carter\u2019s motion for IFP is denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-21\">Carter is hereby informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), in addition to the strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Carter that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-22\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b690-17\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
