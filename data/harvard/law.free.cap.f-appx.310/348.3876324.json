The district court dismissed his complaint because it had previously declared him subject to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g)-plus status and thereby barred from bringing any claims in that court until he paid his outstanding filing fees in that court. For the reasons that follow, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of Heard\u2019s complaint, VACATE the injunc-tive portion of the court\u2019s order regarding future filings, and REMAND the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b377-17\">Heard, a Georgia state prisoner in Augusta Medical State Prison, initially brought this \u00a7 1983 suit <em>pro se </em>against James Donald, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections, and two physicians, Dr. Bennett and Dr. Pinda,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Heard alleged that while he was in the prison infirmary, Drs. Bennett and Pinda violated his civil rights by administering injections to him that caused him extreme emotional and physical pain because of the resulting swelling of his joints and knees. Rl-1, 6. The district court dismissed Donald as a party and transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-18\">The Southern District had previously deemed Heard to be a \u201cserial filer\u201d and thus found him to be \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g)-plus barred\u201d from filing claims under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rl-5. Under this rule, the clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>of court was instructed not to accept any of Heard\u2019s filings until he fully paid his outstanding filing fees in that district. The sole exceptions to this bar were if Heard\u2019s filing was in a criminal proceeding brought against him or if he had been denied access to state courts. Accordingly, even though Heard had paid his filing fee for this case in the Northern District, the district court for the Southern District dismissed his complaint after it was transferred there because he had yet to pay his outstanding filing fees in that court. In the dismissal order, the court reminded Heard that he was subject to the \u201c \u00a7 1915(g)-plus\u201d limitations. Heard now appeals this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1915(g), the filing fee provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir.2004). We construe liberally pleadings filed <em>pro se. See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Heard contends that the district court erred in dismissing his appeal and that he should not be penalized because of his \u201cplus barred\u201d status. Interpreting his brief liberally in light of Heard\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, we view him to be asking us to reverse the dismissal and to vacate the district court\u2019s limitations on his ability to file documents in that court. In <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091 (11th Cir.2008), we dealt with another plaintiff who was subject to a \u201cplus barred\u201d restriction by the Southern District. <em>See id. </em>at 1095. We found that the court abused its discretion in imposing such a restriction because the court could not close off the litigation avenues that Congress specifically left open under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See id. </em>at 1096-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Since Heard was subject to the same impermissible restriction we struck down in <em>Miller, </em>we find that the court\u2019s dismissal of his claim because of such a restriction constituted reversible error. The district court dismissed Heard\u2019s claim without addressing whether or not it would have met the requirements of \u00a7 1915(g), i.e. if he was under imminent danger of serious physical injury. We therefore reverse the dismissal and remand for the district court to consider this issue. Further, to the extent that the limitations imposed on Heard as a result of his \u201cplus barred\u201d characterization enjoin him from filing in the court, they are overbroad. <em>See id. </em>at 1098 (deeming the injunction imposed as a result of Miller\u2019s \u201cplus barred\u201d status to be overbroad). Accordingly, we also vacate that portion of the district court\u2019s order noting that Heard would be subject to those restrictions. The district court still has discretion to fashion its own method for identifying and screening out frivolous filings, but must do so in a manner that takes into consideration our guidance from <em>Miller. See id. </em>at 1096-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Heard appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>to his \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g)-plus barred\u201d status. We find that the \u201cplus barred\u201d restrictions are overbroad and should not have served as a justification for dismissing Heard\u2019s suit. We therefore REVERSE the dismissal of his claim, VACATE that portion of the opinion imposing the \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g)-plus barred\u201d status, and REMAND for further proceedings in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\">.
