The BIA denied the motion to reopen on the ground that Akinsowon had overstayed her period of voluntary departure and therefore was statutorily ineligible for the relief sought. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 387, 388 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Akinsowon argues that her timely motion to reopen avoided imposition of the \u00a7 1229c(d)(l)(B) bar to eligibility for adjustment of status. She further argues that her statutory right to adjustment and the merit of her adjustment application trumps the \u00a7 1229c(d)(l)(B) bar. Akinsowon\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>See Dada v. Mukasey, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2318-19, 171 L.Ed.2d 178 (2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this matter, Akinsowon became ineligible to adjust her status because she failed to depart the United States within the 60-day voluntary departure period, which expired while her motion to reopen was pending. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229c(d)(B). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reopen. <em>See Banda-Ortiz, </em>445 F.3d at 391; \u00a7 1229e(d)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\">. We note that, after <em>Dada </em>was decided, a new rule was promulgated, effective January 20, 2009. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(e)(l)(2009). Under this new rule, a grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated by the filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the time for departure. <em>Id. </em>However, because this new rule, by its own terms, is not to be applied retroactively, it does not inure to Akinsowon's benefit here. <em>See </em>Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed.Reg. 76927, 76937 (Dec. 18, 2008)(stating that the new rule is not to be applied retroactively).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
