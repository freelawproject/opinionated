He requests only that this court exercise its power pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 to correct an alleged clerical error in the judgment. Specifically, he alleges that the district court\u2019s judgment misidentifies the nature of his offense as \u201c[ijllegal reentry after deportation\u201d when it should state that he was found unlawfully in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-28\">Rule 36 authorizes this court to correct only clerical errors, which exist when \u201cthe court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number><em>United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1026 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In the district court\u2019s judgment, the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d description, \u201c[ijllegal reentry after deportation following conviction for an aggravated felony,\u201d so closely tracks the \u00a7 1326 title, \u201c[r]eentry of removed aliens,\u201d that it bears no indicia of the district court having made a mistake or oversight. Rather, it appears that the district court intended the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d to refer generally to the title of \u00a7 1326. Therefore, there is no clerical error, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See United States v. Buendia-Rangel, </em>553 F.3d 378, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
