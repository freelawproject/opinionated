The district court indicated that Curry was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was not sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but under a statutory maximum sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>that was less than the minimum of his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On appeal, Curry generally argues that the district court possessed the authority to reduce his sentence. He asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in which the Court held that the Guidelines are advisory, provided the district court with authority to reduce his sentence despite the operation of his statutory mandatory maximum sentence. He further argues that the district court erred by failing to provide sufficient reasoning for its decision to deny his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). In the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if stick a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2009). A defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction where a guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">Amendment 706 retroactively reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases, calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), by two levels. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant, whose guideline imprisonment range was determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1, to seek a reduction in his sentence, a defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Pursuant to the guidelines, \u201c[w]here the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">We have held that <em>Booker </em>does not constitute an independent jurisdictional basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because <em>Booker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err in finding that it lacked the authority to reduce Curry\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because Curry was subject to a statutory mandatory maximum sentence that was less than the minimum of his amended guideline range, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Curry\u2019s guideline range. Moreover, we conclude that <em>Booker </em>did not provide the district court with an independent jurisdictional basis to reduce Curry\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Curry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a district court complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). Section 3553(c) of Title 18 of the U.S.Code provides, in relevant part, that \u201cthe ... court shall state in open court the reason for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); <em>Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Because the district court\u2019s order included sufficient reasoning to provide for meaningful appellate review, we discern no reason to remand to the district court for a further articulation of its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Curry\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
