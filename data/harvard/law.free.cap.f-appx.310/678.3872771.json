The district court held that Spencer\u2019s claims, which relate to his alleged exposure to asbestos, lack of proper medical treatment, retaliation, and the loss of legal notes, related to the conditions of his confinement. Because success on these claims would not result in Spencer\u2019s accelerated release from prison, the district court held that they were not cognizable under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Spencer argues that his application is proper under \u00a7 2241 because he is challenging the execution of his sentence and he seeks accelerated release from prison. He contends that the loss of his legal notes negatively impacted his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, which he asserts could have resulted in his release from prison. Therefore, he argues that accelerated release is appropriate relief in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-17\">Where \u201ca prisoner challenges an unconstitutional condition of confinement or prison procedure that affects the timing of his release from custody,\u201d the proper vehicle is a civil rights action if a determination in the prisoner\u2019s favor will not automatically result in his accelerated release. <em>Carson v. Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 820-21 (5th Cir.1997). Even if Spencer could prove the claims he seeks to present, he has not shown a legal basis for obtaining accelerated release. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-18\">Spencer\u2019s motion for release pending appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b707-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
