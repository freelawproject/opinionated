The district court denied Muscolino\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that this appeal was not taken in good faith. Muscolino\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to that certification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">As Muscolino raises a claim of conspiracy for the first time on appeal, we shall not consider it. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Muscolino\u2019s claim that the defendants failed to follow prison procedures and regulations is insufficient, without more, to establish a constitutional violation cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Edwards v. Johnson, </em>209 F.3d 772, 779 (5th Cir.2000). His claim that he was retaliated against for his refusal to cooperate in the investigation of another inmate is frivolous because the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against selfincrimination is purely personal and may not be asserted on behalf of a third party. <em>See, e.g., California Bankers Ass\u2019n v. Shultz, </em>416 U.S. 21, 55, 94 S.Ct. 1494, 39 L.Ed.2d 812 (1974). His claim that his reclassification to maximum security and his loss of privileges violated his due process rights does not state a violation of a cognizable liberty interest. <em>See Hernandez v. Velasquez, </em>522 F.3d 556, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 767-68 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Moody v. Baker, </em>857 F.2d 256, 257-58 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Muscolino has not shown that he will present any nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Our dismissal of Muscolino\u2019s appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights suit for failure to state a claim count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Muscolino is warned that if, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he accumulates a third strike, he shall be barred from proceeding IFP while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
