He was sentenced to life in prison and a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-28\">The district court\u2019s calculation of the applicable advisory guidelines sentencing range was based on its determination that Espinoza had a base offense level of 38. That base offense level was chosen based on the district court\u2019s finding that, for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Espinoza <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>was accountable for more than 150 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Espinoza argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination was clearly erroneous. He maintains that the district court relied on information from witness Gabriel Hernandez that was materially untrue. Even if we discount the portion of Hernandez\u2019s testimony that is contested by Espinoza, the district court\u2019s factual finding that Espinoza was accountable for more than 150 kilograms of cocaine is plausible in light of the whole record. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, that finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
