Garees asserts that the BIA erred when it denied him a waiver of inadmissibility under former \u00a7 212(c) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1996)) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and a suspension of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-20\">Garees argues that he is eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility on a nunc pro tunc basis and that the BIA erred as a matter of law in holding that it lacked the authority to grant such a waiver. Garees is not entitled to nunc pro tunc relief. <em>See Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 366-67 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-21\">Garees also argues that he is eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver because there is a comparable ground of inadmissibility in \u00a7 212(a), namely a crime involving moral turpitude, for his conviction of sexual abuse of a minor. Garces\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See Avilez-Granados v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 869, 871-72 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-22\">Garees further argues that the BIA erred in concluding that he was not eligible for a suspension of deportation under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(2). Garees also contends that because the BIA failed to specifically adopt the reasoning and set forth its own reasons for finding Garees ineligible for a suspension of deportation, the matter should be remanded to the BIA for further consideration. Garees cannot satisfy the go.od moral character requirement of former \u00a7 1254(b) because he was convicted of an aggravated felony (sexual abuse of a minor) in 1993. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-24\">Accordingly, Garce's\u2019s petition for review is DENIED, and Garces\u2019s motion to stay is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
