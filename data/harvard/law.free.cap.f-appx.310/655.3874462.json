Gonzalez argues that the district court erred under <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), in recharacterizing his petition, which asserted a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. Gonzalez\u2019s reliance on <em>Castro </em>is misplaced. Because this was not Gonzalez\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion, the warning required by <em>Castro </em>was unnecessary. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), a \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). To do so, the petitioner must show that (1) his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense,\u201d and (2) his claims were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim[s] should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Gonzalez has failed to show that his claim of a violation of the Speedy Trial Act satisfies the test for the savings clause. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
