The gravamen of Williams\u2019s appeal is the July 18, 2008, 2008 WL 2817097, order of the court excluding the testimony of Williams\u2019s proffered expert witnesses for failure to conform to standards of Federal Rule of Evidence 702. As none contest the conclusion that, without the testimony of her experts, Williams has no grounds on which to appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Appellees, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>focus of this appeal is on the order excluding the testimony of her proffered experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Our painstaking review of the facts and the applicable law as related in the appellate briefs of the parties and the writings of the district court compel the conclusion that all relevant rulings of the district court, particularly its order excluding the testimony of Williams\u2019s experts, demonstrates beyond cavil that this order was eminently correct, as a result of which dismissal of Williams\u2019s action by summary judgment for lack of any genuine issue of material fact was equally correct. For the reasons set forth by the district court in its order excluding the testimony and reports of Williams\u2019s experts, and in its Memorandum Opinion of even date therewith, the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing this action with prejudice is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
