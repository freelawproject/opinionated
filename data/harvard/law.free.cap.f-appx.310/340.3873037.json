Her statement did not mention Paul\u2019s political affiliation or. his claims that uniformed police officers representing the L\u00e1-valas political party raped his wife in his home and later killed his cousin, but instead included details of a completely different incident, in which she claimed that she was imprisoned for 17 days and raped by prison guards. According to Paul, the extent to which his wife\u2019s statement varied from his application and testimony is irrelevant because her statement should have been disregarded or given minimal weight. Specifically, Paul claims that he testified consistently and credibly, and he provided solid proof to corroborate his claim, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the IJ disregarded all of that evidence for one statement submitted by Paul\u2019s wife, who Paul contends suffers from depression, decreased concentration, paranoia, and agoraphobia. Finally, Paul argues that, presented with significant evidence of Paul\u2019s wife\u2019s mental illness, the IJ clearly erred in making her statement the only basis for the adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201creweigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>After an adverse credibility finding has been made, the applicant then has the burden to show that the BIA or the IJ\u2019s \u201ccredibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision to uphold the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the IJ\u2019s determination was based on multiple internal inconsistencies in the record, namely, the key differences between Paul\u2019s application and testimony and his wife\u2019s statement supporting her own previously denied asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Second, Paul argues that he has a very compelling claim for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief and is entitled to relief as a matter of law because he provided direct, credible, and specific evidence in the record, proving past persecution and creating a presumption of future persecution. Accordingly, Paul asserts that the IJ should have granted him asylum as a matter of discretion. Paul also argues that the BIA should have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>as a question of law to determine whether he met his burden of proof in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">However, the record likewise does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because Paul\u2019s remaining documentary evidence, outside of his discredited application and testimony, was insufficient to support his claim for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
