He argues (1) that the district court plainly erred in treating his federal drug conviction as a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2; (2) that his case should be remanded so the district court can consider the disparity created by early disposition programs; (3) that his sentence violates his equal protection rights; and (4) that the district court plainly erred in ordering that his sentence be served consecutively to an unimposed state sentence. The Government has moved to supplement the record and for summary affirmance, or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file an appellate brief. The Government\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement the record with the factual resume for Munoz-Astello\u2019s prior drug conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Munoz-Astello\u2019s first appellate argument is without merit. A comparison of the statute and Guideline at issue shows that a conviction under \u00a7 841(a)(1) qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(I). <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1); \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 1(B)(iv)). Moreover, as Munoz-Astello concedes, his last three appellate arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 2, 2008) (No. 08-5226); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 30, 2008) (08-5101); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>(abrogation on other grounds recognized, United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006)). Munoz-Astello raises his last three arguments solely to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motions to supplement the record and for summary affirmance are GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file an appellate brief is DENIED as MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
