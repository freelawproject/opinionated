Ramos, federal prisoner # 60283-004, has moved to proceed in for-ma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his \u201cMotion to Inspect Jury Lists.\u201d A movant for leave to proceed IFP on appeal must show that he is a pauper and that the appeal is taken in good faith. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Ramos was convicted by a jury in November 2001 of conspiracy to possess cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, and Ramos\u2019s initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">Ramos contends that he has an \u201cunqualified right\u201d to inspect the jury lists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(f) and that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion. Ramos asserts that he has received \u201can anonymous letter from an alleged jury venireman\u201d who claimed that he gave false statements to the district court regarding residency requirements. He contends that his conviction is invalid and that he is entitled to inspect the jury lists to perfect a claim regarding unqualified jurors. He argues that his challenge to the composition of the jury is not untimely and that the prior denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion does not preclude him from raising a challenge to the composition of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-18\">Ramos\u2019s instant motion to inspect the jury lists, filed more than six years after the conclusion of his jury trial, and after the conclusion of his direct appeal, is not timely under \u00a7 1867(a). <em>See United States v. Hawkins, </em>566 F.2d 1006, 1013 (5th Cir.1978). To the extent that Ramos seeks access to the jury lists for the purpose of raising a constitutional claim regarding the jury selection process, such a claim would not satisfy the standards of \u00a7 2255(h), which requires that a claim raised in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion be based on newly discovered evidence which \u201cwould be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense,\u201d or on \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d As Ramos has no cognizable claim based on irregularities in the jury selection process, the district court did not err in denying his motion to inspect jury lists. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number><em>States v. Edwards, </em>442 F.3d 258, 268 n. 10 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Ramos has not shown that his appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cik. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
