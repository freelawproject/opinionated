For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Gamble pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute five or more grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The government filed a substantial assistance motion, pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1. The district court set Gamble\u2019s base offense level at 30, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and applied a 3-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The district court set Gamble\u2019s criminal history category at IV. The district court determined that, with a total offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of IV, Gamble\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 100 to 125 months. The district court acknowledged, however, that Jones had a prior drug conviction, such that his statutory mandatory range of imprisonment was ten years to life, pursuant o 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The district court concluded, therefore, that Gamble\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 120 and 125 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). The district court then granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure motion and sentenced Gamble to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. On March 31, 2008, Gamble submitted the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court denied Gamble\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">[Gamble] was subject to a 10 year minimum mandatory sentence. As such, [Gamble] is not entitled to the 2 level reduction. Amendment 706 does not apply in this case. Though [Gamble] received a sentence reduction pursuant to [\u00a7 5K1.1], such reduction does not have the effect of altering the original guideline calculation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the [Guidelines].\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an already-incarcerated defendant\u2019s sentence if the sentence was determined using a guideline imprisonment range that retroactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The commentary to the Guidelines instructs that a defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction \u201cif the amendment [in question] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.)\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). In a recent published case, <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, ---, slip op. at 452-55 (11th Cir.2008), we held that this principle applied even where the district court departed downward from a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. We reasoned that, (1) given the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s point of departure would not shift as a result of [Amendment 706\u2019s] lowering of the crack offense levels\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe decreased sentence [imposed pursuant to the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion] should [not] be read to somehow eliminate the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340-41. We concluded that \u201c[b]ecause [the defendant] was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range, he was not sentenced according to the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, even taking into account the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">The district court did not err in denying Gamble\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Moore, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>541 F.3d at 1326. Gamble was sentenced pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, and departure therefrom pursuant to a substantial assistance motion, rather than a guideline imprisonment range that ultimately was altered under Amendment 706. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1331.10, comment. (n.1(A)); <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at ---, slip op. at 452-55. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
