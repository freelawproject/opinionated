As his sole argument on appeal, Hermosillo argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-24\">\u201cThe general rule in this circuit is that a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotations, alteration, and citation omitted). \u201cExcept in those rare instances where an adequate record exists to evaluate such a claim on direct appeal, this court generally declines to address it, without prejudice to it being raised under [28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>959 F.2d 1297, 1301 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Hermosillo did not raise his claim of ineffective assistance in the district court. Moreover, an adequate record does not exist to evaluate all of Hermosillo\u2019s allegations. Accordingly, we decline to address Hermosillo\u2019s claims, without prejudice to Hermosillo\u2019s rights to raise them in a timely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
