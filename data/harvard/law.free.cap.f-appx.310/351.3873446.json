After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">A.Mitchell\u2019s Child Support Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Mitchell, a Gulf War Army veteran, suffers from a number of medical conditions, including depression, degenerative disc disease, lung disease and hypertension. In 1991, while still in the Army, Mitchell underwent surgery for sarcoidosis in his lungs, which resulted in his breathing capacity being severely restricted. Shortly afterward, Mitchell was honorably discharged. Mitchell has been on permanent disability VA benefits since 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In 2001 Mitchell fathered a child with Annette Robinson. Robinson instituted child support proceedings in state court. Mitchell was ordered to pay child support. Because Mitchell was disabled and unemployed, he struggled to pay the court-ordered child support and often borrowed money from relatives to do so. In 2002 and 2003, Mitchell was twice held in contempt and jailed for failure to pay child support. Between June and August 2004, Mitchell\u2019s financial condition worsened, and he fell behind on his household bills, including his mortgage and utilities bills. Mitchell pawned personal items and borrowed money to pay these bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In 2005, Mitchell filed a motion to reduce his child support payments. At a July 2005 hearing on the motion, Robinson attempted to introduce into evidence two VA documents that contained personal information about Mitchell, including his social security number and the amount of his VA benefits. When Mitchell objected to this information, the state court refused to consider the documents. The state court denied Mitchell\u2019s motion to reduce, but also denied Robinson\u2019s request for a child support increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Mitchell testified at his deposition that, after the hearing, he became angry and upset about Robinson\u2019s use of this information in the child support dispute and that this aggravated his depression. At his wife\u2019s urging, Mitchell saw a psychiatrist, who suggested that Mitchell take medication. Mitchell also was evaluated by a psychologist, who prepared a report. The report stated that Mitchell has suffered from depression since leaving the Army in 1991 and that his depression stems from his physical restrictions after lung surgery. The psychologist diagnosed Mitchell with severe depression and panic disorder and recommended weekly psychotherapy. According to Mitchell, he now takes medication and has obtained counseling through the VA.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">B. Disclosure of Records</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">In August 2005, after the child support hearing, Mitchell complained to the VA about disclosing his records to Robinson. An internal investigation revealed that a VA employee who was Robinson\u2019s neighbor had accessed a VA database and printed Mitchell\u2019s \u201cEnrollment File List\u201d and \u201cHINQ record\u201d on July 19, 2005. The internal investigation concluded that the information was accessed and disclosed to Robinson without Mitchell\u2019s consent or authorization in violation of \u00a7 522a of the Privacy Act. The investigation recommended disciplinary action against the VA employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">C. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">In federal district court, Mitchell filed this <em>pro se </em>action alleging that, as a result of the VA employee\u2019s unauthorized disclosure of his records, he suffered mental depression and financial loss. Mitchell asked for damages and injunctive relief. Following discovery, the VA moved for summary judgment. The VA conceded that an unauthorized disclosure of records under the Privacy Act occurred, but ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>gued that Mitchell was not entitled to relief because he had not shown: (1) that the unauthorized disclosure had an \u201cadverse effect\u201d on him, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(l)(D); or (2) that he had suffered \u201cactual damages,\u201d as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The district court granted summary judgment on the first ground, concluding that Mitchell had not suffered an adverse effect as a result of the Privacy Act violation. The district court noted that the VA records were not admitted into evidence at the child support hearing and presumably did not affect the state court\u2019s decision not to alter the child support amount. The district court rejected Mitchell\u2019s argument that the disclosure aggravated his depression, stating that \u201c[njothing in the medical report or in any other evidence presented indicates that the [VA\u2019s] violation had any significant bearing on Mitchell\u2019s current condition\u201d and that \u201cthere was no proof offered that psychological care was necessitated by the disclosure itself; rather, the evidence shows that Mitchell\u2019s pre-exist-ing, ongoing depressive condition required care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Mitchell filed an objection, arguing <em>inter alia </em>that the stress from the disclosure aggravated his pre-existing depression. The district court construed the objection as a motion for reconsideration and denied it. Mitchell filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">The Privacy Act prohibits a federal agency, with some exceptions not applicable here, from disclosing records without prior written consent of the individual to whom the records pertain. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b). The Privacy Act authorizes a civil action against the agency in district court if an unauthorized disclosure occurs \u201cin such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.\u201d \u00a7 552a(g)(l)(D).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the Privacy Act provides a civil damages remedy of at least $1,000, but only when the agency\u2019s conduct was intentional or willful and the individual has sustained actual damages as a result. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552a(g)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">Thus, under this statutory framework, a plaintiff must show (1) that he was ad-' versely affected by an intentional or willful violation of the Privacy Act, and (2) that he has suffered \u201cactual damages.\u201d <em>See Doe v. Chao, </em>540 U.S. 614, 620-23, 124 S.Ct. 1204, 1208-10, 157 L.Ed.2d 1122 (2004) (concluding that summary judgment should have been granted on plaintiffs Privacy Act damages claim for emotional distress where plaintiff failed to present evidence of actual damages). This Court has con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>eluded that \u201c \u2018actual damages\u2019 as used in the Privacy Act permits recovery only for proven pecuniary losses and not for generalized mental injuries, loss of reputation, embarrassment or other non-quantif\u00edable injuries.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick v. IRS, </em>665 F.2d 327, 331 (11th Cir.1982), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Doe v. Chao, </em>540 U.S. at 616, 124 S.Ct. at 1206.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">On appeal, Mitchell challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that he failed to present a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he suffered an \u201cadverse effect\u201d from the unauthorized disclosure of his VA records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has described the Privacy Act\u2019s \u201cadverse effect\u201d requirement as \u201ca term of art identifying a potential plaintiff who satisfies the injury-in-fact and causation requirements of Article III standing, and who may consequently bring a civil action without suffering dismissal for want of standing to sue.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>540 U.S. at 624, 124 S.Ct. at 1211. \u201cThat is, an individual subjected to an adverse effect has injury enough to open the courthouse door, but without more has no cause of action for damages under the Privacy Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624-25, 124 S.Ct. at 1211. However, neither we nor the Supreme Court has addressed what constitutes an \u201cadverse effect\u201d for purposes of the Privacy Act. In addition, the VA claims Mitchell would need medical evidence to show the record disclosure aggravated his depression. We need not resolve these questions here, however, because even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Mitchell\u2019s statement that he suffered \u201caggravated depression\u201d was sufficient to show an \u201cadverse effect,\u201d Mitchell did not submit evidence from which a reasonable jury could find \u201cactual damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Although Mitchell arguably presented evidence of mental injury-his aggravated depression \u2014 he clearly did not present any evidence of his pecuniary losses stemming from that mental injury, such as bills for his medical treatment, psychological counseling or prescriptions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under our precedent, Mitchell\u2019s mental injury alone is insufficient to show \u201cactual damages.\u201d <em>See Fitzpatrick, </em>665 F.2d at 329 n. 3 (noting that plaintiffs \u201cdamages claim was based solely on his mental injuries\u201d and that plaintiff did not submit evidence \u201cof pecuniary losses, such as expenses of psychiatric care stemming from the disclosure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the VA on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Mitchell\u2019s Privacy Act claim for damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We also reject Mitchell\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">.

To the extent <em>Fitzpatrick </em>suggested that a Privacy Act plaintiff need prove actual damages only to be awarded <em>more than </em>the minimum statutory damages of $1,000, <em>Fitzpatrick </em>is no longer good law after Doe. Doe made clear that the Privacy Act \"guarantees $1,000 only to plaintiffs who have suffered some actual damages.\u201d 540 U.S. at 627, 124 S.Ct. at 1212. However, Doe explicitly left untouched and expressed no opinion about <em>Fitzpatrick\u2019s </em>interpretation of the meaning of \"actual damages\u201d within the Privacy Act. <em>See id. </em>at 627 n. 12, 124 S.Ct. at 1212 n. 12. Thus, <em>Fitzpatrick's </em>restriction of \"actual damages\u201d to pecuniary losses remains binding precedent in this Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">. \"We review a district court's grant of summary <em>de novo, </em>viewing the record and drawing all inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Fisher v.

For the first time on appeal, Mitchell argues that, even if he has not shown proof of actual damages, he is entitled to recover costs under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(4)(B).
