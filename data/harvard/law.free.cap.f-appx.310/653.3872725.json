Sanchez-Alvarez pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement. He argues for the first time on appeal that the Government breached the term in the agreement requiring a recommendation for a minor role adjustment. He points to the following statement made by the prosecutor at the sentencing hearing: \u201cMy-you know, my gut feeling is there was more involvement, but I don\u2019t have any evidence to prove that he has additional involvement beyond his role in repackaging the narcotics at the location.\u201d Sanchez-Alvarez further asserts that the Government breached the agreement by not objecting to the probation officer\u2019s characterization of him as being \u201cmore culpable than the other defendants\u201d and that he \u201chad a larger role within the conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">If a defendant fails to object to an alleged breach in the district court, as is the case here, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Branam, </em>231 F.3d 931, 933 (5th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA defendant asserting a breach bears the burden of proving, by preponderance of the evidence, the underlying facts establishing a breach.\u201d <em>United States v. Laday, </em>56 F.3d 24, 26 (5th Cir.1995) (footnote omitted). This court applies general principles of contract law in interpreting a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Cantu, </em>185 F.3d 298, 304 (5th Cir.1999). \u201c[Tjhis court considers whether the government\u2019s conduct is consistent with the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Sanchez-Alvarez has not shown a breach of the plea agreement. As the Government argues, Sanchez-Alvarez takes the prosecutor\u2019s statement out of context. A review of the sentencing transcript reflects that the statement was made during a discussion at sentencing of whether Sanchez-Alvarez qualified for a decrease pursuant to the \u201csafety-valve\u201d provision. As for a minor role adjustment, the sentencing transcript reflects that the prosecutor advised the district court that there was a stipulation at the rearraignment that the Government would recommend a minor role adjustment. In support of that recommendation, the prosecutor stated that it was the Government\u2019s belief that Sanchez-Alvarez did not have a \u201csupervisor role\u201d and that \u201c[h]is role was limited to that of repackaging the cocaine.\u201d The district court\u2019s rejection of the Government\u2019s recommendation does not constitute a breach of the plea agreement. Rather, the transcript reflects that the Government\u2019s conduct was \u201cconsistent with the defendant\u2019s reasonable under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>standing of the agreement.\u201d <em>See Cantu, </em>185 F.3d at 304. Accordingly, Sanchez-Alvarez has failed to establish a breach of the plea agreement that is plain, obvious, or affected his substantial rights. <em>See U.S. v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Sanchez-Alvarez also argues that the district court erred in not granting him an adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) based on his role as a minor participant in his offense of conviction. The revised presentence report reflects that one of Sanchez-Alvarez\u2019s codefendants stated that Sanchez-Alvarez was sent \u201cto oversee the cocaine delivery and possibly take possession of it.\u201d Although Sanchez-Alvarez objected to the accuracy of this statement, he presented no rebuttal evidence in support of his objection. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in reljdng on the revised presentence report. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831-32 (5th Cir.1998). In addition, Sanchez-Alvarez acknowledged that he agreed to help repackage a large quantity of cocaine, which was a step leading to its further distribution. Because the district court\u2019s finding that Sanchez-Alvarez was not a minor participant \u201cis plausible in light of the record read as a whole,\u201d we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that he was not entitled to this reduction. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Sanchez-Alvarez further argues that the district court erred by enhancing his base offense level by two levels for possession of a dangerous weapon. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Sanchez-Alvarez asserts he was unaware of the presence of any firearms in the house where the cocaine was found. A defendant\u2019s guidelines offense level may be enhanced under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) if the possession of a firearm by a coconspirator was reasonably foreseeable. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 423 (5th Cir.2006). Because there is evidence that Sanchez-Alvarez\u2019s codefendant possessed a firearm while he and Sanchez-Alvarez were engaged in repackaging a large quantity of cocaine, the district court did not clearly err by finding that Sanchez-Alvarez\u2019s codefendant\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon was reasonably foreseeable. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>77 F.3d 1480, 1498 (5th Cir.1996). Furthermore, the record reflects that the district court complied with Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by considering the relevant factors and adopting the revised pre-sentence report\u2019s facts regarding the dangerous weapon enhancement. <em>See United States v. Sherbak, </em>950 F.2d 1095, 1099 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\">. We note that the United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari on the question of what standard of review applies to a forfeited claim that the government breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>505 F.3d 377 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 29, 171 L.Ed.2d 932 (2008). Because we find no breach under any standard, we conclude that the standard of review question does not control the outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
