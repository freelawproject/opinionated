Section 1326 is entitled \u201c[rjeentry of removed aliens.\u201d The judgment describes the offense as \u201c[ijllegal reentry into the United States after deportation following conviction for aggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Rule 36 authorizes the correction of clerical errors, which exist when \u201cthe court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u201d <em>United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022,1026 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because the description of the offense closely tracks the title of \u00a7 1326, there is no indication of mistake or oversight. Rather, it appears that the district court intentionally used the phrase \u201c[ijllegal reentry\u201d to refer to \u00a7 1326 generally. <em>See United States v. Buendia-Rangel, </em>553 F.3d 378, 379 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, there is no clerical error, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
