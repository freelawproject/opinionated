The concession obviates the necessity of an express holding to the same effect. The only question left is whether the marks are so similar as to be likely to create confusion in trade. It would be difficult to imagine a more flagrant violation of the statute than the one here presented. The red core of the watermelon with its seed spots, held under the chin of the negro, is a good reproduction of the red bandana with its spots, tied around the neck of the negress. A mere glance at the marks is convincing. No evidence of confusion is neees<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>sary, nor can any amount of fine-spun discrimination withdraw the case from the direct operation of the statute. The opposition should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
