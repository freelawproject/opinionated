It appears from the record that the term \u201cset\u201d is common among' builders as descriptive of the placing of structural elements in position. The thing upon which the mark is used is metal frame window sash, used for plate-glass store fronts. In <em>Detroit Showcase Co. </em>v. <em>Kawneer Mfg. Co. </em>162 C. C. A. 370, 250 Fed. 234, the court described the product of appellant company as follows: \u201cThe basis of this charge, broadly speaking, is that plaintiff and its predecessor were the first to make an all-metal store front construction, the nearest approach in the prior art being metal covered wood; that the all-metal construction is lighter, more artistic, and more easily set.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Considering the impression which the mark would make on those familiar with the use to which the product of appellant is put, we think the mind would at once be directed to the superior qualities of adjustment possessed by appellant\u2019s product. As was said by the Commissioner: \u201cWhen it is said that this construction is an \u2018Easyset\u2019 metal sash, it will probably convey to the mind of those familiar with such goods that the parts are easily set in place, that the fitting is easy, and perhaps that the glass is itself set in the sash in a manner where it rides easily without danger of breakage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, and the clerk is' directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. - <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
