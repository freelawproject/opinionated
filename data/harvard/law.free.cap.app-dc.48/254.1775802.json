In it be states that be has an office in tbe city of New York; that be has been admitted to practice in state and Federal courts of many jurisdictions, as well as in tbe Patent Office; that be concluded that tbe same rules would apply in tbis court as apply in connection with tbe filing of briefs in the Patent Office; that on October 10 be was informed that appellants\u2019 brief was due on that day, but at tbe request of local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>counsel representing the affiant the time had been extended by the court for fifteen days; that owing to sickness he was not able to complete the writing of the brief until October 23; that on this date he learned that none of many printing houses in New York to which he had made application would be able to print the brief in time for delivery at the office of the clerk of this court on the 25th; that he then placed his order for the printing of the brief, and that the work thereon was finished on the 30th of October, on which date, he asserts, he forwarded the necessary number of copies to the clerk of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">The briefs have not yet been received by the clerk. No letter informing the clerk that they had been forwarded was sent, nor was any inquiry made of him as to whether or not the briefs had arrived at his office. On October 31, the case was dismissed under the rules, and notice given at once to appellants\u2019 counsel. To this no response was made by him until December 11, when he filed the motion and affidavit we are now considering.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-6\"><em>Mr. J. B. Bowersock </em>and <em>Mr. E. T. Brandenburg </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-7\"><em>Mr. Olios. E.

An attorney of wide experience is not justified in believing that the rules of a lower court or tribunal govern in the appellate court. When counsel discovered that he could not get the briefs printed so as to have them filed within the period allowed by the order of extension, he should have applied at once to this court for an enlargement of the time. lie did not do so, but ignored the order and the rules of the court. No steps whatever .were taken by him to ascertain whether or not the briefs had reached their destination. When he was notified by the clerk that the case had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>dismissed lie took no action, but waited about forty days, and then filed this motion. We have said that the rules of this court are made to be obeyed, and he who disregards them does so at his peril. <em>Re </em>Hitchcock, 47 App. D. C. 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The motion is overruled. <em>Overruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">A motion to reconsider the motion to reinstate the appeal was denied December 28, 1918.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
