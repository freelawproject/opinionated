The rejection is based on the ground of estoppel, in view of a terminated interference in which an earlier application of the appellant, Talbot G. Martin, was'involved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">Interference No. 27,232 involved an application of Goodrum, which eventuated into Patent No. 1,156,475, an application of Martin, other than the one here appealed, an application of Dyson, and a joint application of Lattig- and Goodrum, the latter being substantially a duplicate of the sole application of Goodrum. Martin in his preliminary statement failed to overcome the filing date of the Lattig and Goodrum joint application; but judgment was not rendered against him, as he obtained permission to submit evidence seeking to prove that the Lattig and Goodrum device was inoperative. Judgment in the interference was rendered in favor of Dyson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\">After the termination of the Dyson interference the invention here in question was evidently considered to be the sole, invention of Goodrum, as his application was amended, additional claims were inserted, and a patent issued, No. 1,156,475, October 12, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-7\">Appellant has copied claims 1 to 21, inclusive, of this Good-rum patent, and is seeking \u00e1n interference with this patent. The examiner held that the applicant (appellant) is estopped from making any of these claims, on the ground that they should have been made by Martin during the interference, by a motion under rule 109, to include the present Martin application in the interference. The rejected claims are not supported by the disclosure of the Martin application involved in the Dyson interference, nor by Dyson\u2019s disclosure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-8\">The present application of Martin was filed subsequent to the Martin application involved in the interference, but long before that interference was declared. In the interference, therefore, Martin became aware of the fact that the applications of Goodrum, and Lattig and Goodrum, disclosed and claimed features which were not disclosed in the Martin application involved in the interference, but were disclosed in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Martin application. Martin did not amend Ms present application to embrace claims for such common subject-matter in order to contest an interference at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">The interference so far as Martin is concerned was terminated at the expiration of the limit of appeal from the decision of the Examiner of Interferences in favor of Dyson, Martin taking no appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-6\">The claims of Martin\u2019s application have been rejected, and he appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-7\"><em>Mr. Charles C. Bulhley </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-8\"><em>Mr. Theodore A. Hostetler </em>for the Commissioner of Patents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b217-9\">Mr. Justice McCoy,</author>\n<p id=\"Apm\">of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, who sat with the Court in the hearing- and determination of the appeal in the place of Mr. Justice Nobis, delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The examiner based his decision upon the ground that Martin was estopped by laches to make the claims of the present application, because he failed to move under the rule 109 of the Patent Office to be allowed to amend and bring those claims into the Dyson interference, but that if there were no estoppel by reason of laches he was estopped by the judgment of priority in that interference. The Board of Examiners in Chief and the Commissioner placed their decision entirely on the ground of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">There was no judgment of priority in the Dyson interference in favor of Goodrum against Martin; consequently, there can be no estoppel by judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">Assuming that Martin should have moved under rule 109, his failure to do so is not shown to have resulted in injury to anyone; therefore, one of the elements necessary to an estoppel is absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
