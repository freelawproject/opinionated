Petitioner Oregon Free From Drug Abuse does not oppose the Secretary\u2019s motion. Petitioner Sharvy did not file a response to the Secretary\u2019s motion. We dismiss the petitions to review the ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The Secretary of State requests that this court issue an opinion \u201cexplicitly approving the administrative practice of permitting withdrawal of prospective initiative petitions [before] a ballot title is final.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No party to this proceeding disputes this authority. We assume but do not decide that such authority exists. We need not decide whether the practice at issue is within the Secretary\u2019s authority. There presently exists no controversy concerning the proposed ballot title or the authority of the Secretary to withdraw initiative petitions. There is no \u201cactual and substantial controversy between adverse parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d <em>Brown v.
