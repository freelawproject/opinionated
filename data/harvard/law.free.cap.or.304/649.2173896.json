NO PERSON SHALL BE COMPELLED BY LAW TO EMPLOY ANY MEMBER OF ANY BAR ASSOCIATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cREPEALING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">\u201c9.320 Necessity for employment of attorney; effect of employment. Any action, suit, or proceeding may be prosecuted or defended by a party in person, or by attorney, except that the state or a corporation appears by attorney in all cases, unless otherwise specifically provided by law. Where a party appears by attorney, the written proceedings must be in the name of the attorney, who is the sole representative of his client as between him and the adverse party, except as provided in ORS 9.310.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">\u201c9.160 Practice of law by persons other than active members. Except for the right reserved to litigants by ORS 9.320 to prosecute or defend a cause in person, no person shall practice law or represent himself as qualified to practice law unless he is an active member of the Oregon State Bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">The Attorney General then prepared a draft ballot title for the measure. ORS 250.065(3). Within the time set by ORS 250.067(1), each petitioner submitted written comments upon the draft ballot title. The Attorney General, pursuant to ORS 250.067(2), then certified to the Secretary of State the following revised ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201cALLOWS PERSONS OTHER THAN BAR ASSOCIATION MEMBERS TO PRACTICE LAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><em>\u201cQUESTION: </em>Shall law allow anyone to represent itself in court and forbid any laws requiring persons to employ bar association members?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\"><em>\u201cEXPLANATION: </em>Allows any person, corporation or entity to represent itself in Oregon courts. Forbids any law compelling persons to employ member of bar association. Repeals law which allows persons who are parties in legal proceedings to represent themselves, but which requires state and corporations to be represented in legal proceedings by attorneys. Repeals law which prohibits persons from practicing law or acting as qualified to practice law unless person is active member of Oregon State Bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Thereafter, each petitioner sought a different ballot title in this court. ORS 250.085(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The legislatively prescribed standard for this court in reviewing ballot titles is \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the requirements of ORS 250.035 and 250.039. ORS 250.085(4). This standard was introduced by amendment in 1985.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It corresponds to other 1985 statutory changes which, taken together, indicate a greater role for the Attorney General in certifying ballot titles pursuant to delegated authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">ORS 250.039 requires that a ballot title comply with a readability standard set by the Secretary of State \u201cto the fullest extent practicable consistent with the requirements of impartiality, conciseness and accuracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">ORS 250.035 establishes formal requisites for ballot titles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute mandates three components:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>(1) A <em>caption </em>which reasonably identifies the measure\u2019s <em>subject;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\">(2) A <em>question </em>which plainly phrases the measure\u2019s <em>chief purpose; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">(3) A concise and impartial statement <em>(i.e., </em>an <em>explanation) </em>which summarizes the measure and its <em>major effect.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In part, these requisites were shaped by 1987 legislative amendments. The amendments took effect after the Attorney General certified the ballot title at issue here on September 16, 1987. The Attorney General argues, accordingly, that the title should be reviewed under the law in effect at the time of certification. Although we recognize the movement of the goal posts from the time the Attorney General performed his statutory duty of certification, we conclude that we should use the statutorily-required requisites in effect at the time of our review. This is not a case where we can accommodate both the old law and the new law. <em>See Ellis v. Roberts, </em>300 Or 133, 135 n 2, 707 P2d 1226 (1985). We review, therefore, for substantial compliance with ORS 250.035, as that statute was amended by Oregon Laws 1987, chapter 556, section 1, and Oregon Laws 1987, chapter 875, section 1, both effective September 27,1987, and ORS 250.039.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">I. THE CAPTION (Subject of the Measure)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The proposed measure concerns representation of litigants in court. Its import is to allow anyone to represent himself, herself or itself in an Oregon court. More precisely, the measure aims to repeal restrictions found in ORS 9.320, prohibiting corporations and the state from appearing in court without an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The measure goes further, however. Its subject also is the removal of any requirement for state bar membership to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>practice law in <em>or </em>out of court. The Attorney General correctly identified the subject and thus substantially complied with the statutory requirement. We, therefore, certify the following Caption, modified only to reflect that there is no state bar \u201cassociation\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">ALLOWS PERSONS OTHER THAN STATE BAR MEMBERS TO PRACTICE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">II. THE QUESTION (Chief Purpose of Measure)</p>\n<p id=\"A5l\">ORS 250.035(l)(b) sets forth the requirements for the Question. The statute was amended in 1987 to change the requirement from stating \u201cthe purpose of the measure\u201d to one requiring that the question plainly phrase the measure\u2019s \u201cchief purpose.\u201d Or Laws 1987, ch 556, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\"> Ballot titles have been required to express the \u201cpurpose\u201d of a proposed measure since the people reserved to themselves the initiative and referendum power. <em>See </em>General Laws of Oregon 1907, ch 226, \u00a7 5. This court, however, never has construed specifically the word \u201cpurpose.\u201d \u201cPurpose\u201d does suggest, in a dictionary sense, the end or aim which someone keeps in view as the outcome for which effort is expended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cChief purpose\u201d thus suggests the most significant aim or end which a measure is designed to bring about.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">This still leaves the question, however, how to determine the \u201cchief purpose\u201d of a proposed measure. The legislative history of the bill that enacted the \u201cchief purpose\u201d requirement suggests that it should be determined in a manner analogous to legislation. That is, the proposed measure should be reviewed for its unambiguous language and the context in which it was drafted and for statements made by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>sponsors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Context would include the legal context, as well as the more particular circumstances under which a measure is drafted.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">At present, only the state and corporations are required to appear in court through an attorney. ORS 9.320. Individuals may appear in their own behalf. In his brief to the court, petitioner Wright, the \u201csponsor\u201d of the measure, urges that he proposed the measure \u201cto extend self representation to corporations and other entities the [sic] individual already has the right to self representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">However, the unambiguous language of the measure suggests a dual purpose. First, it aims to allow anyone to appear in court without an attorney. Secondly, it aims to remove any requirement for state bar membership to practice law. Although the statement of the sponsor is limited to the first aspect of the purpose, the inclusion in the measure of the repeal of ORS 9.160 compels the conclusion that the chief purpose has the second aspect noted above. To ignore that aspect of the measure would be to disregard the unambiguous language of the measure. Further, the legal context in which the measure was drafted, in light of the proposed repeal of ORS 9.160, confirms the dual aspect of the chief purpose. Because the Attorney General\u2019s Question does not plainly phrase the chief purpose, we certify the following Question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">Shall law repeal state bar membership requirement to practice law and allow corporations to appear in court without an attorney?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The Question, as modified, disposes of an objection made by petitioner DiLorenzo: That the Attorney General\u2019s Question incorrectly suggests that current law prohibits individuals from representing themselves in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>III. THE EXPLANATION (Summary and Major Effect)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The 1987 Legislative Assembly made a significant change in ORS 250.035(l)(c), by requiring the explanation henceforth to summarize the measure\u2019s \u201cmajor effect.\u201d <em>See </em>Or Laws 1987, ch 875, \u00a7 1. Ballot titles previously never had been required to set forth a measure\u2019s \u201ceffect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">This legislative reversal also marked a departure from this court\u2019s earlier pronouncements that statements about the effects of proposed measures do not have a place in ballot titles. <em>See ACLU v. Paulus, </em>282 Or 539, 544, 580 P2d 168 (1978); <em>Crabtree v. Paulus, </em>296 Or 325, 327, 675 P2d 488 (1984). One consequence of the change is that Questions and Explanations may not necessarily resemble one another because \u201cchief purpose\u201d and \u201cmajor effect\u201d may not, for a given measure, be the same.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The proposed measure here, if approved by the electorate, would allow corporations and \u201cother entities\u201d to appear in court without an attorney. Because corporations and at least some \u201cother entities\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> may appear in court only through a representative, the clear import of this change is to allow, by statute, non-attorneys to appear in court representing corporations and \u201cother entities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The proposed measure also, however, prohibits persons from being \u201ccompelled by law to employ any member of any bar association.\u201d Current law does not require, of course, anyone to use an attorney for a legal matter of any kind, with one exception. That exception requires corporations and the state to appear in court through an attorney. ORS 9.320.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Current law does prohibit, however, the rendition of legal services to others by one not a member of the Oregon State Bar. ORS 9.160. The measure repeals this prohibition, and it is this repeal which constitutes the measure\u2019s major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>effect. The proposed measure thus goes beyond allowing corporations and \u201cother entities\u201d to appear in court without an attorney; it also removes the requirement for state bar membership to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s Explanation attempts, but fails, to convey the major effect in the proposed second sentence in the certified ballot title. In addition, the Explanation fails, in part, to summarize the measure because the first sentence is over-inclusive: \u201cPersons\u201d already have the right to represent themselves in court* and the proposed measure in no way changes that. We therefore certify the following Explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">Repeals law requiring state bar membership to practice law. Allows corporations, the state or other entities to appear in court without an attorney. Does so by repealing law which allows persons who are parties in legal proceedings to represent themselves, but which requires the state and corporations to be represented in legal proceedings by attorneys, and repealing law which prohibits persons from practicing law or acting as qualified to practice law unless person is active member of Oregon State Bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The Explanation, as modified, disposes of the objections made to the Attorney General\u2019s Explanation by petitioner DiLorenzo. Petitioner DiLorenzo contends that the Attorney General\u2019s Explanation impermissibly suggests that current law requires individuals: (1) To employ state bar members for legal matters outside court; and (2) To pay for legal services. Neither is suggested by the modified Explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Petitioner DiLorenzo also urges that the ballot title should convey the requirements for Oregon State Bar membership. We do not agree that the ballot title should convey this information, because such amounts more to an argument on the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In summary, we certify the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">ALLOWS PERSONS OTHER THAN STATE BAR MEMBERS TO PRACTICE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\"><em>QUESTION: </em>Shall law repeal state bar membership requirement to practice law and allow corporations to appear in court without an attorney?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>EXPLANATION: </em>Repeals law requiring state bar membership to practice law.
