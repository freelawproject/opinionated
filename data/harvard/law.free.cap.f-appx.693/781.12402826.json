Bacharach Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A2t\">Mr. Charles Henderson, Jr. pleaded guilty in federal court on drug charges and was sentenced to 129 months in prison. After unsuccessfully moving to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Mr. Henderson seeks a certificate of appeala-bility so that he can appeal. We deny Mr. Henderson\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"ach-dedup-0\">Mr. Henderson can appeal only if we issue a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). This certificate is available only if an applicant can make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This showing has been made only if reasonable jurists, could debate the merits of Mr. Henderson\u2019s appeal. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">Mr. Henderson argues that the district court improperly dismissed his claim of ineffective assistance. For this claim, Mr. Henderson had to show that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2062, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court rejected Mr. Henderson\u2019s claim, concluding that his attorney\u2019s efforts were reasonable and did not prejudice Mr. Henderson\u2019s sentencing. For substantially the same reasons discussed by the district court, we conclude that its ruling is not subject to reasonable debate. Thus, we decline to issue a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
