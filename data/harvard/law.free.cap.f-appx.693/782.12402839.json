Lucero Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ay9z-dedup-0\">Cedric Greene, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint against the Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct (\u201cthe Board\u201d). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A2H0\">In February 2017, Greene filed a complaint with the Board against a state court judge who had previously dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Greene\u2019s civil lawsuit. Greene then sued the Board in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, challenging its decision. The district court appropriately dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Greene does not argue that diversity jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). His only asserted basis for federal question jurisdiction is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which is a criminal statute that does not confer jurisdiction in this civil lawsuit. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; Clements v. Chapman, 189 Fed.Appx. 688, 690, 692 (10th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (section 1001 does not provide for private cause of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Adqc\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G), The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
