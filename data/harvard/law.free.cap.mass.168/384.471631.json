S. Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Sts. \u00a7 5044; that the assignees took possession of the property and petitioned the court for leave to sell the equities in the real estate of the debtors; that on December 27, 1878, pursuant to an order of the court, the assignees sold and conveyed to the petitioner by a deed of release all the equity in this property; and that, on December 26, 1876, and prior to his bankruptcy, the petitioner wrote a letter to the respondent, a copy of which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">\u201c Boston, Dec. 26, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\">\u201c Mr. Graves, \u2014 Your letter was duly received, and you can rest assured that I am not forgetting you, but the business has been so hard that I could not get a dollar under any circumstances to give you. I have tried out of all the things I have to mortgage, sell, or do any way to make a raise to pay you as I have actually felt bad, hurt, and really ashamed to think I could not do something for you, and it has been just as much as we could possibly do to keep our business from going to the deuce or some worse place for the past 9 months, failures, losses and slow pay have cramped us up so close that it has actually been impossible to make any move of a personal nature in the way of fixing anything, but if you will keep still and give me time I will swing something into line for you one of these days, and I hope not so far distant as you would say would be no good. I think during the next summer I can make a real estate trade to help me out. Yours truly, N. Y. Brintnall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-7\">\u201c I will call and see you if it will do you any good, or if you have anything to say of importance; if not I don\u2019t want to talk about it till I can do something.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\">The master further found that, previous to the bankruptcy of the petitioner\u2019s firm, it had bought merchandise of the firm of O. H. Graves and Sons, of which the respondent was a member, but that when the above letter was written the petitioner\u2019s firfn was not indebted to the respondent, nor to his firm, nor was the petitioner personally indebted to the respondent\u2019s firm, and that the letter referred to the personal indebtedness of the petitioner to the respondent existing when the mortgage was given; and that the petitioner had paid nothing on account of the debt secured by the mortgage, and had not since it was given recognized its existence as a valid mortgage, unless the foregoing letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>and the acceptance of the deed of release from his assignees in bankruptcy were such a recognition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">Hearing upon the master\u2019s report, before <em>Holmes, </em>J., who dismissed the petition, and, at the request of the petitioner, reported the case for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-6\"><em>C.

The petitioner\u2019s purpose, or one of his purposes, in making it was to defraud his creditors. The master has found that he was then indebted to the respondent in a sum less than sixteen hundred dollars, and that the respondent took and has since held the mortgage as security for the amount actually due him. Perhaps it is immaterial in this case, but it does not appear that the respondent participated in the petitioner\u2019s fraudulent purpose. The master has found that the mortgage is valid for the amount for which it was taken, and that no part of that amount has been paid. The petition is brought under St. 1882, c. 237, to obtain a decree which shall operate as a bar to the respondent\u2019s claim under the mortgage. We have no occasion to determine whether the court could properly enter such a decree as the petitioner prays for in any case in which it appeared that there was a valid mortgage, the condition of which had not been performed. There is much force in the argument that the object of the statute is merely to provide for the removal of a cloud from the record title of the real estate, when it is encumbered by an undischarged mortgage which is not shown to be in force, and which has not been recognized by the mortgagor by payment or otherwise within twenty years after the time limited in it for the full performance of the conditions thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">It is enougli for the decision of the present case that the petitioner wrote a letter within twenty years prior to the filing of the petition, which was an act in recognition of the mortgage. The master found that the letter referred to the personal indebtedness of the petitioner to the respondent, which was secured by the mortgage. In the letter the petitioner makes many apologies for his failure to pay anything on it, and promises, if he can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>have time, to do something towards the payment of it. \u2022 The recognition by a mortgagor of an indebtedness known to be secured by a valid mortgage, unaccompanied by any objection to the mortgage, is a recognition of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The master\u2019s report, as we understand it, shows another act within twenty years in recognition of the mortgage. The petitioner and his copartners became bankrupts in November, 1877, and all of their estate, real and personal, passed to their assignees under the provisions of U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7 5044. A part of this property was the petitioner\u2019s right in equity to redeem this mortgage. The assignees took possession of the property and petitioned the court for leave to sell the equities in the real estate of \"the debtors. They sold the equity in this property to the petitioner by a deed of release. Their treatment of this as an equity of redemption in their petition for an order of sale, and their sale in pursuance of the order, must be assumed to have been in accordance with their real title, as found by the master and shown by the record in the registry of deeds. Their possession, petition for an order of sale, and sale, were all within twenty years prior to the filing of the petition, and their action was <em>prima fade </em>a recognition of this mortgage. The entry must therefore be,</p>\n<p id=\"ABWQ\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
