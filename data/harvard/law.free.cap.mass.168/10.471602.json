But on reading the stenographer\u2019s report of the evidence, it was found that he had not so testified. Thereupon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney asked to reopen the case, and place the plaintiff upon the stand, for the reason that the attorney had misunderstood the answer. The judge refused the request, and the plaintiff excepted. At the request of the defendant, the judge directed a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-4\">P. <em>B. Runyan, </em>for the plaintiff, submitted the case on a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-5\"><em>W. B.

Assuming this to be so, it is quite plain that Hadley was not exercising superintendence, but was merely acting as motor man, or as a fellow servant of the plaintiff. There was no evidence tending to show that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was received by reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer, intrusted with and exercising superintendence, whose sole or principal duty was that of superintendence, as required by St. 1887, c. 270, \u00a7 1, cl. 2. <em>Cashman </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>156 Mass. 342. <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>156 Mass. 293. <em>Adasken </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>165 Mass. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">It was within the discretion of the court to decline to reopen the case for further examination of the witness. The matter sought to be inquired about was immaterial, upon the real question in the case. u</p>\n<p id=\"A-i\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
