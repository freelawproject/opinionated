I consider my services something, and yet I don\u2019t think they are anything compared to hers, \u2014 what hers used to be in running a house or a saloon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>What is the market value of a house ? \" <em>A. </em>What you can make out of it. If you are not capable of running it, you can\u2019t make anything out of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-9\">\u201c Q. No; I mean a piece of real estate independent of anybody to run it. <em>A. </em>I don\u2019t think I understand your question at all. I have answered it the best I could, but the market value of anything is what you make of it, is n\u2019t it, and what you can get out of it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-10\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Is that your idea ? <em>A. </em>It is; I think if you take a house and you are not capable of running it, and don\u2019t make anything out of it, it is not worth anything; and if you take it and make a success, it is what I should call the market value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-11\"><em>UQ. </em>Then your idea of market value is the result ? <em>A. </em>Is the capability that you have of running a place and taking care of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-12\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>That is your idea of market value ? <em>A. </em>That is the nearest I can come to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-13\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>That is what you mean by your testimony when you talk about the market value of Mrs. Harmon\u2019s services, is n\u2019t it ? <em>A. </em>It is; that is what I mean.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-14\">At the end of the cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked that this witness\u2019s testimony be stricken out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked the witness :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">\u201c Mrs. Stimson, will you disassociate any idea of Mrs. Harmon and her services from your mind, and answer this question to me: What, if I inquire of you the market value of something, whether it is the bag you have in your hand, or the gloves that you have on your hands, or potatoes in the market, or meat, or what not, what do you understand by those words \u2018 market value\u2019? does that convey something to your mind ? <em>A. </em>Why, all it conveys to my mind, the market value of anything is what it will fetch.\u201d The witness was further asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">\u201c Mrs. Stimson, when you are testifying as to the value of Mrs. Harmon\u2019s services, whether or not you have in mind the sum which they will fetch in the market, \u2014 whether or not you have that in your mind when you testify to their value ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">The defendant objected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-8\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Or what her services would command in the labor market? <em>A. </em>Why, the question was asked me what they would command, and I said \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-9\"><em>liQ. </em>No, no. Do you have that element in your mind of what they will bring ? <em>A. </em>Why, yes, I do; what they would bring; what my own would or Mrs. Harmon\u2019s.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-10\">The judge allowed the evidence to stand, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-11\">Eugene Fellner, called by the plaintiff, having testified that he was twenty-eight years old, was engaged in the restaurant business in Boston,-and had had for several years the whole charge of the three Fellner restaurants in Boston, employing all the help, and managing the entire business, and that he knew the market value of the services of a person who was capable of managing a restaurant, was then asked the following question : \u201cAssuming that a woman is fifty-one years of age, that she has been engaged practically in keeping a restaurant and a boarding house for twenty-five years, with perhaps some slight intervals, \u2014 but for the most part of the time for twenty-five years, \u2014 and that she has kept such restaurants and boarding houses here in Boston, on Columbus Avenue and at 52 South Market Street; and assuming further that she is a woman who Chas the physical and mental capacity to manage and control a restaurant where there are from two hundred to four hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>patrons that take their meals in a day, and three boarding houses where there are from eighty to one hundred people; assuming that she is a first-class cook, that she understands pastry cooking and meat cooking, and that furthermore she has the capacity to take charge of help, both in the hiring and the managing of the help necessary to a restaurant or a boarding house; assuming further that she is a person of tact and pleasant disposition, so that she has the good will of a large number of patrons; \u2014 I wish you to state to the jury what the services of such a person, what the fair market value of the services of such a person as I have described would be ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">There was evidence from which the jury would be authorized in finding that the particulars stated in this question were true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">To the substance of this question, the defendant objected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">The judge allowed it to be put, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">The witness answered, \u201c I should say that they would be worth about $60 a week.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">The jury' found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-9\"><em>O. E. Choate, Jr., </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-10\"><em>A. A. Strout $ Gr. E. Smith, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-11\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN7\">The only ground relied on in support of the exceptions is that it was not competent for the plaintiff to show what her services would have been worth in the market to other persons. Upon reading the bill of exceptions we should hardly suppose that this question was presented or ruled on at the trial; but, if it was, we are of opinion that the evidence was competent. The instructions of the court as to the rule of damages are not stated, and no exception was taken to them. But if the plaintiff\u2019s services had a market value, in the kind of business in which she was engaged, such market value might be proved to the jury as a fact which they might take into consideration in determining the amount of damages to be awarded to her, although she had not actually worked for others, but was engaged in business on her own account. See <em>Matteson </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad, </em>35 N. Y. 487, 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
