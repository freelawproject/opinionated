At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Fessenden, </em>J., the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions. The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-10\"><em>T. Hunt F. P. Sears, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-11\"><em>W. D. Turner, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b478-12\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvV\">The jury found, in answer to a question from the judge, that the snow and ice were on the steps of a car before it left Rockport. The real questions raised by the exceptions are whether there was any evidence which warranted this finding, and if so, whether it warranted the conclusion that the defendant was liable for not having cleared the step. A ruling was asked to the effect that a railroad company is not bound to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>keep an exposed platform clear while <em>in transitu </em>during a storm, and the jury were instructed that there was no rule of law which absolutely requires it, but that it was for them to say what was reasonable. Considering the evidence as to the middle brakeman\u2019s duty,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we are not prepared to say that there was error in the instructions as applied to a local passenger train; but this we need not decide, as the verdict of the jury went on a different view of the facts. If the snow and ice upon which the plaintiff slipped were on the step before the train started, there is no need to consider what the defendant\u2019s duties would have been if they had accumulated during the passage of the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">We cannot say that the jury were not warranted in their finding. There was evidence of a snow storm, which lasted all day in Salem and most of the day in Boston. It is not unfair to infer that so persistent a storm extended to Rockport. There was evidence that it stopped snowing in Boston at nine in the evening, and that it was not snowing at Salem a little over half an hour later, when the plaintiff left a concert there and took the train. The snow was hard, as if it had been there some time. If this evidence was believed, it was a possible inference that the snow was on the step before the train started. If so, and if it was in such a condition that it was likely that some one would slip upon it, the jury were warranted in finding that the condition ought to have been remedied at the earliest practicable moment. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>New York Elevated </em>Railroad, 73 N. Y. 595. <em>Neslie </em>v. <em>Second &amp; Third Streets Passenger </em>Railway, 113 Penn. St. 300. See <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Bangor Steamship Co. </em>148 Mass. 207. The cases of <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Co. </em>111 N. Y. 488, and <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Manhattan </em>Railway, 112 N. Y. 443, are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u2022 The question of the plaintiff\u2019s care was for the jury.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> She may have had no reason to expect ice on the steps, and she fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>at the same instant that her daughter warned her. <em>Fleck </em>v. <em>Union Railway, </em>184 Mass. 480. <em>Bethmann </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>155 Mass. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"A-g5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> The conductor of the train testified that he carried brooms on the train for the purpose of removing snow ; that it was the duty of the middle brakeman to sweep the platform with a broom; and that he should have swept it on the way to Boston.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> The plaintiff testified on this point as follows: <em>\u201c </em>When we reached Boston my two daughters preceded me in going out of the car. When I got to the door and to the steps, of course I saw the condition of the steps; then my daughter, my eldest daughter, who was the second to alight, said to me, \u2018 Be careful, mother,\u2019 and 1 went down.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
