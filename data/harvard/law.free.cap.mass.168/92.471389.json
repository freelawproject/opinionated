Packard, Lilian F. Packard, and Frances B. Packard, for a jury to assess the damages caused by the taking by the respondent of the petitioners\u2019 land in Brockton, and also the damages alleged to have been caused by such taking to the petitioners\u2019 adjoining land. Trial in the Superior Court, before Braley, J., who reported the case for the determination of this court, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-3\">It appeared that the land taken, together with the land adjoining it, was owned in fee by Charles Packard prior to December 20,1848, and formed a part of his cultivated farm; that Charles Packard died in 1851, and left his son, Charles T. Packard, as his sole surviving heir; and that Charles T. Packard died in 1874, and left as sole surviving heirs his children, Franklin A. Packard and Lilian F. Packard, and his widow, Frances B. Packard, the present petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-4\">On December 20, 1848, Charles Packard executed a deed of the land in question, which recited that, \u201c in consideration of two hundred and twenty dollars, paid by Sidney Perkins, Hiram Atherton, and L. F. Charles Loomis, ... a committee of and in behalf of Village Cemetery, a corporation,\u201d the grantor conveyed \u201c to the said Perkins, Atherton, and Loomis, for the use and behoof of said corporation, a lot of land . . . containing seven acres more or less, in which two acres lying in the northwesterly part are the free and unqualified gift of the said Charles Packard \u201d; that the granted premises were to be held \u201c in behalf of the said corporation, to their use and behoof forever \u201d; that they were free from all encumbrances, \u201c except that the ground shall never be used for other purposes than as a cemetery\u201d ; and that the grantor would warrant and defend the same to the grantees \u201cin behalf of the said corporation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">The petitioner Franklin A. Packard testified, in substance, that his father, Charles T. Packard, went upon the premises at various times between 1863 and 1867, fixed the fence, broke off twigs, tossed off stones \u201cand such things as that to make the land more presentable \u201d; that the witness went upon the land in 1879, 1880, and 1883, claiming it as his \u201cmentally\u201d and believing that he owned it, and cleared away any obstructions there, such as broken bottles and glass, and fixed up the fences; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>that all this time the land had been used as a cemetery; that he knew of the \u201c Village Cemetery \u201d; and that, in 1883, under the advice of counsel, he notified the \u201c Village Cemetery \u201d that he claimed the land as his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-3\">The respondent, against the objection and subject to the exception of the petitioners, introduced in evidence the record book and the account book of the \u201c Village Cemetery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-4\">The petitioners objected to these books as incompetent and immaterial, but admitted that they were the books of the association claiming to be incorporated under the name of the \u201c Village Cemetery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">From the record book it appeared that on February 5,1848, eleven men desirous of organizing themselves as a corporation to procure a cemetery under the act of March 17, 1841, signed a petition to a justice of the peace to issue a warrant to one of them to call a meeting of the subscribers on February 16, to adopt by-laws and such other measures as might be necessary to accomplish the proposed object of procuring a cemetery; that the justice issued his warrant to this effect to Edward S. Packard, who made his return thereon February 9; and that on February 16 a meeting was held, at which a secretary, president, and treasurer were chosen, and a committee appointed to draft a constitution and by-laws; but there was no record of the number present. Subsequently, and at varying intervals up to April 20, 1854, sixteen meetings were held, at one of which, on October 31, 1848, the name was chosen of \u201c Village Cemetery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">On February 20, 1883, a justice of the peace directed Amasa Edson \u201c to notify and warn all the proprietors of \u2018 Village Cemetery,\u2019 so called, to meet \u201d on March 8, at a place named, \u201c for the purpose of forming themselves into a corporation, then and there to act on the following articles, to wit: 1st. To choose a secretary. 2d. To choose all other necessary officers for said corporation. 3d. To adopt by-laws for said corporation. 4th. To prescribe the method of calling future meetings \u201d; and Edson made due return of the warrant on March 7, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-7\">A meeting was held on March 8, 1883, and, a communication of the Packard heirs being read, the president was authorized to obtain counsel. On March 22, 1883, another meeting was held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>and, after a discussion as to the title to the premises, H. A. Ford was authorized to take legal advice, and a request was sent to the register of deeds to send a copy of the deed of the land. The next meeting was on April 27, 1883, when authority was given Ford to take further legal advice. The next meeting was on May 25,1883, when the legality of the original corporation was called into question on the ground of the number of members present at the first meeting, and the secretary was authorized to take legal counsel. The next meeting was on June 29, 1883, when a report was read that, after the advice of counsel being taken, there was a possibility that an insufficient number was present at the first meeting. The next meeting was held on August 7, 1883, when it was suggested that the Legislature be petitioned to re-establish the corporation. . Another meeting was held on November 6,1883, but nothing was done. The last meeting was held on December 18, 1883, when nothing was done, except to vote an adjournment to the first Tuesday in September, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-20\">The records also showed that deeds of twenty-nine burial lots were given from 1849 to 1854. * Thaddeus E. Gifford, a witness called by the respondent, testified that he had known of this land being used as a cemetery for over forty years, and gave the names of various persons, including Charles Packard, who he knew had been buried there; and that he obtained the books of the \u201c Village Cemetery \u201d from the widow of Henry M. Little-field, the last secretary of the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-21\">The judge ruled that the petitioners had not shown any right or title in the land, the taking of which would entitle them to recover any damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-22\">If, upon the evidence reported, the petitioners have any right or title in the land upon which they are entitled to have damages assessed, the cause was to be remanded for such assessment; otherwise, the petition was to be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-23\"><em>S. JJ. Shepard, </em>for the petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-24\"><em>J. H. Benton, Jr., </em>for the respondent, submitted the case on a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-25\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5s\">The petitioners contend that the deed by their ancestor was governed by the statute of uses, and that there was no legally existing cemetery corporation, and therefore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>deed was ineffectual for want of an existing <em>cestui que use; </em>or, if otherwise, that at any rate it conveyed no more than a life estate, leaving a reversion in the grantor\u2019s heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">The deed on its face shows a clear intention that the estate granted should not be limited to the lives of the three persons named as grantees. The purpose was that the land granted should be used for burial purposes by the corporation called the \u201c Village Cemetery.\u201d Though the word \u201c heirs \u201d is not found in the habendum, it is recited that the granted premises are to be held, \u201c in behalf of the said corporation, to their use and behoof forever.\u201d In the covenant against encumbrances, a provision is inserted, \u201c except that the ground shall never be used for other purposes than as a cemetery.\u201d In the granting part of the deed it is also stated that two acres are the free and unqualified gift of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">It is well settled that deeds are to be so construed as to give effect to them according to the intention of the parties where that is possible; and a conveyance may always be construed to be of that kind or species which may be necessary in order to vest the title according to that intention, if such interpretation is not repugnant to the terms of the grant. <em>Jamaica Pond Aqueduct </em>v. Chandler, 9 Allen, 159, 167. <em>Chenery </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>97 Mass. 77, 86. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>157 Mass. 576. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Southworth, </em>164 Mass. 52. Crocker\u2019s Notes on Common Forms, 2. It being plain that this deed was intended to be for the benefit and use of the Village Cemetery corporation, it is to be construed as a deed in trust for that corporation. No particular words are required to create a trust. The absence of the words \u201c in trust,\u201d or \u201c trustees,\u201d does not negative a trust. 2 Washb. Real Prop. (5th ed.) 547. Lewin on Trusts, (7th ed.) 98,118. And as the purposes of the trust require a legal estate in the trustees for a period beyond their own lives, they will take a fee though no words of limitation to heirs were used. <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Hallett, </em>6 Cush. 403. <em>Easterbrooks </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>5 Gray, 17. <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>138 Mass. 301. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Colt, </em>5 Wall. 119, 168. 2 Washb. Real Prop. (5th ed.) 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The petitioners, however, contend that the Village Cemetery was never legally organized as a corporation, and that therefore the deed was ineffectual to convey any title. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>can, however, be no doubt that the Village Cemetery was a cor-<em>dc </em>facto, and as the petitioners\u2019 grantor acted on the assumption that it was a corporation, and so described it, and received money which probably came from its funds as the consideration of the deed, it is at least doubtful if it is now open to the petitioners to deny the due and legal organization of the Village Cemetery as a corporation. But it is not necessary to rest upon this ground, as there is sufficient evidence that it was legally organized.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The chief objection to the regularity of its organization rests on the ground that the records do not show in express terms that ten persons were present at the first meeting. By St. 1841, c. 114, \u00a7 1, under which the action was had, \u201c Any ten or more persons may organize as a corporation for the purpose of procuring, establishing, and preparing a cemetery or burial place for the dead, in the same manner that religious societies are authorized to organize by the provisions of the twentieth chapter of the Revised Statutes.\u201d Section 2 provides that, \u201c when such persons are organized as aforesaid, they shall become a corporation,\u201d etc. Referring now to the Revised Statutes, c. 20, we find the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">\u201c Sect. 26. Any parish, which, from the want of officers, or any other cause, may be unable to assemble in the usual manner, and any religious society that is not incorporated, provided they contain respectively ten or more qualified voters, may organize themselves as a corporation, in the manner and for the purposes expressed in the following sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">\u201cSect. 27. Any justice of the peace for the county in which such parish or religious society may be, upon application in writing by any five or more of the qualified voters thereof, may issue his warrant for calling a meeting of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">\u201c Sect. 28. The warrant shall state the objects of the meeting, and shall be directed to some one of the applicants therefor, requiring him to warn the qualified voters of the parish or society to meet at such time and place as shall be appointed in the warrant; and upon due return thereof the same justice, or any other justice of the peace for the county, may preside at such meeting, for the choice and qualification of a clerk, who shall enter at large upon the records of the parish or society the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ceedings had in the organization thereof; and the parish or society may thereupon proceed to choose a moderator, and to do all such other things as parishes are by law authorized to do at their annual meetings. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\">\u201c Sect. 29. Every parish and religious society, organized as provided in the three preceding sections, shall become a corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">It will be seen that there is no provision in the statutes requiring the presence of any particular number of persons at the first meeting. Eleven persons signed the application, and thus expressed their wish and intention to be members of the corporation. This was, a proceeding analogous to the signing of the articles of agreement, which was deemed essential in the case mostly relied on by the petitioners. <em>Utley </em>v. <em>Union Tool Co. </em>11 Gray, 139. Having done this, it was not necessary that all should attend the first meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Moreover, even if it were necessary for ten to be present, there would be a presumption that this requirement had been \u2022complied with. The presumption of regularity extends to the proceedings in the organization of corporations. In <em>Narragansett Bank </em>v. <em>Atlantic Silk Co. </em>3 Met. 282, 287, it was said: \u201c The maxim of law is, that all things shall be presumed to have been rightly and correctly done, until the contrary is proved. 'This maxim is stated and explained, and many instances given \u25a0of its application to corporations, and to acts and doings of their \u2022members, officers, and agents, in <em>Bank of United States </em>v. <em>Dandridge, </em>12 Wheat. 64, 70. As the corporation could not proceed lawfully until duly organized, and as they did proceed to act as a corporation, this presumption has its effect.\u201d This doctrine is often applied, and it is to be assumed that ten persons were present at the first meeting, if that number was necessary. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>First Parish in </em>Townsend, 109 Mass. 263. <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Grover, </em>136 Mass. 115. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>143 Mass. 84. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Woelper, 3 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 29. <em>Grays </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Salem Turnpike Co. </em>4 Rand. 578. <em>Lauderdale Peerage, </em>10 App. Cas. 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The petitioners also contend that, if any title passed by the deed, the corporation has lapsed, and upon such lapse mere possession in the petitioners is sufficient, \u2014 meaning, we suppose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>sufficient to show title in them. No authority is cited in support of this proposition, and we are aware of none which supports it. The case does not fall within the doctrine that when the purposes of a trust have failed, or have been completely performed, the trustees then hold the estate for the benefit of the heirs at law, as a resulting trust, and are answerable to them for it upon proper proceedings. <em>Packard </em>v. Marshall, 138 Mass. 301. <em>Easterbrooks </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>5 Gray, 17. The purposes of this trust have not failed, and have not been completely performed. The records show that deeds of twenty-nine burial lots were given from 1849 to 1854, interments were made, and the land had not ceased to be used as a cemetery. The corporation was not dissolved by the omission to choose officers, and to hold meetings; nor would the title to the land revest in the original grantor, without some due proceedings had for that purpose. <em>Boston Glass Manufactory </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>24 Pick. 49. <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>7 Gray, 113, 119. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Ship Canal Co. </em>137 Mass. 71. The trustees were the proper parties to bring this petition. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Charles River Branch Railroad, </em>11 Cush. 506. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>110 Mass. 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">The records of the corporation were competent evidence. <em>King </em>v. <em>Little, </em>1 Cush. 436. This indeed is not now controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">In the recent case of <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Grimshaw, </em>165 U. S. 342, which bears a resemblance to the present case in some of its aspects, a resulting trust in favor of the grantor and his heirs was declared to exist. But in that case the society which for a time maintained the burial ground was not incorporated, and it was practically dissolved and extinct, and the land had ceased to be used for burial purposes, the bodies all having been ex-burned and removed to other cemeteries.</p>\n<p id=\"AOI\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
