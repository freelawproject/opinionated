Whereby the plaintiff was severely injured, made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>sick, put to great expense and loss of time, and whereby his bicycle was demolished.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">The defendant demurred to the declaration, assigning as grounds therefor that it set forth no cause of action in law against the defendant; that it nowhere averred that the alleged injuries were incurred by reason of any fault or negligence or tortious act of the defendant, or for which the defendant was liable; that it nowhere averred that the alleged servant of the defendant was engaged at the time upon the defendant\u2019s business ; and that, if it stated any cause of action, it joined in one count two separate and distinct grounds of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">Not waiving the demurrer, the defendant filed an answer setting up a general denial and want of due care on the part of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">In the Superior Court the demurrer was overruled, and the plaintiff appealed. Trial before Blodgett, J., who, in instructing the jury on the matter of damages, ruled, among other things, that, if the plaintiff was entitled to recover at all, he was entitled to compensation for the wages actually lost by him through his inability to work at his trade on account of the injuries sustained by him through the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servant. To this ruling the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-9\"><em>J.

The meaning of the declaration is plain and sufficient. Nowadays we do not require pleadings to be guarded against all the possible distortions of perverse ingenuity. The single collision which caused the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s person and to his bicycle was one cause of action. <em>\u201c </em>Un trespasse ne serra mye deux foitz puny.\u201d Y. B. 5 Ed. II. 134, 135. <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>147 Mass. 342, 344. <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>160 Mass. 447, 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">The ruling as to damages was correct. It is true that, when a man is allowed to prove his average earnings or the wages actually lost by him, they are proved as a measure of the value of the time and power to labor of which he has been deprived, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>as themselves recoverable <em>eo nomine. </em>But the distinction does not appear to be material in this case. There is nothing to show that the wages were not reasonable, and a proper measure of the value of the plaintiff\u2019s time. It is argued for the defendant, that the true measure is the market value of the average wages of a man of the plaintiff\u2019s average capacity working in the same employment. But the eases cited do not sustain the position, and there are many decisions adopting the test of the individual\u2019s experience. If any distinctions in- the value of men\u2019s time are admitted there is no reason why the whole actual difference should not be recognized. To this extent a tortfeasor takes the risk of the value of what he destroys. <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>New York &amp; Boston Despatch Express Co. </em>167 Mass. 549, and cases cited.
