The written agreement signed by the defendant was virtually a promise to pay to such person or persons as should be fixed at a meeting of the subscribers. This promise was at the outset an offer, but when steps were taken in pursuance of Article 2, and a plan was fixed and determined as therein provided, and the plaintiffs were chosen trustees, they became the promisees : and when they proceeded to erect a building in reliance upon the subscriptions of the defendant and others, and before any withdrawal or retraction by him, that supplied a good consideration, and the promise became valid and binding in law. <em>Athol Music Hall Co. </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>116 Mass. 471. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Smith American Organ Co. </em>117 Mass. 456. <em>Cottage Street Church </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>121 Mass. 528. <em>Hudson Real Estate Co. </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>156 Mass. 82; <em>S.
