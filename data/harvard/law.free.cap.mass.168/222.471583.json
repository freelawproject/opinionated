Sts. c. 202, \u00a7 26, which cannot be supported in its full extent, is not wholly invalid, but the defendant may properly be sentenced for an assault and battery, which is well charged in the indictment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\">Motion in arrest of judgment upon a verdict rendered at the trial of an indictment under Pub. Sts. e. 202, \u00a7 26. After the former decision, reported 167 Mass. 434, ordering the defendants to be sentenced for the offence of assault and battery, they moved in the Superior Court that the judgment be arrested for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-10\">\u201c 1. The indictment never properly charged the full offence under Pub. Sts. c. 202, \u00a7 26, confining with intent, etc., and the defendants were not acquitted of that offence, as the verdict of the jury would not constitute a good plea of <em>\u2018 </em>autrefoit acquit \u2019 in another trial of the same indictment for the same crime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-11\">\u201c 2. Since the only offence well charged in the indictment is assault and battery, it is obvious that they could never have been legally convicted of the full offence under Pub. Sts. c. 202, \u00a7 26, and that being so, they were never acquitted of the full offence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-12\">\u201c 3. The verdict of the jury cannot be severed into different parts, and the verdict as to Crowley and Green must be taken as a clear acquittal of everything well charged in the indictment, and the verdict as to the second and third counts are ineffective and are dehors the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-13\">\u201c 4. The crime of confining was not well charged in the indictment, and the verdict of \u2018 Not guilty,\u2019 first count, must be construed to be an acquittal of everything contained in the indictment, as a verdict of \u2018 Not guilty \u2019 cannot be severed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-14\">\u201c 5. By the ordering of a sentence of simple assault and battery, and thereby eliminating the s assault with intent to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>larceny \u2019 from the verdict, the verdict in this case is vacated, and the court on the record has no right or authority to sentence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">\u201c 6. The verdict of the jury is repugnant, inconsistent, ambiguous, and defective in every particular, and no judgment or sentence can be rendered upon it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">This motion was overruled; and the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-7\"><em>F. F. Sullivan J. M. Sullivan, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-8\"><em>J. T&gt;. </em>McLaughlin, Second Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b247-9\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHU\">The defendants rely, in support of their new motion in arrest of judgment, upon <em>Crain </em>v. <em>United States, </em>162 U. S. 625; but we find nothing in that decision which touches the objections presented by the present motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">We heretofore held that the verdict was properly received and recorded. The defendants were not convicted of the full offence with which they were charged, and the verdict of guilty which was rendered could not be supported in its full extent; but it included a smaller offence which was well charged, and for which they might properly be sentenced under the indictment. The verdict was not wholly invalid, because it included the element of an intent to commit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The other objections now taken are covered by the former decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajj\"><em>Motion in arrest rightly </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
