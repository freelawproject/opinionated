Howe. She died before her husband, and he, never having consented to the will, waived its provisions. They had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>no children. The respondent contends that, as they had had no issue born alive, William J. Howe was cut off by the will from everything but a life estate in one half of his wife\u2019s lands. By Pub. Sts. c. 147, \u00a7 6, as amended by St. 1885, c. 255, \u00a7 1, a married woman may make a will as- if sole, except that without her husband\u2019s written consent the will is not to deprive him of his curtesy or his statutory life estate, or by the further amendment of St. 1887, c. 290, \u00a7 2, \u201cof her real estate not exceeding five thousand dollars in value, when no issue survives her.\u201d The argument is that the word \u201c survives \u201d imports that issue must have been born, although it does not live beyond its parent, and then this interpretation of the act of 1887 is applied to Pub. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 1, by which the right to the five thousand dollars\u2019 worth of land is created, in order to determine in what cases that right is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The trouble with the argument is that it begins at the wrong end. The saving clause of the later act of 1887 must be construed by the earlier act creating the right which is saved, not the earlier by the later. By Pub. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1887, c. 290, \u00a7 1, \u201c If she dies and leaves no issue living, he shall take her real estate in fee to an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars in value, and shall also have an estate by the curtesy or other life interest, as before provided, in her other real estate.\u201d It will be observed that here the word is \u201c living \u201d not \u201c surviving.\u201d Furthermore, the words \u201c or other life interest\u201d refer to an immediately preceding provision made for the husband if they have had no issue born alive, so that it is plain on the face of the section that it is not necessary to have had children in order to get the five thousand dollars\u2019 worth in fee, since one who takes this \u201cother life interest \u201d may have it. Our construction is confirmed, if confirmation is needed, by the original statute, St. 1880, c. 211, \u00a7 1, where the provision in question is enacted independently of the matters with which it has been connected in the compilation, and by <em>Cochran </em>v. Thorndike, 133 Mass. 46, 48. In <em>Eastham </em>v. Barrett, 152 Mass. 56, it appears from the exceptions that the husband and wife had had no children. So in <em>Lincoln </em>v. Perry, 149 Mass. 368, 370, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">An objection taken to the form of the decree is not much pressed. It is agreed that the adjudication that \u201c William J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Howe died seised of an estate in fee not exceeding five thousand dollars in value,\u201d etc., means an estate of that value, where, as here, the land of the wife was worth more than that amount. In substance it is right.</p>\n<p id=\"As2_\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
