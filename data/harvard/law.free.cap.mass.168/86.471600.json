The answer, among other defences, alleged that the note was signed and delivered to Kulp for his accommodation, and with the understanding that, if certain goods held by the defendant should be returned to Kulp, the latter would renew or pay the note when due; that the goods were returned by the defendant to Kulp before the note became due; that, if Kulp indorsed and delivered the note to the plaintiff, it was done after \u201e maturity, and if indorsed before maturity it was so indorsed and delivered without consideration ; and that the note was fraudulently put into circulation by Kulp, and the plaintiff did not take it without notice of the fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-3\">Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Richardson, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-4\">John C.

A. Under the conditions of these contracts.

A. Yes, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-11\">John C. Carter, recalled, testified that at the time that he received this note, or at any other time, he did not know anything about any agreements between Kulp and the defendant; and that the note was taken in the ordinary course of business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-12\">The defendant \u201corally asked the court to find that the note was fraudulently put in circulation by Kulp, the plaintiff being bound to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it obtained it in good faith and without notice of Kulp\u2019s fraud; that the plaintiff has not sustained the burden on the evidence; that even if the plaintiff bank obtained the note in good faith, and merely discounted it for the indorser and credited it on his account, it did not thereby pay for it, or part with anything, and therefore the plaintiff bank cannot recover on this evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-13\">This the judge declined to do, and found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>W. J. </em>Miller, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-3\"><em>J. M. Lesser L. A. </em>McLaughlin, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-4\">Field, O. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMG\">We think that it was competent for the court to find, from the evidence, that the plaintiff took the note before maturity for value, without notice or knowledge of any fraud on the part of the payee in discounting it, or of any defence which the maker of the note had against the payee. Besides, from the inconsistent character of the different parts of the defendant\u2019s testimony, the court might well have found that the note was given for a valuable consideration, and that there had been no failure of consideration. Although there was evidence that the note was discounted for the payee by the plaintiff before maturity without any knowledge that the maker of the note had any defence to it as against the payee, and although the proceeds were passed to the credit of the payee in his account, yet the defendant contends that there was no evidence that these proceeds ever had been drawn out by the payee. Whether merely discounting the note for Kulp, and crediting the proceeds in his account, are sufficient to constitute the bank a purchaser for value, we need not decide. The note is dated August 8, 1894, and was payable four months after date, and was discounted by the bank on August 10, 1894. The cashier testified that the payee of the note \u201c ceased to be a depositor \u201d in the bank in the early part of October, 1894. From this testimony the court could infer that at that time the payee closed his account with the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"AO9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
