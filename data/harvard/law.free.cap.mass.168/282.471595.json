At the trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Fessenden, </em>J., the auditor\u2019s report was the only evidence introduced. The plaintiff requested the judge to rule that the releases did not constitute a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. The judge refused so to rule and found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-13\"><em>W. B.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXB\">We are of opinion that St. 1890, c. 437, is a remedial and not a penal statute. The right given by the second section of the statute is given to the person who contracts to buy or sell upon credit or upon margin, etc., or to the person who employs another so to buy and sell, etc., and it is a right to \u201csue for and recover in an action of contract from the other party to the contract, or from the person so employed, any payment made or the value of anything delivered,\u201d etc. At common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>law no such right of action existed because the parties were considered <em>in pari delicto. No </em>penalty is imposed by the statute which the Commonwealth or any person other than the person who makes the payment or delivers the thing of value can enforce, and the amount to be recovered is the amount of the payment made or the value of the property delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The statute has been held to be constitutional as a statute intended to suppress a species of gambling. <em>Crandell </em>v. <em>White, </em>164 Mass. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">As the statute was passed in order to suppress transactions which were deemed to be against public policy, it may be that contracts made in advance not to take advantage of the statute would be held void. <em>Bosler </em>v. <em>Rheem, </em>72 Penn. St. 54. See <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>140 U. S. 226; <em>Fidelity Mutual Life Association </em>v. <em>Ficklin, </em>74 Md. 172; <em>Hermany </em>v. <em>Fidelity Mutual Life Association, </em>151 Penn. St. 17. But after a cause of action under the statute has accrued, it is at the option of the person to whom the right to sue is given whether he will sue or not, and if he neglects to sue no other person can sue. The cause of action being thus the property of the person entitled to sue, and no other person having any interest in it, he can discharge or release it. The releases in this case, being under seal, were sufficient. <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Parnell, </em>147 Mass. 409. <em>Leddy </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>139 Mass. 394. <em>Squires </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>145 Mass. 192. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Groves, </em>134 Mass. 471. <em>Tamplin </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>99 Mass. 63. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>3 Met. 522. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>12 Cush. 278. <em>Getman </em>v. <em>Second National Bank of Oswego, </em>89 N.

The judge ruled that \u201cthe releases under seal dated April 14, 1896, are a bar to the recovery by the plaintiff of any sums of money for or on account of any transactions had prior to the time of execution of said releases,\u201d and found for the defendant.
