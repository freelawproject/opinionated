If either party fails to appoint a referee for ten days, after written notice of such appointment by the other party, then the referee so appointed shall appoint a second, and the two so appointed shall appoint a third.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-13\">\u201c The referees shall proceed forthwith to hear the parties and to determine whether or not there has been any violation of the agreements herein contained, and whether the same has continued for more than thirty days after notice to discontinue such violation above provided for, and what damage either party has sustained by reason of such violation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-14\">\u201c The decision of a majority of said referees shall be final and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>binding on said parties, and they hereby agree to abide by, submit to, and forthwith to comply with any decision, or award, of a majority of said referees. The expense of any such reference shall be borne by any or all the parties in such proportion as said referees may determine.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">The Superior Court sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-6\"><em>O.

But the law is settled otherwise in this State. <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>97 Mass. 163. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>114 Mass. 185. <em>Pearl </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>121 Mass. 390. <em>Vass </em>v. <em>Wales, </em>129 Mass. 38. <em>White </em>v. <em>Middlesex Railroad, </em>135 Mass. 216. When the question is a preliminary one, or in aid of an action at law or suit in equity, such, for instance, as the ascertainment of damages, an agreement for arbitration will be upheld. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>114 Mass. 185. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Washington Ins. Co. </em>138 Mass. 572, 575. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Liverpool &amp; London </em>&amp; <em>Globe Ins. Co. </em>153 Mass. 143. The defendant contends that the agreement for arbitration in this case goes no further than the assessment of damages. But it is expressly provided, amongst other things, that the referees shall \u201c hear the parties and determine whether or not there has been any violation of the agreements herein contained, . . . and what damage either party has sustained \u201d thereby, and that \u201c the decision of a majority of said referees shall be final and binding on said parties.\u201d The evident intent is to submit all disputes relating to the performance of the agreement to the final decision of a tribunal constituted by the parties themselves. The referees are not only to assess the damages, but also are to determine whether there have been any violations of the agreement, and their decision in all matters is to be final. The agreement to submit to arbitration was therefore in violation of law, and the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled, and decree dismissing hill set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
