I deeply regret all the trouble that is behind us, and am sorry my unruly tongue got the better of me. I have told you every time I have seen you that I had no intention of leaving you, that I prefer to live with you as your wife, and have made up my mind to stop quarrelling at all costs. I will endeavor as far as possible to retrench expenses, and be satisfied with whatever you think you can do for me and the children. Nothing in the world is so wretched for little children as to see their parents unhappy together, and I am more than willing to do whatever lies in my power. This affair has caused me quite as much misery as it has you. I have consulted no one in this matter, and I give you my word no one has seen this letter. Everything looks blue to you now for you are still very ill, but try to see the bright side of things. I am very sorry that I said anything about your, not having the hospital, for of course you will have it, and make a grand success of it, and I shall be proud of it as you are, for your success will mean happiness to me. Please consent to see me, and for the sake of our children let us try to be happy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">\u201c Your true Wife.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">The libellant further testified, on cross-examination, that when she wrote the letter her husband had been ill two weeks at the hospital; that she did not think him responsible for his actions at the time, and that she was willing to make any concessions, and do anything else she could to help him; that although she tried not to be angry with her husband she sometimes answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>him back, but never swore at him; that he always began the altercations, and was always to blame; that he had abused her for seven years preceding the filing of the libel, but was much worse in the winter of 1895; that the hardest blow that he ever struck her was in September, 1895, at his hospital; that he pinched her as many as twenty times between September and January, one of the occasions being a day or two after the letter of September 23, and again a few days afterward on both arms, and at such times she cried out, but did nothing to him; that in November, 1895, the libellee blew tobacco smoke into his little girl\u2019s face until it nauseated her, and upon the libellant remonstrating, he took her by the arm, dragged her across the library, and threw her half way across the hall; that she resisted for a moment, and then yielded, and was forcibly thrown or pushed out; and that the libellee was a pretty strong man, and took hold hard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">On redirect examination, she testified that the libellee often gave wine to the little boys at dinner, and on one occasion, when the wine affected her son Richard, who was about seven years old, his father laughed, and said, \u201c Richard, you are as full as a goat\u201d; and that, on the libellant remonstrating, he gave him some more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-6\">The libellee introduced testimony in denial and contradiction of the evidence of the libellant, and at the close of the case he requested the judge to rule : \u201c 1. That the letter of the libellant to the libellee, September 23, 1895, is conclusive evidence of condonation of all causes of divorce then known to libellant. 2. That there is no evidence of such conduct on the part of the libellee since September 23, 1895, and before the filing of this libel, which revived the right to maintain the libel for any cause arising before September 23,1895, and known to the libellant at the time of filing this libel. 3. That there is no evidence of cruelty or abusive treatment on the part of the libellee sufficient to justify a decree for the libellant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-7\">The judge declined to rule as requested, but ruled that the letter of September 23,1895, written to the libellee, \u201c if accepted and acted on by him, is conclusive evidence of condonation of all causes of divorce then known to the libellant, unless the libellee was guilty of such subsequent misconduct as legally to invalidate the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The judge entered a decree for the libellant; and the libellee alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-3\"><em>0.

There was evidence that the libellee was guilty of cruel and abusive treatment of the libellant, even to the extent of inflicting considerable injury upon her person by violence. There was also evidence tending to show that he was cruel and abusive in other ways, so that her health was materially affected by his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">2. The judge ruled that her letter to him written on September 23, 1895, <em>\u201c </em>if accepted and acted on by. him, is conclusive evidence of condonation of all causes of divorce then known to the libellant, unless the libellee was guilty of such subsequent misconduct as legally to invalidate the same.\u201d To revive a cause of divorce for cruelty it is not necessary that the subsequent misconduct should be sufficient of itself to warrant a decree for divorce without regard to the previous cruelty. It is enough if there is such frequent unkindness or persistent ill treatment as to warrant a well grounded belief that, if the cohabitation continues, the ill feeling will quickly break out in acts of gross cruelty. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>2 Gray, 434. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>100 Mass. 150. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>167 Mass. 87. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>1 Ed.

There was abundant evidence that the libellee broke the condition of his wife\u2019s condonation. She was then pregnant, and her condition of health called peculiarly for kind and tender treatment from her husband. It is unnecessary to review the testimony. There was evidence of great unkindness on his part, manifesting itself in a variety of ways, and materially affecting her health. The rulings and refusals to rule were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
