Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Hammond, </em>J., who ruled that the plaintiff was a mere licensee, and directed a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.

He wished to borrow money, but the exceptions state that it did not appear that the plaintiff\u2019s brother ever held himself out as lending money, or that he ever lent money before. There was no previous appointment to call, and no previous notice of his intention to call had been given. The judge, therefore, rightly ruled that the plaintiff was a mere licensee, and that the defendant on the evidence was not liable.
