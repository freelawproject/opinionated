The facts, admitted by the pleadings, are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-24\">\u201cOn September 9, 1931, buildings owned by one Esther Charlestein and having an agreed value of $43,985 wore damaged by fire for a total loss of $24,374.90. At the time of the fire there were two mortgages upon the property \u2014 a first mortgage of $30,000 held by the plaintiff and a second mortgage of $15,000 held by a building and loan association. The defendant had insured the properly for $30,000 with a standard mortgagee clause making the loss payable to the plaintiff in accordance with its terms. There was also another policy of $15,000 written by another company in favor of the second mortgagee under a similar clause. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-25\">\u201cTho defendant, conceding that the total insurance upon the property was more than 80 per cent, of its cash value so that the entire loss must lie paid to someone, contends that tho Co-insuranee Clause in the policy is hind<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ing as between it and the plaintiff. And, since the plaintiff\u2019s policy is substantially less than 80 per cent, of the cash value of the property, it would follow that the defendant is hable to the plaintiff for only a major fraction of the \u00bfamount of the loss and to the second mortgagee for the balance.' The plaintiff\u2019s position is that the Co-insurance Clause is not applicable to it and it therefore claims the entire amount of the loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Without entering into details, we may say that if the defendant\u2019s contention is right, it has already paid the plaintiff the $16,6-29.54 payable under the policy. On the other hand, if the plaintiff\u2019s contention is right, the defendant owes the plaintiff $3,831.36, which it has not paid, but which it will pay to the second mortgagee. It will thus be seen that the contest is really one between the first and second mortgagees. The court adopted the plaintiff\u2019s view, and entered judgment against defendant for the last-mentioned sum, whereupon defendant took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We are of opinion the court\u2019s construction of the policy in suit was right. As stated by it,</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cThe mortgagee clause in this policy however contains something in addition to the ordinary standard form. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201c \u2018New York and Pennsylvania Standard Mortgagee Clause</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFx\">(Non-Contribution)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201c \u2018Loss or damage, if any, under this policy, shall be payable to,\u2019 etc. Then follows the usual form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u201cIn my opinion the addition of the words \u2018(Non-Contribution)\u2019 indicate an intention on the part of the parties to exclude the mortgagee from the operation of the Co-insurance Clause and should be given that effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The policy, as delivered, contained the words \u201c(Non-Contribution).\u201d These words cannot be ignored, and their presence necessitates their -being given effect. They were embodied in the contract for some purpose. What other effect can be given them save to make the . policy noneontributing? If the words had been \u201ccontribution,\u201d there could have been no doubt the parties emphasized the fact that there was to be contribution. If so, the addition of \u201cnon,\u201d \u201cnon-contribution,\u201d evidenced a contrary intent. The insurance company and the mortgagee agreed to put them where they were put, for some purpose, and we see no warrant for transposing and removing them elsewhere for the benefit of the second mortgagee, who was not a party to the policy contract. Without further discussion,- we note we not only agree with the court below, \u201cThe view that these words were intended to be an effective part of the contract between the insurer and mortgagee, and, as such,' to exclude the Co-insurance Clause- is by far the most reasonable construction that can be put upon them,\u201d that this construction is the most reasonable, but we go further and hold that, in our view, it is the only reasonable and logical construction that can be put on the provision of this policy, \u201cnon-contribution.\u201d So holding, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
