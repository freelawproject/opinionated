We merely held that since the bill affirmatively shows upon its face that the deed to the one-half interest in the 720.90 acres was of record in the county at the time the affidavit was submitted, at the time the patent issued, and at all subsequent times, thereby reflecting open, avowed ownership, the government cannot recover in this suit to cancel the patent, instituted more than six years after it issued, upon the terse, tmamplifled allegation that the entryman concealed the fraud and that the action was filed within six years after its discovery. The mere allegation of concealment, without more, is not aided by the declared ownership reflected by the public record. The only fact alleged is not one of concealment, hut the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-24\">If it can he said that there is substantial basis for doubt respecting the extent to which our former opinion went, it is thus limited, and the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
