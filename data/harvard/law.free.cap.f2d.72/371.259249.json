The court entered' judgment in favor of the carrier; whereupon Trinidad took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">The facts of the ease are that Trinidad shipped the carload of beans from Twin Falls, Idaho, to Philadelphia, Pa. On shipment, it received a bill of lading, in which Trinidad was named as consignor and consignee. On the bill of lading was .the direction, \u201cNotify Elkan B. Marks, - care of Pennsylvania Warehouse <em>\u25a0&amp; </em>Safe Deposit Company.\u201d On arrival of the beans in Philadelphia, carrier promptly notified Elkan B. Marks, who failed to respond in any way to the notice. Following arrival, the beans were placed by the carrier in the Pennsylvania Warehouse &amp; Safe Deposit Company, where the bill of lading provided Marks was to be notified. The contention of Trinidad is that it should have been notified of Mark\u2019s failure to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">It will be noted that the bill of lading made Trinidad both consignor and consignee, and that under the decisions the naming of Marks as the \u201cnotify party\u201d did not make him a consignee. See Davis v. Richardson, 87 Pa. Super. Ct. 205; Chicago &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. Picard, 98 Pa. Super. Ct. 134; Furman v. Union Pacific Railway Co., 106 N. Y. 579, 13 N. E. 587 (quoted approvingly in North Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Commercial Nat. Bank, 123 U. S. 727, 8 S. Ct. 266, 31 L. Ed. 287). It is contended by Trinidad that it should have been advised that the beans were not accepted by any one. Were such the law, we would have <em>the </em>strange contradiction in this ease, where the consign- or is itself the consignee of the goods, that the consignor should be advised that it, as consignee, had not accepted delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">Finding no error in the decision of the court below, its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
