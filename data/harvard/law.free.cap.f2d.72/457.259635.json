Schaffer charged with violating the Harrison Narcotic Act, December 17, 1914, as amended by Act Feb. 24, 1919 (26 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 211, 691 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">An earlier judgment against the surety was reversed on appeal to this court because of the failure to aver in the writ the time at which Schaffer had made default. 51 F.(2d) 470. The amended writ, upon which the ease was retried without a jury, declared that defendant Schaffer had iailed to answer the charge against him on November 5, 1928, wherefore the bond was declared forfeited. Appellant now assigns as error the overruling of its objection to evidence admitted to explain the record and the denial of its motion for judgment in its favor on the ground that, for various reasons specified, the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-20\">1. The evidence admitted over appellant\u2019s objection was designed to meet the defense that the record failed to show Schaffer ever to have been released on appellant\u2019s bond. The record consisted in part of the docket of United States Commissioner Head, showing entries in the following order: July 7, 1926, complaint against Schaffer for violation of the Harrison Narcotic Act; July 7, 1926, appearance of defendant and fixing of bail at $2,000; July 7, 1926, \u201cbail bond with Western Surety Co. as sureties, acknowledged, approved and filed\u201d; July 7, 1926, at 11 o\u2019clock a. m., waiver of examination by defendant and order that he be held to the grand jury; July 7,1926, \u201cin default of bail, final commitment issued.\u201d There was also admitted, without objection, testimony of a Deputy United States marshal who read from the jail register the following entry: \u201cName, Schaffer, David A. Offense, Violation of the Harrison Act. Commissioner, Head. Marshal or Deputy, Maples. Date committed, July 6, 1926: date discharged or released, July 7, 1926. Bail.\u201d In addition there was admitted, over appellant\u2019s objection, a \u201cCommitment Card,\u201d a \u201cUnited States Commissioner\u2019s Release Card,\u201d and a \u201cJailors\u2019 Release Card,\u201d from which the entry in the jail register was compiled, showing the discharge of the defendant by the United States commissioner at 1:50 o\u2019clock p. m., July 7, 1920, because he gave bond, and the release of the defendant from jail at 2:30 o\u2019clock p. m., the same day, because of bond. Testifying without any independent recollection of the Schaffer Case, Commissioner Head explained' that the record entries and the cards showed that defendant Schaffer had been released on appellant\u2019s bonds, despite the fact that the entry, \u201cin default of bail, final commitment issued,\u201d appeared after the entry, \u201cbail bond with Western Surety Co. as sureties acknowledged, approved and filed.\u201d He testified that the confusion, if any, arose from the fact that the entry concerning the filing of bond was made not in its chronological order but in the place reserved for it on the docket. This evidence did not impeach the record, as appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>lant claims, but merely explained the time sequence which the record left obscure. For this purpose it was clearly admissible. Commonwealth v. Perkins, 32 S. W. 134, 17 Ky. Law Rep. 542 (1895); State of Oregon v. Hays, 2 Or. 314 <em>(1868); see </em>Ewing v. United States, 249 F. 241, 246, 251 (C. C. A. 6, 1917), cf. State of Iowa v. Clemons, 9 Iowa, 534 (1859); People v. Baughman, 18 Ill. 152 (1856); cf. Treasurer of Vermont v. Merrill <em>&amp; </em>Maeck, 34 Vt. 64 (1842).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"> 2. In support of its motion for judgment on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment for plaintiff, appellant contends that the record shows that it was not appellant\u2019s bond, but some other bond which was forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Appellant offered in evidence without objection minutes of the court in the ease of United States v. Dave Schaffer, showing that on September 9,1926, an indictment was presented to the District Court by the grand jury, and that the court ordered a bench warrant issued for the apprehension of the defendant and his bond fixed at $5,000; that on September 20, 1926, the cause came before the court for arraignment and plea, and was continued for two weeks; and that on October 4, 1926, it was continued again until October 18, 1926, when it was continued for the term. There were no further proceedings until J anuary 9, 1928, when, the cause having come on for arraignment, the United States attorney stated that the defendant was a fugitive from justice. The judgment nisi, introduced in evidence over appellant\u2019s objection, shows that on November 5, 1928, the cause \u201ccoming on at this time for arraignment and plea, * * * the defendant does not appear,\u201d and thereupon the court \u201cordered that a bench warrant issue for the apprehension of the defendant, and, if any bond lias been furnished for the appearance of the defendant, that same be, and it is forfeited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Appellant argues that, sinee there is no record of defendant Schaffer\u2019s failure to appear, except for the minute entries of January 9, 1928, and November 5, 1928, he must be assumed to have been present at all previous occasions when the case was called and to iiave been released, if at all, upon a bond of $5,000 required by the court on September 9, 1926, and assumed to have been filed subsequent to the filing of appellant\u2019s bond. To meet this defense, appellee put in, over appellant\u2019s objection, testimony of a deputy clerk that it was the uniform practice in that court to note the defendant\u2019s presence but not his absence. This evidence, not contradictory of anything in the record, was admissible to explain it. See cases cited supra. But, even without it, the record does not sustain appellant\u2019s contention, for by the very order that fixed bail at $5,000 a bench warrant was directed to issue for <em>his </em>apprehension. Clearly he was not then in custody of the court, and the record fails to show a later arrest or the giving of a new bond to effectuate a release therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">3. Appellant also contends in support of the motion for judgment in its favor that the obligation under the bond had terminated before the forfeiture because there were no proceedings in the case against Schaffer from October 18, 1926, when it was continued for the term, until January 9,1928, when, on the statement of; the United States attorney that the defendant was a fugitive from justice, the cause was stricken from the calendar. <em>The </em>language of the bond is that \u201cDavid A. Schaffer shall appear and answer said charge against him \" y * wherever and whenever the same may be called or prosecuted.\u201d This, appellant argues, is substantially the Same as a bond for the appearance of the defendant at \u201cthe next regular term and each subsequent term,\u201d and means that the ease must be called at each regular term or else the surety is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The obligation of the surety depends upon the wording of the bond and the applicable state law. See Palermo v. United States, 61 F.(2d) 138, 140 (C. C. A. 8, 1932); Western Surety Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 51 F.(2d) at page 471. The California Penal Code (Deering, 1931) \u00a7 1278, requires that a bail bond should be in \u201csubstantially the following form\u201d- \u2014 that the sureties \u201cundertake that the above named-will appear and answer the charge above mentioned, in whatever court it msxy be prosecuted, and will at all times hold himself amenable to the orders and process of the court.\u201d In Los Angeles County v. Delahunt, 99 Cal. App. 569, 279 P. 187 (1929), a bail bond, in the form required by the statute, was held properly forfeited when the defendant failed to appear on being called for ari*aignment some six years-after the complaint against him had been filed and the bond for his appearance had been given. Obviously, neither in the wording of. this bond nor in the California law, is there! warrant for the limitation which appellant' would read into its obligation. In Reese v.. United States, 9 Wall. 13, 15, 19 L. Ed. 541 (1839), upon which appellant heavily relies, , the obligation was conditioned upon the appearance of the defendant at the \u201cnext reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ular term of the Cireuit Court to be held in the city of San Francisco, and at any subsequent term to be thereafter held in that city.\u201d The court held that the sureties were released by a stipulation between the government and the accused that trial should be postponed until the determination of certain related causes. The basis of the decision was primarily that the-obligation of the principal to- appear at any subsequent term had been changed, without consent of the surety, to an obligation that he need appear \u201conly at such term as might be held after the happening of an uncertain and contingent event.\u201d It may well be doubted whether even under such a bond the surety would be discharged by lack of a formal continuance from term to term. Cf. United States v. Fletcher, 279 F. 160 (D. C., W. D. Tex. 1922). In answer to appellant\u2019s argument that it is unreasonably harsh to hold the surety obligated to answer for the prisoner whenever he may be called, it may be said that, if the delay grows too long, the surety may relieve himself of the obligation by surrendering the prisoner to the custody of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">4. Finally, appellant contends that the order of forfeiture was not a valid judgment nisi; that it was insufficient to support a final judgment on a scire facias because it did not determine that there was any bond to be forfeited, but provided merely that, \u201cif any bond has been furnished for the appearance of the defendant, that same be, and it is forfeited.\u201d Appellee answers that the instrument in suit which appellant terms a bail bond is more properly termed a recognizance, that this is a confessed judgment conditioned on appearance of the defendant, and that the order of forfeiture need show only a breach of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Recognizance and bail bond are often used interchangeably, although there is a distinction between them. A recognizance, properly speaking, is an obligation or record entered into before a court of reeord or magistrate duly authorized, conditioned on the doing of some specified aet, while a \u201cbond, or as it is commonly called, a bail bond, is an obligation but under seal, signed by the party giving the same, with one or more sureties, under a penalty, conditioned to do some particular aet.\u201d See Swan v. United States, 3 Wyo. 151, 157, 9 P. 931, 935 (1886). See, too, 2 Blackstone Comm. 341. In some states \u201ca recognizance is a matter of reeord, in the nature of a conditional judgment, and is proceeded upon by scire facias, while a bond is but an evidence of debt, for the recovery of which an action must be brought.\u201d Cole v. Warner, 93 Tenn. 155, 159, 23 S. W. 110, 111 (1893). In Ewing v. United States, supra, however, scire facias was held to be a proper method of enforcing in the federal courts an instrument characterized as a \u201cbail bond, not a recognizance.\u201d See, too, State v. Wilson, 265 Mo. 1, 175 S. W. 603 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The instrument before us was signed and sealed by the parties, acknowledged before a notaiy public, approved, sealed, and filed before the United States commissioner on July 7, 19-26-, and finally filed with the clerk of court on October 17,1928. Whether the bond was actually entered into before the United States commissioner does not appear. Assuming that it was not, it might be necessary to decide for some purposes whether such an instrument is technically a recognizance or a bail bond; for our purposes, such a choice in terminology is not essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">On the question of whether or not an order of forfeiture is necessary before a scire facias may issue to enforce a recognizance or bail bond, there is conflict of authority. Although state law is controlling, California law offers no guide, since a statutory procedure other than scire facias is provided for the enforcement of a recognizance. Penal Code (Deering, 1931) \u00a7\u00a7 1305, 1306. Under the greater weight of authority, an order of forfeiture is necessary. Park v. State of Georgia, 4 Ga. 329 (1848); Kennedy v. People, 15 Ill. 418 (1854); Eubank v. People, 50 Ill. 496 (1869). See State v. Kinne, 39 N. H. 129, 138 (1859); Lewis v. Commonwealth, 106 Va. 20, 54 S. E. 999, 1000 (1906); cf. McGuire v. State, 124 Ind. 536, 23 N. E. 85, 25 N. E. 11 (1889) (not a scire facias, but an original action upon the recognizance). Authorities to the contrary seem to be largely influenced by statute. State of Minnesota v. Grant, 10 Minn. 39 (Gil. 22, 31) (1865); State v. Edgerton, 12 R. I. 104 (1878). Cf. Potter v. Kingsbury, 4 Day (Conn.) 98 (1809) (action of debt on the bond). Of course, the judgment nisi is invalid if it fails to conform to statutory requisites, Watkins v. State, 16 Tex. App. 646 (1884); United States v. Ewing, 19 F.(2d) 378 (D. C., N. D. Miss. 1927); or to the terms of the bond, Gass v. State, 110 Tex. Cr. R. 238, 8 S.W. (2d) 123 (1928). The order of forfeiture in the present ease failed to specify the bond or to- state that there was any valid bond on reeord subject to forfeiture. While it is doubtless better practice for the District Judge, on examination of the reeord, to specify in the order the bond which is to be forfeited, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>absence of relevant statutory requirements this is not essential. National Surety <em>Co. </em>v. United States (Case No. 5497) 29 F.(2d) 92, 99 (C. C. A. 9 (1928); and the cases cited therein. We conclude that the judgment nisi was not fatally defective and that the motion of defendant surety company for judgment was ijropeify denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
