S. C.), as in the amended libel, filed herein, set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-31\">The vessels were thus forfeited on the sole ground that they were employed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>trade for which they were not licensed, the carriage of intoxicating liqnor made illicit by the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">The same allegation in the libel and the same decree of condemnation was made in the ease of each vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">If this is all there is in this ease, it is controlled by the decisions in the eases of United States v. Chambers &amp; Gibson, 291 U. S. 217, 54 S. Ct. 434, 78 L. Ed. 763, 89 A. L. R. 1510; Massey v. United States, 291 U. S. 608, 54 S. Ct. 532, 78 L. Ed. 1019, and McClure et al. v. United States (C. C. A.) 70 F.(2d) 519, and the decrees must be reversed, for the vessels were licensed to engage in \u201ccoasting\u201d trade and could engage in any such trade. The illegal character of the cargo in these cases was alleged to be illegal because of the National Prohibition Act, which does not now have any force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">But the libelant proceeded under sections 584 and 594 and section 3, Schedule 8, par. 814, of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 1584, 3594 and 1001, Schedule 8, par. 814).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Section 584 (19 USCA \u00a7 1584) provides the penalty for the refusal to produce the manifest by vessels eng-aged in foreign trade and \u201cbound to the United States,\u201d and section 504 (19 USCA \u00a7 1504) prescribes the procedure for the collection of the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">These sections do not refer to a vessel engaged in a coastwise trade which does not require a manifest. This is a tariff measure, and its provisions were designed, to prevent the importation of merchandise into the United States without the payment of the required duty thereon. Consequently it is not applicable to a vessel engaged in a coastwise trade where no manifest is required because no duty is imposed on such merchandise, it being already in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Section 1, par. 814, of Schedule 8 (19 USCA \u00a7 1O01, Schedule 8, par. 814), provides that: \u201cNo wines, spirits, or other liquors or articles provided for in this schedule containing one-half of 1 per centum or more of alcohol shall be imported or permitted entry except on a permit issued therefor by the Commissioner of Prohibition, and any such wines, spirits, or other liquors or articles imported or brought into the United States without a permit shall be seized and forfeited in the same manner as for other violations of the customs laws: Provided, That high-proof fruit spirits made in distilleries connected with wineries for use in the fortification of wines, may also lie withdrawn and used, under the same laws and regulations applicable to the withdrawal and use of alcohol for all non-beverage proposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">This section provides that wines and other liquors imported into the United States without a permit from the Commissioner of Prohibition shall be seized and forfeited. This has no reference to the vessels in this case, and is inapplicable to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">The decrees forfeiting the vessels are reversed, with directions to discharge the vessels and dismiss the libels.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
