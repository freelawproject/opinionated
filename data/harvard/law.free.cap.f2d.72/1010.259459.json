This latter surcharge the court below refused to make, and from its decree so ordering the trustee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-27\">No question of law is involved in the case, but rather the business and administrative one arising in handling the situation. The opinion of the court below is so thorough and comprehensive, covering 'as it does every phase of the administration of the estate, that an additional opinion by this court would be a studied effort to use different language and avoid duplication of what has been already adequately discussed by the judge' below. As we find ourselves in accord with his statement and conclusion, we limit ourselves to affirming the decree below on his opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
