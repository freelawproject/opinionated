The indictment against the defendant contained two counts; the first charging possession of a stolen automobile in violation of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act (18 USCA \u00a7 408), and the second charging the transportation of the same automobile. At the trial, after evidence w-as hoard, the jury brought in a verdiet of guilty and the judge below fined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>the defendant $1,000 and sentenced him to five years imprisonment, from which judgment this appeal was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">An examination of the record shows that there was ample evidence to justify the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The charge of the trial judge, read as a whole, was fair to the defendant. That part of the charge, to which attention is called in <em>the </em>brief on behalf of the defendant as being erroneous, was not objected to at the time and cannot now be considered here. Certainly the rights of the defendant were not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">There was no harmful error in the trial, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
