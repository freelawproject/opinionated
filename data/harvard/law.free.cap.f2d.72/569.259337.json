During the trial, counts 8, 9, and 12 were dismissed by the-government, and the defendant was found guilty on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-29\">The scheme to defraud as charged in the indictment consisted in representing that defendant was about to recover from the British government from five to twenty-two billions of dollars in gold, jewels, and real estate; that this vast estate would he distrito <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>uted to donors to a fund, to be used by defendant in recovering the. estate, in proportion to contributions made by donors; that defendant had discovered the only living\u2019heir of Sir Francis Drake, the great navigator and buccaneer, who died about 1596; that this only surviving heir had assigned to defendant in 1922 or 1923 his interest in the Drake estate, and that the Lord Chancellor of England had looked over and passed upon the genealogy of this heir, and had agreed that defendant\u2019s assignor was the only living heir of Drake, and was directing the checking of the returns from Drake\u2019s property to make sure that defendant was paid, not only the value of the property, but all income and increase therefrom from the.date of Drake\u2019s death to the date of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">During the time of the commission of the crime charged in the indictment in all its parts, defendant lived in London, England. He induced some twenty agents located in various parts of the United States to solicit funds for the avowed purpose of using them to get possession of the alleged Drake estate. It is charged that the representations about the Drake estate were false and that the scheme was a scheme to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">While it is claimed on this appeal that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict on the various counts, the substantial questions presented relate to alleged errors \u25a0of law occurring at the trial, or preliminary thereto. Despite the palpable fraud in the representations made, and the incredible nature of the representations of defendant and his agents, they seem to have fired the im.agination and dulled the sense of reason of many honest people who relied on them, and \u2022during some ten years of activity defendant received, through his various agents in the United States from $700,000 to $800,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Specifications of error urged by defendant occupy sixty pages of the printed brief. It will not be possible to consider in detail \u25a0all of these alleged errors. The object of the rule requiring an assignment of errors is to enable the court and opposing counsel to \u2022determine on what points appellant\u2019s eoun\u2022sel intend to seek a reversal of the judgment, \u25a0and to limit the discussion to such points; but, where there is an unlimited assignment, it amounts to a perversion of the rule, defeats its purpose, and bewilders both court \u2022and counsel. While we have laboriously gone through this entire record and considered each specification of error, we shall attempt, \u2022as far as possible, to group the questions presented and limit our discussion to such points as impress us as being substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">I. Each count of the indictment sets forth in detail the representations alleged to have been made. Defendant interposed a motion for bill of particulars which w\u00e1s denied, and this action of the court is urged as error. It is contended by defendant that the indictment charges the falsity of these representations in general language. Summarizing these allegations of representations into as narrow a statement as possible, they charge: (1) That defendant had discovered the only living heir of Sir Francis Drake; (2) that the genealogy of such heir had been definitely established and approved by-' the high British authorities; (3) that defendant, had secured an assignment to himself from such heir; (4) that the British'government had recognized his right to the possession of the vast Drake estate; (5) that he was obliged to expend large sums of money for the fees of lawyers and experts, and other necessary expenses, in order to assure the delivery of the estate to him; (6) that the amount of the necessary expenditures was a weekly minimum of $2,500; (7) that the persons who contributed money to assist him in meeting the expenses would be repaid on the basis of at least $1,000 for every dollar contributed; (8) that he was a British subject, and would soon receive a title; (9) that Sir Francis Drake died, leaving a son, and at the death of Sir Francis Drake his estate was fraudulently administered by a brother of Sir Francis Drake; (10) that he (defendant) had discovered the rightful heir, but that the genealogy had to be passed upon \u201cby the highest powers that be\u201d; (11) that the genealogy of Drake was made final in August, 1923, by the Lords\u2019 and King\u2019s Commission; (12) that from the time the heir was established in 1923 until August, 1925, defendant had been engaged in cheeking up the property and its accumulations; (13) that since August, after the baronetcy was established, he was getting all details ready to take possession of everything that followed the title under the law of to-day; (14) that this law was passed thirty or forty years ago, and gave to the rightful heir his right to transfer all property and everything that followed the title; (15) that the contributors could see that everything which belonged to Sir Francis Drake at his death would have to be accounted for by the Crown and subsequently turned over to the defendant; (16) that the genealogy had been presented to the Crown Commission, which was the highest power in the British Empire, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>could not be attacked by the courts; (17) that since the death of Drake there had always been a dispute winch accounted for the Crown's control and supervision of everything tbat belonged to the estate of Sir Francis Drake; (18) that the Crown confiscated the whole thing from the parties in possession and turned it over to the rightful heir in the baronetcy; (10) that it was said by people in lugh finance that the amount of the estate was considerably over the combined debt of Great Britain to the United States of America and all the other countries' indabtcclneas to Great Britain, and that it amounted to $22,500,000,000; (20) that the contributors could figure np all the land in the state of Iowa at an average price of $125 per acre and all the stock and bank deposits in Iowa, as well as the railroads and cities contInued, and that defendant could buy the whole lot and put a Pence around the whole state, and still have more money left than the contributors ever thought of; (21) that, if the contributors had all over and above $S,OOO,OOO~OO0, they could buy the whole city of Des Moines and build a fence around it; (22) that every tree, lodd of wood, and timber that had been cut off the lands since the death of Drake was accounted for, as well as the accumulation of moneys, and money from rock quarries, brickyards, pottery, clay, minerals, ores, fishing rights, income from railroad lands, and all rents from properties that had been accumulated; (23) that this iaoney had been working for over three hundred years, both Ia the ecclesiastical and goverameatal departments; (24) that the nation of Great Britain was the one which owed this bill, and that nation was reliable, safe, and sound, and had verified defendant's claim; (25) that the original documents had been sealed and locked a way in the archives, and that five copies were in the hands of the people who should have theni; (26) that all moueys, properties, lands, title deeds, heirlooms, and personal effects of the late Sir Francis Drake and his heirs were to be handed over to defendant with the utmost imasihle speed; (27) that defendant had been raeognizcd by King George, hut that he had not go no through the formality of rccognition; (28) that defe dant was the only real Sir Francis Drake, and that everything bm longed to him, and lds claim had been 0. K.'d by the Crown; (29) that, by reason of an error, certain papers and charts had to he made out afresh whioh meant an extra benefit to him of 250,000 pounds sterling; (30) that the expense that was attached to the balance sheet ran from $3,000 to $5,000 a week, and had so run since the middle of August; (31) that the day of the finish he would send a copy of the London Gazette, the only official government paper printed in London, which would tell the contributors of defendant's name being changed on deed poll to Francis Drake, and that thereafter he would be raised to the peerage, the crests for which had already been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-71\"> Defendant in his motion asked that the government be required to set out what was false about each of the claims just summarized above. In each instance defendant asked the government to sot out what was false about his alleged representation. There are doubtless many instances under which, in order to comply with the constitutional requirement of certainty in the accusation, ~m indictment should not only allege the falcity of the misrepresentation, but allege affirmatively in what the falsehood consists. The indictment here, however, fairly apprised dalemidant of the charge against him. The charged misrepresentations were directly stated, and it is charged that these representations were false. There would seem to be no possibility that delendant might be taken by surprise at the trial, or that the government, m~der these allegations, might introduce proof not fairly within the plain terms of the allegation, and hence there was no function to be performed by a bill of pariiculars. Motion for a bill of particulars is generally addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and, unless it appears that this discretion has been abused, the ruling will not be reversed. Dunlop v. United States, 165 U. S. 486, 17 S. Ct. 375, 41 L. Ed. 799; Savage v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 270 F. 14; Hyney v. United States (C. C. A. 6) 44 F.(2d) 134. The representations were charged to be utterly false. A bill of l)art~ eulars could not have added anything to the information conveyed by the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-107\">II. Defendant moved to strike from the indictment certain phrases used to describe the original Drake fortune. It would seem quite unnecessary to reproduce these various phrases attacked by this meLlon. The indictment alleges the sckeme, the misrepresentstions and falsity, and the use of the mails. There are many embellishing phrases embodied in this indictment that might more appropriately have been used in a newspaper article than in an indictment. Whoever prepared it possibly indulged in phrase--maleing to an unwarranted degree, and it is prolix and contains much redundant and immaterial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>matter. These defects, however, do not vitiate the indictment, as the embellishing phrases may properly be disregarded as surplusage. Busch v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 52 F.(2d) 79; Goldstein v. United States (C. C. A.) 63 F.(2d) 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"> III. The sufficiency of the indictment was challenged by demurrer and motion to quash. It is urged that defendant could not be tried in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Iowa because he at the time of the commission of the crime charged was in London, England. The gist of the offense described in the statute is not the devising of a scheme to defraud. That in itself is not a crime under the laws of the United States. Such an act becomes criminal under the statute only in the event the United States mails are used in carrying it. into effect. . Busch v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 52 F.(2d) 79; Cochran v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 41 F.(2d) 193. The indictment alleges that defendant caused to be delivered letters within the Northern District of Iowa. Under the statute, knowingly to cause a letter to be delivered by mail in accordance with the directions thereon for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud is an offense separate from that of mailing the letter or causing it to be mailed for the same purpose, and, where the letter is so delivered as directed, the person who caused the mailing likewise causes the delivery at the place of delivery, and may be prosecuted in that district, although he was not present therein. Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 44 S. Ct. 519, 68 L. Ed. 989; Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 32 S. Ct. 793, 56 L. Ed. 1114, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 614; Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 26 S. Ct. 688, 50 L. Ed. 1057, 6 Ann. Cas. 362; United States v. Steinberg (C. C. A. 2) 62 F.(2d) 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In United States v. Steinberg, supra, the \u2022Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second- Circuit held that one who had mailed a letter in Canada, which was delivered in the United .States, was subject to prosecution under section 338, title 18, USCA, in the United States. We have held that, whore a scheme to defraud or to obtain money by false pretenses was charged, when such scheme is criminally participated in by more than one individual, it \u25a0constitutes of itself a conspiracy, and all who \u25a0engage therein are equally guilty. Cochran v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 41 F.(2d) 193; Busch v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 52 F. (2d) 79; Chambers v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 237 F. 513. If defendant\u2019s associates knowingly participated in this alleged scheme, then they were guilty of a conspiracy, and all those participating in the furtherance of the scheme, whether within the United States or without, would be equally guilty. Ford v. United States, 273 U. S. 593, 47 S. Ct. 531, 71 L. Ed. 793. But if, on the other hand, defendant\u2019s aides were innocent, then the defendant would still be guilty of the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of the lower court if while remaining in London he procured the commission of a crime through these innocent agents. The acts constituting the gist of the offense took place within the jurisdiction of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The demurrer and motion were properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">IV. Complaint is made of the court\u2019s rulings as to the qualification of jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">(1) Two jurors on their voir dire testified that they had made contributions to the Drake estate fund or the Hartzell fund,, which had never been repaid. The government challenged these jurors for cause, and the court sustained the challenges. These jurors had an interest in the litigation, and hence were subject to challenge. Frank v. United States (C. C. A. 9) 59 F.(2d) 670. The findings of the trial judge on such an issue will not be se.t aside unless manifestly erroneous, and the qualifications of a juror to sit in a cause are to be determined by the trial court. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145, 25 L. Ed. 244; Nations v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 52 F.(2d) 97; Union Electric Light <em>&amp; </em>Power Co. v. Snyder Estate Co. (C. C. A. 8) 65 F.(2d) 297. Defendant had a right to have his cause tried by an impartial jury, but he had no right to have any particular member of the panel sit upon the trial unless such member had been accepted and sworn as a juror. Marande v. Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. (C. C. A. 2) 124 F. 42; Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Herbert, 116 U. S. 642, 6 S. Ct. 590, 29 L. Ed. 755; Hayes v. Missouri, 120 U. S. 68, 7 S. Ct. 350, 30 L. Ed. 578; Howard v. Kentucky, 200 U. S. 164, 26 S. Ct. 189, 50 L. Ed. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">(2) In examining a prospective juror named Sitzman on his voir dire, the court asked him if his mind were open and unbiased, and if he would make a good, fair juror without any interest or knowledge one way or the other. The juror answered, \u201cWell, I feel as though it is nothing but a \u2014 .\u201d Before the juror finished his remark, the court interrupted, saying: \u201cYou need not tell\u2014 the question is whether you can try this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>as an unbiased juror on the evidence.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attorney then examined the juror as follows: \u201cYou started to say, Mr. Sitzman, \u2018I feel as though it is nothing but <em>a </em>\u2014 \u25a0\u2019 what was the rest you were g'oing to say? The juror answered, \u2018Damned scheme.\u2019\u201d Counsel for defendant challenged the juror, and the challenge was sustained. Thereupon counsel for defendant said, \u201cAnd we likewise ask that the Court admonish the jury panel.\u201d The court replied that there was no jury yet to bo admonished, to which counsel responded, \u201cI mean those jurors, prospective jurors, talesmen that are present and have heard this juror\u2019s statement, that they should be admonished not to consider it.\u201d The trial judge responded, \u201cThe court will admonish the jury when the jury is impaneled.\u201d No further action was taken by the court or the defendant. It is urged that it was prejudicial to allow this remark to stand without admonition. It may be observed that counsel for defendant is responsible for the remark. It was brought out presumably for the purpose of showing that the juror was biased and it was proper for that purpose, and the court properly sustained the challenge. The matter was not again brought to the court\u2019s attention, and the incident is too trivial to warrant serious consideration. It is not conceivable that the incident could have prejudiced the defendant, but, if it was considered serious, then counsel should subsequently have obtained a direct ruling in order to preserve the objection. There is no exception to the ruling of the court, and the ruling was not final.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">(3) Defendant also complains of the action of the court in overruling his challenge for cause to the juror \"Wierda. Defendant exercised a peremptory challenge on this juror, but he contends that he was compelled so to do when the juror should have been excused on his challeng-e for cause. Defendant did not exercise all his peremptory challenges before the trial jury was impaneled and sworn. The juror having been peremptorily challenged by defendant, and an impartial and competent juror obtained in his place, no prejudice was done the defendant because defendant still had an unexnrcised peremptory challenge. Spies v. Illinois (Ex Parte Spies), 123 U. S. 131, 8 S. Ct. 21, 22, 31 L. Ed. 80; Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S. 430, 7 S. Ct. 614, 30 L. Ed. 708; Krause v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 147 F. 442; Holt v. United States, 218 U. S. 245, 31 S. Ct. 2, 54 L. Ed. 1021, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138; Stroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15, 40 S. Ct. 50, 64 L. Ed. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">V. Great stress is placed upon certain rulings of the court on the admissibility of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">(1) Over objection of counsel for defendant, testimony was given by officers as to the conversations had with the defendant after Ms arrest. The statements were not confessions, but at most admissions against interest. In the federal courts there is no presumption against the voluntary character of a confession, and the burden is not on the government in the first instance to show its voluntary character. Gray v. United States (C. C. A. 9) 9 F.(2d) 337; Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 860. The mere fact that defendant was under arrest did not render inadmissible the statements which he made. Ziang Sung Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1, 45 S. Ct. 1, 69 L. Ed. 131; Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355, 16 S. Ct. 321, 40 L. Ed. 454. The admissibility of such evidence depends largely upon the circumstances connected with the statements, arid the matter is largely to be determined by the trial court. There is nothing in the evidence indicating that the statements were not voluntary, and hence they were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">(2) Defendant objected to the introduction of certain cablegrams or secondary evidence of their contents. These cablegrams appeared on their face to come from London, England, and at the end or bottom of them appeared the name \u201cIlarteell.\u201d They all bore extrinsic evidence of relating to the business which defendant was carrying on in this country, and they were delivered to the persons with whom defendant was shown to be corresponding, or through whom he was carrying on his business in America. It is urged that there was not a sufficient foundation laid for the introduction of secondary evidence as to the contents of the cablegrams. The persons to whom the cablegrams were addressed testified that they had destroyed the copy of the cablegram received, or had made diligent search and had been unable to find them. Proper foundation was therefore laid for secondary testimony of the contents of the lost or mislaid cablegrams. Purington Paving Brick Co. v. Metropolitan Pav. Co. (C. C. A. 8) 4 F.(2d) 676; McGowan v. Armour (C. C. A. 8) 248 F. 676; Missouri Dist. Telegraph Co. v. Morris &amp; Co. (C. C. A. 8) 243 F. 481; Stockyards Loan Co. v. Miller (C. C. A. 8) 288 F. l76; General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. American Ins. Co. (C. C. A. 5) 50 F.(2d) 803; Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence (10th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 198 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>and 199; Zoline\u2019s Federal Criminal Law and Procedure, \u00a7 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">If the copies of the cablegrams as received were admissible in evidence, then the oral testimony was admissible. It remains to consider, however, whether the copies of the cablegrams delivered were admissible. The original cablegrams were, of course, delivered to the sending office, and these instruments were not offered in evidence. Contents of telegrams may he proven either by primary or secondary evidence. Primary evidence is, of course, the original telegram itself. Secondary evidence of a telegram may consist of a copy proved to be correct, or oral evidence of the contents by one who has seen it and knows its contents. But, before secondary evidence may he received, the absence of primary evidence must he satisfactorily accounted for. In a criminal case in which it is claimed that the defendant is the sender of the telegram, the original telegram is the one filed in the sending office. Montgomery v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 219 F. 162. The rule might be otherwise if the defendant were the recipient of the, telegram, but that is not here material. Secondary evidence of the contents can only he admitted when proper foundation has been laid by proof of loss, destruction, or other facts sufficient to permit the admission of secondary evidence. Here it appears that the cablegrams were sent from London, England, and therefore the original was out of the jurisdiction of the court. Under such circumstances, secondary evidence became admissible. Burton v. Driggs, 20 Wall. 125, 22 L. Ed. 299; Galbreath v. United States (C. C. A. 6) 257 F. 648; Ritter v. State, 70 Ark. 472, 69 S. W. 262. But it is still necessary to consider whether the cablegrams were sufficiently identified as coming from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Ordinarily, where a writing is not shown to have been executed by the defendant, it'cannot be offered in evidence against him. To be admissible in a criminal ease, either to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime, or to procure a verdict against him, a writing must be established with that degree of certainty recognized as necessary to a conviction. Sprinkle v. United States (C. C. A. 4) 150 F. 56. A writing, of course, does not prove itself, and there is no presumption that a telegram is sent by the party who purports to send it. McGowan v. Armour (C. C. A. 8) 248 F. 676; Drexel v. True (C. C. A. 8) 74 F. 12; Ford v. United States (C. C. A. 9) 10 F.(2d) 339. The government was therefore hound under the established rules of evidence to prove that Hartzell was the person who sent these messages. Some of them, relating to the granting of a power of attorney to certain persons by Hartzell to represent him, might be put aside because Hartzell, by the admissions above held to be competent, admitted that these same persons held his power of attorney. This fact was clearly established by other evidence, so there could have been no prejudice to defendant in so far as such cablegrams are concerned. Holt v. United States, 218 U. S. 245, 31 S. Ct. 2, 54 L. Ed. 1021, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138; Beach v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 19 F.(2d) 739; Cooper v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 9 F.(2d) 216; Bergera v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 297 F. 102; Kreuzer v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 254 F. 34; De Moss v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 250 F. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> But as to these and the other cablegrams there is undisputed evidence in the record sufficient to establish their authenticity and defendant\u2019s connection therewith, (a) Large sums of money were forwarded to defendant in London by the agents whom he selected to carry on his work in this country. The cablegrams fit into as related parts of a whole scheme with other circumstantial evidence, the competency of which is not' challenged, establishing the connection between defendant and these parties to whom the cablegrams were sent, (b) Their subject-matter, considered with this other evidence, competent and undisputed, unquestionably proves plaintiff to be their author. The connection of a defendant in a criminal case with the writing or mailing of a writing may be established by circumstantial as well as direct evidence. Cochran v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 41 F.(2d) 193; Montgomery v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 219 F. 162; Watlington v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 233 F. 247; Rice v. United States (C. C. A. 1) 251 F. 778; Ford v. United States (C. C. A. 9) 10 F.(2d) 339; Schwartz v. United States, 56 App. D. C. 105, 10 F.(2d) 900; Gridley v. United States (C. C. A. 6) 44 F.(2d) 716; Van Riper v. United States (C. C.

A. 1) 295 F. 441, 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">In the last-cited case, the identification of a telephone call was held sufficient, although the customer victims of the defendants in that ease, which was a prosecution for violation of section 215 of the Criminal Code (18 USCA \u00a7 338), had never known defendants personally nor seen them, and, of course, could not recognize their voices. The court said: \u201cThe undisputed testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>showed that the defendants were carrying on a wholesale business of this sort by telephone. \" y The gist of the problem is whether there was sufficient identification of the persons in the Boston office calling the witnesses, or later responding to the calls of the witnesses, so as to justify the court in admitting tiie evidence. Plainly, recognition of the voice is not the only means of ideniifieafion. Circumstantial evidence may be as persuasive as testimony that the voice is recognized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Defendant\u2019s contention that there was not sufficient foundation in the evidence for the receipt of these cablegrams is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> (3) I. T. Jones, an attorney at law, called on behalf of the government, testified \u00a1o the receipt from the defendant of certain letters which he identified. His testimony was objected to as being- privileged because the letters constituted confidential communications between attorney and client. It is sufficient to say that the evidence does not show that this witness was retained by the defendant in the matters concerning- which lie was interrogated. The communications, in other words, were not confidential communications between attorney and client, it also appears without dispute that substantially the same communications were .sent to others who were not attorneys, and one of these witnesses testified to that effect. The defendant, in one of the communications at least, advised the witness to read the letter \u201cto parties you know you can trust.\u201d The privilege does not extend to the protection of matters not in their nature private or which cannot be properly termed the subject of a confidential disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Similar objections were made to certain cablegrams passing between defendant and P. M. Young, an attorney at Mitchell, S. D., at which time the relationship of attorney and client may be assumed to have existed; but copies of all these cablegrams were elsewhere admitted in evidence, so that, if error occurred, it could not have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">(4) Objection was made to the introduction in evidence of the will and codicil of Sir Francis Drake, and the definitive sentence or probate thereof. \u2019These were photostatic eopies certified by 0. Wilkinson, the assistant registrar at Sommerset House, London, England, to bo true copies of the \u201coriginal will and the codicil record in this Registry.\u201d Each of these exhibits has attached thereto the certificate of the American consul to Great Britain, under his consular seal, to the effect that C. Wilkinson \u201cwas at the time of signing the said certificate Assistant Registrar of the Probate Division of the High Court of Justice of England, duly commissioned and qualified, that said C. Wilkinson is the officer of said court authorized to sign and seal official eopies of such documents and that the seal affixed to the said certificate is the seal of said Probate Division of the High Court of Justice.\u201d These eopies were procured at Sommerset House, London, England, that being the registry of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, and the regular depository of such documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">We think it clear that, under the rule prevailing in the federal courts, there was not sufficient foundation for the introduction of these exhibits. Church v. Hubbart, 2 Cranch, 187, 2 L. Ed. 249; The Alice (D. C.) 12 F. 923; American Surety Co. v. Sandberg (D. C.) 225 F. 150, affirmed (C. C. A. 9) 244 F. 701; Stein v. Bowman, 13 Pet. 209, 10 L.

Hub-hart, supra, is that a foreign judgment may bo authenticated (1) bjr an exemplification under the great seal; (2) by a copy proved to be a true copy; (3) by the certificate of an officer authorized by law, which certificate must itself be properly authenticated. See&gt; aiso, Stein v. Bowman, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">There is no proof in the record of the authority of C. Wilkinson to make the certificates. The certificate under seal of the consul does not meet the requirements, as there is no autliority in the consul to so certify. The rule of Church v. Hubbart, supra, is the common-law rule in America. Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 1681.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\"> If the Iowa statute may be invoked, and we refrain from expressing any opinion on that question, eopies of records and proceedings in courts of a foreign country may bo authenticated as follows: (1) By the official attestation of the clerk or officer in whose custody such records are usually kept; (2) by the certificate of one of the judges or magistrates of such court that the person so attesting is the clerk or officer legally intrusted with the custody of such records, and that the signature to his attestation is genuine; (3) by the official certificate of the officer who has the custody of the principal seal of the government under whose authority the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>is held, attested by said seal, stating that such court is duly constituted, specifying the general nature of its jurisdiction, and verifying the seal of the court. Iowa Code 1924, \u00a7 11308. But the government neither complied with the requirements of the common-law rule of Church v. Hubbart, supra, nor the Iowa Code. Neither can the admission of these documents be sustained under the ancient document rule. Documents coming from official custody and bearing on their face every evidence of age and authenticity, and which present an honest as well as ancient appearance, are admissible in evidence as ancient documents. With reference to such documents, it is only necessary to show that they are of the age of thirty years, and come from a natural and reasonable custody. McGuire v. Blount, 199 U. S. 142, 26 S. Ct. 1, 50 L. Ed. 125. But neither the certificates nor the photograph here offered are ancient, and there is no satisfactory proof that the will or the definitive judgment are correctly reproduced in the photostatic copy. In United States v. Ortiz, 176 U. S. 422, 20 S. Ct. 466, 44 L. Ed. 529, photographs of documents were hold to have been properly admitted in evidence where the photographer by whom the photographs were made testified as to the accuracy of the methods pursued and the results obtained by him. Certainly the photograph must be verified by some one. Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 790; 793; Stone v. Chicago, M. St. P. &amp; P. Ry. Co. (C. C. A. 8) 53 F.(2d) 813; Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v.

There is nothing in this record to authenticate the photograph of these documents, except the certificates above described, which are, for reasons stated, wholly inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">While the exhibits were improperly admitted in evidence, it does not necessarily follow that the error was prejudicial, and defendant is not entitled to a reversal of the judgment unless it appears that he has been denied some substantial right amounting to the denial of a fair trial. Judicial Code, \u00a7 269, title 28 USCA \u00a7 391; Beck v. United States, 62 App. D. C. 223, 66 F.(2d) 203; Goldstein v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 63 F.(2d) 609; Salerno v. United States (C. C.

A. 9) 248 F. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The purpose of the evidence was to show the falsehood of defendant\u2019s representations to the effect that he had a claim based upon the Francis Drake estate, or properly growing out of the provisions of his will. We know as a matter of history that Sir Francis Drake died in 1596, more than three centuries ago. It appears from competent evidence that there was no unsettled or unappropriated estate in existence which had formerly belonged to Sir Francis Drake, or any member' of his family. Admissions made by the defendant were proved which established beyond all peradventure of doubt that the claim he was making was to his knowledge spurious, fictitious, and without foundation. Expert testimony showed that any claim to the personal or real property of the estate would long since have been barred by the. statute of limitations and laches, and without any such proof we should know judicially that, based upon the common law of England as it existed at the time of the adoption of the first judiciary act, no such claim could now be successfully maintained. It appears in some parts of the record that defendant claims the right to recover vast sums from the British government through Sir Francis Drake, and expert evidence shows that such a claim could have no existence. The claim made by defendant that he had obtained from some one a claim against the Drake estate, or the right to recover it, was shown to be without foundation, because such a claim was not assignable. Defendant represented that his claim had been passed on by the ecclesiastical courts, but the evidence shows that such courts have had no jurisdiction of such a matter since 1857., Defendant claimed in his representations that he had secured certain rights in secret proceedings, while the evidence shows, and we know as a matter of history, that all courts and court proceedings in England are public. There was evidence that the defendant represented that the genealogy of Sir Francis Drake was made final in 1923 by the \u201cLords\u2019 and King\u2019s Commission,\u201d but the evidence shows that there never has been such a commission in England. Defendant represented that the Lord Chancellor had charge of the estate; that the archbishops and bishops desired further extension in the matter, but it was shown that under the laws of England none of these officials could have had anything to do with such a matter. Defendant claimed that his name was about to be changed to Sir Francis Drake, and he would be raised to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>peerage, boili of which are shown to be impossible. In this state of the evidence, the admission of the copy of the will and definitive sentence could not possibly have prejudiced defendant. His claim that he was either to have had a claim against or through the Sir Francis Drake estate was conclusively shown to have been false without any reference to the will or definitive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Post Office Inspector Williamson, in an interview with defendant, asked him where the Drake estate was. To this inquiry defendant waved his hands and said it was all over. In another interview he was asked where the Drake estate was, and said, \u201cI cannot tell you that offhand, it is all over the place.\u201d This was in December, 1932, and ho had been operating since 1922. He was asked if three years before he had not been requested to go to Scotland Yard in London, so that he could give information concerning the Drake estate. lie answered, \u201cYes, which I could not do.\u201d He was asked, \u201cAfter all this time you ought to be in a position to do so now.\u201d He said, \u201cI wish I was. I wish 1 was in a position to tell you everything. I would give you $5,000.00 to be in that position.\u201d He was also asked, \u201cIt amounts to this, Mr. Harteell, you cannot give us any information concerning the estate of -Sir Francis Drake, or any of the supposed heir?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo, I cannot myself personally; the estate is all over the place. That is my understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Defendant was interviewed in New York City by an Assistant United States District Attorney, who testified in the case. Defendant was asked, \u201cHow is the unclaimed Drake estate coming along?\u201d Defendant answered, \u201cThere is no such thing as an unclaimed Drake estate.\u201d This witness further testified as to what defendant said: \u201cSir Francis Drake had a. wife and child who were not known and that his claim came through them. I asked the name of his wife and child and he said, \u2018I cannot tell you.\u2019 I asked what the name of the child was through whom his claim arose. He said, \u2018I cannot tell you that.\u2019 I asked if he had the assignment with him. He said ho would not and could not tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">O. B. Williamson, a post office inspector, had an interview with defendant in which, he testified, defendant said, \u201cThere was no unclaimed estate anywhere, the estate was all over.\u201d Another witness testified that defendant told Mm in June, 1933, that he was not claiming the Sir Francis Drake estate, but it was the property that should have gone to an infant son who was defrauded out of Ms property.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Thomas W. Barnard, testifying to a conversation with the defendant in London, in June, 1930, testified as follows: \u201cHe said he first came to England during the wa r with a bunch of crooks, the principal among- whom was a woman or person named Whitaker; that he had carried on with them for some time but had dropped them as he was seared of the game and since 1921 had carried on a scheme in connection with a claim of the Sir Francis Drake estate. lie said that this estate consisted of many millions of pounds and that there were 1,100 acres right in the center of London which proved very attractive to his supporters. I asked Mm if he was making any money out of it and he said he was making plenty. He said that since 1921 the only business he bad done was in connection with this claim to the Sir Francis Drake estate. I said, knowing something of these estates that had been promoted before, that it was a wonder the authorities didn\u2019t get after him. He said, \u201cThey did take an indictment against me in the United States at one time, but I got away with it.\u2019 He then sa id, \u201cThis is a racket based on an old legend.\u2019 I asked him what the supporters or contributors would get out of this matter. He said he couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">There is nothing in the record to uphold or even give color to defendant\u2019s representations. For the most part they are not only false, but fantastic and absurd, many of them false as a matter of history, and many of them conclusively shown to be false as a matter of law. It appears that there is no semblance of fact upon which these representations are based, but they are figments of falsehood, and the admission in evidence of t'he purported copy of the will and definitive sentence added nothing in support of the government\u2019s case, and resulted in no possible prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">(5) Copies of certain statutes o\u00ed England wore identified by one Charles Challen, of the London, England, bar, and admitted in evidence. They were identified by this witness as being accepted as statute laws of England, and, while we do not think they had any particular bearing on the case, we think the statutes were sufficiently authenticated. Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 1684; Nashua Savings Bank v. Anglo-American Mtg., etc., Co., 189 U. S. 221, 23 S. Ct. 517, 47 L. Ed. 782. Certainly, their admission in evidence could not have been prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>(6) It is urged that certain of the indictment letters were not sufficiently identified, and that hence the court erred in admitting them in evidence. Otto G-. Yant testified that he lived at Mallard, Iowa, in 1931, and that Exhibit 10-B was a substantial copy of a letter which he received. Many letters and cablegrams from defendant were put in evidence, and this letter bears at least the indication of defendant\u2019s style of expression and trend of thought. At the time this exhibit was written, August 21, 1931, a fraud hearing had been held in Washington, D. C., and Yant, who had successfully solicited funds for defendant\u2019s enterprise, with others, had signed an affidavit in which they agreed to cease soliciting. Some considerable correspondence passed between defendant and Yant relative to these proceedings at Washington. Correspondence between defendant, his sister, Pearl Palmer, and Yant and others concerning this fraud order continued until Exhibit 10-B was written. This exhibit fits into all this correspondence. It goes back to the hearing before the postal department, and censures Yant and others for submitting to the \u201cembargo.\u201d In this exhibit defendant said, \u201cYou have not got the nerve to defy the officials and tell them to do their worst. * * * \u201d It closes with, \u201cI am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. Cochran, Biddle Stela, Osborne, Hinz, Carlson, Hartsoek, Landes and Brother and Sister Pearl and Ray.\u201d Pearl Palmer\u2019s husband\u2019s Christian name was Ray. The other persons were all agents of defendant. Landes testified' that he received a copy of this letter from London, and so did Osborne. As further identifying this letter in which defendant censures Yant, on July 31, 1931, Yant wrote to Hartzell referring again to the fraud hearing and the fact that Yant had agreed not to solicit for defendant. He added a postscript as follows: \u201cIf I have to be your official goat over here just whisper in my ear, please.\u201d Defendant sent a long cablegram to Yant on August 17, 1931, the last three lines of which axe as follows: \u201cAnswer to your postscript phrase. I don\u2019t need any official or any kind of goat. If I had I would have told you so.\u201d On August 18, 1931, Yant cabled defendant, saying, \u201cCan vindicate myself. You cannot prove your statements.\u201d On August 19, 1931, defendant cabled Yant as follows: \u201cCable received. I will prove all my statements when the time is right but not by cable. * * * I notice your cable was inspired by McCarty. He will also have to protect his sheepskin.\u201d On August 19, 1931, Yant cabled defendant, \u201cCable was not inspired by McCarty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The letter, Exhibit 10-B, contains many references to McCarty, an -attorney who apparently appeared on behalf of Yant and others at the fraud hearing in Washington. .The proof showed that the typewriting on this exhibit was the same as on other exhibits which defendant was shown to have admitted that he sent. Yant testified that, when he received the letter of which Exhibit 10-B was a copy, it made him very angry and he destroyed it. The exhibit in evidence was shown to have been received by Hartsoek through the mail. Where the contents of a letter reveal a knowledge or other trait peculiarly referable to a single person, a sufficient foundation is laid for its receipt in evidence. Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 2148; People v. Dunbar Contracting Co., 215 N. Y. 416, 109 N. E. 554; State v. Freshwater, 30 Utah, 442, 85 P. 447, 116 Am. St. Rep. 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">What has been said with reference to Exhibit 10-B is equally true of Exhibits 9-B, 11-B, 12-C, 13-B, 14A-D, 15-B, and 15-C. In addition, these last-named exhibits were identified as coming from defendant, and Exhibits 9-B, 11-B, and 12-C were further identified by expert testimony as being in the handwriting of defendant. All of these exhibits, including Exhibit 10-B, were delivered through the United States mail in the Northern District of Iowa. Exhibits 14A-D, 15 \u2014 B, and 15-C are copies of cablegrams sent through the mail by defendant to Hartsoek. Kramer, who possessed a power of attorney from Hartzell, on September 12, 1932, cabled defendant in London that he was working but donations were falling off, and requested news, saying, \u201cAnswer me to Willowlake, South Dakota until Wednesday.\u201d On September 14, 1932, defendant wired Kramer a cable in reply, which is prefaced with, \u201cCable received.\u201d On September 17, 1932, Kramer cabled a reply, and on September 18, 1932, received a cablegram from defendant addressed to him at Adrian, Minn. The originals were destroyed. These copies, Exhibits 14A-D, were mailed from London. The principle above referred to is equally applicable to these exhibits. There is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that they were mailed bjr defendant. Cochran v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 41 F.(2d) 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Exhibits 15-B and 15-C are also copies of cablegrams sent from London to Hartsoek at Laurens, Iowa. Landes, another agent of defendant, testified that he received the orig-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>i nal cablegrams and destroyed them. Dr. Nitzke testified that he received similar copies through the United States mail at Storm Lake, Iowa, sent from London.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Exhibits 78-A, 79 \u2014 A, and 80-A were written by contributors to the fund and mailed, Exhibit 78-A being mailed to Senator Smith W. Brookhart and 79-A and 80-A being mailed to the Postmaster General and the Attorney General. They were all requests to clo nothing to hinder defendant in his work, and were written at Hart-z ell\u2019s suggestion and request.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Exhibit 32-A is a letter purporting to be from Amos Hartsock to W. L. Mauney at Rochester, Minn., where Mauney received it through the United States mail May 25,1932. Inclosed with this letter were \u00edyvo bulletins relating to operations. The matter Yiras mailed at Laurens, loYva. Hartsock testified I hat he was mailing out bulletins similar to Exhibits 32-B and 32-C, inclosed with 32-A. We think sufficient foundation was laid for the admission of all these exhibits in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Hartsock admitted Yvriting the Exhibit 77-A, addressed to Hay Fear, Bronson, Iowa, stamping it and putting it in the United States mail, at Laurens, Iowa.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> The above are all the so-called indictment letters. Not only was proper foundation for their admission established, but the use of the mails within the Northern District of Iowa Yvas thereby clearly shown. There were other attending circumstances to show mailing by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">(7) Exhibit 48 Yvas a photostat of several pages of handwriting, dated February 9, 1925, addressed to <em>W. </em>E. Owen, Des Moines, \u00a1OYva, signed 0. M. Hartzell, together with the photostat of an envelope attached thereto. A handwriting expert testified that, comparing the writing in this exhibit with proved handwriting of defendant, he was of the opinion that the exhibit and the standards were written by the same person. The same record was made as to Exhibits 40, 44, 45, 46, and 47, and these photostatic copies of letters were admitted in evidence upon testimony from the expert that they Yvere written by the same person Yvho Yvrote the standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">It is the contention of defendant that the court erred in admitting these letters in evidence, and that photographs were not a proper basis for purposes of comparison. There is no doubt but that formerly courts held that comparing photographic copies of handwriting with original specimens was not to be permitted, as it was feared that certainty could not be assured because there was the hazard that there might be errors or differences in copying. As pointed out by Professor Wigmoro, Yvhother because of a development in the art, or a change in judicial approach to the question, or both, this is not now the law. Ho says: \u201cA photographic copy of handwriting may be used instead of the original so far as the accuracy of the medium is concerned.\u201d Wigmore, \u00a7 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">Other questions are involved as to thescoxliibits; the first being the failure to produce the originals. The destruction of Exhibits 40, 44, to 48, inclusive, by Owen, who received them, was shown. The other three letters were shown to have been given by Owen to a post office inspector who lived in Des Moines. If the case turned on the propriety of using this secondary evidence as to these three letters, it would seem that defendant\u2019s objection to the use of secondary evidence should be sustained. However, in this particular ease, these three letters are similar in import and substance to the other five, and hence no prejudice could result. Mr. Owen testified that he was reasonably sure that these were copies of letters he received. The court committed no prejudicial error in the challenged ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">(8) The defendant objected to the introduction in evidence of Exhibits 10-B, 11 \u2014 B, 12-C, 13-B, 14, and 15. These are the so-called indictment letters. The basis of the objection is that W. G. Henning, qualified as an expert in handwriting, was permitted to identify these exhibits which were typewritten, using other typewriter standards. The signature on these exhibits was typcYvritten as well as the body. Tho objection interposed was that it was \u201cincompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, no proper foundation has been laid, and calling for speculation and surmise,\u201d and also \u201can attempt to usurp the function of the jury on a matter on which expert testimony is not proper.\u201d The question of the identity or similarity of two or more pieces of typewriting may be the subject of expert testimony. Bartholomew v. Walsh, 191 Mich. 252, 157 N. W. 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">It is noted that the objection did not sharply call the attention of the court to the precise question noYV urged, and it is too general to present it for review. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. Hall (C. C. A. 8) 66 F. 868; Wabash R. Co. v. Lewis (C. C. A. 8) 48 F.(2d) 519. The objection that expert testimony was not proper seems to indicate that defendant\u2019s counsel considered ihe qualifiea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tions either as proved or unimportant. He should not now be permitted to shift his grounds in this court. If the matter now urged had been called to the attention of the trial court and to opposing counsel, it might readily have been cured. The objection that \u201cno foundation was laid\u201d is too vague to call this point to the court\u2019s attention. Karlen v. Trebble, 45 S. D. 570, 189 N. W. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">(9) Defendant objected to the introduction in evidence of Exhibits 83-A.to C, inclusive. These are copies of letters and a cable from defendant to Dr. Cochran, which the witness Kuhnes received from E. W. Clark. Clark obtained $205 from Kuhnes as a contribution to the fund. Exhibit 83-B is the same as another exhibit, Exhibit 4, which was received in evidence, and Exhibit 83-A is, very similar to Exhibit 3, which was received in evidence. Here again the subject-matter and style of these three exhibits furnish additional evidence of their being used as a means of furthering defendant\u2019s scheme, and of authenticity. Again, no possible prejudice could have resulted because of their similarity, actual or substantial, to other exhibits received in evidence, either without objection or upon uneontroverted foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Another exhibit, No. 88, was objected to. This is the affidavit in which the witness Tant and others agreed to cease having any connection with the defendant\u2019s enterprise and to refuse any remittances of money in connection therewith. This affidavit was admitted on one ground, and that was that defendant, in writing to Tant, referred to it. The government was seeking to establish the authenticity of this letter Exhibit 10-B, and, like any other fact that was referred to in it (e. g., persons, events, etc.), could be put in evidence to aid in the identification of the exhibit, to show what was referred to. If admissible for that purpose, it was properly in evidence, and, if defendant desired that its effect should be limited to that purpose, he should have asked a ruling to the effect, or requested an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">(10) Defendant complains 'that the court erred in sustaining objections interposed to certain abstract questions propounded to an expert on English law. This examination covered a wide field of abstract questions. Their materiality was not mad,e to appear, but the short answer to the argument here is that there was no proffer of proof, and neither the lower court nor this eourt was advised as to what it was claimed the witness, if permitted, would testify. Clauson v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 60 F.(2d) 694; Hatch v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 34 F.(2d) 436; Federal Surety Co. v. Standard Oil Co. (C. C. A. 8) 32 F.(2d) 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">(11) The government was permitted to show that, after defendant was released on bail in this ease, and prior to indictment, he attended a meeting at Sioux City, Iowa, on February 24, 1933, at which he said the Drake estate would be closed by June 1st; that he would need $2,000 a week until that time to close the estate; and that his present deficit was $15,000. It seems those present concluded that the best defense for the defendant would be the closing of the Drake estate, and to this end they appointed a receiver of a defense fund and raised $68,000 between February 24, 1933, and May 1, 1933. Other similar statements were made by the defendant. On November 9, 1926, he wrote, \u201cThe time is getting short and nearer every day.\u201d On March 29, 1928, he wrote, \u201cThey agreed to settle and turn over possession immediately after feaster vacation, 1928.\u201d On August 2,1929, he wrote, \u201cDelivery and complete settlement will be made before the end of August, 1929.\u201d On November 16, 1931, he wrote, \u201cNobody knows a week ahead about the finish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">In prosecutions of this character, great latitude is allowed in the introduction in evidence of attending circumstances. Smith v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 267 F. 665. \u201cThe competency of a collateral fact to be used as the basis of legitimate argument is not to be determined by the eonelusiveness of the inferences it may afford in reference to the litigated fact. It is enough if these may tend, even in a slight degree, to elucidate the inquiry, or to assist, though remotely, to a determination probably founded in truth.\u201d Williamson v. United States, 207 U. S. 425, 28 S. Ct. 163, 172, 52 L. Ed. 278. False statements outside the scheme charged are competent to show the defendant\u2019s fraudulent intent. Busch v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 52 F.(2d) 79; United States v. Sprinkle (C. C. A. 2) 57 F.(2d) 968; Vause v. United States (C. C. A. 2) 53 F.(2d) 346. The evidence admissible to establish the scheme and the intent may be extensive in scope and rests largely within the discretion of the trial judge. These admissions tended to show the nature of the scheme, the falsity of the representations, and the knowledge and intent of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>VI. Complaint is made that the court unduly limited defendant\u2019s counsel in his cross-examination of the witness Amos Ilarisoek. A defendant is entitled as a matter of right to have an opportunity of fairly and fully cross-examining the witnesses appearing against him. A denial of this right is usually prejudicial error. It is only after the right of cross-examination has been substantially and thoroughly exorcised that the allowance of further cross-examination becomes discretionary with the trial court. Heard v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 255 F. 829; Cossack v. United States (C. C. A. 9) 63 F.(2d) 511; Minner v. United States (C. C. A. 10) 57 F.(2d) 506; Galinden v. United States (C. C. A. 1) 19 F.(2d) 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The witness Hartsoek was one of defendant\u2019s agents in this country, who sent out some bulletins and circulars and made speeches as to the source of his information. It was shown that defendant had approved the whole of these bulletins and circulars. Further cross-examination as to reference in his speeches to a Miss Dietrich, a school teacher who had gone to England to investigate the matter, and to the witnesses talking to a Rev. Nestander about investigations he had made, were, we think, properly refused. The witness was asked if certain exhibits that had been taken from him by the sheriff of Pocahontas county, Iowa, had been taken near the town of Laurens, Iowa, and the letters taken from their envelopes and containers and shown promiscuously to the people after they had been seized. No error was committed in sustaining objections to such questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">A witness, Mr. Yout, identified a. letter addressed to him from defendant, which contained a reference to an \u201coriginal Scotland Yard letter.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel was not permitted to cross-examine the witness as to the Scotland Yard letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Counsel also complains because a question asked on extended cross-examination of the witness Charles Challen as to the Judicature Act of .1833 was not answered because an objection was sustained, but counsel fails to show how in any way this act had any possible bearing on the case or how cross-examination of this witness would have been material. Bonner v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 46 F.(2d) 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">VII. It is also contended by defendant that the use of his signature on a bail bond as a standard for comparison and proof of his handwriting on other exhibits was vio-</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In Holt v. United States, supra, the court said: \u201cBut the prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material. The objection in principio would forbid a jury to look at a prisoner and compare his features with a photograph in proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">The bond was voluntarily given. Where rights are availed of without objection, there is no compulsion. Czarlinsky v. United States (C. C. A. 10) 54 F.(2d) 889; Lefkowitz v. United States Attorney (C. C. A. 2) 52 F.(2d) 52. In the last-cited case, the accused wrote a letter at the request of an officer, to secure release on bail. The primary purpose of the officer was to obtain a sample of defendant\u2019s typewriting and her signature. It was held that the provision against self-incrimina,lion had not been infringed. We are clear that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself was not infringed in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>VIII. The court in its instructions, after stating that the opinion of the court on faets was not binding upon the jury, and that they should understand the court\u2019s views were merely to aid the jury in arriving at its own conelusion, and that the jury was not bound in any way upon any question of fact, said: \u201cNow, with that caution I will say to you, gentlemen, that I have listened to all this evidence as intently as you have I think, and in the opinion of the court the government has established the facts which ought to convinee reasonable men beyond a reasonable doubt, and taking the evidence as a whole I think the government has established the allegations of- these^several counts that remain in the indictment. v ,</p>\n<p id=\"Ai6o\">This instruction is vigorously assailed as erroneous and prejudicial, and great reliance is placed upon the opinion in United States v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389, 54 S. Ct. 223, 78 L. Ed. 381. In the Murdock Case, however, 'there was a serious question of whether or not the defendant had acted willfully within the meaning of the statute. The trial judge may, of course, analyze the evidence or comment upon it, and may express his views with reference thereto, always advising the jury that the decision on the issues of fact is left to the jury.^ In the instant case, there is no question of intent or wilfullness, and the evidence may be said to be undisputed. The expression of an opinion under such circumstances is little more than advising the jury that the faets as proved are sufficient in law to constitute the offense charged. As said by the court in Horning v. District of Columbia, 254 U. S. 135, 41 S. Ct. 53, 54, 65 L. Ed. 185: \u201cThe facte were not in dispute, and what he did was to say s\u00f3 and to lay down the law applicable to them. In such a case obviously the fu\u00f1etion of the jury if they do their duty is little more than formal. The judge cannot direet a verdict it is true, and the jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both law and faets. But the judge always has the right and duty to tell them what the law is upon this or that state of faets that may be found, and he can do the same none the less when the facte are agreed. If the facte are agreed the judge may state that fact also, and when there is no dispute he may say so although there has been no formal agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AkX\">In the instant ease, according to the undisputed evidence, a fraud has been earried on for years, and these undisputed facts constitute a violation of the statute with which the defendant was charged, and we are of the view that it was proper for the court, in its discretion, so to advise the jury, Quercia v. United States, 289 U. S. 466, 53 S. Ct. 698, 77 L. Ed. 1321; Cook v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 18 F.(2d) 50. The undisputed facts in this ease can give rise to no conflicting inferences. It is impossible that any inference of innocence or honesty can be predicated upon this record, and if, as is stated in the Murdock Case, the trial judge has the power to express his opinion as to the guilt of the defendant, it would seem that this is a proper ease for the exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AMD\"> Defendant also complains of the ingfcruetion of the court to the effect that more details were alleged in the indictment than were necessary to prove. This did not amount to an amendment of the indictment, That could only be done by action of the grand jury. Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1, 7 S. Ct. 781, 30 L. Ed. 849. Disregarding surplusage, however, is not in the nature of an amendment. Ford v. United States, 273 U. S. 593, 47 S. Ct. 531, 71 L. Ed. 793.</p>\n<p id=\"AbX\">W]lile it is no1. ^^6 as error, the rceord M printed indicates that the court su6mitted to the jury a count that had been dismissed, and failed to submit to the jury coun^ y^ remained in the indictment, \u2018W'Deth.ei\u2019 the record is correct or not in this ^ we need not stop to inquire; because it must be aceepted as a verity in this court, not baving. been correeted nor amended.</p>\n<p id=\"AMI\">It appears that the judgment and sentence is not upon each count, but there is a combination or grouping into two sentences, one on counts 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the other on counts 5, 6, 7,16,11, 13,14, and 15. After the five-year sentence on the first group has been served, the five-year sentence on the second group is to he effective. In other words, a concurrent sentence is made as to counts, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a concurrent sentence as to the other counts. \u2022 The sentence on these combined offenses does not exceed that which could have been imposed on any one of the counts included, and hence the error with respect to one of the counts is without prejudice and may be disregarded, Busch v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 52 F.(2d) 79; Dickerson v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 20 F.(2d) 901; Brooks v. United States, 267 U. S. 432, 45 S. Ct. 345, 69 L. <em>Ed. </em>699, 37 A. L. R. 1407.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae9\">We have considered all the other alleged errors, but are of the view that they present no substantial question or prejudicial error, The defendant in this case has been ably de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>fended; lie has been accorded a fair trial by the lower court; and has been found guilty by the jury. The record conclusively establishes Ms guilt beyond all peradventure of doubt. What was said by this court in Smith v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 267 F. 665, 670, is here apposite. We there said: \u201cThe evidence of the guilt of these defendants was so conclusively established that, even if there had been some error in the admission of evidence, and we do not hold that there was, the modern law so clearly stated by Judge Hook in Williams v. United States (C. C. A.) 265 F. 625 (opinion filed April 29, 1920), applies. Judge Hook there said: \u2018Whether prejudice results from the erroneous admission of evidence at a trial is a question that should not be considered abstractly or by way of detachment. The question is one of practical effect, when the trial as a whole and all the circumstances of the proofs are regarded. * * It is manifest that he was not prejudiced by the admission of the testimony to which reference has been made.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ayae\">Convinced as we are that no injustice lias been done tliis defendant, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
