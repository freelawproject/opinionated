United States, </em>No. 98-786C (Fed.Cl. Aug. 30, 2002). We affirm the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision that the plaintiffs were not entitled to per diem compensation, but we vacate and remand with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for remote duty pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b856-20\">The plaintiffs were employed at various times by the Office of Environmental Health and Engineering, Alaska Area Native Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cthe agency\u201d). The agency hired the plaintiffs to perform construction work in sparsely populated and undeveloped areas of western Alaska that were difficult to access. Beginning in 1993, the plaintiffs\u2019 positions were converted to seasonal appointments. The agency\u2019s announcement for the positions the plaintiffs held read: \u201cExtensive travel to communities throughout Alaska is required, often in small unpressurized aircraft. Normally long periods of residence in small bush communities will be required.\u201d (App. at 18.) The plaintiffs lived at each successive worksite. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>agency did not promise to provide housing at the worksites for the plaintiffs, it typically made arrangements for nearby housing, which was often rudimentary. Every time one of the plaintiffs was assigned to a different construction project, the agency made that project his permanent duty station. Assignments lasted from several weeks to over a year. The plaintiffs received neither per diem nor remote duty pay while they were at their duty stations, but they received per diem pay \u201cif [they] were away from the worksite and away from [their] homes while working.\u201d (App. at 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In early 1998, a tribal organization elected to take over the construction projects for which the plaintiffs were employed. <em>See Thompson v. Cherokee Nation of Okla., </em>334 F.3d 1075, 1079-81 (Fed.Cir. 2003) (discussing the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act, Pub.L. No. 93-638, 88 Stat. 2203 (1975) (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 450-450n (2000))). The plaintiffs, most then still employed by the agency,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were subjected to reduction-in-force actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">On October 13, 1998, the plaintiffs brought suit in the Court of Federal Claims. They sought, <em>inter alia, </em>per diem pay pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5702 for the period of their employment. On March 7, 2000, the plaintiffs, with leave of the Court of Federal Claims, amended their complaint to include an alternative claim for remote worksite pay pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942(a). On April 27, 2000, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment with respect to their alternative per diem and remote worksite pay claims. On June 30, 2000, the government opposed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and cross-moved for summary judgment. The government argued that, because each worksite to which one of the plaintiffs had been assigned was designated by the agency as that plaintiffs permanent duty station, the plaintiffs were not entitled to per diem pay. With respect to remote duty pay, the government argued that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942 applies \u201conly to instances where an employee\u2019s daily commute to and from his work-site results in hardship.\u201d (Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">The Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment for the government, holding that the agency\u2019s \u201csystem of successive transfers upon completion of projects was a permissible personnel practice which does not produce liability for per diem payments.\u201d <em>Agwiak, </em>slip op. at 4. With respect to remote duty pay, the court held that, \u201c[a]s plaintiffs\u2019 duty stations were their remote worksites, commuting, as such, did not occur, and no basis for liability pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942 has been established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">We review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment without deference. <em>Scott Timber Co. v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1358, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">This case presents two issues. The first of these is whether the Court of Federal Claims properly held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to per diem compensation because each of the duty stations to which they were assigned was a permanent duty station. In this respect, we agree with the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">The statute that authorizes per diem payments provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-15\">Under regulations prescribed pursuant to section 5707 of this title, an employee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>when traveling on official business away from the employee\u2019s designated post of duty ... is entitled to ... a per diem allowance....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5702(a)(1) (2000). \u201cThe purpose of per diem is to reimburse an employee for meals and lodging while on temporary duty while he also maintains a residence at his permanent duty station.\u201d <em>Matter of: Frederick C. Welch, </em>62 Comp. Gen. 80, 84 (1982). It is not contested that the agency successively changed the plaintiffs\u2019 permanent duty stations each time they were assigned to a new work area. The plaintiffs contend, however (as best we understand it), that if an employee is assigned to a duty station for a short period of time here periods ranging from a few weeks to more than a year (1) that station cannot be a permanent duty station; (2) the agency must designate some other place as the permanent duty station; and (3) per diem compensation must be paid while the employee is away from that permanent duty station.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">In this respect, plaintiffs rely on a decision by the Comptroller General in <em>Comptroller General Warren to the National Housing Administration, </em>23 Comp. Gen. 162 (1943) <em>(\u201cWarren\u201d). </em>In <em>Warren, </em>the Comptroller General concluded that, because it is necessary \u201cto designate some place as the headquarters or official station of itinerant employees,\u201d the \u201cofficial station\u201d for itinerant employees ordinarily should be the \u201ccentral place from which their orders emanate and to which their reports go for consideration and on the basis of which administration action is taken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164. That decision is of course not binding on us, <em>see Cherokee Nation of Okla., </em>334 F.3d at 1084, and it is distinguishable in any event. In <em>Warren, </em>the itinerant employees were \u201cexpected to travel continuously\u201d within a region to which they were assigned or among several such regions. <em>Id. </em>at 162. In contrast, the plaintiffs in this case lived at a particular worksite for the duration of their assignment to the site. Although their assignments were often brief, the plaintiffs were not traveling \u201ccontinuously.\u201d Furthermore, unlike in this case, the agency in <em>Warren </em>sought to designate no official station for the employees, designating them instead as a special class of \u201citinerant employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the agency continually updated the plaintiffs\u2019 permanent duty stations as they were reassigned. Thus, the employees always had \u201csome place\u201d as their permanent duty station, unlike the situation in <em>Warren.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">We hold that an agency can designate a station as a permanent duty station, even if an employee is assigned to it for only a short period, so long as the employee is not assigned to another permanent duty station. Under these circumstances, the plaintiffs were not traveling \u201caway from the employee\u2019s designated post of duty,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5702(a)(1), and they were not entitled to per diem compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">This leads then to the plaintiffs\u2019 second contention \u2014 that if these locations were the employees\u2019 permanent duty stations, they are entitled to remote duty pay under section 5942, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">[A]n employee of an Executive department or an independent establishment who is assigned to duty, except temporary duty, <em>at a site so remote from the nearest established communities or suitable places of residence as to require an appreciable degree of expense, hardship, and inconvenience, </em>beyond that normally encountered in metropolitan commuting, on the part of the employee in commuting to and from his residence and such worksite, is entitled, in addition to pay otherwise due him, to an allowance of not to exceed $10 a day. <em>The allowance shall be paid under </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number><em>regulations prescribed by the President establishing the rates at which the allowance will be paid and defining and designating those sites, areas, and groups of positions to which the rates apply.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942(a) (2000) (emphases added). The Court of Federal Claims, adopting the government\u2019s arguments, rejected this contention on the ground that \u201ccompensation pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942 depends upon establishing that the commuting to and from the worksites required \u2018... an appreciable degree of expense, hardship, and inconvenience, beyond that normally encountered in metropolitan commuting.\u2019 \u201d <em>Agwiak, </em>slip op. at 4 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942). Because \u201ccommuting, as such, did not occur\u201d between the plaintiffs\u2019 duty stations and the remote worksites, the court held that \u201cno basis for liability pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942 has been established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the government candidly admits that this was erroneous. Neither the statute nor the regulations require that the employee be engaged in daily commuting. Rather, the statute is directed to a situation where commuting is unpractical or particularly onerous. Thus, section 591.306(a) of the Code of Federal Regulations authorizes an allowance rate when \u201cthe employee remains at the work-site at the' direction of management because daily commuting is impractical.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.306(a) (2003). The regulations also provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">[A] duty post shall be determined to be a remote duty post for [remote duty pay] eligibility purposes when ... [d ] <em>aily commuting is impractical </em>because the location of the duty post and available transportation are such that <em>agency management requires employees to remain at the duty post for their workweek as a normal and continuing part of the conditions of employment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 591.304(a)(2) (2003) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Nonetheless, the government urges that, even though the ground for the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision was incorrect, the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction because the statute and regulations are not money-mandating. Rather, the government argues, the regulations \u201cmerely reflect [the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s] delegation of authority to the agencies.\u201d (Gov\u2019t Br. at 16.) We disagree. The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (2000), constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to claims over which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983). However, the Tucker Act alone \u201cdoes not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages.\u201d <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). Instead, in a context such as this, another statute or regulation must be money-mandating to create such a substantive right against the government. <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 218, 103 S.Ct. 2961; <em>Martinez v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1295, 1302-03 (Fed.Cir.2003) (en banc). The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that a statute is money-mandating \u201cif, but only if, it can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.\u201d <em>United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, </em>537 U.S. 465, 472, 123 S.Ct. 1126, 155 L.Ed.2d 40 (2003) (internal citations omitted). \u201cIt is enough ... that a statute creating a Tucker Act right be reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages. While the premise to a Tucker Act claim will not be lightly inferred, a fair inference will do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>more, a statute can be money-mandating even if the government enjoys some discretion under it. <em>Bradley v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 1578, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1989) (\u201cThere are limits, of course, to the discretion inherent in [the prevailing pay rate statutes].... Inasmuch as discretion is not unlimited, the statute must be deemed to be a pay-mandating statute.\u201d (alteration in original) (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The relevant statute in this case provides that an employee at a remote duty site \u201cis entitled\u201d to the remote duty allowance. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942(a). The statute further provides that \u201c[t]he allowance <em>shall be paid </em>under regulations prescribed by the President.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We have repeatedly recognized that the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d generally makes a statute money-mandating. <em>See, e.g., McBryde v. United States, </em>299 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>Huston v. United States, </em>956 F.2d 259, 261-62 (Fed.Cir. 1992); <em>Grav v. United States, </em>886 F.2d 1305, 1307 (Fed.Cir.1989). Indeed, we have held that 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204 is money-mandating, and it contains substantively identical language to the statute at issue here: \u201cThe following persons <em>are entitled </em>to the basic pay of the pay grade to which assigned or distributed,\u201d 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (2000) (emphasis added). <em>See, e.g., Martinez, </em>333 F.3d at 1303 (acknowledging that 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204 is money-mandating); <em>Holley v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1462, 1465 (Fed.Cir.1997) (\u201cIt is well established that 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204 (\u2018Pay and Allowances of the Uniformed Services\u2019) serves as the money-mandating statute applicable to military personnel claiming damages and ancillary relief for wrongful discharge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Moreover, the implementing regulations for section 5942(a) contain similar language. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a) (2003) (requiring that \u201ca duty post shall be determined to be a remote duty post\u201d when certain criteria are satisfied); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.306(a) (2003) (requiring that remote duty pay \u201cshall be paid to each employee with a permanent duty station at or within a remote post of duty approved under \u00a7 591.304\u201d). We therefore hold that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5942(a) and its implementing regulations are money-mandating.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The government argues alternatively that the plaintiffs here have not shown that the duty stations have in fact been classified as remote. The government is correct that the ultimate burden of proof is on the plaintiffs, but it misconceives the standard of proof on summary judgment. Summary judgment is properly granted if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d CFC Rule 56(c). Whether the plaintiffs\u2019 duty stations were indeed designated remote by the agency is a material fact, and the government, as the moving party, was required to demonstrate in its motion that no genuine issue existed as to it. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Bubble Room, Inc. v. United States, </em>159 F.3d 553, 561 (Fed.Cir. 1998). Here, however, the government\u2019s summary judgment motion was limited to a different issue. It sought summary judgment only on the ground that the statute did not apply to the plaintiffs because they did not commute, and the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition and the decision of the Court of Federal Claims addressed only this issue. The government made no showing that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the agency had designated the plaintiffs\u2019 duty stations as remote. On remand, this issue must be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">The plaintiffs also argue that, even if it turns out that the duty stations were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>designated as remote by the agency, the Court of Federal Claims should determine whether the sites should have been designated as remote sites under the criteria in section 591.304 of the regulations, which require that the agency and the Office of Personnel Management designate a duty station as remote under certain clearly defined circumstances. Section 591.304(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">[A] duty post <em>shall </em>be determined to be a remote duty post for basic allowance eligibility purposes when ... [d]aily commuting is impractical because the location of the duty post and available transportation are such that <em>agency management requires employees to remain at the duty post for their workweek as a normal and continuing part of the conditions of employment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a)(2) (emphases added). Furthermore, the regulations also provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">An authorized allowance rate <em>shall be paid </em>to each employee with a permanent duty station at or within a remote post of duty approved under \u00a7 591.304, regardless of type of appointment or work schedule, only ... [when] the employee <em>remains at the worksite at the direction of management because daily commuting is impractical.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 591.306(a) (emphases added). The plaintiffs allege that the agency required the plaintiffs to remain at their duty stations while working there and that section 591.304(a)(2) requires the agency to designate the plaintiffs\u2019 duty stations as remote duty posts and to pay the plaintiffs remote duty pay pursuant to section 591.306(a). The government apparently suggests that this claim is non-justiciable because the standards leave so much discretion to the agency. <em>See, e.g., Voge v. United States, </em>844 F.2d 776, 780 (Fed.Cir.1988) (\u201cA controversy is \u2018justiciable\u2019 only if it is \u2018one which the courts can finally and effectively decide, under tests and standards which they can soundly administer within their special field of competence.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Greene v. McElroy, </em>254 F.2d 944, 953 (D.C.Cir.1958), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959))). We disagree. Determining whether a worksite is remote under section 591.304(a)(2) is a relatively simple matter, requiring no determinations of a discretionary nature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">The factual inquiry is spelled out by the regulations. A duty post is a remote duty post if \u201cagency management requires employees to remain at the duty post for their workweek as a normal and continuing part of the conditions of employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a)(2); <em>see also </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.306(a). However, section 591.306(c) limits the application of the remote duty pay regulations, excluding those who reside at the remote duty post for their own convenience. Section 591.306(c) provides: \u201cAn employee who <em>resides permanently, or temporarily for his or her own convenience </em>at a remote duty post is not eligible for an authorized allowance rate during his or her period of residence.\u201d 5 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>\u00a7 591.306(c) (emphasis added); see <em>also </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.302(b) (2003). Therefore, those who reside at the remote duty post <em>\u201cfor his or her own convenience,\u201d </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.306(c) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a)(2), as opposed to those who remain at the duty post during the workweek <em>at the direction of the agency, </em>are ineligible for remote duty pay. The Court of Federal Claims is competent to make such determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">On the merits, although the plaintiffs allege that there is no dispute that they remained at the worksites at the direction of the agency, rather than for their own convenience, the government disagrees. We believe that the matter should be addressed in the first instance by the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision as to per diem compensation, and we vacate the decision with regard to the issue of remote duty pay and remand this case to the Court of Federal Claims for further proceedings. On remand, the court must determine (1) whether the worksites were designated as remote duty stations; (2) if not, whether they should have been so designated pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a)(2); and (3) if the sites were remote duty sites, whether the plaintiffs resided at the sites for their own convenience or whether they remained there at the direction of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED-IN-PART, VACATED-IN-PART, and REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-7\">. Alf Skaflestad and Carl Fanning had previously retired. John Williams had previously been dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. No claim is made here that the agency can be required to designate the sites as remote pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a)(1), which sets forth criteria for determining when a worksite is remote because it is far from \"the nearest established community or suitable place of residence.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a)(1). Nor is a claim made that the agency can be required to designate the sites as remote pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a)(3), which states that a duty post shall be determined to be remote \"on an individual location basis\" when \"commuting conditions result in expense, inconvenience, or hardship significantly greater that that encountered in metropolitan area commuting.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.304(a)(3). Thus, we need not decide whether such claims would be justicia-ble.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
