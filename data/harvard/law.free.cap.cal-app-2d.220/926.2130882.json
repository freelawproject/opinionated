J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aaid\">This case comes to us from the Appellate Department of the Los Angeles Superior Court. It is in the identical procedural posture as <em>People </em>v. <em>Randazzo, ante, </em>p. 768 [34 Cal.Rptr. 65] filed this date, and involves the precise legal question decided in that case. Upon the grounds and for the reasons stated in <em>Randazzo, </em>the order and judgment from which the People have appealed are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">Ashburn, J., and Herndon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 28, 1963, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 27, 1963. Peters, J., and Tobriner, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
