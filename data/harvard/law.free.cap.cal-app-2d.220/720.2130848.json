Code, \u00a7 274) upon Mrs. Dorothy Schwartz on September 1, 1961, defendant, a medical doctor specializing as an internist, appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Counsel\u2019s principal argument is insufficiency of the evidence, a position which the record plainly does not support. The \u201c \u2018test on appeal is whether there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. It is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poindexter, </em>51 Cal.2d 142, 148 [330 P.2d 763].)  We must accept as established all evidence favorable to the respondent and assume that the jury rejected, as it had a right to do, that or any part of that presented by the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daugherty, </em>40 Cal.2d 876, 885 [256 P.2d 911]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778].) Thus arrayed, the proofs show the following sequence of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Mrs. Schwartz, who was in perfect health, was advised by her family physician that she was pregnant and she so believed. Through a friend, Don MeCandless, she located and made an appointment to see defendant. She arrived at his office in Los Angeles at about 3 p.m. on Friday, September 1, 1961, being driven in her car by Mr. MeCandless. After waiting a while in the reception room they were invited by defendant into his private office. They entered and both were present at the conversation then had. Mrs. Schwartz told defendant she had a very unwanted pregnancy and understood he was going to take care of the situation for her. He asked where she got that idea and she said an appointment had been made for her. Defendant said he would not do it. She cried and begged him and he brought up the question of the fee, inquiring if she had any idea what that would cost. At this point, according to the testimony of Mc-Candless, \u201cthey started haggling over the terms.\u201d She said she had been told it would be $300. \u201c \u2018Well, that just shows how misinformed you are because that is the price that it used to be, but it costs much more than that.\u2019 And I asked him what it cost, and he said, \u2018$500.00.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I didn\u2019t have that much money.\u2019 He says, \u2018How much money do you have?\u2019 And I said I had $300.00.\u201d Mrs. Schwartz then asked MeCandless if he had money, as she pulled out her own wallet. He gave the doctor $100 and she produced and handed him $310, whereupon he agreed to perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>operation. No receipt for the $410 was requested or given. The automobile was parked at the curb so defendant told McCandless to move it, come back and wait in the waiting room and not leave. He did place it in a less conspicuous place and waited in the office as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In the examining room defendant had Mrs. Schwartz go to the toilet, remove her undergarment, lie on the table with the stirrups in the operating room, and he gave her two injections of penicillin. First he inserted a speculum into her vaginal cavity, then inserted something else which \u201cfelt like it was being attached to me, and a very painful pulling, and I think that was done about seven or eight different times. .. . Well, we went through this pulling routine for a long time, and I kept asking him if he was about through, and he said just a few more minutes. And then when he was through with that pulling, he went in and did a scraping sensation.\u201d Also: \u201cBy the time he was through with the scraping, the speculum fell out on its own, and he did no more inserting of instruments, but he did put in a packing, a gauze packing that had quite a few knots in the tail, and he told me to leave that packing in until the following morning, and then to take it out myself.\u201d The pain was so very excruciating that she screamed and defendant told her several times to quiet down. During the operation defendant told her she was about two months pregnant and \u201cthat I was no longer pregnant, when he completed the operation he said I had no longer any pregnancy.\u201d She was told to go home, to bed and stay flat for five days. Going through the office on her way out she reached for one of defendant\u2019s cards on the desk but was told by him not to take one, and not to call him under any circumstances; that if she felt she had to see him to come on the following Thursday after 10 a.m. Defendant also said everything was fine and anything that happened would be normal. He gave her no pills to take with her. Through that evening and Saturday she was quite uncomfortable and by bedtime on Saturday the pain was so intense she could not take it and her husband took her to St. Francis Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The foregoing facts are taken mainly from Mrs. Schwartz\u2019 testimony. McCandless corroborated it in important particulars. Through a friend of his he arranged an appointment with defendant for Mrs. Schwartz; he drove her to the office on the same day. He was present and heard her say to defendant that she had a pregnancy and \u201cwanted an abortion.\u201d Defendant disclaimed any appointment and refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>to perform such an operation. She cried and begged and the haggling on terms began, he finally agreeing on $400; they actually paid him $410. When McCandless was called into the inner office after waiting as directed, he asked \u201cif there was some medication that he wanted to give her, or some kind of prescription that he would let her have, and he said, no, that he didn\u2019t want to write a prescription, he didn\u2019t want his name on it.\" Also: \u201cMrs. Schwartz asked him for a card, or went to pick one up, I guess it was, that was, I believe at the time he told her that he didn\u2019t want any telephone calls from her, or any further contact. If she did have some trouble, he mentioned the date, I guess it was three or four days later to return at his regular hour call time if she had experienced any difficulty. And so then he escorted us not out through the same office that we had entered, but through a hallway and out another door and back out on to Soto Street. So I walked her to her car and to her home.\" Mr. McCandless was promised immunity for testifying in this case and appellant\u2019s brief correctly refers to him as an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Testimony of another young woman that she had been aborted by defendant on June 1, 1961, was received by way of corroboration over defendant\u2019s objections. It will be discussed later in connection with the claim of error in receiving such evidence, but that testimony is not of consequence in consideration of the Schwartz count for her testimony is adequately otherwise corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">General principles here applicable are the following.  The aborted woman is not an accomplice of the defendant who commits the offense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>24 Cal.2d 835, 837 [151 P.2d 237]), but she must be corroborated (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1198).  Accomplices \u201care persons who participate in the <em>commission of </em>a <em>crime, </em>either by committing the act directly, aiding in its commission, or advising and encouraging its commission.\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clapp, supra, </em>at p. 837.)  The abortee is considered the victim of the crime ( 1 Witkin, California Crimes, \u00a7 576, p. 520), and she may be corroborated by an accomplice of defendant.  Although an abortee is not an accomplice, the test to be applied to corroboration of her testimony is that of section 1111, Penal Code <em>(People </em>v. <em>MacEwing, </em>45 Cal.2d 218, 224 [288 P.2d 257]), which section says: \u201cA conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense; and the corroboration is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The corpus delicti of abortion consists merely of an attempt to produce a miscarriage. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>131 Cal.App.2d 127, 129 [280 P.2d 136]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>177 Cal.App.2d 691, 700-701 [2 Cal.Rptr. 594]), which implies specific intent based upon knowledge or belief of pregnancy on the part of the defendant, and absence of necessity to preserve the abortee\u2019s life. (1 Witkin, California Crimes, \u00a7\u00a7 582-583, pp. 524-525; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallardo, </em>41 Cal.2d 57, 62 [257 P.2d 29].)  Proof of actual pregnancy or a completed miscarriage is not necessary (1 Cal.Jur. 2d \u00a7 11, p. 159; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pollum, </em>97 Cal.App.2d 173, 177 [217 P.2d 463]), provided defendant believes the woman pregnant and acts with intent to induce a miscarriage (1 Witkin, California Crimes, \u00a7 580, p. 522).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The corroboration required by the statute need not go to the corpus delicti but to defendant\u2019s connection with same once it has been established by other evidence; it need relate only to some act or fact which is an element of the offense. Such is the language of Penal Code section 1111, quoted, <em>supra, </em>and the settled holding of the courts <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gallardo, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 57, 62-63).  One abortee may corroborate another in many instances, i.e., in situations such as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>43 Cal.2d 661, 675 [276 P.2d 801] : \u201cEither one of the women upon whom an abortion was performed can act as a corroborating witness with respect to matters which she may have observed that are relevant to the other count charging the performance of an abortion upon the other woman. [Citation.] The independent testimony of the two victims of abortion is mutually corroborative in that it shows that both abortions were committed in a similar manner following the same procedure. [Citations.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">MeCandless was undoubtedly an accomplice (see, Pen. Code, \u00a7 31; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallardo, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 57, 63; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>135 Cal.App.2d 519, 527 [287 P.2d 547, 53 A.L.R.2d 1147]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kutz, </em>187 Cal.App.2d 431, 436-437 [9 Cal.Rptr. 626]), and his testimony competent to corroborate Mrs. Schwartz; it did so fully upon the important element of defendant\u2019s connection with the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Moreover, as stated in Witkin on California Evidence, section 489, at page 545: \u201cSufficient corroboration may be furnished by the defendant\u2019s own testimony, his admissions or confessions, or his silence in the face of an ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>cusatory statement.  The entire conduct of the parties, their relationship, acts, and conduct during and after the crime, may be considered.  The corroboration need not extend to all elements of the offense, nor to every detail in the testimony of the accomplice. It need not be strong; it is sufficient if it tends in some slight degree to implicate the defendant.  It need not be direct; circumstantial evidence is sufficient if the connection of the defendant with the crime may be reasonably inferred therefrom.  In brief, the corroborating evidence is sufficient if it connects the defendant with the commission of the crime in such a way as reasonably to satisfy the fact-finding body that the accomplice is telling the truth. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>136 Cal.App.2d 778, 788-789 [289 P.2d 581] : \u201c \u2018... For the same reason, it is not necessary that the independent evidence be sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt. The prosecution is not required to single out an isolated fact which in itself, unrelated to other proven facts, is considered to be sufficient corroboration. It is the combined and cumulative weight of the evidence furnished by nonaeeompliee witnesses which supplies the test.\u2019 [Citations.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Defendant\u2019s testimony denied most of the essential facts covered by the prosecution witnesses but it also furnished corroboration of his connection with the crime to which Mrs. Schwartz had testified. He said that Mr. MeCandless did bring Mrs. Schwartz to his office where she sought an abortion (though he fixed a different date); that both were in the inner office when a conversation occurred; that she became hysterical, \u201chollered\u201d and \u201cyelled.\u201d  \u201cSo long as corroborating evidence creates more than a suspicion of guilt, it is sufficient even though it \u2018be slight and, when standing by itself, entitled to but little consideration.\u2019 [Citations.] It may consist of testimony of the defendant and inferences therefrom as well as inferences from the circumstances surrounding the criminal transaction [citations], and it need not establish the precise facts testified to by the witness whose testimony it supports.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>25 Cal.2d 341, 347 [153 P.2d 720].)</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">We entertain no doubt of the adequacy of the proof of the corpus delicti or of the sufficiency of the corroboration. Mrs. Schwartz\u2019 testimony sufficiently establishes that she told defendant she was pregnant, he agreed to do an abortion, made an examination and then entered upon an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tensely painful procedure which lends itself to no explanation other than an abortion or an attempt to commit one (which is the same thing under the <em>statute); </em>he told Mrs. Schwartz she had been pregnant but was no longer in that condition; his belief and his intent are clearly shown, as is the fact that the operation was not necessary to preserve her life, she being in good health. Mr. McCandless amply corroborated the abortee\u2019s testimony; he was present when the agreement was reached that defendant do an abortion on Mrs. Schwartz for $400, and he participated in paying the fee; this and other testimony given by him constituted legally sufficient corroboration of defendant\u2019s connection with the crime to which Mrs. Schwartz had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Appellant\u2019s arguments of insufficiency of the evidence are built mainly upon actual or asserted inconsistencies in the testimony of various witnesses but they do not surmount the hurdle of <em>People </em>v. <em>Huston, </em>21 Cal.2d 690, 693 [134 P.2d 758]: \u201cAlthough an appellate court will not uphold a judgment or verdict based upon evidence inherently improbable, testimony which merely discloses unusual circumstances does not come within that category. [Citation.] To warrant the rejection of the statements given by a witness who has been believed by a trial court, there must exist either a physical impossibility that they are true, or their falsity must be apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions. [Citations.]  Conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rule above quoted has been reiterated in <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>28 Cal.2d 756, 760 [172 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>30 Cal.2d 589, 594 [184 P.2d 512]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>43 Cal.2d 553, 562 [275 P.2d 31]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>43 Cal.2d 740, 747 [278 P.2d 9]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>47 Cal.2d 311, 319-320 [303 P.2d 329]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wein, </em>50 Cal.2d 383, 399 [326 P.2d 457]; and by a long line of decisions of the District Courts of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Claim of error in receiving over vigorous objections testimony of another alleged abortee (whom we will call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Mary Sue) cannot prevail. As above shown, the proofs were entirely sufficient to establish the Schwartz abortion without aid of Mary Sue\u2019s experience. The information did not specify that crime and the date fixed by her was June 1, 1961, while the Schwartz abortion was on September 1, 1961, three months later. But these are inconsequential differentiating circumstances. Mere remoteness of time does not render the Mary Sue abortion incompetent but goes merely to its weight. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moroni, </em>196 Cal. 154, 159 [236 P. 135]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kearns, </em>149 Cal.App.2d 113, 121 [307 P.2d 1015].)  The general rule is that evidence of an abortion upon a woman other than the prosecuting witness is admissible to show intent, preparation, guilty knowledge, identity, scheme, plan or design. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vosburg, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 535, 536 [266 P.2d 927].) It is said in 1 California Jurisprudence 2d section 30, page 179: \u201cEvidence of other offenses of a similar nature committed by the defendant is therefore admissible for the purpose of proving intent and is also admissible to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim that the operation was innocently performed and for a lawful purpose.... [S]uch evidence is relevant if it logically tends to prove the defendant\u2019s intent in the offense under investigation, notwithstanding that it may prove a distinct crime and prejudice the defendant before the jury, and that it may tend to prove the defendant was preparing to commit abortions generally. Remoteness in time of the previous abortion is not material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADf\">The similarity between the Schwartz and the Mary Sue experiences with defendant is striking. Mary Sue testified she was pregnant but otherwise in good health, went to Dr. Reinard on June 1, 1961, pursuant to appointment made with him. He asked how far along she was and she told him three months. He said it would cost her $500 to help her get rid of the baby; she said she had only $350; he told her to show him and she counted it into his hand, whereupon he said that would be enough if it was all she had, took the money but gave no receipt and was not asked for one. Defendant told Mary Sue to remove her undergarment, get onto the table and put her feet in the stirrups. This she did and the doctor gave her a shot in the hip and one in the arm to dull the pain. He then inserted several instruments in her vagina and she had \u201cvery bad pain, it was like my, he was pulling my insides out.\u201d Defendant said he could not get rid of the baby right then but in a couple of days she would have a miscarriage; that she should be in bed not over a week and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>there would be just a little pain. By the time she reached home her stepfather had to carry her because she could not walk. She was taken to the emergency hospital, called her family physician Dr. Copeland, who in turn called Dr. Petoyan in consultation. At the \u00d1orthridge Hospital she was seen by Dr. Petoyan who testified this was on June 1, 19G1, and a \u201cpelvic examination showed a foul bloody discharge covering the vulva, that is the outside of the female genitalia. And the vagina was filled with recently clotted blood. ... My impression at that time was acute pelvic inflammatory disease, secondary to a probably induced abortion. ... And I was afraid that she might have a perforation of her uterus. That essentially were my findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Police Lieutenant Gray visited defendant at his office on June 8, 1961, said he was the stepfather of Mary Sue who was in critical condition and short of money, accused defendant of an illegal abortion upon her and asked for return of the fee. Defendant said: \u201c \u2018I treated her for an infection for the vaginal infection.\u2019 He said, \u2018But I do feel sorry for you, and I will give you the fee back.\u2019 \u201d He gave the $350 to the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">This evidence was competent and properly received. Before Mary Sue testified defense counsel raised vigorous objections to her doing so. When same were overruled he moved for a mistrial, a tactic which was often repeated after adverse rulings upon evidentiary matters. Of course there was no merit in the motion and it was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Appellant claims error in the court\u2019s refusal to permit his attorney to examine Lieutenant Gray upon the question of whether after arresting defendant on September 1, 1961, the police did not fail to file any charge against him; also refusing to permit examination of Mary Sue as to whether she knew such to be the fact. Plainly, the bare fact that no charge was filed would not be competent, for it would have no tendency to impeach Mary Sue\u2019s testimony. So far as her knowledge of the fact (if it were one) is concerned, it would have no legitimate impeaching effect even if the question were answered affirmatively. What the police may have thought of her story would be a combination of conclusion and hearsay so far as she was concerned, hence not competent. However, Officer Paul LePage, called by defendant in surrebuttal, was permitted to testify that defendant was scheduled to appear in department 100 (of the superior court) on June 8, 1961 \u201con a Writ Return\u201d and that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>complaint was issued at that time. If there had been error in the previous rulings it seems to have been cured, but as indicated we find no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Reliance upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>138 Cal.App. 748, 751 [33 P.2d 460], is misplaced. The prosecuting witness in a rape trial was asked whether she had requested dismissal of the charges against defendant immediately after preferring same and the appellate court held it was error to sustain an objection to the question. An affirmative answer would have reflected directly upon her credibility and the situation presents no true analogy to the one at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel asserts error in giving and refusing certain instructions. His whole argument in this connection consists of citations of the numbers of the instructions and the transcript pages at which same may be found \u2014to which he adds: \u201cThe legal authorities cited under the instructions \u2018Refused\u2019 and the cases hereinabove cited, represent the authority for the serious error committed by the Trial Court with respect to these instructions.\u201d This is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Volume 4 California Jurisprudence 2d section 480, page 309: \u201cIt is the office of a brief attacking a decision to point out the errors complained of, as shown in the record, to state the points on appeal separately under appropriate headings, to give arguments and authorities in support of the points made, and to show that the errors resulted in prejudice to the substantial rights of the appellant.  Thus, while counsel for the appellant is entitled to be heard upon every error which he deems it his duty to raise as ground for reversal, the appellate court cannot be expected to search the record or prosecute an independent inquiry for errors on which the appellant may be relying. It will notice only those errors pointed out in the brief, and all others may be deemed waived or abandoned.\u201d  <em>Id. </em>section 484, page 318: \u201cThe points made in a brief must be supported by argument or citation of authority or they will not be considered by the reviewing court, but will be deemed without foundation, without prejudice to the appellant\u2019s rights, or to have been waived or abandoned. The appellate court cannot be expected to prosecute an independent inquiry to find reasons for or against the rulings of the trial court, and it is the duty of counsel by argument and the citation of authority to show why rulings complained of are erroneous. It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>sufficient merely to state the error without showing of what it consists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Another point urged by appellant is: \u201cThe appellant\u2019s rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America were violated in that he was convicted upon evidence incorrectly admitted by the court, which represented a violation of procedural due process and as a result of highly inflammatory and prejudicial opening and closing remarks of the district attorney.\u201d This reminds one of the observation of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philadelphia &amp; Beading Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>145 Pa. 283 [23 A. 809], that the Fourteenth Amendment is one of \u201cthose last resorts of desperate cases.\u201d Repeatedly throughout the trial defense counsel, after an adverse ruling upon a question of evidence, sought and even demanded a continuance to enable him to procure a writ of prohibition from an appellate court, a thing to which he manifestly was not entitled; of course the motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Due process has taken on such novel forms in recent months and years that it is difficult to harness and hold it within reasonable limits. But it seems to be settled and we now hold that \u201c [t]he guaranty is a matter of substance, not of form. It does not guarantee against judicial error, and it does not provide any guaranty against unjust or erroneous decisions, or assure uniformity of judicial decision, or guarantee any particular decision; it is not a guaranty that every court ruling shall be correct, but it is a guaranty that the fundamental principles of justice shall not be violated.\u201d (16A C.J.S. \u00a7 569 (1) p. 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Arechiga, </em>203 Cal.App.2d 159, 165 [21 Cal.Rptr. 464], this court said: \u201cTrue, that ruling now appears to have been erroneous in the light of the <em>Bell-flower </em>decision. But the fact of error therein does not support appellants\u2019 argument of denial of due process or other constitutional rights. As said in <em>Worcester County Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>302 U.S. 292, 299 [58 S.Ct. 185, 82 L.Ed. 268, 275] : \u2018In any case the Constitution of the United States does not guarantee that the decisions of state courts shall be free from error, <em>Central Land Co. </em>v. <em>Laidley, </em>159 U.S. 103 [16 S.Ct. 80, 40 L.Ed. 91]; <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Ginzberg, </em>205 U.S. 170 [27 S.Ct. 461, 51 L.Ed. 755], or require that pronouncements shall be consistent. <em>Milwaukee Electric R. &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>252 U.S. 100, 106 [40 S.Ct. 306, 64 L.Ed. 476, 480, 10 A.L.R 892, 897].\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>\u201cDatta </em>v. <em>Staab, </em>173 Cal.App.2d 613, 621 [343 P.2d 977] : \u2018Due process does not guarantee either a correct decision or consistency in decision.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\"><em>Market Street R.

In his opening statement to the jury the deputy district attorney said that Mrs. Schwartz was examined by Dr. Juler at the St. Francis Hospital \u201cand he found that there was a criminal abortion or induced abortion. \u201d Immediately after this opening statement defense counsel assigned the reference to criminal abortion as misconduct and basis for a mistrial. The deputy district attorney said: \u201cI do not feel that I have committed misconduct, and I have done it in good faith. I submit the matter to the Court. MR. SCHULLMAN: May I add to it, I, knowing Mr. Galliano, I want to say for the record I am satisfied he did it in good faith.\u201d Later, defendant\u2019s attorney remarked: \u201cI will say this, that we don\u2019t know whether it can be cured by an admonition of the Court, but we think the Court could attempt to admonish the jury to disregard the statement of counsel with respect to both the victims, to the conclusion of the doctor with respect to criminal abortion, with respect to the fact that somebody suffering in a hospital.\u201d The court announced a recess and in doing so told the jurors: \u201cAnd again I do want to say, too, that opening statements are not evidence in any sense of the word. The evidence that you are to be concerned with comes from the witness stand, from the lips of the witnesses that are under oath, or documents or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>exhibits that may properly be admitted into evidence, that is your first concern, and then the law, the complete instructions as to credibility of witnesses and all of the general propositions of law and specific propositions of law that apply to this case will come from the judge at the conclusion of the trial, not from any counsel.\u2019\u2019 Defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">When Dr. Juler, the first witness, was testifying he said he examined Mrs. Schwartz on September 4, 1961, and found she had \u201ca purulent vaginal discharge\u201d and \u201con examining the cervix, the os or opening to the uterus, it was found to be soft or open, with a sanguineous purulent discharge. There was also erosion around the os or the opening to the uterus. The uterus was enlarged and excruciatingly tender. There were no masses, abnormal masses palpated within the pelvis. Q. Prom your history of the case, Doctor, and from your examinations, were you able to arrive at an opinion as to what had caused this? A. Yes, we made a diagnosis of a criminal abortion.\u201d Counsel for defendant immediately moved to strike the word \u201ccriminal\u201d; the prosecution agreed that \u201ccriminal abortion\u201d be stricken. But the defense attorney immediately said: \u201cAnd I think that may, I cite it as prejudicial procedure and move for a mistrial.\u201d And the court: \u201cWell, the reference in the answer, ladies and gentlemen, to the criminal abortion will be stricken from the record, and you are instructed to disregard such reference. The motion will be denied. MR. GALLI-ANO: May I ask a question ? Does that mean that criminal abortion, the both words will be stricken ? THE COURT: Yes. That is correct.\u201d Then followed this: Q. Please do not use that expression, Doctor, in your answer. Did you find that there had been an abortion on this woman ? A. Based upon the patient\u2019s history and the findings from the physical examination, that was the only conclusion we could make. ... Q. Prom your examination of this woman, from the records, history of the ease, was this a spontaneous abortion ? A. Well, spontaneous abortions usually do not become infected. This patient was infected, therefore, we had to draw a conclusion that this was not a spontaneous abortion.\u201d It is to be presumed that the court\u2019s admonition to disregard the objectionable phrase was followed by the jury and any prejudice thus obviated.

Of course, the district attorney\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ccriminal abor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>tion\u201d was but a part of his statement to the jury of what he expected to prove, and there was in fact no impropriety in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Appellant\u2019s other charges of misconduct on the part of the prosecutor have been examined in the light of the record and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Fox, P.
