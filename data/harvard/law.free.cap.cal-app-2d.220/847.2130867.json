Probation was denied and he was sentenced to state prison for the term prescribed by law. He appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">On the morning of June 23, 1962, defendant visited the home of his ex-wife, Bertha Lee Herd. That evening defendant and Mrs. Herd attended a party at a friend\u2019s house. At approximately 2 a.m. the following morning, Mrs. Herd went with defendant to \u201cget some coffee,\u201d after which defendant, refusing Mrs. Herd\u2019s request to be driven to her sister\u2019s house, drove instead to a motel. Prior to their arrival, defendant had said nothing about going to a motel. Upon arriving at the motel, defendant asked Mrs. Herd to spend the night with him there. She refused and left the automobile. Whereupon, defendant grabbed her and with a knife inflicted a cut across the lower part of her abdomen. After being cut, she ran to the motel and asked the manager to call the police. She was taken to a hospital by ambulance and remained there for nine days under treatment for the wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Deputy Sheriff Barlup testified he went to the motel in response to a call stating that someone had been injured. He saw Mrs. Herd lying on the front porch covered with blood \u201cfrom the waist down. \u2019 \u2019 Defendant was standing over her 11 asking her how she was.\u201d They removed Mrs. Herd\u2019s skirt and Deputy Barlup observed she had a large cut across her lower abdomen, directly at her private parts, and from which \u201csome of her intestines or something was protruding.\u201d She told the officer defendant had cut her and that she wanted him to go to jail. Defendant was then placed under arrest and when asked where the knife was located, he pointed out its location approximately 50 feet from where the victim was lying. Defendant admitted to Deputy Barlup, in the presence of Deputy Miklos, that he had cut Mrs. Herd with the knife which the deputy had found (introduced at the trial as an exhibit), but stated that he had not done it intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, stated that since the time Mrs. Herd obtained an interlocutory decree of divorce in 1960, he had visited her and their child frequently, and had lived with her occasionally. On June 23, they went to a friend\u2019s house and had several drinks. When they left, defendant thought they would go back to Mrs. Herd\u2019s apartment, but she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go some place else.\u201d Defendant agreed and they went to a motel. Finding no vacancy, they had coffee and something to eat at a hot dog stand, and then went to another motel, where defendant registered as Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Herd, paid $3.00 and they went to the assigned room. Defendant then took out a knife which he used for \u201ccutting lead and oleum,\u201d and while playing with it, \u201cswinging it... apparently she walked into it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Defendant contends that the prosecution failed to establish the corpus delicti of the crime of assault with a deadly weapon because no evidence was introduced to show that the knife used by defendant to cut Mrs. Herd was in fact a deadly or dangerous weapon, or to show that defendant intended \u201cto commit violent injury upon another.\u201d No merit is found in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Penal Code, section 245, under which defendant was convicted, sets forth the elements of the crime of assault with a deadly weapon in the following language: \u201cEvery person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is punishable....\u201d An assault is defined in section 240 of the Penal Code as \u201c... an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another.\u201d  Defendant\u2019s present ability to perpetrate a violent injury (the assault element) was conclusively established by the evidence showing he did in fact cut Mrs. Herd.  The testimony concerning the gravity of the wound, causing hospitalization for nine days, established the violent nature of the injury.  Although not an inherently deadly weapon, a knife becomes such when used in such a manner as to cause severe bodily injury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kersey, </em>154 Cal.App.2d 364, 366 [316 P.2d 52]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arguilida, </em>85 Cal.App.2d 623, 625 [193 P.2d 478].)  In determining Avhether an instrument which is not inherently deadly or dangerous, assumes these characteristics, the trier of fact looks to the nature of the weapon, the manner of its use, the location on the body of the injuries inflicted, and to the extent of such injuries. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Basnett, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 108, 118 [8 Cal.Rptr. 804].)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Specific intent is not an element of the crime of assault with a deadly weapon. \u201cThe intent may be inferred from the doing of the wrongful act.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roshid, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 692, 694 [12 Cal.Rptr. 794].)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Here, the trial court found, upon what we are convinced was amply sufficient evidence, that defendant, being angered by Mrs. Herd\u2019s refusal to accompany him to the motel, took hold of her and then cut her with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Also, without merit is defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in denying his application for probation even though the probation officer\u2019s report allegedly indicated that defendant had no prior criminal record and in other respects was eligible for probation.  \u201cProbation is not a matter of right but an act of grace and clemency which is within the court\u2019s discretion, and such an exercise of discretion will not be interfered with on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jermane, </em>194 Cal.App.2d 754, 757 [15 Cal.Rptr. 221].)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The trial court in the ease at hand, clearly and succinctly summed up its decision denying defendant\u2019s application for probation, with the statement: \u201cI am sorry, I can\u2019t go along with it. This man was within just a hair\u2019s breath [sic] of a murder charge.\u201d No abuse of discretion has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Burke, P. J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
