J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKD\">Plaintiff Robert Gallina, a minor, brought this filiation proceeding through his guardian <em>ad litem, </em>Sara Rose Gallina, to have it adjudged that defendant Robert Antonelli was the father of plaintiff and under a duty to support him. The trial court, sitting without a jury, entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">, Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the trial court\u2019s finding that respondent was not his father. This argument is without merit. The evidence relative to paternity consisted of the conflicting testimony of appellant\u2019s mother, Sara Rose Gallina, and of respondent Robert Antonelli. This conflict in the evidence presented a question of fact for the trial judge, and it cannot be said as a matter of law that he erred in choosing to believe respondent rather than Miss Gallina.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">Neither is there any merit to appellant\u2019s contention that respondent\u2019s testimony was inherently improbable because he admitted acts of sexual intercourse with Miss Gallina and denied only that they had occurred during the period when, in the ordinary course of nature, appellant must have been conceived. It must be remembered that Miss Gallina herself testified that she and respondent had terminated their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>relationship in 1957. Respondent\u2019s testimony that the relationship was never reestablished is certainly no more improbable than Miss Gallina\u2019s testimony that she and respondent were reunited for one further act of intercourse at the approximate time of appellant\u2019s conception.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Miss Gallina\u2019s sexual relations with other men prior to the date of appellant\u2019s conception.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Appellant is clearly correct in such contention. The law is well settled that, in filiation proceedings, evidence of the immorality of the mother prior to the period of possible conception is inadmissible, and it is error even to ask questions which are designed to imply acts of immorality for the purpose of showing bad character, or for impeachment. <em>(Estate of Gird </em>(1910) 157 Cal. 534, 547 [108 P. 499, 137 Am. St. Rep. 131]; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1953) 121 Cal.App.2d 1, 6 [262 P.2d 613]; <em>Dastagir </em>v. <em>Dastagir </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 809, 815-816 [241 P.2d 656]; <em>Kyne </em>v. <em>Kyne </em>(1940) 38 Cal.App.2d 122, 131 [100 P.2d 806].)  In view of the peculiar facts in the present case, however, it is apparent that appellant was in no way prejudiced by improper questions addressed to Miss Gallina, and the evidence adduced thereby. The fact is that appellant\u2019s own counsel, during examination of this witness, successfully eliminated all doubt as to her sexual morality, and covered the very matters of which she now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Further, this was a court trial and hence we presume on appeal that the trial judge considered and relied upon the competent evidence in making his findings and rendering the judgment. <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Bixby </em>(1953) 120 Cal.App.2d 495, 499 [261 P.2d 286].)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">It would serve no useful purpose to set forth in detail Miss Gallina\u2019s testimony on direct examination. Suffice it to say that her testimony left no doubt whatever as to the caliber of her morals. It is difficult to conceive of any reason why appellant\u2019s counsel would seek to vilify the character of Miss Gallina in this manner. The testimony particularly pertaining to abnormal sexual acts was totally irrelevant to the issue of paternity. Whatever the motives of appellant\u2019s counsel may have been, however, it is apparent that the information elicited through direct examination left appellant in no position to claim prejudice by the relatively innocuous questions which the trial judge and respondent\u2019s counsel subsequently addressed to Miss Gallina.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in refusing to permit appellant to be brought into court. Appellant correctly points out that at the conclusion of Miss Gallina\u2019s testimony, appellant's counsel asked the trial judge whether he would permit appellant, a child then 20 months of age, to be brought into court for the purpose of observing his resemblance to respondent. The trial judge stated, \u201cNo, don\u2019t ask me to pass upon the resemblance of the child .... I couldn\u2019t see the resemblance when everybody in the world can see a resemblance. In other words, I can when they are twins; but other than that, spealdng candidly, when mothers or parents say, \u2018You look like somebody, you look like somebody,\u2019 as far as I am concerned they all look alike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Appellant, in contending that this ruling constituted prejudicial error, relies upon the rule that it is entirely proper for the trier of fact to view the minor plaintiff in a paternity action. <em>(In re Jessup </em>(1889) 81 Cal. 408, 417-418 [21 P. 976, 22 P. 748, 6 L.R.A. 594]; <em>Valencia </em>v. <em>Millikin </em>(1916) 31 Cal.App. 533, 535-536 [160 P. 1086].) However, appellant has directed this court\u2019s attention to no case holding that the refusal to undertake such a view constitutes error. In the present case, the trial judge\u2019s position was that he could not see resemblances in young children even where they were strikingly apparent to others. Under such circumstances, it would clearly have served no useful purpose to allow appellant to be brought into court. Appellant has not sustained the burden of showing either that error was committed or that he was prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the trial judge was biased and prejudiced against appellant\u2019s mother and accordingly prejudged the case. In support of this contention, appellant relies upon an incident which occurred during direct examination of Miss Gallina\u2019s brother, who had apparently been absent from the courtroom during her testimony. Appellant\u2019s counsel asked Mr. Gallina if he had any personal knowledge of what time his sister got home from dates. The trial judge then inquired as to the purpose of the question, and appellant\u2019s counsel replied that the purpose was to ascertain whether the witness had any knowledge of his sister\u2019s relationship with respondent. The following colloquy then took place: \u201cTHE COURT: Oh, heavens above, I don\u2019t think he knows; may he never know. THE WITNESS: I know. THE COURT: Do you know what your sister has done ? THE WITNESS: I know that she knows that fellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>there. THE COURT: I mean \u2014 but do you know what she has done, what she has admitted ? May you never know. THE WITNESS: What do you mean by that ? THE COURT: Well, somebody else will tell you; I won\u2019t tell you. \u2019 \u2019 As further evidence of the trial judge\u2019s \u201cbias,\u201d appellant also relies upon a reference in the trial court\u2019s memorandum opinion to the \u201castounding admissions\u201d made by Miss Gallina.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In the light of the unusual record in this case, it cannot be said that the learned trial judge\u2019s behavior indicated that he was prejudiced against Miss Gallina or that he had prejudged the case. Portions of her testimony were such as in their very nature could not help but shock the normal mind. The fact that the trial judge was admittedly astonished by some of her admissions certainly does not establish that he was unable to try the case fairly and to arrive at a decision based solely upon the competent evidence before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Agee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 30, 1963, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 6, 1963. Peters, J., and Peek, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
