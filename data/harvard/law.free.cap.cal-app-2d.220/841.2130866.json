On Mar. 15, 1963, he filed an opening brief. On July 14, 1963, he was notified by letter that he was entitled to counsel, that if he wanted to be represented by counsel and had no funds to employ counsel, the court would appoint counsel to represent him on appeal. On July 25, 1963, the Attorney General filed his reply brief; nothing further has been heard from defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b863-7\">JEFFERSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADz_\">On July 5, 1961, defendant was charged by information with grand theft for allegedly obtaining a loan of $800 from one Edna E. Joslyn by means of false representations. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Prohibition proceedings were subsequently instituted in the appellate courts by defendant and a continuance was granted pending the outcome. Thereafter the writ sought was denied by the state Supreme Court <em>(Perry </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>57 Cal.2d 276 [19 Cal.Rptr. 1, 368 P.2d 529]), and the matter was set for trial. On April 30, 1962, defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty. He has represented himself in propria persona throughout the proceedings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including those seeking a writ. On June 22, 1962, a motion for new trial was denied, proceedings were suspended, and defendant was granted probation under certain conditions. Following defendant\u2019s motion for a stay of execution, and in order to permit defendant to remain on bail while he arranged his affairs before going to jail for 270 days, one of the conditions of probation, the court vacated the proceedings taken on June 22 and the matter of probation and sentence was continued to July 6, 1962. On the latter date, defendant filed a \u201cmotion to set aside judgment and to allow defendant to change his plea of guilty to plea of not guilty.\u201d On July 13, 1962, the motion was heard and denied, proceedings were suspended, and probation was granted for five years upon the same conditions set forth in the original probation order of June 22, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Defendant\u2019s notice of appeal from the denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>\u201cmotion to set aside judgment\u201d will be treated as an appeal from the order granting probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Defendant maintains that the trial court should have granted his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty. The proceedings had relating to defendant\u2019s withdrawal of his original plea of not guilty and entry of the plea of guilty conclusively show that both the deputy district attorney and the court carefully questioned defendant in order to ascertain that he was acting voluntarily and not because of any threats or promises of any kind and specifically with respect to representations as to punishment or penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion on July 6, 1962, to withdraw his guilty plea was made pursuant to Penal Code, section 1018, which states in part: \u201cOn application of the defendant at any time before judgment the court may, and in case of a defendant who appeared without counsel at the time of the plea the court must, <em>for good cause shown, </em>permit the plea of guilty to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty substituted.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">In discussing the application of section 1018, the court said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ottenstror, 127 </em>Cal.App.2d 104, <em>109 </em>[273 P.2d 289] : \u201cIt is well settled in our law that an accused who seeks to set aside a plea of guilty must show good cause therefor, and the granting or denial of such an application rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and his decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of that discretion is clearly shown. [Citation.] \u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>188 Cal.App.2d 549, 552 [10 Cal.Rptr. 396].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Because a plea of guilty is the equivalent of a conviction of the crime charged <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>52 Cal.2d 636, 651 [343 P.2d 577]), while it may be withdrawn pursuant to section 1018, the basis for the motion for relief must be established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 353, 356 [266 P.2d 566].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">In considering the motion, the doctrines of presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt are inapplicable, since the defendant has already admitted his guilt by his plea of guilty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 624, 634-635 [345 P.2d 282].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">In the instant case we are persuaded that no \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d was presented which would justify a finding by this court that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Defendant alleged in the motion that certain representations were made to him by members of the office of the district attorney, which he alleges were false and upon which he allegedly relied in changing his plea of not guilty. However, there is nothing in the record other than defendant\u2019s affidavit, on which his motion to withdraw the plea was based, to support these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">As stated in the ease of <em>People </em>v. <em>Beck, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.2d 549, 553 (which involved similar facts), \u201cIt should also be pointed out that the trial court was not bound to give full credence to the statements in defendant\u2019s affidavit in support of his motion to withdraw his pleas of guilty even though they are uncontradicted because of defendant\u2019s obvious interest in the outcome of the proceeding. [Citations.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">\u201cA trial judge is not required to accept as true the sworn testimony of a witness, even in the absence of evidence contradicting it, and this rule applies to an affidavit. Further, the trial court as trier of the fact, is the judge of the credibility of the witness whether he testify in person or by affidavit. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>98 Cal.App.2d 687, 692 [220 P.2d 976].)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\"> Defendant alleges that he was not given the reports of the probation officer (with the exception of a supplementary report), until the time of the June 22, 1962, hearing, and that this resulted in his \u201cinability to comprehend, analyze, and evaluate the effect thereof on the court\u2019s disposition of said matter.\u201d It is alleged that the reports did not contain certain \u201ctrue facts,\u201d and that had he been given the opportunity to examine them prior to the date of the hearing, \u201call of the facts\u201d could have been presented to the court for its consideration. Defendant maintains that his plea of guilty was based on the representation made to him that \u201call the facts of the ease\u201d would be placed before the court, and that the court \u201cwould probably be inclined\u201d to at least grant a motion to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and suspend further proceedings thereon, or the court \u201cmight even refuse on its own motion to accept the plea of guilty.\u201d Penal Code section 1203 provides that the probation officer\u2019s report and recommendations \u201c... must be made available to the ... defense attorneys at least two days prior to the time fixed by the court for the hearing and determination of such report. . . .\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 366, 370-371 [29 Cal.Rptr. 474].)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>In the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Valdivia, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 145, 147 [5 Cal.Rptr. 832], the court held that, though no copy of a probation officer\u2019s report was made available to defendant\u2019s counsel two days prior to the hearing on the report as required by Penal Code section 1203, the error was cured where the court, after partially hearing the matter, ordered a continuance of one week.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Likewise, in the instant case, any claimed error of the trial court, in not providing defendant with a complete copy of the probation reports within the time prescribed by section 1203, was cured by the court\u2019s vacating the action taken in the proceedings of June 22 and continuing the matter of probation and sentence to July 13. This allowed defendant ample time \u201cto comprehend, analyze and evaluate\u201d the effect of the reports and to apprise the court in writing of any discrepancies or omissions therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">It appears to this court that defendant\u2019s complaint is based upon his disappointment upon being sent to jail as a condition of probation. The court indicated that the offense, the bilking of a 65-year-old woman of a sizable sum of money, merited a state prison sentence and that probation with a county jail term as a condition was being substituted solely because of the court\u2019s feeling that this was a case where restitution should also be required as a further condition of probation.  The rule is well established that a defendant cannot be permitted to gamble on the anticipated result of a plea of guilty and when disappointed in the outcome reestablish his right to a trial. <em>(In re Gutierrez, </em>122 Cal.App.2d 661, 665 [265 P.2d l6].)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The judgment (order granting probation) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">Burke, P. J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Defendant did have an associated counsel at the probation report hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
