Under the well settled practice of this court, it is necessary that the appellant should make such <em>a prima facie </em>showing as would satisfy this court that this was a proper case for the granting of the motion submitted by the appellant. After a careful consideration of the affidavits upon which the motion is made, we cannot say that such a showing has been made. It is, therefore, ordered, that the motion be refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
