It was stated at the time by the agent of the bankrupt that it was the purpose of the bankrupt to use the money, or a portion thereof, in paying labor claims then due. There was no agreement between Theobald and the bankrupt that the money should be so used, nor was there an agreement between them that the security or priority incident to the labor claims should pass to Theobald and be operative in his favor. Theobald was under no obligation, in law, to advance this money, nor was it in any wise for his protection or interest that the claims were paid. I think the law is clear, under these circumstances, that Theobald cannot assert a priority, and could not have so asserted it in the receivership suit which was antecedent to the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-13\">The finding of the referee is sustained and affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-14\">Smith &amp; Taft, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-15\">Treadway &amp; Marlatt, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b537-16\">Before EURTON, SEVERENS, and RICHARDS, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b537-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A6H\">The order denying a preference to the appellant is affirmed for the reasons stated in the opinion of WING, District Judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
