The decision , of this court, on the appeal of the complainants, affects only the part of the decree complained of by them, to wit, the construction of the agreement of October 14, 1845; and, while the declaratory parts of the decree of the Circuit Court, in favor of the complainants, remain unreversed, the. right to sustain their bill for a perpetual injunction; and to recover damages, followed as a consequence, from the construction given by this court to the agreement of October 14,1845.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-10\">VII. The defendants are entitled to an appeal at. some time within five years from the decision of the Circuit Court against them, on the validity of the patent in question. Now, if the complainants\u2019 p' \u00fat\u00edon is true, that nothing is appealed from but the order directing the bill to be dismissed, these defendants have not now, and never have had, an opportunity to appeal at all; because that decree was in their favor, and a party cannot appeal from a decree in his own favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-11\">It is a mere subtlety to say that because the decree, deciding^ the validity of the patent and the title of the complainants in their favor, ordered no relief; but, on the contrary, for a different reason, directed their bill to be dismissed, that, therefore, the decision of the validity of the patent and the title of the complainants is mere recital, and not a substantial part of the decree, and proper subject of an appeal. The test is this: Are the validity of the patent and the title of the complainants now open to dispute by the defendants in the Circuit Court <em>1 </em>Certainly they are not. But, according to the complainants, those points are not open to appeal; so that a decision on a vital point against the defendants is not the subject of appeal at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-12\">Again. If what the complainants allege is correct, that there is no decree now remaining in the court below but the decree, which is entered on the mandate; and. also, that, on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>from that decree so entered on the mandate, the party aggrieved can review only the proceedings subsequent to that decree, then it results that the defendants can have no appeal at all from a decree in which the material issue upon the invention is found against them by the court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-5\">Again. In answer to this, it is said that, on the appeal brought- by the complainants upon the issue as to a license found against them, the defendants were at liberty to fall back, and contest the issue of the invention found against them; but, in reply, we say that, by the rules of courts of equity, as well as by statute, it is optional to the defendants whether they will so fall back, and contest the issue found against them on the hearing of the appeal of the complainants, or whether they will bring their own distinct appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">VIII. The respondents\u2019 motion should be denied.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b476-7\">Mr. Justice GRIER,</author>\n<p id=\"A_s\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The Troy Iron and Nail Factory filed their bill in the court below, claiming to be assignees of a patent granted to Henry Burden, for a \u201c new and useful improvement in the machinery for manufacturing wrought nails or spikes.\u201d The bill charges, that the appellants, Corning &amp; Company, have infringed their patent, and prays for an injunction and an account of -profits, &amp;c. The answer of the respondents below took defence on two grounds \u2014 first, that Burden was not the first and original inventor of the machine patented; and, secondly, that the respondents used their machine under a license from the patentee. The court below sustained the defence on the latter ground, and entered the following decree : \u201c Therefore, it is. ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the said bill of complaint is hereby dismissed, with costs to be taxed, and that the defendant have execution therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The case is now before us on a motion to dismiss the 'appeal. Looking at the case as exhibited to us by the record, it appears to be an appeal by respondents from a decree dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill with costs. It often happens that a court may decree in favor of a complainant, but not to the extent prayed for in his bill, and he may have just cause of appeal on that account. But the prayer of the respondent\u2019s answer is, that \u201che be hence dismissed, with his reasonable costs and charges, on this behalf most wrongfully sustained.\u201d And, having such a decree on the present case, he cannot have a more favorable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">It is true that the petition for the appeal in this case prays \u2022 only, \u201c that so much of such parts of said decree, as declares, orders, adjudges, and. decrees as follows, to wit, \u201c And it appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ing to the said court that the said Henry Burden was the first inventor of the improvement, &amp;c., may be reversed, and that the appellants may be restored to all things which they have lost by reason thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">But the matter complained of forms no part of the decree of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">It shows only, that the judge, in reciting the inducement of reasons for entering a decree in favor of the respondents below, was of opinion that they were entitled to such decree, because they had- succeeded in establishing one only of the two defences alleged in their answer. It is the opinion of the court, on a question of fact involved in the case, but not affecting the decree. If the decree be correct, the party in whose'favor, it is given, has no right to complain; yet his appeal prays that it \u201cmay be reversed, and the appellants restored to all things which they have lost by reason thereof;\u201d and the record shows they have lost nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">If the decree be reversed, according to the prayer of the appellants, the court must necessarily enter a decree for the complainants below. This would, probably, not meet the views of the appellants. They have put themselves in the anomalous position either of asking for the affirmance of the decree from which they have appealed, or of requesting this court to reverse a decree in their favor, and send back the record to the court below, with directions to enter the very same decree, but to assign other reasons for it. The court were not bound to give any reasons for their decree. The law gives the party aggrieved an appeal from a final decree of an inferior court. But it does not-give the party who is not aggrieved an appeal from a decree in his favor because the judge has given no reasons, or recited insufficient ones for a judgment admitted by the appellant to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">There is a part of the history of this case which does not appear on the record; but, being known to the court, and assumed by counsel on both sides to* make part of the case, it will be necessary to notice the case under that aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The decree in favor of the appellants, which is now appealed from, has already been before this court on an appeal by the complainant below. The parties were then fully heard, the decree of the Circuit Court reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings. It is reportedin 14 Howard, 194. It appears, therefore, that there is no such decree as that which is now complained of. The decree of the Circuit Court has been entirely annulled, reversed, and set aside by this court. Before that was done, the appellants, had a full hearing on every point of defence set up in their answer. The court below had de\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>aided that the defendant had a good defence under his plea of license, but not under the plea that Burden was not the first inventor of the patented machine. This court has decided, that the appellant\u2019s defence was insufficient on both pleas. The language of the court is, (14 How. 208,) \u201c That the defendants have failed to prove that Burden was not such first inventor; and, in our opinion, the evidence given by them oh that point, rather serves to establish the originality of the invention than to impair it, The appellants stand upon the .patent, as the first which was granted for the bending lever; and they may well do so, until other evidence than that in this record shall be given to disprove its originality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">It is plain, therefore, that, under the guise of an appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court, this is an appeal, in fact, from the decision of this court. For there is no other decree existing in the case except the decree of this court. There must be an end of litigation some time. To allow a second appeal to a court of last resort, on the same questions which were open to dispute on the first, would lead to endless litigation. It is said' by this court, in Martin <em>v. </em>Hunter, (1 Wheat. 355,) \u201cA \u25a0final judgment of the court is conclusive upon the rights which it decides, and no' statute has provided any process by which this court can revise its judgment.\u201d See, also, Sibbald <em>v. </em>United- States, 12 Pet. 488. It follows, therefore, that, when a complainant has a decree in his favor, but not to the extent prayed for in his bill, and the respondent appeals; if the complainant desires a more favorable decree, he' must enter a cross appeal, that, when the decree comes b\u00e9fore the appellate court, he may be heard. For, when the decree -is either affirmed or reversed by the appellate court, it becomes the decree of that court, and cannot .be -the subject of another appeal. But, in this case, where the decree of the court below dismissed the bill, ho appeal by the respondent was necessary. He had a full opportunity to urge every defence set up in his answer. The printed arguments show that \u2019the defence, for want of originality in the patent, was relied upon as a- ground for. affirming the decree of the court below, and, as we have already shown, was distinctly passed upon and overruled by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">A second appeal lies only when the court below, in carrying out the mandate of this court, is alleged to have committed an error. But, on an appeal from the mandate, it is well settled, that nothing is before the court but the proceedings subsequent to the mandate. Whatever was formerly before the court, and was disposed of by its decree, is considered as finally- disposed of. See Himely <em>v. </em>Rose, 5 Cranch, 313; Canter <em>v. </em>The Ocean Insurance Company, 1 Peters, 511; The Santa Maria, 10 Wheat. 431; Rice <em>v. </em>Wheatly, 9 Dana, 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u2022 Moreover, as it is admitted that the court below have not yet acted upon the mandate of this court, and entered a final decree in pursuance thereof, there is no final decree, from which only an appeal can. be. taken. See the Palmyra, 10 Wheat. 502; Chace <em>v. </em>Vasquez, 11 Id. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">There are, therefore, three conclusive reasons for dismissing the present appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">1. The appellants have already been heard in this court on a former appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">2. There is no such decree as that from which the appeal purports to be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">3. There is no final decree in the case, from which an appeal can be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of New York, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court, that this cause be, and the same is hereby, dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
