J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aez\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-12\">The appeal is from the affirmance by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of the refusal of the County Council to rezone some ten acres of land located generally along Old Georgetown Road in Bethesda from R-60 (one family detached residential) to R-T (Town Houses). The Technical Staff and Planning Board recommended denial of the application to rezone because (1) the existing high grade character of the neighborhood (single-family residences in the thirty thousand to forty-five thousand dollar range on large lots) had not been changed by the granting of a number of special exceptions such as private clubs, a nursing home in a former residence, a medical clinic, and a group of doctors\u2019 offices in town houses, and (2) the subdivision streets were narrow for the increased traffic which would be generated if the application were granted, and (3) the desirable character of the area would best be maintained by the development of the ten acres for more single family residences\u2014which the applicants admitted was feasible\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u201crather than introducing a use considerably different from the surrounding area.\u201d The staff also found that \u201ccertainly no transition is needed in this area\u201d and that \u201crezoning of this land to the R-T zone will permit over three times as many families as the R-60 zone would yield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">The Council concurred in the recommendations and \u201cconcluded that the standards prescribed in the Zoning Ordinance for the R-T zone<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have not been met in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">Appellants make two main contentions. First, it is said that the Council erroneously applied the general mistake or change rule applicable to individual rezonings to the R-T zone, having acted before our decision in <em>Knudsen v. Montgomery County Council, </em>241 Md. 436, where we held that the R-T zone, like the R-H zone reviewed in <em>Beall v. Montgomery County Council, </em>240 Md. <em>77, </em>was a floating rather than a conventional Euclidean zone and therefore was in the nature of and analogous to, a special exception. Second, it is contended that when the Council refused, in effect, to add another special exception (the R-T zone) to the several which had been previously granted, its action was discriminatory, arbitrary and capricious because if the earlier exceptions were compatible with the neighboring area, as they were forecast to be when granted and had actually proved to be, the analogous one now sought must also be found to be compatible.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">The short answer is that we gave in <em>Tauber v. Montgomery County, </em>244 Md. 332, 336-37, where the Council relied in part on a finding of no mistake or change in rejecting a requested floating zone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-7\">\u201cAlthough the Maryland \u2018original mistake in zoning-change in conditions of the area\u2019 rule is not applicable in considering rezoning for an R-H zone as a \u2018floating zone\u2019 in view of our decision in <em>Beall v. Mont</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>gomery County, 240 </em>Md. <em>77, </em>212 A. 2d 751 (1965) and in the recently decided case of <em>Bujno v. Montgomery County Council, </em>243 Md. 110, 220 A. 2d 126 (decided June 8, 1966), it is clear that the District Council must determine on the evidence that the proposed R-H rezoning is compatible with the surrounding area. <em>Bujno v. Montgomery County Council, supra. </em>As the evidence made this issue fairly debatable, the courts may not substitute their judgment for that of the District Council upon this issue. See <em>Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County v. Parr, </em>242 Md. 315, 218 A. 2d 923 (1966) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">In the case before us, as in <em>Tauber, </em>there was, in addition to the \u25a0evidence afforded by the reports of the Technical Staff and Planning Board, other probative evidence from which the Coun\u2022cil reasonably could have concluded that the appellants had not met the tests set out by the zoning ordinance for a Town House \u25a0zone and that a rezoning of ten acres for town houses with a \u25a0\u2022density three times as great as permitted by the existing zoning would not be compatible with the present character of the ^neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, zvith costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b21-8\">. Section 104-10A, Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance (1958), now codified in Montgomery County Code \u00a7 111-12 (1965), provides that the classification is inter alia to fully and efficiently utilize available public utilities and services, to provide the amenities normally associated with less dense zoning categories and to prevent detrimental effects to the use or development of adjacent properties or the neighborhood.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
