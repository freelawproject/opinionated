J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8pi\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">At issue is the priority between a landlord\u2019s lien on automobiles of his tenant, a dealer, in the leased premises and the lien of a lender who had advanced the dealer the purchase price of the automobiles and prior to the levy under the warrant of distraint had perfected a security interest in them under the Uniform Commercial Code to cover his advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Congressional Motors, Inc. had leased premises in Montgomery County to Peter Palmer, Ltd., an automobile dealer. In early December 1965 Palmer owed rent to Congressional which directed the sheriff to levy upon seven automobiles owned by Palmer and located on the leased premises. The sheriff, having learned that Universal C.I.T. Credit Corporation was claiming a lien for its advances to Palmer superior to that of the landlord, refused <em>to </em>sell the automobiles as directed by Congressional, which then sought mandamus to compel the sale. Universal intervened, asserting its claimed prior lien. Judge Pugh ruled that the landlord had priority and ordered the sale of the automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The priority between the landlord\u2019s lien and Universal\u2019s lien must be determined by the state of the law in December 1965 when the levy under the distraint warrant was made. If the levy had been made on or after January 1, 1966, Universal\u2019s security interest would have been explicitly preferred to the landlord\u2019s lien under \u00a7 16 of Ch. 915 of the Laws of 1965, effective January 1 (Code, Art. 53, \u00a7 16), which completely revised and formalized the law of distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Universal, the lender, asserts, as it did below, that the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code are applicable and controlling. In considering the contention we must examine the law of distress as it existed before 1966, including the extent to which it exempted property on the demised premises subject to security devices and the effect the passage of the Code had on the preexisting law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Before 1966 distress was a mixture of rules of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>law, many stemming from feudal times, implementing and supplementing Maryland legislation and long-standing practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In 1964 the Committee on Laws of the Maryland State Bar Association said in reporting on the bill which later became Ch. 915 of the Laws of 1965 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201cThe present distraint law in Maryland is archaic in that a landlord\u2019s remedy of distress is exercised without supervision by any court in spite of the substantial rights, and important interests, of tenants and landlords which are involved. The sheriff or constable now acts merely as an agent of the landlord. No court record is made with respect to a distress proceeding including the levy and sale of goods on the leased premises.\u201d (69 <em>Transactions of the Maryland State Bar Association </em>305.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Despite its somewhat amorphous structure, the Maryland law of distress prior to 1966 had definitely established rules and principles. A landlord had a \u201cquasi-lien\u201d for unpaid rent on the goods of his tenant subject to distress even before the levy under the distraint warrant, Rhynhart, <em>Law of Landlord and Tenant, </em>20 Md. L. Rev. 1, 36; <em>Thomson v. Baltimore &amp; Susquehanna Steam Co., </em>33 Md. 312, 319. In <em>Calvert Bldg. &amp; Const. Co. v. Winakur, </em>154 Md. 519, 531, Judge Parke, speaking for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u201cBut a <em>quasi </em>lien in the sense used in <em>Thomson v. Baltimore, etc. Co., supra, </em>and the other cases cited, means nothing <em>more </em>than the potential right of a landlord to subject to distress the goods and chattels on the demised premises for the rent in arrear.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The cases have held that the quasi lien o\u00ed the landlord becomes a lien either upon levy, <em>Buckey v. Snouffer, </em>10 Md. 149, 155 ; <em>Stewart v. Clark, </em>60 Md. 310, 311 ; <em>Mears v. Perine, </em>156 Md. 56, 62 ; <em>Gay Investment Co. v. Comi, </em>230 Md. 433, 437, or upon assertion of the right under the Statute of 8 Anne, Ch. 14, \u00a7 1, to be paid up to one year\u2019s rent in arrears by another creditor levying execution or attachment. <em>Gaither v. Stockbridge, </em>67 Md. 222, 228 ; <em>Calvert Bldg. &amp; Const. Co. v. Winakur, supra, </em>at pp. 528-31 of 154 Md.; Rhynhart, <em>op. cit., </em>says (p. 36) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201cThis quasi-lien may be converted to a lien, even without a distress under the Statute of 8 Anne, Ch. 14, and if the landlord\u2019s claim for rent is properly established it will take precedence over the debt on which an attachment issues and he is entitled to be first paid out of the proceeds of the property condemned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In bankruptcy the landlord had a prior lien on the proceeds of sale of the bankrupt\u2019s assets sold by the trustee if the landlord had levied distress before the tenant\u2019s adjudication as a bankrupt, <em>Irving Trust Co. v. Burke, </em>65 F. 2d 730, 731-32 (4th Cir.), and the lien acquired by such a levy within four months of a bankruptcy petition was not voidable as it was regarded as one secured other than through legal proceedings. <em>In re Potee Brick Co. of Baltimore City, </em>179 Fed. 525, 530 (Rose, J., D. Md., 1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The landlord could distrain on any goods and chattels on the premises whether owned by the tenant or owned by another or subject to liens in favor of another, except as such goods were exempted by law. <em>Giles v. Ebsworth, </em>10 Md. 333, 345 ; <em>Trieber v. Knabe, </em>12 Md. 491 ; <em>McCreery v. Clafflin, 37 </em>Md. 435 ; <em>Swartz v. G. B. S. Brewing Co., </em>109 Md. 393, 399 ; <em>Mears v. </em>Perine, 156 Md. 56. Two recent cases in which otherwise valid preexisting liens of lenders were held inferior to the landlord\u2019s because they were not such liens as were expressly given pref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ereuce by the exemption statute, Code (1957), Art. 53, \u00a7 18, are J. <em>Holland &amp; Sons v. Ettleman, </em>225 Md. 84, and <em>Gay Investment Co. v. Comi, </em>230 Md. 433, <em>supra. </em>The rule that the goods of a stranger were liable equally with those of the tenant had its origin in feudal times. This ancient privilege was regarded as an inseparable incident of the seigniory and as a remedy which was confined to the land out of which the rent issued. The tenant owed the rent but the remedy was enforced against the land as if it were the debtor. <em>Emig v. Cunningham, </em>62 Md. 458, 460-61. (See also Rhynhart, <em>Distress, </em>13 Md. L. Rev. 185 and 190; Rhynhart &amp; Schlitz, <em>Civil Practice before People\u2019s Courts and Justices, </em>\u00b6 14:23, and authorities cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Goods and chattels of strangers which at the times here pertinent were exempt from distress and liens which were then superior to the landlord\u2019s lien were set out in detail in \u00a7 18 of Art. 53, as it read in 1965. That section after exempting from distress a number of specified articles not the property of the tenant provided that, except in Prince George\u2019s County, if the landlord should distrain on any non-exempt goods or chattels covered by \u201ca conditional contract of sale defined in \u00a7 66 of Article 21 or mortgaged by the tenant by a purchase money chattel mortgage under the terms of \u00a7\u00a7 41 to 51, inclusive, of Article 21,\u201d he should either release such property from the distraint or pay the balance due \u201cunder such conditional contract of sale or mortgage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Universal\u2019s lien was not a conditional contract of sale as defined in \u00a7 66 of Art. 21 of the Code as it read before its express repeal by the Uniform Commercial Code because title to the lieued automobiles was never in Universal, the lender, nor was that lien a purchase money chattel mortgage within the terms of \u00a7\u00a7 41-51 of Art. 21 and the contemplation of \u00a7 18 because the money it secured was not due from Palmer, the vendee, to the vendor of the automobiles for or on account of the purchase price, but was money advanced by a third person to provide the purchase price. The purchase money chattel mortgage exempted by \u00a7 18 was such a mortgage as it was defined by Maryland law prior to the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 9-107. Although \u00a7 9-107 now defines \u201cpurchase money security interest\u201d as one taken or retained by the seller to secure all or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>part of the price or taken by a person who makes advances or incurs an obligation to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or use of the collateral, <em>Gay Investment Co. v. </em>Comi, supra, makes clear that before the Commercial Code only a chattel mortgage which secured the vendor for all or part of the purchase price was a purchase money chattel mortgage. Thus, under Maryland law as it existed before the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, the landlord\u2019s lien would have had priority over Universal\u2019s perfected interest since Universal did not have an interest of the types specifically excepted from distraint by \u00a7 18 of Art. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We turn to whether the Uniform Commercial Code repealed \u00a7 18 of Art. 53 of the Code and enacted its own rules as to priority between a landlord\u2019s lien and a perfected Code security interest or amended that section to do this. It did not do either in terms. The lender explicitly concedes, as it must, that there was no complete repeal of \u00a7 18 of Art. 53 by virtue of Code (1964 Replacement Vol.), Art. 9533 (Uniform Commercial Code), \u00a7 10-103, declaring that \u201call laws and parts of laws inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed.\u201d It really argues only that the Commercial Code impliedly amended \u00a7 18 of Art. 53 so as to add as exempt from distress chattels covered by security \u201cfinancing statements\u201d to those under conditional contracts of sale and purchase money chattel mortgages. We think Universal\u2019s concession is correct but that its contention of implied amendment is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">It would be hard to deduce that the Legislature intended to repeal the exemption given by \u00a7 18 to conditional contracts of sale and purchase money chattel mortgages since these forms of secured financing were among the security interests recognized and protected by the Commercial Code, and \u00a7 18, if it remained in effect, would extend their effectiveness. Further the able and knowledgeable subcommittee on laws of the Maryland State Bar Association (which included the president of the Senate, a law professor who was also a member of the Association\u2019s committee on the Commercial Code and a lawyer experienced and active in debtor-creditor relationships) which prepared the bill to revise the law of distress,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Legislative Council which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>recommended the bill to the Legislature and the Legislature which passed it unchanged as Ch. 915 of the Laws of 1965 could scarcely have reasonably thought that the Uniform Commercial Code had repealed \u00a7 18 because Ch. 915 in terms repealed that section as it then existed and enacted in its place a new \u00a7 16 to provide inter alia that all chattels covered by \u201ca recorded conditional contract of sale or chattel mortgage or any other security interest which shall have been recorded prior to the levy under said distraint,\u201d shall, in effect, be exempt from distress. There is no suggestion in the report of the sub-committee (69 <em>Transactions of the Maryland State Bar Association </em>305-07) or in the recommendation of the Legislative Council <em>(Report to The General Assembly of 1965, </em>p. 54), or in Ch. 915 itself that the repeal of \u00a7 18 and the enactment of \u00a7 16 of' Art. 53 was intended to declare or clarify the law of distress, as it was after the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, or that it was other than a usual repeal of an existing, effective statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The matter of whether the Commercial Code impliedly amended \u00a7 18 of Art. 53 requires consideration of the purposes, of that Code and the provisions enacted to accomplish those purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The basic plan of Art. 95B is to deal with the normal and ordinary aspects of a commercial transaction from start to finish by means of nine subtitles, eight of which are devoted to a specific phase or facet of commercial activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Subtitle 1 provides the general rules of construction and definitions applicable to all of the other subtitles. Section 1-103 (references, unless otherwise noted, will be to Code [1964 Replacement Vol.] Art. 95B) provides that \u201cunless displaced by the particular provisions of this article, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant * * * shall supplement its provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The purposes of subtitle 9\u2014Secured Transactions\u2014are well summed up in the appendix to the interim report of the Committee on the Commercial Code to the 1962 Mid-Winter Meeting of the Maryland State Bar Association (67 Transactions 276, 280-81) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cThis Article will replace our present chattel mortgage, conditional sale, trust receipt, factor\u2019s lien, pledge and assignment of accounts receivable statutes. The basic and fundamental idea of the Article is that all of these present varying types of security arrangements can be, and, in the Code, they are assimilated into one single lien concept or interest in personal property which is called a \u2018Security Interest\u2019, with such security interest having different effects which are spelled out in detail depending upon the type of transaction out of which the security interest arises. Under the Article all secured transactions involving personal property would be governed by a single, well organized and comprehensive set of rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The official comment following \u00a7 9-101 reiterates this analysis and adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cUnder this Subtitle the traditional distinctions among security devices, based largely on form, are not retained; the Subtitle applies to all transactions intended to create security interests in personal property and fixtures, and the single term \u2018security interests\u2019 substitutes for the variety of descriptive terms which has grown up at common law and under a hundred-year accretion of statutes. This does not mean that the old forms may not be used, and Section 9-102 (2) makes it clear that they may be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">^Section9-102 (2) says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\u201cThis subtitle applies to security interests created by contract including pledge, assignment, chattel mortgage, chattel trust, trust deed, factor\u2019s lien, equipment trust, conditional sale, trust receipt, other lien or title retention contract and lease or consignment intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>as security. <em>This subtitle does not apply to statutory liens except as provided in </em>\u00a7 <em>9-310.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The official comment states that the purpose of \u00a7 9-102 is to bring all consensual security interests in personal property, with exceptions specified in \u00a7\u00a7 9-103 and 9-104, under subtitle 9. \u201cThe Subtitle does not in terms abolish existing security devices\u201d but if they are used the rules of subtitle 9 govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Section 9-201\u2014General validity of security agreement\u2014provides \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this article a security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the collateral and against creditors.\u201d' The official comment notes that \u201cexceptions to this general rule arise where there is a specific provision in any Subtitle * * as where\u2014\u201cthis Subtitle subordinates the security interest because it has not been perfected (Section9-301) * *</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Section 9-310 gives those who furnish services or materials-to goods subject to a security interest a prior lien over a perfected security interest, with specified exceptions. Section 9-312 defines priority among conflicting security interests in the same collateral, and \u00a7\u00a7 9-401-406 and 9-501-507, respectively, establish the mechanics and effects of filing and procedures upon default.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The purposes and provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code lend us to believe that it did not impliedly amend \u00a7 18 of Art. 53 by exempting from distress security interests not previously exempted. We find persuasive indications to support that view. <em>Bell v. State, </em>236 Md. 356, 365-67, recognized the theory of implied amendment as applicable in Maryland and delineated its controlling rules. An implied amendment is an act which does not state that it is amendatory but which in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>stance alters, modifies or adds to a prior act. Like repeals by implication, amendments by implication are not favored and will not be found unless there is a manifest repugnancy or irreconcilable conflict between the prior and the later act. If the two statutes can stand and be read together, there is no amendment of the first by the second, and the Code and \u00a7 18 of Art. 53 can be read together.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">As we have noted subtitle 9 of the Commercial Code applies to all consensual security interests that are not specifically excluded by \u00a7\u00a7 9-103 and 9-104, as \u00a7 9-102 makes plain. Section 9-104 lists a number of the \u201ctransactions excluded from subtitle\u201d 9. The operative words here pertinent are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201cThis subtitle does not apply * * * (b) to a landlord\u2019s lien; or (c) to a lien given by statute or other rule of law for services or materials except as provided in \u00a7 9-310 on priority of such liens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">It appears that a landlord\u2019s lien and an artisan\u2019s lien were excluded from the applicability of subtitle 9 because they are lion-consensual. Comment 1 to \u00a7 9-102 says that \u201c* * * the principal test whether a transaction comes under this Subtitle is : Is the transaction intended to have effect as security? For example, Section 9-104 excludes certain transactions where the security interest (such as an artisan\u2019s lien) arises under statute or common law by reason of status and not by consent of the parties.\u201d 2 Hawkland <em>A Transactional Guide to the Uniform Commercial Code, </em>\u00a7 2.2201, p. 569, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201cThe policy of Article 9 [Subtitle 9 of Article 95B] is to bring within its scope all transactions that are intended to create security interests in personal property or fixtures, and this policy, therefore, excludes real estate security, such as mortgages and landlord\u2019s liens, as well as personal property transactions that are not consensual in nature. Thus, artisan\u2019s liens generally are excluded from Article 9 because they are created not by agreement but by operation of positive law. Positive law creating non-consensual liens often reflects local considerations and value judgments, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the draftsmen of the Code decided not to interfere with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We conclude that the flat and unqualified exclusion of landlord\u2019s liens from the application of the subtitle left the law on such liens as it was. The exclusion was not limited to ruling landlord\u2019s liens out as a Code security interest or to freeing them from procedural requirements applicable to such security interests; it provided in effect that no part, including rules as to priorities, of subtitle 9 controlled or governed them. This left their status and priority vis-a-vis those of security interests to the existing law. This was the view taken by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, <em>In re Einhorn Bros., Inc., </em>171 F. Supp. 655, 660, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which affirmed under the same name in 272 F. 2d 434, 440-41. On the point here involved, the federal courts, in applying the law of Pennsylvania which adopted the Uniform Commercial Code in 1958 and which had a body of law on distress essentially the same as that of Maryland,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> held that as the Commercial Code in terms did not apply to a landlord\u2019s lien it did not deprive a landlord of the priority his perfected rent claim had under Pennsylvania law and therefore a landlord\u2019s lien continued to be superior to those consensual liens to which it was superior before the Code. See also 2 Anderson <em>Uniform Commercial Code, </em>\u00a7 9-104:3, pp. 480-81, and Schwartz, <em>Pennsylvania Chattel Security and the Uniform Commercial Code, </em>98 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 530, 540-41, where the author, in discussing whether a landlord\u2019s distraint for rent would take precedence over a Code security interest, pointed out that it had been held that the Pennsylvania exemption-from-distress statute did not exempt chattel mortgages, and suggested: \u201cShould this decision be followed, form might retain importance even under the Commercial Code. To avoid such an unfortunate result, it is suggested that the exemption statutes be revised to protect any security interest in the designated types of collateral.\u201d Maryland as we have seen, did by Ch. 915 of the Laws of 1965, just what was suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>We think the intention to completely exclude a landlord\u2019s lien from every part of subtitle 9 is emphasized by the provision of \u00a7 9-104 (c), immediately following that as to landlord\u2019s liens, which gives artisan\u2019s liens priority over perfected security interests as in \u00a7 9-310 provided. The comment to \u00a7 9-310 makes plain that the reason for giving priority expressly to artisan\u2019s liens is that \u201cthere was generally no specific statutory rule as to priority between security devices and liens for services or materials\u201d since many decisions made the priority turn on whether the secured party did or did not have \u201ctitle.\u201d A major Code purpose was to do away with differences and distinctions based on form (although allowing the retention of differences for other purposes, such as between the parties or for purposes of taxation) and the express rule of priority of \u00a7 9-310 accomplished this.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The lender argues that the landlord\u2019s lien which the Commercial Code excludes from the ambit of subtitle 9 must be a statutory lien to qualify and that in Maryland the right of a landlord to seize and sell chattels on the leased premises (the right to sell the chattels was added to the right to seize them in 1690 by the statute of 2 W. &amp; M., c. 5) is merely a right and a remedy and if it becomes a lien upon levy it is not a statutory lien.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, in <em>In re King Furniture City, Inc., </em>240 F. Supp. 453, held that a lien in favor of the landlord created by the lease was not excluded from the coverage of subtitle 9 and in the course of the opinion did say (at p. 457) : \u201cIt also appears that the term \u2018landlord\u2019s lien\u2019 as used in the statute must be interpreted as referring to liens created by statute, for the matter of liens on property such as here involved is obviously considered by all of the remainder of the Code as fitting into a general commercial statute.\u201d The actual holding of the case on this point was that the lien created by the lease was within the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>provisions of the Commercial Code since under the law of Arkansas (which \u201cdoes not recognize the \u2018harsh and oppressive remedies\u2019 of the landlord\u2019s common law right of distraint\u201d) the lien was one created by contract. 2 Anderson <em>Uniform Commercial Code, </em>1966 Cum. Supp., p. <em>71, </em>correctly summarizes the real holding in <em>King </em>and the applicable law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">\u201cThe landlord\u2019s lien which is excluded from the Code is the lien which arises by operation of law or statute. The exclusion clause of the Code does not apply to an express contractual lien given the landlord by the lease with respect to all personal property brought by the tenant on to the premises. Consequently, the express contractual lien is subject to Article 9 of the Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">As has been noted, the landlord in Maryland had a lien by operation of law when the levy was made under the warrant of distraint. We conclude that this lien was \u201ca landlord\u2019s lien\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 9-104 (b) of the Commercial Code, and therefore is excluded from the operation of subtitle 9. Liens of landlords arising by operation of law, as well as statutory liens would seem to have been contemplated because \u00a7 9-102 (2) in terms exempts statutory liens and unless other landlord\u2019s liens than those arising by statute were meant, there would have been no need to have used paragraph (b) as part of \u00a7 9-104. Liens of landlords arising by operation of law meet the test of being nonconsensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">It is suggested that because \u00a7 9-201 provides that a perfected security interest is valid against creditors and \u00a7 9-301 (1) (b) gives priority to one who becomes a lien creditor without knowledge of a security interest before the security interest was perfected (and, so, it is inferred that it gives priority to the perfected security interest over a subsequent lien creditor) the landlord\u2019s lien must be subordinate to a security interest perfected before the landlord\u2019s lien came into being. A lien creditor is defined as one who acquires a lien by attachment or levy and it may be that the landlord\u2019s lien in Maryland acquired, as it was, without judicial aid, was not acquired by levy as that word is used in the Commercial Code. Assuming that it was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>these sections did not change the law. Code (1957), Art. 21, \u00a7 48, made perfected mortgages of personal property valid against creditors, as does \u00a7 9-201 of the Code. Nevertheless, in <em>Gay Investment Co. v. Comi, supra, </em>we held that chattels covered by a chattel mortgage which had been perfected before a landlord\u2019s lien became choate by levy was not exempt from distress because the mortgage was not a purchase money chattel mortgage under the then Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Code (1957), Art. 21, \u00a7 66, like \u00a7 9-301 (1) (b) of the Code, subordinated an unrecorded conditional sales contract to subsequent purchasers, mortgagees, incumbrancers, landlords with liens, pledgees, receivers and creditors who acquired without notice a lien by judicial proceedings. By necessary inference and judicial holding, see <em>In re Careful Laundry, </em>204 Md. 360, a perfected conditional sales contract was superior to the named classes. We held, however, in <em>J. Holland &amp; Sons v. Ettleman, </em>225 Md. 84, that a conditional contract of sale duly executed and recorded in Prince George\u2019s County was not effective under \u00a7 66 of Art. 21 to give priority as against a landlord\u2019s lien because \u00a7 66 of Art. 21 and \u00a7 18 of Art. 53 of the Code must be read together and since \u00a7 18, which created an exception to the general rule that a landlord may seize and sell all chattels on the demised premises not exempt by statute, whether they belong to others or not, expressly was made inapplicable to Prince George\u2019s County, the landlord in that County could prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">It is further suggested that since Ch. 538 of the Laws of 1963 which enacted the Commercial Code expressly repealed \u00a7\u00a7 41 through 67 of Art. 21 of the Code, \u00a7 18 of Art. 53 was rendered inoperative to exempt property covered by conditional sales contracts and purchase money chattel mortgages from distress because \u00a7 18 exempted only conditional sales contracts \u201cdefined in \u00a7 66 of Art. 21\u201d and purchase money chattel mortgages \u201cunder the terms of \u00a7\u00a7 41 to 51, inclusive, of Article 21.\u201d The quoted passages were shorthand aids in identifying and defining what was to be exempt and their effect was to incorporate by reference the provisions of Art. 21 which would identify and define. The Commercial Code did not abolish or purport to abolish conditional contracts of sale or chattel mortgages; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>indeed, their continued use, subject to the rules of that Code,, was contemplated. The repeal of the statutes incorporated by reference into \u00a7 18 did not, we think, destroy the ability to identify and define the kind of instruments given exemption by \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">If it be assumed that the portions of \u00a7 18 here involved were rendered inoperative by the repeal of the identifying and definitional parts of Art. 21, the lender would not be helped. As we noted earlier, in such case there simply would have been no exemption from distress for property covered by any security device.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\"><em>Order </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. In 3 Tiffany, <em>Landlord and Tenant, </em>\u00a7 <em>320, </em>pp. 1897-98, in discussing liens in favor of a landlord arising apart from statute or agreement, the learned author says: \u201cBy the word \u2018lien,\u2019 as we use it in this chapter, is meant a right, as regards particular property, to obtain satisfaction of a claim by the forced sale of such property * * *. Occasionally the right of distress itself has been characterized as a lien, this having reference apparently to the priority obtainable by distress as regards the property subject thereto.\u201d Mr. Tiffany cites as authority, inter alia, the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Salmond, <em>Jurisprudence </em>(at p. 535) \u201ca modern work of high character\u201d so refers to the right of distress and says: \u201cThe word lien has not succeeded in attaining any fixed application as a technical term of English law. Its use is capricious and uncertain.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">.

It is not unusual for the Legislature to state that an enactment is declaratory or corrective, if this is what it intends.

Section 9-310 headed \u201cPriority of certain liens arising by operation of law\u201d provides that \u201cWhen a person in the ordinary course of his business furnishes services or materials with respect to goods subject to a security interest, a lien upon goods in the possession of such person given by statute or rule of law for such materials or services takes priority over a perfected security interest unless the lien is statutory and the statute expressly provides otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"><em>. </em>Pa.
