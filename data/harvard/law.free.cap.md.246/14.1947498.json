Jaseph owns the corporate appellee. Mrs. Ellen O\u2019Meara is one of his employees. In this disquisition both Jaseph and the corporation will be known as Jaseph. The appellant is owned by James Partello whose surname will be used to designate both him and his corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">Early in 1962 Partello bought a tract of land in Prince George\u2019s County which he subdivided and dubbed Holmehurst. By the spring of 1963 he had completed five houses and more were under construction. Jaseph, who had sold the land to Partello, was employed to sell the houses. He was given an exclusive listing and he was to receive a commission of 3percent on all sales. Mrs. O\u2019Meara \u201cwas a saleslady sitting on the project at Holmehurst on weekends and during the week one night.\u201d She thought a friend (Thomas E. Burke), who owned a retail liquor store in Kentland, might be interested in buying one of the houses in Holmehurst. She persuaded him to come out and take a look. Pie did so on 9 August. Mrs. O\u2019Meara said \u201che seemed to show some interest\u201d and that \u201che would be interested\u201d if she \u201ccould sell his house\u201d in Cheverly. Burke testified he was not \u201cin a position to purchase the house\u201d unless he \u201cdisposed of the other house.\u201d In the cross-examination of Mrs. O\u2019Meara the question and answer quoted below appear :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\">\u201cQ. So in reality they [Burke and wife] were not ready, willing and able to buy on or about the 9th day of August 1963, were they, Mrs. O\u2019Meara.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-13\">\u201cA. No sir. I feel that they were very interested in buying.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>On Monday, 19 August 1963, Partello terminated the arrangement with Jaseph. It seems no sales had been made by Jaseph and Partello was \u201cdesperate.\u201d On 21 August Partello sent Jaseph the following letter :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">\u201cRelative to the termination of your association as Real Estate Agents representing my firm at Holmehurst Subdivision, as of 8-19-63 I should appreciate your sending me a registered list of what you consider bonafide clients, showing names, phone numbers and addresses. We will honor this list for a period of two weeks from 8-22-63 until 9-5-63 to the following extent. During this period you may sell them yourself at a commission or if we should close the deal I will reimburse you $300.00. I must have this list by 8-24-63. You understand that this is done strictly as a courtesy on our part and is not an obligation. Thank you for your efforts and I\u2019m sorry you took this so personally. However, business is business and I have to take some drastic steps to insure the success of Holmehurst.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">On 23 August Jaseph replied. Relevant parts of his letter follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u201cReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your letter dated August 21, 1963 terminating the services of Hagan Realty Company, Incorporated, as exclusive agents for the sales at Holmehurst, termination effective August 19, 1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">\u201cRespectfully submitted herewith is list of names [494] of prospects with whom we have been working at the project through termination date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">\u201c* * * After careful consideration and consultation with counsel I do hereby reject the terms proposed by you and further advise you that if any client on the enclosed list is sold a house at Holmehurst by you * * * at any price, at any time from the termina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>tion date to any future period, I will take any necessary legal action * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">\u201cIn conclusion I wish to extend my sincere wishes for success at Holmehurst, as I believe that irrespective of your unorthodox procedures the project will culminate into a real success. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Partello\u2019s reply dated 29 August 1963, in part, follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201cActually, the list <em>you </em>submitted is valueless anyhow since I told you it would have to contain full names, addresses, and telephone numbers. The way it was compiled meant nothing and could have come from most anywhere. It is small wonder that out of approximately 500 names you didn\u2019t have any results if that\u2019s all the information you had on these people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">\u201cMy original premise that you have no claim to commissions on future sales still stands and if you feel otherwise, the burden of proof is on you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">During the second week in September Burke again visited Holmehurst and, for the first time, met Partello. On the list of 494 names sent to Partello by Jaseph was \u201cMr. and Mrs. Tommy Burke.\u201d Partello testified, however, that he had \u201cnever heard of\u201d Burke before they met in September. He said, also, that Burke disclosed nothing of his earlier conversations with Mrs. O\u2019Meara. On 21 September Burke and Partello entered into a contract for the sale of a house then under construction. Partello took a deed for Burke\u2019s house in Cheverly and gave him a credit of $22,000 on the price of the new house. Made a part of the contract was a list of 16 items which Burke insisted be installed in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Jaseph and Mrs. O\u2019Meara sued Partello in July 1965. The case came on for trial before Bowen, J. and a jury on 8 February 1966. At the conclusion of the evidence offered by Jaseph, and again at the conclusion of all of the evidence, the trial judge denied Partello\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. Partello contends the court was wrong in both instances. The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>instructed the jury that \u201cthe real issue is * * * whether or not the plaintiff [Jasephj * * * was the procuring cause of the sale made * * * to Burke.\u201d Partello, he went on to say, had \u201can absolute right to discontinue the agent\u2019s services at any time * * * and that absent some chicanery or bad faith\u2014and there is no evidence or indication of any of that in this case\u2014 the plaintiff is entitled to recover if you find that he was the procuring cause of the sale.\u201d After counsel had been given an opportunity to except to the court\u2019s charge, the trial judge said \u201cthe court declines to instruct the jury that in order to be the procuring cause the broker must have a purchaser ready, willing and able to buy prior to the time his agency is revoked. We give you an exception to our failure to do so.\u201d Partello contends the court\u2019s instruction also was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In our judgment <em>Hill v. Iglehart, </em>145 Md. 537, 125 Atl. 843 (1924) is controlling. Judge Offutt, who wrote the Court\u2019s opinion, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">\u201cThe general rule is that the principal may at any time, before the broker finds a purchaser ready, able and willing to buy the property upon terms satisfactory to the principal, revoke the agency, 9 <em>C.J. </em>563, and that where such revocation is untainted by fraud or bad faith, the broker will not be entitled to commissions even though the principal after the revocation sells the property to a purchaser with whom the broker had been negotiating, and notwithstanding that the broker\u2019s efforts may have been the direct and procuring cause of such sale. <em>Howard v. Street, </em>125 Md. 302; <em>Attrill v. Patterson, </em>58 Md. 226; <em>Beale v. Creswell, </em>3 Md. 201.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550-51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">See also <em>Leimbach v. Nicholson, </em>219 Md. 440, 448, 149 A. 2d 411 (1959); <em>Steele v. Seth, </em>211 Md. 323, 127 A. 2d 388 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">While we agree that the trial judge\u2019s rulings on Partello\u2019s motions for a directed verdict, in the light of the evidence produced before him, were not erroneous, we cannot agree that his charge to the jury was free from error. Partello was entitled to have the jury consider the evidence against the background of the rule announced in <em>Hill v. Iglehart, supra. </em>We think there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>was evidence from which a jury could find that Burke, on 9 August 1963, was not ready, able and willing to buy the property and that Partello\u2019s revocation of the agency was untainted by fraud or bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\n<em>Remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\n<em>Appellees to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
