Frank Washington argues that the district court erred in its interpretation of the Speedy Trial Act and crafted an unconstitutionally vague condition of supervised release. We agree with the latter challenge, but disagree with the former assertion. We also disagree with Washington's only other claim on appeal-that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Thus, we affirm in part and remand narrowly for the district court to reconsider the challenged special condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying facts are relatively straightforward. Washington was arrested at his residence on June 9, 2016 on the basis of a complaint that alleged possession with intent to distribute marijuana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Just over a month later-33 days to be precise-a grand jury charged Washington with possession with intent to distribute within 1000 feet of a school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), 860(a). Washington made his initial appearance on the indictment on October 3, 2016. Shortly thereafter, he moved to dismiss the indictment because of Speedy Trial Act violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 3174.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court denied that motion. Washington then went to trial. After three days of deliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict. At sentencing, Washington's advisory Sentencing Guidelines range was set at 21 to 27 months imprisonment. The district court eventually sentenced him to 27 months imprisonment with four years of supervised release. The term of supervised release included a special condition with respect to gang association and activity (Special Condition #3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, Washington challenges the district court's ruling on his Speedy Trial Act claim, the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, and Special Condition #3. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Speedy Trial Act was passed by Congress \"to give effect to the [S]ixth [A]mendment right\" to a speedy trial.\n   <em>\n    Betterman v. Montana\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596703\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1609/#p1616\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1616,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596703\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1609/#p1616\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). On appeal, Washington argues that the government violated the Act's direction that \"no\n   more than 30 days pass between arrest and indictment,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596703\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1609/#p1616\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596703\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1609/#p1616\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   given 33 days passed between his arrest and indictment. When the government runs afoul of this timeframe, the Act sanctions the government by stating: \"such charge ... contained\n   <em>\n    in such complaint\n   </em>\n   shall be dismissed or otherwise dropped.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203162\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added). As noted above, the complaint and indictment in this case charged two different offenses. Sensing the textual barrier to his desired remedy, dismissal of the indictment, Washington urges adoption of the so-called \"gilding exception.\" In theory, but not often in practice, this doctrine allows dismissal under the Act where \"a [later] charge is one that merely annotates in more detail the same charge alleged in the [complaint].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court declined to apply the gilding exception, but noted that our circuit has yet to speak definitively on its validity. We review the district court's legal conclusion de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Herbst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050773\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/504/#p509\">\n    666 F.3d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 (8th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We find that there is no gilding exception to the Speedy Trial Act. Our prior holdings-while not taking the gilding exception head on-seemingly foreclose its application to the Speedy Trial Act.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10505041\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/194/#p199\">\n    23 F.3d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199 (8th Cir. 1994) (\"A defendant's arrest on one charge does not necessarily trigger the right to a speedy trial on another charge filed after his arrest.\"). More importantly, those holdings are in line with the text of the statute. Again, the Act only permits dismissal of \"such charge ... contained in such [earlier] complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203162\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Given the unambiguous wording of the statute, it should hardly come as a surprise that courts recently \"have questioned [the gilding exception's] doctrinal validity\" as applied to the Speedy Trial Act.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At oral argument, it was suggested that the government could wait \"a day, a month, a year, two years and simply get around the Speedy Trial Act by adding a protected zone location.\" But, the solution to that hypothetical scenario is not to \"do[ ] violence to the statutory language\" in the Speedy Trial Act.\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

Instead, protection may lie in the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial-a constitutional right distinct from the Act.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Given that it was not briefed before us, we do not examine whether the Sixth Amendment was violated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Additionally, even if we were to recognize a gilding exception to the Speedy Trial Act, that would not lead to the dismissal of Washington's indictment. The majority of our sister circuits that have considered the question have agreed that a later-indicted charge which contains different elements than the charge in the initial complaint is not subject to dismissal\n   under the gilding exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is in line \"with Supreme Court precedent analyzing multiple prosecutions.\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916170\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/1229/#p1236\">\n    111 F.3d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the indicted crime required an additional element-evidence that Washington was within 1000 feet of a school-beyond the original possession with intent to distribute charge in the complaint. The doctrine, as widely understood, does not offer support for Washington's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   His argument fares no better under a minority view of the gilding exception. This view, most prominently adopted by the Tenth Circuit, places emphasis on the underlying factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He argues that the district court erred by not varying downward from his Guidelines range because \"(1) of the impact of the protected location enhancement ... ;(2) of the small quantity of marijuana at issue; and (3) the legalization of marijuana by several states.\" We review for abuse of discretion, which \"occurs when a district court (1) fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight; (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor; or (3) considers only the appropriate factors but in weighing those factors commits a clear error of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A \"[s]entence[ ] within the [G]uideline range,\" however, \"[is] presumed to be substantively reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And it is a \"defendant's burden to rebut the presumption and to show that the sentence should have been lower.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Funke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137532\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/998/#p1000\">\n    846 F.3d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1000 (8th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Washington has offered no evidence to rebut our presumption. The district court carefully considered the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) factors-and Washington's arguments-but in the end found a Guidelines sentence was necessary because Washington \"is at extremely high risk to recidivate\" in addition to a number of other factors, including his \"gang membership\" and \"lack of respect for authority, specifically the police.\" Put another way, the district court balanced, and weighed, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in a manner different than Washington would have liked. We, however, grant district courts \"wide latitude to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) in each case\n   and assign some factors greater weight than others in determining an appropriate sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Given this, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing within the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, Washington argues that Special Condition #3 of his supervised release, which deals with gang association, is unconstitutionally vague. In full, the condition states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant must not knowingly associate with any member, prospect, or associate member of any gang without the prior approval of the United States Probation Office. If the defendant is found to be in the company of such individuals while wearing the clothing, colors, or insignia of a gang, the Court will presume that this association was for the purpose of participating in gang activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While a district court has \"broad discretion\" to impose special conditions, when a defendant challenges a special condition on constitutional grounds, as in this case, we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And the term is not delineated by common use. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"gang\" as a \"group of persons who go about together or act in concert, esp. for antisocial or criminal purposes.\" Gang,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Thus, gangs are not necessarily tied to criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LoFranco v.

The lack of statutory definition and its wide-ranging use mean that the term \"gang\" fails to \"convey[ ] sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct\" the district court wants Washington to avoid \"when measured by common understanding and practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

If it were used to mean a \"member\" of a gang, a term already used by the Condition, \"associate member\" would be repetitive.

Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   174 (West 2012). The other possible reading of the term is that \"associate member\" means somebody who associates with actual gang members. This reading suffers from the same vagueness problems we discussed above with respect to the usage of \"gang.\" Such a reading \"could even preclude [Washington] from meeting with his probation officer\" because it encompasses \"those who may have only a social connection to an individual gang member.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
