After misappropriating over $5,000 of those funds for personal expenditures, Askia was charged on March 6, 2013, with theft concerning programs receiving federal funds, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). Askia moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that it violated the applicable statute of limitations. Specifically, Askia claimed that the five-year statute of limitations barred his indictment for offenses committed before March 6, 2008, and that his crime was committed before that date. In fact, and complicating the issue, Askia's alleged criminal conduct straddled this limitations bar; the indictment charged criminal conduct from August 23, 2007, to April 11, 2008. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied Askia's motion, concluding that the offense was a \"continuing offense,\" meaning the crime was not committed until the last date charged in the indictment, and thus the indictment was timely. The district court alternatively held that, even assuming the offense was not a continuing offense and Askia had committed an offense before the limitations bar, the indictment charged a separate \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) offense\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the limitations period. The case proceeded to trial, and a jury returned a guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Askia raises several questions, including one of first impression in this circuit: When an offense prohibits unlawfully taking at least $5,000 from an organization receiving federal funds, is that crime \"committed\" once all elements are established or is the crime continually committed over time?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States government, through a grant program known as the \"21st Century Community Learning Centers,\" provides grant money to subsidize community learning centers, typically for children attending high-poverty, low-performing schools. The Arkansas Department of Education received grant funds from the 21st Century program and then awarded grants to approved entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Askia, the owner of Askia Learning Concepts, submitted an application on behalf of Askia Learning for a 21st Century grant. The application sought a grant in order to establish a community learning center in Arkansas during the 2007-2008 school year. The application was approved, and Askia Learning received a grant for $149,280, the full amount requested in the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 1, 2007, Arkansas Department officials visited Askia Learning's location and discovered several compliance issues. Based on these issues, the Department ordered Askia Learning to cease spending grant funds and to send the Department a current expenditure report with supporting documentation. Department officials then held several meetings with Askia, repeatedly requested documentation,\n   and continually ordered Askia to stop spending grant funds. Askia neither supplied the requested documentation nor stopped spending grant funds. On March 27, 2008, the Department sent Askia Learning a letter, terminating the 21st Century grant based on Askia Learning's failure to comply with grant requirements and demanding repayment of most of the grant. After investigating Askia Learning and Askia, the Government identified numerous expenditures where he allegedly misappropriated grant funds for personal expenditures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 6, 2013, more than five years after Askia Learning received the 21st Century grant, a one-count indictment was returned, charging Askia with a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). The indictment specifically charged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   From on or about August 23, 2007, to on or about April 11, 2008, in the Western District of Arkansas, El Dorado Division, the defendant,\n   <strong>\n    KWAME ALI ASKIA\n   </strong>\n   , being an agent of, Askia Learning Concepts, a for profit organization, said organization receiving in the one year period beginning August 23, 2007, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a 21st Century Community Learning Centers Grant, embezzled, stole, without authority knowingly converted, obtained by fraud, and intentionally misapplied property worth at least $5,000 and owned by and under the care, custody and control of Askia Learning Concepts, that is, grant funds provided for educational services to Strong High School, Strong, Arkansas, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Askia moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the applicable five-year statute of limitations barred his indictment for offenses committed before March 6, 2008. This date landed toward the end of the timeline charged in the indictment (i.e., August 23, 2007, to April 11, 2008). At a hearing on the motion, the Government offered proof of seventeen supposedly personal expenditures, including at least four occurring after March 6, 2008. These four expenditures totaled $5,503.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court denied Askia's motion to dismiss, for two reasons. First, the court concluded that \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) was a \"continuing offense\" and thus the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the last date charged, i.e., April 11, 2008, placing the indictment within the limitations period. Second, even assuming \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) was a completed offense and thus the statute of limitations began to run once all elements of the offense were established, the court concluded that the four expenditures after March 6, 2008, established a separate offense within the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The case proceeded to trial, where Askia represented himself\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   with standby counsel. Notwithstanding the district court's earlier alternative ruling that the indictment charged an offense committed after March 6, 2008, Askia did not challenge the Government's evidence of expenditures before March 6. Askia also did not request a jury instruction or a special verdict form as to the dates of his alleged misappropriations. A jury then returned a guilty verdict. The sentencing court sentenced Askia to twenty-four months of imprisonment, to be followed by thirty-six months of supervised release, and ordered $148,416 in restitution. Askia timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Askia raises four challenges regarding: (A) the statute of limitations, (B) evidentiary issues, (C) his due-process rights, and (D) the sufficiency of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Askia first asserts that the applicable statute of limitations barred the indictment charging him with violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). \"This court reviews de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Larceny is an easy example. A larceny occurs when a person wrongfully or fraudulently takes another's property without her permission or consent, and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. The crime is committed and complete once the last of these elements has occurred.

We see nothing in criminal law that would prevent the prosecution of an individual who commits a series of thefts or embezzlements (which, by their nature, are crimes of concealment) over a number of years from being prosecuted for those crimes that occurred within the limitations period, just because a few of the embezzlements or thefts occurred outside the five years.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, these transactions established that Askia unlawfully took, for his own personal use, over $5,000 from Askia Learning. Because this evidence supports a finding that Askia violated \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) within the statute of limitations, the purported error did not seriously affect the judicial proceeding's fairness, integrity, or public reputation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Askia next complains that the Government submitted, to the grand jury and at trial, a document falsely purporting to be Askia Learning's application for the 21st Century grant. The application admitted into evidence was marked as \"Exhibit 4,\" and Askia contends that Exhibit 4 was not his\n   <em>\n    true\n   </em>\n   grant application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Even assuming Askia properly objected to this evidence, he has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in admitting Exhibit 4 into evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Big Eagle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647053\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/1125/#p1130\">\n    702 F.3d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1130 (8th Cir. 2013) (standard of review). The purported differences between Exhibit 4 and the document that Askia claimed to be his \"true\" application include omitted page numbers, date stamps, and an appendix, as well as different formatting. The most significant difference between the documents, it appears, is the documents' budgetary allocations (allocating the amounts that Askia Learning could spend on certain expenses). Askia has not shown, however, how those purported differences were relevant to the question at trial, i.e., whether Askia misappropriated federal grant funds for his personal expenditures. Askia therefore has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in admitting Exhibit 4 into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moving on, Askia appears to argue that the Government violated his Sixth Amendment rights by not introducing into evidence the document he claims to be the\n   <em>\n    true\n   </em>\n   21st Century grant application. He also suggests that the district court violated his rights by not\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   holding a\n   hearing to determine which document was the real application. Askia nevertheless concedes there was no violation of\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963) (holding that \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution\"). Although his arguments are not entirely clear, we conclude they are meritless. Askia had ample opportunities at trial to introduce his version of the application into evidence and to challenge the validity of Exhibit 4. His own failures did not create Sixth Amendment violations by the Government or the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, Askia contends that the district court should have dismissed the indictment because the Government gave the grand jury a copy of Exhibit 4 (before being marked as such). Askia did not file a motion to dismiss the indictment based on this supposedly false application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(A)(v). Because Askia did not file such motion before trial, he must show good cause for this failure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   12(c)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He has not done so, and therefore his argument is untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Askia next claims that his due-process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated at a pretrial hearing because the Government presented hearsay evidence rather than giving Askia the opportunity to confront an adverse witness who was the source of that evidence. Specifically, after Askia allegedly violated conditions of his pretrial release, the Government petitioned to detain him pending trial. At a hearing on that petition, the Government elicited testimony from a probation officer about the alleged pretrial violations, detailed in a \"violation report.\" The testifying officer, however, had not prepared the report. The Government did not call as a witness the officer who actually had prepared the report. Askia contends that the Government's reliance on the hearsay testimony of the probation officer who had not prepared the violation report was a violation of Askia's due-process rights. For this contention, Askia relies on\n   <em>\n    Morrissey v. Brewer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/#p477\">\n    408 U.S. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/#p477\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/#p477\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even assuming there was such a violation, however, this issue is moot.

The resolution of the issue in this appeal-whether there was a violation of Askia's constitutional rights at the pretrial detention hearing-will have no direct consequence on Askia now. His pretrial detention has concluded (and he has already been released after serving his sentence).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In support of this argument, Askia relies primarily on\n   <em>\n    Barker v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , a defendant must show \"serious prejudice\" resulting from a constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Askia has not shown how he suffered serious prejudice here, besides his conclusory claim that his trial preparation was hindered. Askia also fails to explain how his stand-by counsel-who claims to have met with Askia \"daily\"-was unable to pursue these possible sources of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Askia's last argument is that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction. \"We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, viewing evidence in the light most favorable to the government, resolving conflicts in the government's favor, and accepting all reasonable inferences that support the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
