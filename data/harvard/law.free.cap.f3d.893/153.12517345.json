Thus, we affirmed the District Court's dismissal of their petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Now, two years after their initial detention, Petitioners raise what, at first glance, appear to be the same claims. But upon inspection they differ in a critical respect: The children now have been accorded Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status-a protective classification designed by Congress to safeguard abused, abandoned, or neglected alien children who are able to meet its rigorous eligibility requirements. The protections afforded to children with SIJ status include an array of statutory and regulatory rights and safeguards, such as eligibility for application of adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent residents (LPR), exemption from various grounds of inadmissibility, and robust procedural protections to ensure their status is not revoked without good cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because we conclude that the INA prohibits our review just as it did in\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   , we are now confronted with a matter of first impression among the Courts of Appeals: Does the jurisdiction-stripping provision of the INA operate as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus as applied to SIJ designees seeking judicial review of orders of expedited removal? We conclude that it does. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   , only aliens who have developed sufficient connections to this country may invoke our Constitution's protections. By virtue of satisfying the eligibility criteria for SIJ status and being accorded by Congress the statutory and due process rights that derive from it, Petitioners here, unlike the petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   , meet that standard and therefore may enforce their rights under the Suspension Clause. Accordingly, we will reverse the District Court's denial of Petitioners' request for injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In September and October of 2015, each family crossed into the United States from Mexico and was apprehended by Customs and Border Patrol within four miles of the border almost immediately thereafter. They were initially detained in Texas and later moved to a detention center in Leesport, Pennsylvania. After immigration officers determined that Petitioners were inadmissible, they were each ordered expeditiously removed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

We concluded we did lack jurisdiction under the INA, explaining that, under \u00a7 1252(e)(2)(B), we were only permitted to review \"whether an immigration officer issued that piece of paper [i.e., the expedited removal order] and whether the Petitioner is the same person referred to in that order.\"\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355765\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/422/\">\n    835 F.3d at 431, 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

While the\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   litigation was pending, however, the four children here applied for SIJ status. To do so, they first sought and obtained orders from the Berks County Court of Common Pleas \"finding that reunification with one or both the parents was not viable due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and that it would not be in the child's best interest to be returned to his or her country of origin.\" App. 7-8. Based on those orders, the children submitted petitions for\n   SIJ status to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In late 2016, USCIS approved their petitions and, with the consent of the Secretary of Homeland Security, the children were formally granted SIJ status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Among other benefits, SIJ status conferred on the children eligibility and the right to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent residents while within the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (h)(1). At the time they filed those applications, however, visas necessary for their adjustment of status had not yet come available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, for close to two years, the children have been wait-listed, retaining their SIJ classification and awaiting adjustment of their status to LPR. Notwithstanding these developments, however, DHS continued to detain the children and their mothers and to seek their expedited removal-removal to the very countries to which USCIS and the Berks County Court of Common Pleas both found, as part of the SIJ determination, it would not be in the children's best interest to return. The Government's decision to continue seeking removal is particularly noteworthy because, as far as we are aware, until very recently DHS has never attempted to remove SIJ-classified children back to their countries of origin, much less on an expedited basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In view of the children's changed status, Petitioners filed a new class action complaint seeking a writ of habeas corpus or injunction to prevent the Government from executing the expedited removal orders against them and to require their release from immigration detention pursuant to those orders, on the ground that their SIJ classification prohibited their expedited removal and continued detention. Petitioners also sought a declaration that their expedited removal violates due process, and an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. In so doing, Petitioners claimed that their expedited removal violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act and its implementing regulations, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (which implements the Convention Against Torture), and the Administrative Procedure Act. They also asserted a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action on the ground that their continued detention violated their Fifth Amendment right not to be illegally detained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District Court initially granted Petitioners' request for a temporary restraining order. But the case was then reassigned to a different judge who dissolved the TRO and declined to issue a preliminary injunction, interpreting\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   to mean that Petitioners could not succeed on the merits of their claims because the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus, enjoin Petitioners' removal, or place them in standard removal proceedings.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Government asserts that, for all intents and purposes, this case is identical to\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   and our holding there dictates the same outcome here. As we explain below, while we agree with the Government that\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   forecloses our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(e)(2), we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   supports a different result as to the constitutionality of that jurisdiction-stripping provision as applied to SIJ designees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We will address, first, the question of our jurisdiction under the INA; second, the constitutionality of \u00a7 1252(e)(2) under\n   the Suspension Clause as applied to Petitioners; and third, the consequences of our analysis for Petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory Basis for Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioners' challenge arises at the conflux of two provisions of the INA. On the one hand, as we explained in detail in\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   , Congress prescribed expedited removal procedures to facilitate the speedy processing of certain inadmissible aliens, limiting their access to federal courts under \u00a7 1252(e)(2) and granting immigration officers virtually unchecked authority to effect their removal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355765\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/422/\">\n    835 F.3d at 425-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, as Petitioners argue, for certain aliens present in the country, including SIJ designees, Congress has provided for special immigrant classifications, affording them a status and statutory protections that may not be revoked without specified process, including judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (27)(J)\n   <em>\n    as modified by\n   </em>\n   Pub.

Because the children have now attained this status, they contend they are exempted from the application of \u00a7 1252(e)(2) and the courts retain statutory jurisdiction to review their expedited removal orders. We briefly review the provisions of the INA relevant to expedited removal and to SIJ status before explaining why\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   definitively resolved this issue in the Government's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Expedited Removal of Inadmissible Aliens\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a general matter, when an immigration officer determines that an alien \"is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted\" to the United States, the INA requires that the alien be placed in standard removal proceedings.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229a (standard removal proceedings). Those proceedings take place before an IJ and provide the alien with a variety of procedural protections, including the rights to present evidence, examine the evidence against him, demand reconsideration or reopening of his case, and appeal adverse decisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229a(b)(4)(B), (c)(5), (c)(6), (c)(7);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Serrano-Alberto v.

Those requirements include: (1) that the alien be \"arriving in the United States\" or not have been continuously present in the United States for two years; (2) that the alien has \"not been admitted or paroled\" into the United States; and (3) that the alien either lack valid immigration documentation or have made a misrepresentation in an attempt to attain immigration status.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Aside from an asylum interview, such aliens are afforded no procedural protections, let alone the various procedural safeguards of standard removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As relevant to Petitioners' claims, expedited removal also affects aliens in two other respects. First, the INA tightly constrains judicial review of expedited removal orders, stripping federal courts of jurisdiction to review such orders except on three narrow grounds: (1) whether the petitioner is an alien; (2) whether the petitioner was \"ordered removed\" under the expedited removal provisions; and (3) whether the petitioner can prove that she has been granted legal permanent resident, refugee, or asylum status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(e)(2). Underscoring the limited scope of the second ground, the statute specifies that the inquiry into whether a petitioner was \"ordered removed\" may address only \"whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it relates to the petitioner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(e)(5).

In that case, the court agreed with the petitioners, focusing on the fact that \u00a7 1252(e)(5) directs the \"ordered removed\" inquiry to \"whether [the order] relates to the petitioner,\" and then concluding that review of whether the statute was \"lawfully applied is a review of the question of whether an order of expedited removal has been entered against them and whether the order 'relates' to the individual.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099923\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/272/650/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099923\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/272/650/\">\n    at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet each of these rights and protections would be summarily stripped from Petitioners upon execution of the expedited orders of removal against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The second factor, irreparable harm, is also satisfied given the finding in this case by a juvenile court \"that reunification with one or more of the child's parents was not viable due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and that it would not be in the child's best interest to be returned to his or her country of origin.\" App. 7-8. This conclusion is also bolstered by the drastic legal consequences that expedited removal would carry for Petitioners' pending applications for adjustment of status and future admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.i.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The third and fourth factors also weigh in favor of Petitioners. We are aware of the \"public interest in prompt execution of removal orders\" and the Supreme Court's admonition against characterizing the Government harm in removal cases as \"nothing more than one alien being permitted to remain while an appeal is decided.\"\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p434\">\n    556 U.S. at 435-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p434\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). But the fact that the Government has not-until now-sought to remove SIJ applicants, much less designees, undermines any urgency surrounding Petitioners' removal.
