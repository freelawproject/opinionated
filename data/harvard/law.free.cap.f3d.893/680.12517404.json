McNair's complaint alleged that Defendants, including the law firm Maxwell &amp; Morgan P.C., violated the FDCPA in their efforts to collect unpaid homeowner association assessments and other charges that she allegedly owed their client, the Neely Commons Community Association (\"Association\"). In the Memorandum Disposition filed together with this Opinion, we affirm the district court's conclusion that all but two of Plaintiff's FDCPA claims were untimely and the grant of summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiff's timely claim that Defendant violated the FDCPA by not responding expeditiously to Plaintiff's requests for a statement of the amount she owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court also granted summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiff's sole other timely claim, which alleged that in judicial proceedings in 2013 and 2014, Defendants misrepresented the amount of Plaintiff's debt and sought attorneys' fees to which they were not entitled. With respect to this claim, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment against Plaintiff and denial of Plaintiff's\n   motion for partial summary judgment, as explained herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because most of the facts in this decade-long saga bear little or no relevance to the basis for this Opinion, we do not recite the entire history of the case, which was ably summarized in the district court's decision. As relevant here, Plaintiff bought a home in Gilbert, Arizona in 2004 that was part of the Neely Commons Community Association. Plaintiff was required, under a declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions, to pay an annual assessment to the Association in monthly installments. When an owner fails to pay an installment, after the Association makes a written demand, the Association can record a notice of lien on the owner's property. The Association has the right to collect the debt, including late fees, costs, and attorneys' fees, by suing the owner or by bringing an action to foreclose the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants first notified Plaintiff in 2009 of her failure to pay a debt arising out of her homeowner association assessment. Defendants represented the Association in suing Plaintiff, after which the parties entered into a payment agreement. After Plaintiff defaulted on the agreement, Defendants revived the lawsuit and obtained a default judgment in 2010. As the district court noted, the record is silent as to what occurred in 2011. In 2012, Defendants represented the Association in suing Plaintiff again, and the parties agreed to a new payment plan and to execute a stipulated judgment against Plaintiff that recognized the Association's right to collect the debt by selling Plaintiff's home. Plaintiff failed to make all of the required monthly payments. In November 2013, Defendants requested via praecipe, and the Maricopa Superior Court granted, a writ of special execution for foreclosure on Plaintiff's house. The property was sold for $75,000 at a foreclosure sale, and Defendants and their client received a total of $11,600.13 in satisfaction of the debt, including attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court rejected Plaintiff's claim that Defendants violated the FDCPA in judicial proceedings in 2013 and 2014 by misrepresenting the amount of Plaintiff's debt and seeking attorneys' fees to which they were not entitled, on two separate and apparently independent grounds. First, the district court held that Defendants were not engaged in \"debt collection\" as defined under the FDCPA. Second, the district court held that Defendants' filing of the writ did not violate the FDCPA because the Maricopa County Superior Court later approved the attorneys' fees claimed in the writ. We disagree with both grounds and therefore reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Writing without the benefit of our subsequent published opinions, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the district court concluded that Defendants were not engaged in \"debt collection\" as defined under the FDCPA because the writ was filed in order to foreclose on a lien. We now clarify that Defendants' effort to collect homeowner association fees through judicial foreclosure constitutes \"debt collection\" under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the FDCPA, a \"debt\" is \"any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5). The Act \"defin[es] the term 'debt collector' to embrace anyone who 'regularly collects or attempts to collect ... debts owed or due ... another.' \"\n   <em>\n    Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/#p1721\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1721,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/#p1721\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (citing\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6) ) (alterations in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This statutory language notwithstanding, the district court concluded that \"Defendants' filing of the writ did not constitute a violation\" of the Act, relying in part on\n   <em>\n    Hulse v.

Bank, FSB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9425734\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/195/1188/#p1204\">\n    195 F.Supp.2d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1204 (D. Or. 2002), for the proposition that foreclosure proceedings are not the collection of a debt for purposes of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court's holding cannot be reconciled with the language of the FDCPA. The record makes clear that Defendants were in fact \"debt collectors\" collecting \"debt.\" The debt here accrued as a result of Plaintiff's failure to pay homeowner association fees. Accordingly, Plaintiff's \"obligation ... to pay money ar[ose] out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes[.]\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5) (defining \"debt\" under the Act);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mashiri v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ho\n   </em>\n   , we noted that because \"[t]he object of a non-judicial foreclosure is to retake and resell the security, not to collect money from the borrower[,]\" and because \"California law does not allow for a deficiency judgment following non-judicial foreclosure[,]\" \"the foreclosure extinguishes the entire debt even if it results in a recovery of less than the amount of the debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 571-72 (citing Cal.

Accordingly, we held that \"actions taken to facilitate a non-judicial foreclosure, such as sending the notice of default and notice of sale, are not attempts to collect 'debt' as that term is defined by the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 572. Here, by contrast, Defendants filed the Praecipe and Writ in order to collect a debt arising from Plaintiff's failure to pay homeowner association fees as part of a judicial foreclosure scheme that in many cases allows for deficiency judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2033-727\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 33-727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A), 33-729(B)-(C). Therefore, and for the reasons discussed above, this action constitutes debt collection under the FDCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As an independent basis for summary judgment, the district court also concluded that the Maricopa County Superior Court implicitly approved the attorneys' fees claimed, first by issuing the writ and later by rejecting Plaintiff's subsequent challenges to the amount of fees made in Plaintiff's motion to cancel the sheriff's sale and in Plaintiff's motion for relief from judgment. In so doing, however, the district court failed to examine whether Defendants were legally entitled to claim the attorneys' fees owed at the time Defendants made the writ application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Arizona, a party that has obtained a judgment \"may have a writ of execution or other process issued for its enforcement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2012-1551\">\n    Ariz.
