Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While patrolling Interstate 30 on November 6, 2014, Corporal Chris Goodman, a twelve year veteran of the Arkansas State Police, stopped a Tornado bus for following a tractor trailer too closely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-51-305\">\n    Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-51-305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the suppression hearing, Goodman testified that traffic enforcement was an important part of his duties, but he was also a member of an Interstate Criminal Patrol Team that had \"saturate[d]\" this portion of I-30 with patrol cars and canine units, seeking to uncover evidence of criminal activity by those who were legitimately stopped for traffic violations. In this capacity, Goodman had attended drug interdiction training at the federal El Paso Intelligence Center and regularly received High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area summaries identifying methods being used by those smuggling drugs across the country. These intelligence summaries had reported \"countless\" seizures of contraband from Tornado buses, a bus line popular along the U.S.-Mexico border, and that drug traffickers were storing drugs in unlabeled, apparently abandoned luggage to keep police from linking a bag to a passenger if drugs were discovered in the luggage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the stop, in a brief conversation with the bus driver, Jose Soto, Goodman observed Soto's \"hands were trembling\" and his voice was \"pretty nervous and shaky.\" Goodman found this odd because a professional driver typically interacts more comfortably with law enforcement and regulatory authorities than the average driver. Soto provided his commercial driver's license, said four passengers were on the bus, and said he was driving to Milwaukee from southern Texas. Examining the passenger manifest, Goodman noted the passengers were en route to Chicago, not Milwaukee. He thought it suspicious that a bus company would undertake a costly cross-country trip with only four passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Approximately two minutes after making contact, Goodman asked Soto if there was any contraband on the bus and if he could search the bus. Goodman testified that he quickly asked for consent because, had Soto refused, Goodman would have time to call for one of the nearby canine units while he completed the traffic stop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Soto consented to the search and opened three doors to a luggage compartment in the bus's undercarriage. Goodman saw five or six bags with name tags hanging off their handles inside the far right door. On the left side of the middle door, Goodman testified, \"was a black bag all by itself with no apparent markings of any kind, no name tag associated with it, nothing.\" Seeing no name tag \"made me think that it was either the driver's luggage because he wouldn't put a name tag on his own luggage or it was someone who didn't want me to know whose bag it was.... [I]t was an unclaimed bag for that reason.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Goodman opened the black bag in the luggage compartment and reached inside, feeling what he believed was a false bottom. While trying to access the hidden compartment, Goodman saw a name tag bearing Tuton's name trapped beneath the bag's collapsed handle. Goodman stopped searching the bag, requested a canine unit, and entered the bus to question the passengers. One passenger had his luggage above the seat and consented to a search. Goodman testified that passenger Tuton was \"very nervous,\" the only passenger\n   who appeared to avoid eye contact with him. Tuton said his journey began in El Paso, where Goodman knew \"a lot of drugs cross the border ... and then are distributed ... all across the country.\" Tuton's explanation why he chose to take the bus rather than fly \"didn't make sense.\" He initially said he did not fly because the plane ticket was too expensive, but then said a plane ticket would have cost $120.00 when he paid $192.00 for the bus ticket. Goodman testified that he did not know what was in the false compartment of Tuton's bag but suspected drugs were hidden there. Asked why he did not ask Tuton for consent to search, Goodman replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I thought is the consent tainted if for some reason [Tuton] saw me already looking in his bag.... I feel like the most neutral thing to do will just be have a dog come run the bus ... the dog doesn't know anything about what I did.... He just runs, and he tells us whether he smells the drugs he's trained to smell or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   About four minutes after Goodman requested the canine unit, Corporal Rocky Rapert arrived with his drug-detection dog, Hemi. Goodman asked that Hemi sniff one suitcase, but Rapert said he would deploy Hemi on the entire luggage compartment. At the suppression hearing, Rapert explained this practice strengthens the reliability of any alert because a handler who directs his dog to sniff only one bag can be accused of having \"cued\" a false alert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hemi jumped into the luggage compartment and immediately showed behavioral changes. He assumed an excited posture, normal for being \"in the odor of narcotics,\" closed his mouth, breathing just through his nose, and focused his sniffing on the back side of the luggage area. When Rapert pulled Hemi away from the luggage compartment, Hemi resisted leaving. Rapert concluded Hemi had given a \"profound alert,\" a behavior change that any lay person would notice, which is a more definitive signal of drug detection than a \"normal alert,\" a change detectible only by the handler. Though Hemi sniffed the individual bags in the compartment, he did not give a \"final indication\" on any bag-when Hemi sits or stands before and stares at the source of the drug odor he is detecting. Based on the profound alert, Rapert advised Goodman that Hemi's behavior provided probable cause to search for drugs in the luggage compartment. Officers searched all the bags and, in Tuton's, found eight pounds of cocaine after breaking into the false bottom. Tuton confessed to transporting the cocaine in a post-arrest interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In denying Tuton's motion to suppress, the district court concluded: (i) Corporal Goodman conducted a lawful traffic stop and had reasonable suspicion to investigate whether the bus was transporting contraband; (ii) Goodman's warrantless search of the bag without probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or consent violated passenger Tuton's Fourth Amendment rights; (iii) Hemi's profound alert provided a lawful, independent source of probable cause to justify search of the bags in the compartment; and (iv) \"all the facts surrounding [Hemi's] alert, viewed through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   On appeal, Tuton first argues that he was unconstitutionally seized when Corporal Goodman unreasonably expanded the traffic stop by asking bus driver Soto if there was any contraband in the bus and if Goodman could search the bus. This contention\n   is without merit. It is of course true that \"[a] seizure justified only by a police-observed traffic violation ... becomes unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete the mission of issuing a ticket for the violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Here, Corporal Goodman asked bus driver Soto for consent to search the bus only two minutes after the traffic stop began.

Alternatively, any possible causal connection ... is so attenuated that any taint of the unlawful search is purged.\" On appeal, acknowledging that Goodman testified he would have called for a canine unit anyway, Tuton argues that the close temporal proximity between Goodman's discovery of the false bottom, discovery of Tuton's name tag, ceasing his search of the bag, calling for a canine unit, and directing dog handler Rapert to a bag with a false compartment \"supports the conclusion that [Hemi's] sniff was tainted by the unconstitutional discovery of the false compartment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This argument has considerable force, but we reject it for two reasons. First, as the district court noted, Goodman testified that his suspicions were raised before he received consent to search the luggage compartment, and he would have called for a canine unit even had he not discovered the false bottom in Tuton's bag. This is supported by his testimony that he asked Soto for consent early in the encounter so\n   that, if Soto refused, there would be time for a canine unit to arrive before Goodman completed the traffic stop. Of course, in that event, the dog would have sniffed from outside the closed luggage compartment, but Soto's consent provided whatever consent was needed to enter the compartment where Hemi alerted. The district court necessarily credited Goodman's testimony in finding that Hemi's alert was not tainted by Goodman's prior search of the bag. Deferring to that credibility determination, as we must, we conclude the district court committed no clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We agree with the court that passenger Tuton had a protected privacy interest in properly tagged luggage stowed in the bus's luggage compartment. But the court did not focus on the brief, isolated, and good faith nature of Goodman's unlawful search. Goodman had received law enforcement communications reporting that drug traffickers were smuggling illegal drugs in unlabeled, apparently abandoned luggage so they could not be identified if the drugs were discovered. When he found an isolated bag matching that description in the luggage compartment of a bus that had aroused his suspicion of criminal activity, Goodman believed he could search the bag as abandoned property. It is \"firmly established that a warrantless search of abandoned property is not unreasonable and does not violate the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11893816\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/130/1316/#p1317\">\n    130 F.3d 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1317 (8th Cir. 1997). Like other fact-intensive Fourth Amendment issues, \"[w]hether the basis for such authority exists is the sort of recurring factual question to which law enforcement officials must be expected to apply their judgment; and all the Fourth Amendment requires is that they answer it reasonably.\"\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

Even if this decision was based on his discovery of the false bottom in a bag he believed was abandoned property, the decisive question becomes whether the subsequently discovered cocaine must be suppressed because it was tainted by information acquired in this manner.

Therefore, the district court's conclusion that Hemi's general alert gave officers probable cause to search the bags would mean that a dog's alert to a luggage compartment that contained hundreds of bags would justify a warrantless search of every bag. This argument, while it parades a legitimate \"horrible,\" ignores that the determination of probable cause depends on the totality of the circumstances, which included Corporal Goodman's suspicions as well as Hemi's profound general alert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donnelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752719\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/946/#p955\">\n    475 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   955 ;\n   <em>\n    Carbajal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203724\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/449/551/#p555\">\n    449 F.

He knew that passenger Tuton's journey began in El Paso and observed that Tuton, one of only four passengers, was nervous, evasive, and gave inconsistent answers about the nature of his trip.

This conclusion obviously does not mean that hundreds of bags in the luggage compartment of another bus could be searched without consent or a warrant based on a drug dog's general alert. The Fourth Amendment probable cause inquiry is always fact specific. With Hemi's profound alert, Goodman had probable cause to search Tuton's bag because he was the only nervous and evasive bus passenger. The dissent's assertion that Hemi's alert did not provide probable cause to search the other six bags is of no moment. \"Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    Rakas v.

But, here, Hemi did not sniff the outside of a personal vehicle. Rather, Hemi had complete access to the entire inside of the luggage compartment of a commercial bus containing bags owned by multiple travelers, each with his or her own individual, reasonable expectation of privacy. Inside that compartment were seven bags. And yet, even when he was allowed to sniff each of them individually, Hemi showed no interest in any of the bags. Instead, he returned repeatedly to the back wall of the luggage compartment. Of course, as the government witnesses posited, it is possible that Hemi was overwhelmed by the odor because he was operating in an unfamiliar environment. But that possibility undermines, rather than enhances, the reliability of Hemi's alert on any particular spot. In light of Hemi's alert to the luggage compartment, his disinterest in the bags, and his strong interest in the compartment's rear wall, it is my view that Goodman lacked probable cause to conduct a search of each individual piece of luggage in the compartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The court states that the district court \"necessarily credited Goodman's testimony\" based on the ultimate conclusion it reached, but the district court made no explicit credibility determination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The district court concluded, in the alternative, that \"any possible causal connection between the unlawful search and the discovery of the cocaine is so attenuated that any taint of the unlawful search is purged.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hamilton v.

Even if we stretched to assume that Hemi's \"general alert\" constituted sufficient proof that 1 out of 7 of the bags contained drugs, it does not seem obvious to me that an officer is justified to search each bag based on the approximately 14 percent chance that that bag is the one that contains contraband.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
