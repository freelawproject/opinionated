We affirm, except as to the restitution award where we reverse in part and remand for further consideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Lagos v.

He worked in the company's office in Elk Horn, Iowa. In 2010, Cornelsen was named the company's Chief Financial Officer. In April 2014, Cornelsen was terminated and MVT launched an internal review into his corporate activities. After several months of private investigation, which cost the company $763,746.74, MVT referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2016, a grand jury indicted Cornelsen on five counts of wire fraud. The indictment charged Cornelsen with defrauding MVT of $297,985.13 through unauthorized wire transfers made between January 2013 and February 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, David Oswald, a forensic accounting expert, testified regarding an Ernst &amp; Young (E &amp; Y) audit of Cornelsen's corporate activities. The E &amp; Y audit estimated Cornelsen defrauded MVT of a total of $1,453,025.42. Accordingly, the government presented evidence of uncharged, yet related conduct, including unauthorized, non-business expenditures made using manual checks and a company credit card. In November 2016, a jury found Cornelsen guilty on all five counts of wire fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Presentence Investigative Report recommended the court find an actual loss amount of $1,150,320.09 for purposes of determining the base offense level under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B1.1. At sentencing, Special Agent Kevin Kohler, a certified public accountant\n   , testified to the calculations. Kohler used the E &amp; Y audit's $1,453,025.42 calculation as a baseline and recommended the court (1) remove a $206,250.00 personal loan that did not appear to be fraudulent, (2) remove $321,846.75 in potentially ambiguous vehicle expenditures, and (3) include a $225,391.42 unauthorized cash bonus from November 2012. After making certain credibility findings and determining the E &amp; Y audit to be a \"very conservative\" estimate of the actual losses, the district court adopted the recommended loss calculation of $1,150,320.09. The court then turned to restitution, awarding $1,150,320.09 in losses, as well as $250,000.00 in attorney and accountant fees, for a total restitution award of $1,400,320.09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cornelsen appeals the district court's calculation of the loss amount and restitution award, arguing any amount over the $297,985.13 stated in the indictment, and any conduct outside of the time period stated in the indictment, cannot be included in either calculation. Cornelsen also argues MVT is not a \"victim\" under the Guidelines or the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Turning first to the calculation of the loss amount, we review the district court's interpretation of the term \"loss\" under the Guidelines\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The commentary also clearly defines a \"victim\" as \"any person who sustained any part of the actual loss,\" with \"person\" including \"individuals, corporations, companies, associations, [and] firms.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.1. Based on \u00a7 2B1.1 and the associated commentary, we conclude the district court correctly determined MVT was a victim and suffered actual and intended pecuniary losses as a result of Cornelsen's fraudulent activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Furthermore, \"we take a broad view of what conduct and related loss amounts can be included in calculating loss.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As the court reasonably relied on the E &amp; Y audit and related expert testimony, the evidence related to the charged and uncharged conduct, and Agent Kohler's testimony as to the suggested modifications, we conclude the loss calculation is supported by a preponderance of evidence. Because we give deference to the district court's assessment of this evidence, we find no clear error in the court's loss calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fazio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045772\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/646/#p657\">\n    487 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   659 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
