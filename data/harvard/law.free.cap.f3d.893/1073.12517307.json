Under that section, an alien is removable if he has been convicted of violating \"any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21).\" Section 802 defines \"controlled substance\" as a \"drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   An immigration judge concluded that Bueno-Muela's state conviction made him removable, and the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Bueno-Muela's administrative appeal. The Board reasoned that the question of removability turned on whether the elements of Bueno-Muela's state offense were a categorical match to the elements of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Descamps v.

After determining that \u00a7 195.202 was overbroad but divisible, the Board consulted Bueno-Muela's record of conviction and concluded that Bueno-Muela was convicted of a controlled substance offense within the meaning of the federal statute. Bueno-Muela disputes this conclusion, and we review the Board's legal determination\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of Bueno-Muela's offense,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20195.202\">\n    Mo.

A separate section, \u00a7 195.010(5), defined \"controlled substance\" with reference to five drug schedules set forth in \u00a7 195.017. Bueno-Muela argues that \u00a7 195.202 is broader than the federal removal statute because it criminalizes the possession of two controlled substances-salvia divinorum and ephedrine-that are not listed in the federal drug schedules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 195.017.2(4), (jj), 195.017.8(6). He further asserts that \u00a7 195.202 is indivisible between removable and non-removable offenses, because the specific controlled substance is a means, not an element, of the state offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

June 27, 2018), also filed today, we considered a similar challenge involving a\n   conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20195.211\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 195.211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). After examining the text of \u00a7 195.211, the Missouri approved jury instructions, and decisions of the Missouri courts, we concluded that the specific controlled substance was an element of \u00a7 195.211 and that the statute was therefore divisible based on the identity of the controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-4242, op. at 7-8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517306\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/1067/\">\n    893 F.3d at 1072-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, we relied primarily on two decisions of the Missouri Court of Appeals:\n   <em>\n    Salmons v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11523225\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/16/635/\">\n    16 S.W.3d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. Ct. App. 2000), and\n   <em>\n    State v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9032068\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/4/\">\n    153 S.W.3d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. Ct. App. 2005). In\n   <em>\n    Salmons\n   </em>\n   , the court held that knowledge of the specific controlled substance is an element of the offense of manufacturing methamphetamine under \u00a7 195.211.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11523225\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/16/635/\">\n    16 S.W.3d at 637-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , the court held that \"the possession, with intent to distribute, of any one of the different controlled substances listed in Schedules I through V [is]\n   <em>\n    a separate and distinct offense\n   </em>\n   under \u00a7 195.211.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9032068\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/4/\">\n    153 S.W.3d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Salmons\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   similarly resolve the means-versus-elements question in this case. Although Bueno-Muela was convicted under a different statutory section, nothing in the statute or other sources of Missouri law suggests that the identity of a controlled substance is treated differently in the drug possession statute, \u00a7 195.202, than in the drug trafficking statute, \u00a7 195.211. Both sections cross-reference the same list of controlled substances, and \"possession of methamphetamine in violation of section 195.202 is a lesser-included offense of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver in violation of section 195.211.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Neher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8330247\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/213/44/#p48\">\n    213 S.W.3d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (Mo. 2007). Having ruled in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   that the identity of a controlled substance is an element of possession with intent to deliver under \u00a7 195.211, we likewise conclude that the specific controlled substance is an element of simple possession under \u00a7 195.202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bueno-Muela contends that the identity of a controlled substance cannot be an element of the offense because it operates instead as the unit of prosecution. He asserts that by forbidding the possession of \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   controlled substance\" under \u00a7 195.202, the Missouri legislature intended merely to authorize separate prosecutions for the possession of each controlled substance, thereby avoiding any double-jeopardy concerns arising from cumulative punishments for the same offense. Bueno-Muela then claims that it would have been unnecessary to write the statute in this way if each controlled substance were an element of the offense. But the Missouri Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   concluded that it was precisely the use of the singular in \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   controlled substance\" that made possession of each controlled substance a \"separate and distinct\n   <em>\n    offense\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9032068\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/4/\">\n    153 S.W.3d at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). That the legislature could have accomplished the same meaning with different text does not undermine the conclusion that we draw from\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bueno-Muela's other arguments about the statutory text, approved jury instruction, and Missouri case law echo the contentions raised by the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   . We reject them for the same reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-4242, op. at 5-7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517306\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/1067/\">\n    893 F.3d at 1071-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the identity of a controlled substance is an element of the drug possession offense under \u00a7 195.202, the statute is divisible based on the substance involved. The Board properly consulted the record of conviction to determine whether Bueno-Muela was convicted of violating a state law relating to a controlled substance listed in the federal drug schedules. Bueno-Muela's record of conviction establishes\n   that he pleaded guilty to a count charging that he \"possessed\n   <em>\n    methamphetamine\n   </em>\n   , a controlled substance, knowing of its presence and nature.\" Methamphetamine is a Schedule III controlled substance under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Board therefore correctly concluded that Bueno-Muela was removable for committing a controlled substance offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The petition for review is denied.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
