Before trial, the State moved for a protective order for A.C.'s deposition, requiring that Rosales-Martinez be separated from her by a one-way mirror, and that she not be told he is on the other side. Rosales-Martinez consented to the one-way mirror, but requested A.C. be told he was present and could hear her. At a hearing on June 11, 2001, the child's therapist and her foster mother testified. According to the therapist, A.C. is concerned about seeing Rosales-Martinez, continually afraid of running into him, and would be very traumatized if she knew he was in the same building. The foster mother testified that A.C. encountered him at a parade and was in a state of panic for nearly 30 minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 5, the court denied Rosales-Martinez's request, making these findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   A.C. would suffer serious trauma caused by testifying in the physical presence of the defendant and that it would impair A.C.'s ability to communicate and that the protective measures stipulated to by the parties and endorsed by the Court are necessary to protect A.C. from trauma.... The Court finds and the parties stipulate that the defendant shall remain behind a one-way mirror where he can see and hear A.C. but that A.C. cannot hear nor see defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the first trial, the State moved for a protective order for A.C.'s trial testimony. Rosales-Martinez agreed to A.C. testifying by closed-circuit television, but again requested she be told he was present and could hear her. Relying on the previous findings, the judge denied Rosales-Martinez's request. The jury deadlocked. The court declared a mistrial. Before the retrial began on January 8, 2002, the court again discussed A.C.'s trial testimony. A.C.'s guardian ad litem told the trial court that the previous procedure was still necessary based on conversations with A.C. The parties agreed to the procedure used in the first trial. The court reiterated its previous findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rosales-Martinez was found guilty. He appealed.
