ASARCO asserts that the award is invalid because the arbitrator reformed the Basic Labor Agreement (\"BLA\") between the Union and ASARCO in contravention of a no-add provision in that agreement. The Union argues that the arbitrator did not contravene the no-add provision because he was required to reform the BLA upon finding that the parties were mutually mistaken as to its terms when they agreed to it. The district court affirmed the award, holding that ASARCO properly preserved its objection to the arbitrator's jurisdiction, but the arbitrator was authorized to reform the BLA, despite the no-add provision, based on a finding of mutual mistake. We affirm, but conclude that ASARCO did not properly preserve its objection to the arbitrator's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ASARCO is a miner, smelter, and refiner of copper and other precious metals with facilities in Arizona and Texas. ASARCO's employees are represented by the Union. ASARCO and the Union are parties to the BLA, which was originally effective January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2010. The BLA was modified and extended through two Memoranda of Agreement (\"MOA\") negotiated in 2010 and 2011. Article 9, Section B of the BLA provides that a Copper Price Bonus (\"Bonus\") will be paid quarterly to employees who participate in ASARCO's pension plan. The Bonus is calculated based on the price of copper and is significant, at times as much as $8,000 annually per employee. The 2011 MOA modified Article 12, Section Q of the BLA to make employees hired on or after July 1, 2011 ineligible for ASARCO's pension plan, and thus ineligible for the Bonus. The Union, unaware of the link between the pension plan and the Bonus,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a grievance disputing ASARCO's refusal to pay the Bonus to employees hired after July 1, 2011. The case proceeded to arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the beginning of the arbitration hearing the parties stipulated that the matter was properly before the arbitrator and that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide the grievance. The Union claimed there was a mutual mistake in the 2011 MOA: the parties failed to recognize that Article 9, Section C of the BLA tied eligibility for the Bonus to participation in the pension plan, and both parties intended for all employees to remain eligible for the Bonus when they negotiated the 2011 MOA. Accordingly, the Union argued that reformation of the BLA was the appropriate remedy. ASARCO offered no evidence to the contrary, but argued that the arbitrator lacked authority to reform the BLA because Article 5, Section I(6)(c) contained\n   the following no-add provision: \"The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement.\" After hearing six days of evidence the arbitrator concluded that neither party anticipated that the 2011 MOA modification would impact new hires' eligibility for the Bonus. Because he found that the parties were mutually mistaken as to the terms of the 2011 MOA, the arbitrator ordered that the BLA be amended to provide that new hires, though ineligible for ASARCO's pension plan, remain eligible for the Bonus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ASARCO filed a Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. ASARCO did not challenge the arbitrator's findings of fact or conclusions of law, but argued that the no-add provision deprived the arbitrator of authority to amend the BLA. The district court confirmed the arbitration award, but rejected the Union's argument that ASARCO had waived any argument regarding the limits of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. In confirming the award, the district court noted the degree of deference due to the arbitrator's decision and concluded that the arbitrator did not violate the no-add provision because the reformation corrected a defect in the BLA, which was the product of mutual mistake, to reflect the terms the parties had agreed upon. ASARCO timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to ASARCO, the arbitrator's award should be vacated on all three grounds. We will address each, but turn first to the Union's argument that ASARCO waived the right to contest the arbitrator's jurisdiction. According to the Union, it did so by conceding that the grievance was arbitrable and failing to expressly preserve the right to contest jurisdiction in a judicial proceeding. Although the district court rejected this argument, we agree with the Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Local Union 70 filed grievances on behalf of the seven employees hired by Van Waters related to pay, benefits, and seniority status. The parties agreed to arbitrate the grievances. At the outset of the arbitration Van Waters stipulated that under Local Union 70's CBA the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction over its other employees, who were represented by a different Union, Local 287, and that the arbitrator did not have the authority to issue a ruling that would affect the employees represented by Local 287, which was not a party to the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536070\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/736/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536070\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/736/\">\n    at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Van Waters objected to the arbitrator exercising jurisdiction over an entire group of employees, Local 287, who were not parties to the proceeding and were in no way represented in the arbitration. Second, after objecting to the arbitrator's jurisdiction, Van Waters did not proceed to argue throughout the arbitration hearing how and why the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction, as ASARCO did in the instant case. Instead, Van Waters stipulated to the scope of the arbitration and proceeded to argue only the merits of its case. ASARCO, on the other hand, objected not to the scope of the arbitration and not to the arbitrator's exercise of jurisdiction over any parties, but rather to his authority to reform the BLA in crafting a remedy. After objecting, ASARCO argued at length, to the arbitrator, that he lacked such authority. By doing so, ASARCO submitted the issue to the arbitrator and \"evinced a subsequent agreement for private settlement\" of that issue.\n   <em>\n    Ficek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"886062\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/338/655/#p656\">\n    338 F.2d at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

That question is not before this court. ASARCO attempts to discard this difference as one of inconsequential procedural posture, but here procedural posture makes all the difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even assuming a court would have been obligated under\n   <em>\n    West Coast Telephone\n   </em>\n   to hold that the dispute at issue was not arbitrable, ASARCO loses because it agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration. When ASARCO did so, it took the question of arbitrability out of the courts' hands. Consequently, ASARCO is now faced with a nearly insurmountable hurdle given the level of deference that this court must grant to the arbitrator's decision. Had ASARCO refused to arbitrate and instead sought relief in the district court, it is quite possible, if not probable, that the court would have followed\n   <em>\n    West Coast Telephone\n   </em>\n   . ASARCO did not. Instead, it stipulated that the dispute was arbitrable and argued to the arbitrator that he lacked authority to reform the BLA. Again, ASARCO \"may not voluntarily submit [its] claim to arbitration, await the outcome, and, [when] the decision is unfavorable, then challenge the authority of the arbitrator[ ] to act.\"\n   <em>\n    Ficek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"886062\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/338/655/#p656\">\n    338 F.2d at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The other cases cited by ASARCO are equally inapt, if not more so. Not one of them concerns a mutual mistake made by two parties who have agreed to submit their dispute to an arbitrator, or what the proper remedy would be in such a situation. For the reasons discussed above, these facts matter. Additionally, ASARCO faults the Union for not seeking reformation of the BLA in the district court, but ASARCO knew all along that the Union sought reformation and was equally capable of seeking relief in the district court by simply refusing to arbitrate the issue. It did not and now cannot present the issue to this court and hope for a better outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, ASARCO argues that the arbitrator's award should be vacated because it violates public policy. The Union argues that ASARCO waived this argument by failing to present it in the district court. ASARCO concedes this fact, but urges that an argument first raised on appeal is not waived when the issue is purely one of law and the opposing party will not be prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Assuming ASARCO has stated an \"explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy,\" its argument still fails for a very simple reason. The arbitrator did not distort the BLA; he reformed it so that it no longer distorted the agreement that the parties made during collective bargaining.

First, the majority upholds the arbitrator's award because it \"was grounded in his reading\" of the collective bargaining agreement. Maj. Op. at 630. On its face, this statement is dead wrong: the arbitrator did not even mention, let alone construe, the no-add provision in formulating his award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Oxford Health Plans LLC v.

The majority does not really dispute this point: it concedes that the arbitrator \"did not specifically cite the no-add provision when explaining the basis of his award,\" but concludes it was sufficient for the arbitrator to \"quote it directly\" in the section of the arbitration decision entitled \"Relevant Language of the BLA,\" which it deems to be an \"acknowledgment of the no-add provision.\" Maj. Op. at 630-31. But the arbitrator's knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement contained a no-add provision is immaterial if the arbitrator failed to construe it. Obviously, a \"few references\" to a key issue in dispute does not show that the arbitrator \"did anything other than impose its own policy preference.\"\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v.

Op. at 631. This sweeping assertion is inapposite here. While arbitrators may have power to reform an agreement where\n   permitted to do so by the collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   clearly lacked that power. Rather, \"the terms the parties actually agreed upon\" in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   collective bargaining agreement expressly state that the arbitrator may not add provisions to the agreement. Because \"an arbitrator's authority derives solely from the contract,\"\n   <em>\n    McDonald v. City of W.

The majority fails to explain why the arbitrator here could exercise a power directly contrary to the express restrictions on the arbitrator's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Indeed, the majority cites no case supporting its proposition that an arbitrator can reform a contract based on mutual mistake when the parties expressly prohibit the arbitrator from adding to or modifying the agreement. To the contrary, we have held that a no-add provision prohibits an arbitrator from modifying an agreement even when there is a mutual mistake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Coast Tel.

In\n   <em>\n    West Coast Telephone\n   </em>\n   , we considered a union's demand to compel arbitration of the question whether its collective bargaining agreement should be reformed to reflect the parties' intent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n    at 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded \"with positive assurance\" that the issue of reformation due to mutual mistake was not arbitrable because \"[t]he arbitration clause of the contract expressly provides that the arbitrator 'shall have no power to destroy, change, add to or delete from its terms.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n    at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, a no-add provision in a collective bargaining agreement precludes the arbitrator from rewriting the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The majority attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    West Coast Telephone\n   </em>\n   because it addressed whether a dispute over reformation was arbitrable, rather than whether the arbitrator lacked authority to reform the contract, and therefore does not definitively resolve the issue whether the arbitrator's award here drew its essence from the agreement. Maj. Op. at 631-32. But\n   <em>\n    West Coast Telephone '\n   </em>\n   s holding was based on its conclusion that a no-add provision deprives the arbitrator of the authority to modify the agreement, and this ruling is binding on us.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n    431 F.2d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We need not consider whether we would defer to an arbitrator who erroneously construed a no-add provision as allowing reformation of a contract in a particular case. This issue is not before us because-as mentioned above-the arbitrator here did not construe the no-add provision. Because under our precedent the arbitrator's modification was contrary to the no-add provision and is therefore not a \"plausible interpretation\" of the contract, and because there is no basis for deferring to the arbitrator's construction of the no-add provision in this case, his award must be vacated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Federated Empr's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1453306\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/600/1263/#p1264\">\n    600 F.2d at 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The arbitrator here dispensed his own brand of industrial justice by exceeding the scope of his delegated powers and modifying the agreement \"in the interest of justice and fairness.\" Because \"an arbitrator\n   has no authority to ignore the plain language of a collective bargaining agreement that limits the scope of his authority,\" the award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\n   <em>\n    Haw.
