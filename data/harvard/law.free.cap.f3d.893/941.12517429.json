We are tasked with deciding whether the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\") impliedly preempts McDaniel's Tennessee failure-to-warn claims premised solely on Upsher-Smith's failure to provide the Medication Guide as required by FDA regulations.

Because \"the medicine stays in your body for months after treatment is stopped,\" these adverse effects may continue even after ceasing treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rita McDaniel, Johnny's widow, sued Upsher-Smith on behalf of her late husband's estate. In general, she alleges that her husband died in July 2015 because he had been taking amiodarone. More specifically, Johnny's doctor prescribed him a course of amiodarone to treat his non-life threatening atrial fibrillation. Johnny apparently did not receive the corresponding Medication Guide when he filled his prescriptions in May and June 2015 because Upsher-Smith neglected to ensure its availability. Thus, he was unaware that only adults with life-threatening heartbeat problems who had unsuccessfully sought alternative treatments should take the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   McDaniel sued on multiple theories, but only her Tennessee strict-liability failure-to-warn, negligent failure-to-warn, and negligence-per-se claims are before us. The failure-to-warn claims are premised solely on Upsher-Smith's failure to provide a Medication Guide. Upsher-Smith moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted Upsher-Smith's motion and dismissed the failure-to-warn claims with prejudice, holding that they were impliedly preempted under the FDCA. The court explained that McDaniel failed to cite any Tennessee duty paralleling the federal duty to provide a Medication Guide. Said differently, the claims would not exist in the absence of the FDCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review de novo the district court's dismissal on federal preemption grounds.\n   <em>\n    Fulgenzi v.

Her complaint makes this eminently clear. For instance, she asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The failure to provide each patient a \"Medication Guide\" by failing to provide the Medication Guides to the distributor for ultimate distribution to the patient with the drug is a direct violation of the FDA's mandate to the manufacturers of the drug intended to warn patients directly outside the communication with the prescribing physician, of the very dangers of amiodarone toxicity that injured Johnny McDaniel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Other parts of the complaint similarly demonstrate that the existence of the Medication Guide regulation is a \"critical element\" in McDaniel's suit. Here are just a few:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 The Defendant manufacturer, Upsher-Smith, was responsible by federal regulation for ensuring that the appropriate warning labels and Medication Guides were provided to McDaniel. Had the Medication Guide been provided by Upsher-Smith to the distributor or his pharmacists for distribution to him as required by FDA regulations, McDaniel ... would not have taken amiodarone [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Because his distributors and pharmacists were not provided a Medication Guide to give directly to him outside of his doctor's office and interaction as required by FDA regulations by the Defendant manufacturer, McDaniel did not know \"the medicine stays in your body for months after treatment is stopped.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 McDaniel did not receive a Medication Guide because the Defendant Upsher-Smith did not provide the Medication Guide to the distributors for distribution to him by his pharmacists as required by the FDA and did not ensure that the Medication Guide was distributed to McDaniel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   McDaniel's opposition to Upsher-Smith's motion to dismiss further underscores that this litigation is strictly about Upsher-Smith's compliance with federal regulations that are enforceable only by the Federal Government. She insisted that her \"failure-to-warn claims [are] based on Upsher-Smith's failure to provide the FDA required Medication Guide to Johnny\" and that \"[t]he Medication Guide that Johnny did not receive was required by federal law to be provided to\" him. What's more, McDaniel explicitly disclaimed the argument that her failure-to-warn claims stem from inadequate content. She described her complaint as alleging that Upsher-Smith \"failed to actually and physically provide for the appropriate distribution of federally mandated warnings in the form of the Medication Guide.\" Then she doubled down on her reliance on the FDA's regulations: \"The allegation is not one of adequacy or 'content' failure to warn, (i.e., the verbiage or even the format fails), but an actual and physical negligent failure of Upsher-Smith to fulfill its federally mandated responsibility to ensure Medication Guides are available for distribution directly to patients with each prescription.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   McDaniel cannot salvage her appeal by hanging her hat on a generic duty to warn under Tennessee law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loreto v.

McDaniel's claims depend on whether the warnings provided were inadequate and proximately caused her late husband's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803719\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/578/#p583\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 587 ;\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

Because the fact of a federal-law violation is not a necessary element of those claims, they are not subject to obstacle preemption under\n   <em>\n    Buckman\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Fulgenzi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803719\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/578/#p583\">\n    711 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   587 &amp; n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   When faced with an apparent conflict between the words in a complaint and a brief responding to a motion to dismiss, we are obligated to choose the former. It is, after all, the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint that we are evaluating.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The majority focuses on a singular remark in McDaniel's briefing that \"[t]he allegation is not one of adequacy or 'content' failure to warn, (i.e., the verbiage or even the format fails), but an actual and physical negligent failure of Upsher-Smith to fulfill its federally mandated responsibility to ensure Medications Guides [sic] are available for distribution directly to patients with each prescription.\" R. 23, PageID 111. The majority interprets that statement to mean that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Fulgenzi\n   </em>\n   , McDaniel \"pleaded that the 'adequacy' of warnings ... is not the issue.\" Maj. Op. 947.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The complaint tells us that McDaniel pleaded precisely the opposite: \"The warnings and directions provided with amiodarone by [Upsher-Smith] failed adequately to warn of the potential risks and side effects of amiodarone.\" Compl., R. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 91, 98. And context tells us that the purported concession in the brief was meant to explain why the claim is not barred by impossibility preemption-clarifying in the same section that what she meant is that she \"does not allege that the contents of the labeling should have been changed\" in violation of the federal duty of sameness, only that a separate \"Medication Guide and its warnings were not provided to him in accordance\" with that duty. R. 23, PageID 113. Indeed, it necessarily follows that McDaniel's claims challenge the adequacy of the warnings that were provided, alleging as they do that a death would not have occurred but for the failure to provide additional warnings in the form of a medication guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Tennessee's learned intermediary doctrine does not bar McDaniel's claims. Under this doctrine, Upsher-Smith argues that its duty to warn under Tennessee law extended only to her husband's prescribing physician. And this would mean that McDaniel's claims are barred, either because (1) there is no Tennessee duty paralleling the federal duty to provide a medication guide, or (2) she fails to allege that the prescribing physician was inadequately warned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Upsher-Smith cannot dispense with its duty to warn McDaniel's late husband of amiodarone's risks. Under Tennessee law, the learned intermediary doctrine \"constitutes a defense,\" rather than a common-law rule delineating to whom a manufacturer owes the duty to warn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nye v. Bayer Cropscience, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319202\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/347/686/#p701\">\n    347 S.W.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 701 (Tenn. 2011). When the defense is invoked, \"a pharmaceutical manufacturer can discharge its duty to warn by providing the physician with adequate warnings of the drug's risks.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319202\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/347/686/#p701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This defense, however, does not eliminate Upsher-Smith's \"continuing duty to warn the users\" of its prescription drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne v. Novartis Pharm. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202985\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/526/#p530\">\n    767 F.3d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (6th Cir. 2014) (interpreting Tennessee law). Adequately warning a physician is simply one means of discharging that duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Dismissal under this defense would be premature at this juncture. A plaintiff is not required to plead around all potential defenses.\n   <em>\n    Xechem, Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9235843\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/899/#p901\">\n    372 F.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 901 (7th Cir. 2004). Only when a plaintiff \"admits all the ingredients of an impenetrable defense\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   may a complaint that otherwise states a claim be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9235843\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/899/#p901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As Upsher-Smith points out, McDaniel does not allege that her husband's physician was unaware of the risk of lung damage associated with amiodarone. But she also does not allege that his physician was aware of that risk. Discovery is the proper vehicle to explore those factual issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At this stage, it is enough that McDaniel has pleaded a plausible claim to relief that is neither precluded by the learned intermediary doctrine nor preempted by the FDCA.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
