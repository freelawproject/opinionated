Before trial, Christian sought to suppress evidence obtained via a search warrant that he argued was not supported by probable cause. He also challenged the admission at trial of a recorded telephone call between two other individuals on the grounds that it was inadmissible hearsay. The district court denied the motion to suppress and admitted the recording of the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Christian renews both challenges on appeal. For the reasons set forth below, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the judgment of the district court and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 3, 2015, a state magistrate issued a search warrant for Christian's residence located at 618 Grandville Avenue in Grand Rapids, Michigan (the Residence), based on information contained in a four-and-a-half-page affidavit prepared by Thomas Bush, a Grand Rapids police officer. But the equivalent of only one page of the affidavit is dedicated to facts specifically related to Christian. The rest concerns generic information, including Officer Bush's qualifications and the nature of drug investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The search was carried out shortly after midnight on September 4, uncovering various quantities of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, as well as two firearms and sandwich bags with cut corners. Christian was not present for the search, but was stopped and detained in his car nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before trial, Christian sought to suppress the evidence from the search of the Residence, arguing that the warrant was not based on probable cause. The district court denied the motion, and the evidence was introduced at trial. Christian was convicted on all three counts with which he was charged. He now timely appeals his conviction, contending that the district court erred when it allowed evidence from the search to be introduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Bush's affidavit sought authorization to search the Residence for controlled substances, firearms, records relating to trafficking in controlled substances, and any quantities of cash that might be proceeds from the sale of controlled substances. In support of his request, Officer Bush outlined his qualifications and experience in investigating drug crimes and noted that he and other law-enforcement officers had become \"involved in a drug investigation involving Tyrone Christian.\" He also provided six assertions of factual support relating to Christian:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 The Grand Rapids Police Department had previously executed two search warrants at Christian's residence in\n   2009 and 2011 as part of drug investigations targeting Christian. Arrests resulted from both searches (including the arrest of Christian's wife for \"maintaining a drug house\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Christian has been convicted of several drug-related crimes over a nineteen-year period: (1) possession of cocaine in 1996, (2) an unspecified second controlled-substance offense in 2002, (3) delivery/manufacture of marijuana and possession of a firearm by a felon in 2009, and (4) delivery/manufacture of cocaine in 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 In December 2014, Officer Bush \"had contact with a credible and reliable informant who provided information on several drug traffickers including Tyrone Christian.\" The affidavit states that the unnamed informant \"provided names, nicknames, phone numbers, residences utilized by the drug traffickers and information regarding specific drug transactions,\" and that Officer Bush was \"able to confirm much of the information provided.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 At the direction of Officer Bush, the informant conducted a controlled purchase of drugs from Christian at the Residence in January 2015, eight months before the warrant in question. The affidavit notes that the drugs purchased were field tested with positive results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 \"Within the last four months, [Officer Bush] has been involved in or received information from several debriefs of subjects who have stated that Tyrone Christian is a large scale drug dealer. These subjects further stated that they have purchased large quantities of heroin and crack cocaine from Christian at 618 Grandville Avenue [ ] in the last four to five months.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 On September 3, 2015-the date that the warrant was requested and issued-surveillance of the Residence was established. A subject later identified as Rueben Thomas was seen \"walk[ing] away from the area of 618 Grandville Avenue and leav[ing] the area in a vehicle.\" Surveillance of the vehicle continued until officers conducted a traffic stop for a civil infraction. During the stop, officers seized approximately 20 grams of heroin from the vehicle. Thomas admitted to being on Grandville Avenue, but denied being at the Residence, \"contrary to observations of the law enforcement officers.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to contesting the validity of the search warrant, Christian argued at trial that statements made during a recorded telephone call between Rueben Thomas and Thomas's girlfriend, Tanisha Edwards, constituted inadmissible hearsay and thus should not be admitted. The call occurred while Thomas was in jail following his arrest on September 3, 2015. Edwards informed Thomas during the call that he should be grateful to Christian because Christian had removed \"groceries\"-allegedly referring to drugs and firearms-from Thomas's home following the arrest. This call was used to tie Christian to Thomas and to contraband later found buried in the backyard of the house belonging to Christian's mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

They followed Thomas and stopped him after an unknown period of time for a driving infraction. During the stop, the officers found approximately 20 grams of heroin in Thomas's vehicle. Crucially, the affidavit does not state that the officers saw Thomas entering or leaving the Residence, even though their surveillance was targeted specifically at that property. Nor does it say that Thomas was seen with Christian. In fact, the affidavit does not assert that there is any connection at all between Thomas and Christian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   True enough, the affidavit states that, during the traffic stop, \"Rueben Thomas admitted that he had recently been at an address on Grandville Avenue in the City of Grand Rapids but denied being at 618 Grandville, contrary to observations of the law enforcement officers.\" But we decline to interpret this \"contrary to observations\" statement as an indication that officers saw Thomas actually entering or leaving the Residence itself. Officer Bush was undoubtedly aware that any evidence of Thomas being at the Residence would be highly relevant to the probable-cause determination, but chose instead to state simply that Thomas was seen \"in the area\"-a vague description that does not place Thomas at the Residence. Absent a direct statement that Thomas was seen entering or leaving the Residence, or even at the Residence in any sense, we are unwilling to read such a factual assertion into the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The dissent, on the other hand, contends that the affidavit's lack of a direct statement that Thomas was at the Residence is attributable to the \"haste of a criminal investigation,\" and that we are in effect requiring the affidavit to include \"magic words,\" contrary to precedent from the Supreme Court. Dissent Op. 872-73 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

But the affidavit's inclusion of the specific, nontechnical language \"in the area\" appears to\n   us more consistent with an honest acknowledgement that the officers did not observe Thomas on the property itself. In fact, the common-sense meaning of the language \"in the area\" suggests that Thomas was near but not at the Residence when observed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The dissent also notes that the affidavit \"need only have alleged 'facts that create a reasonable possibility' \" that \"Thomas was seen leaving 618 Grandville.\" Dissent Op. 873. This statement reflects a subtle but crucial error. The affidavit must contain facts that establish probable cause that\n   <em>\n    evidence of drug activity would be present in the Residence at the time of the search\n   </em>\n   . Stated differently, probable cause must be established in relation to whether there is evidence of drug activity in the Residence, not in relation to whether Thomas was seen leaving the Residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Such an inference is made even more tenuous by the fact that there is nothing in the affidavit to suggest that the heroin later recovered during the traffic stop was on Thomas's person, rather than simply in the car, when Thomas was observed walking in the area of the Residence by the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This leaves us to consider the significance of the following: A single individual with no known connection to Christian was seen walking away from the area of the Residence and then leaving that area in a car. He was followed by officers to a subsequent location where a traffic stop was conducted, during which heroin was found in the vehicle. If this provides any nexus at all between evidence of drug trafficking and the Residence, that nexus is so speculative and attenuated that it cannot, without more, support a finding of probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But that does not end our inquiry.

Crucially, the affiant-officer arrested the defendant for aggravated drug trafficking at the defendant's residence and, in the process, smelled marijuana and observed marijuana seeds in plain view, as well as found $1,000 in cash on the defendant after conducting a pat-down search. Later that day, the affiant-officer executed the affidavit in support of the search warrant. On review, this court held that the officer's observations alone were sufficient to support probable cause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523476\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/488/#p492\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523476\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/488/#p492\">\n    at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   But the affidavit in\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   also contained several other pieces of information that by themselves would not, according to the court, have established probable cause.

Rather, the statement appeared to be commentary about past events, intended only to inform Thomas of what had happened but not to induce his participation in the alleged conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The government now attempts to argue that, despite its own characterization of the conspiracy as one \"to remove incriminating evidence,\" the conspiracy was actually broader in scope: \"It was not simply to hide evidence. It was to keep Thomas quiet and continue the drug trafficking scheme.\" But the government did not argue for such a broad definition of the conspiracy at the trial level. Nor has it identified any evidence indicating that Edwards intended to \"keep Thomas quiet\" or linking Edwards to an agreement to engage in drug trafficking. The district court, moreover, never explicitly identified the scope or aim of the conspiracy in which Christian and Edwards were allegedly involved, implying that it agreed with the narrower scope of the conspiracy as identified by the government at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Christian also raises a question of whether the alleged conspiracy-a conspiracy to remove incriminating evidence from Thomas's home and thus to obstruct justice-is a conspiracy that qualifies a statement for admission pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(E). As the Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   [A]fter the central criminal purposes of a conspiracy have been attained, a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal may not be implied from circumstantial evidence showing merely that the conspiracy was kept a secret and that the conspirators took care to cover up their crime in order to escape detection and punishment. As was there stated, allowing such a conspiracy to conceal to be inferred or implied from mere overt acts of concealment would result in a great widening of the scope of conspiracy prosecutions, since it would extend the life of a conspiracy indefinitely. Acts of covering up, even though done in the context of a mutually understood need for secrecy, cannot themselves constitute proof that concealment of the crime after its commission was part of the initial agreement among the conspirators. For every conspiracy is by its very nature secret; a case can hardly be supposed where men concert together for crime and advertise their purpose to the world. And again, every conspiracy will inevitably be followed by actions taken to cover the conspirators' traces.

That search uncovered a large amount of heroin, some cocaine, and two loaded guns. Christian argues on appeal that the search was not supported by probable cause because each\n   piece of evidence assertedly could not have independently authorized the search. However, reading each piece of evidence in that way-alone and in the most uncharitable light possible-distorts the narrow scope of our review prescribed by\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

Such a hyper-technical, line-by-line scrutiny of each factual allegation patently violates the common-sense, totality-of-the-circumstances approach to probable cause that multiple precedents compel us to apply.

To suppress the evidence seized in reliance on the robust warrant here is to ignore that clear admonition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The search-warrant affidavit at issue here provided an ample basis for probable cause, and the question is really not even close. The affidavit first outlined Christian's extensive history with drugs, which included four felony drug convictions from 1996, 2002, 2009, and 2011, at least two of which were for drug trafficking. In 2009 and 2011, search warrants executed at Christian's home, 618 Grandville, the same place searched here, uncovered evidence of drug trafficking that each time resulted in Christian's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The affidavit next detailed the reasons why officers believed that Christian had gone back into business. In December 2014, a \"credible and reliable informant\" advised Officer Bush, the affiant, that Christian was again dealing drugs. The informant also provided information about other traffickers, including \"names, nicknames, phone numbers, residences utilized by the drug traffickers and information regarding specific drug transactions.\" Officer Bush independently corroborated \"much of the information provided\" by this informant. In January 2015, under the direction of Officer Bush, the informant executed a controlled purchase of drugs from Christian. In addition, \"[w]ithin the last four months\" from the date of the search, meaning from May to September of 2015, several other informants stated that \"Tyrone Christian is a large scale drug dealer\" and that \"they [had] purchased large quantities of heroin and crack cocaine from Christian at [his residence] in the last four to five months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   That brings us to September 3, 2015, the day of the search, when, according to the affidavit, officers established surveillance \"at 618 Grandville Avenue.\" The officers observed Reuben Thomas \"walk away from the area of 618 Grandville Avenue and leave the area in a vehicle.\" After stopping him for a traffic violation, officers found \"approximately 20 grams of heroin\" in the form of \" 'chunk[s]' that appeared to have been removed from a larger portion of heroin.\" Thomas denied having been at 618 Grandville but admitted having been at another address on that street. Crucially, the affidavit recounted that Thomas's denial was \"contrary to the observations of the law enforcement officers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Viewing the \"totality of the circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    Florida v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    568 U.S. 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), through the \"lens of common sense,\" as the Supreme Court has instructed,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the conclusion is inescapable: there was probable cause to believe that a search of 618 Grandville would uncover evidence of drug trafficking. Most readers of the affidavit would have been surprised if it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Indeed, one element of the affidavit was independently sufficient for probable cause: the surveillance of Reuben Thomas. Christian argues that there was no \"nexus\" between Thomas and 618 Grandville\n   because the affidavit states merely that officers saw Thomas \"walk away from the area of 618 Grandville Avenue,\" rather than entering or leaving that residence. But that selective, out-of-context reading is contradicted even by other parts of the affidavit, which later states that \"Reuben Thomas ... denied being at [the Residence],\n   <em>\n    contrary to the observations of the law enforcement officers\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) While this is not a direct statement that Thomas was seen entering or leaving 618 Grandville, the law does not require such a direct statement. Indeed, our precedents require us to eschew such a formal requirement. \"Affidavits are not required to use magic words.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743253\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/970/#p976\">\n    211 F.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 975 (6th Cir. 2000) (en banc). Because our job is not to reweigh the assertions in an affidavit but to ask whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for his conclusion,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275738\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/412/#p414\">\n    864 F.3d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415 (6th Cir. 2017), the latter phrase in the affidavit cannot be read out of existence. Rather, the deferential nature of our review means that we should take that latter statement-i.e., that Thomas's denying that he was at 618 Grandville was \"contrary to the observations of the law enforcement officers\"-to reconcile any doubt about where the officers saw Thomas walk away from.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Under that proper view of the affidavit, and paying the appropriate \"great deference\" to the magistrate's probable-cause determination,\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p235\">\n    462 U.S. at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p235\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the surveillance evidence provided a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. Argument to the contrary is unavailing. Any possible contradiction between \"from the area of\" and \"contrary to the observations of the officers\" is more readily attributable to the \"haste of a criminal investigation\" under which officers often draft an affidavit supporting a search warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p235\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p235\">\n    at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p235\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such haste was certainly present here: Officer Bush applied for and received the warrant on the same day as the purportedly infirm surveillance and search. To boot, police officers are mostly non-lawyers who must draft search-warrant affidavits \"on the basis of nontechnical, common-sense judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p235\">\n    at 235-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p235\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps the affiant could have been more precise. But our precedents do not require such an exacting degree of specificity. For example, in our recent published opinion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tagg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516458\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/579/\">\n    886 F.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2018), we held that probable cause existed to search the defendant's home for child pornography despite the supporting documents' failure to state that the defendant had actually clicked on or viewed an online file containing child pornography.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516458\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516458\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/579/\">\n    at 585-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, we explained that probable cause is not the same thing as proof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516458\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/579/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516458\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/579/\">\n    at 589-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the affidavit here need not have definitively stated that Thomas was seen leaving 618 Grandville. Rather, it need only have \"alleged facts that create a reasonable probability\" that he did.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516458\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/579/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   From there, the remaining inferences needed to connect 618 Grandville to Christian's drug trafficking are quite straightforward, given Christian's history of dealing drugs from that address and the officers' finding heroin on Thomas. Under a common-sense reading of the affidavit, then, its description of the 618 Grandville surveillance easily exceeds the \"degree of suspicion,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516458\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/579/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516458\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/579/\">\n    at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , needed to establish probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Moreover, the officers who saw Thomas were assigned to \"establish[ ] [surveillance] at 618 Grandville Avenue,\" not the entire area around it. Assuming those officers were doing their jobs, the fact that they saw Thomas at all probably means that he was very near 618 Grandville. At the very least, that would be far from an arbitrary\n   inference for a magistrate to draw. In addition, the heroin found on Thomas appeared to \"have been removed from a larger portion of heroin.\" These facts further supported the magistrate's determination that there was probable cause to believe that evidence of drug dealing would be found at 618 Grandville.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The affidavit hardly relies alone on the Thomas surveillance, however. There is also Christian's lengthy history of dealing drugs from 618 Grandville, the controlled purchase from 618 Grandville, and the numerous tips that Christian was dealing large quantities of drugs from 618 Grandville, all of which provide further evidence still that probable cause existed. When it comes to probable cause, \"the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts-especially when the parts are viewed in isolation.\"\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p589\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   588 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Refusing to adhere to those decisions in a case like Christian's unduly exalts the Fourth Amendment interest marginally served by deterring nonculpable conduct over the public interest in combatting crime-and amounts to effective disregard of Supreme Court precedent as well as our own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Finally, it is questionable to conclude that the district court erred by admitting the challenged telephone-call evidence. In any event, any such error was harmless, given that, as explained above, the evidence obtained in accordance with the search warrant was properly admitted. Because suppression was correctly denied, the jury properly heard, for example, evidence that officers found 70 grams of heroin\n   next to two loaded guns in Christian's basement and cocaine in another part of the house, that the DNA found on one of the guns matched Christian's, and that Christian's cell phone contained text messages about drug trafficking. Considering that evidence, the phone call added relatively little: it connected Thomas and Christian, which provided a basis for the jury to conclude that Christian had sold drugs to Thomas, and it linked Christian to a third gun. But even had that evidence not been admitted, no jury could have acquitted Christian on these charges. The evidence against him was too damning. Admitting the phone-call statements was therefore harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The judgment of the district court should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
