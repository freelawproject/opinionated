Applying the 2015 Sentencing Guidelines, the probation officer assessed a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on a determination that Sanchez-Arvizu was deported after a conviction for a \"crime of violence\"-his Texas conviction for indecency with a child by sexual contact in violation of Texas Penal Code section 21.11(a)(1). This produced an advisory Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the district court accepted the probation officer's Guidelines calculation without objection by Sanchez-Arvizu. Defense counsel stated that, under the November 2016 Guidelines, Sanchez-Arvizu's sentencing range would be 15 to 21 months. The probation officer arrived at an even lower calculation under the November 2016 Guidelines. The probation officer informed the district court that applying the new Guidelines would result in no enhancement and a sentencing range of 1 to 7 months of incarceration. The district court asked the probation officer whether this range reflected a conviction for indecency with a child, and the probation officer confirmed that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Government requested a Guidelines sentence; defense counsel asked the district court to consider a \"downward variance,\" or in the alternative, a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. The district court ultimately chose to \"stay within the advisory range.\" While noting that \"a sentence of 51 months would be entirely appropriate,\" the district court sentenced Sanchez-Arvizu at the low end of the Guidelines range because this was his first conviction for illegal reentry. The\n   district court stated that it had \"considered all of the [ 18 U.S.C. \u00a7] 3553(a) factors\" and sentenced Sanchez-Arvizu to 42 months in prison followed by a 3-year term of supervised release. Sanchez-Arvizu timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because Sanchez-Arvizu did not object to his sentence in the district court, we review for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Esquivel-Quintana v.

Thus, as the Government concedes in light of\n   <em>\n    Esquivel-Quintana\n   </em>\n   , the district court erred by deeming Sanchez-Arvizu's conviction for indecency with a child a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Guidelines, and by applying the corresponding 16-level enhancement.

The transcript of Sanchez-Arvizu's September 2016 sentencing hearing indicates that the court anchored Sanchez-Arvizu's sentence to the incorrect Guidelines range. At the hearing, the district court began its analysis by announcing the incorrect Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months. The court then heard from defense counsel and the probation officer about pending changes to the Sentencing Guidelines that were to take effect that November. Defense counsel stated incorrectly that, under the proposed amendment, Sanchez-Arvizu's Guidelines range would be reduced to 15 to 21 months. The probation officer provided a different calculation; under the amended Guidelines, Sanchez-Arvizu's sentencing range would be between 1 and 7 months. The court then asked whether the amended Guidelines range provided by the probation officer would apply even though Sanchez-Arvizu had a prior conviction for indecency with a child, and the probation officer confirmed. The court stated that this amended range would not be retroactive and that it was \"not inclined to follow\" it or \"to vary down or vary up\" from the incorrect range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on this exchange, which centered on the probation officer's estimated Guidelines range of 1 to 7 months, we cannot conclude that the district court considered and rejected the correct Guidelines range\n   of 15 to 21 months. Regardless, the court treated both estimates of the amended range offered by defense counsel and the probation officer as an optional downward departure and not as \"the framework for sentencing\" to \"anchor [its] discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molina-Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595701\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1338/#p1345\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
