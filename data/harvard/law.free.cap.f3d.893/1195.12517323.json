Two months later, he amended that complaint, without leave to do so, again asserting various violations of his constitutional rights and adding nine defendants. The district judge screened that complaint as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). After setting forth the claims, he decided they were \"not linked by a common question of law or fact, involve different defendants, and arose from different transactions.\" (R. Vol. 1 at 379.) He concluded Requena \"may not present all of the claims in a single action\" and directed him to decide which claims he wished to pursue and file a second amended complaint accordingly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The second amended complaint (hereinafter complaint) named 38 defendants and alleged myriad violations of his First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Attached to the complaint was over 450 pages of exhibits. The complaint fell far short of containing \"a short and plain statement\" of the claims showing entitlement to relief. Fed. R. Civ.

He concluded \"many of [the] claims lack support or substance, and much of the material submitted as exhibits appears to be irrelevant and disorganized.\" (R. Vol. 1 at 1150.) At the end of the day, the judge identified two claims meriting discussion-(1) denial of hygiene supplies and (2) denial of access to the courts. Both failed to state a claim for relief. He dismissed the entire complaint with prejudice,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but did not first explicitly address whether amendment of the complaint would be futile, even though Requena's complaint requested leave to amend if necessary to cure any deficiencies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judgment was entered the same day.

Nevertheless, he bears \"the burden of alleging sufficient facts on which a recognized legal claim could be based.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Bellmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540951\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/935/1106/#p1110\">\n    935 F.2d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1110 (10th Cir. 1991). In doing so, he must comply with the same rules of procedure as other litigants.\n   <em>\n    Ogden v. San Juan Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844314\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/452/#p455\">\n    32 F.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 455 (10th Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Requena (still pro se) has failed to follow the federal rules of appellate procedure. Rule 28(a)(6) requires briefs to contain \"a concise statement of the case setting out the facts relevant to the issues submitted for review ...\n   <em>\n    with appropriate references to the record\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). In his brief, he provides us with a nine-page statement of the facts with no record citations. His cavalier approach has made our review overly and unnecessarily burdensome. We will not act as his counsel, searching the record for arguments he could have, but did not, make, particularly when he has not made the slightest effort to tie his arguments to the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his brief, he raises eight arguments addressing nine different claims. However, because he failed to raise one of those claims in the complaint, we will not consider it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, although the complaint raised numerous claims, we will address only those challenged on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

Mgmt. of Colo., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638720\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1199/#p1205\">\n    108 F.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1205 (10th Cir. 1997) (\"Issues not raised in the opening brief are deemed abandoned or waived.\"). To reiterate, we will not consider arguments on appeal not tied to the allegations in the complaint and we will not consider claims in the complaint not raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the judge did not explicitly address futility of amendment, it is implicit in his treatment of the case (a series of patiently delivered orders) that he considered further amendment futile. We nevertheless consider futility, as it is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. Longshore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784406\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1311/#p1314\">\n    621 F.3d 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1314-15 (10th Cir. 2010). In doing so, however, we will not conjure facts Requena might conceivably raise in support of his claims; that would make us his advocate. Our restraint is particularly critical when he made no appropriate effort\n   in the district court to seek amendment or to indicate, there or here, how amending his complaint would cure its deficiencies (he contends, implicitly at least, that his pleadings are adequate). A proper motion to amend, accompanied by a proposed amended complaint or a detailed description of proposed amendments, provides notice to the screening judge (and the opposing parties when appropriate) of the purpose to be served by the amendment.\n   <em>\n    Calderon v. Kan. Dep't of Soc. &amp; Rehab. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663910\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/181/1180/#p1186\">\n    181 F.3d 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1186-87 (10th Cir. 1999). It should include reality-based facts in sufficient detail to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). If properly done the judge can fairly decide whether amendment would be fruitful. Anything less simply invites a \"merry-go-round\" ride. But here, the failure of a disciplined approach is ameliorated. Requena has provided us with \"everything but the kitchen sink,\" attaching what appears to be every grievance and claim he filed in the prison for over two years (October 2011 to February 2014). We have reviewed his complaint\n   <strong>\n    AND\n   </strong>\n   the materials pertinent to each claim in deciding whether amendment would be futile. Most likely, we have here merely repeated the district judge's thought processes (which he often did not explain) in evaluating Requena's claims. We do so as a matter of judicial economy, all the while recognizing that thorough explanation by the district court would obviate our need to do so. That said, avoiding a remand to the district court for a detailed explanation of what is by now patently obvious is the most efficient approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    A. Eighth Amendment-Denial of Hygiene\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 3, 2011, Requena ordered supplies, including hygiene items, from canteen. The next day, he was placed in administrative segregation. He again ordered canteen (presumably also including hygiene items) on October 10. The next day, he was transferred from administrative segregation to disciplinary segregation. That same day, he filed a Request to Staff asking that the supplies he ordered on October 3 be sent to him in disciplinary segregation. The next day, his unit team manager Schneider informed him there are limits on the items inmates can purchase and possess when in disciplinary segregation. As a result, it was likely his canteen items included proscribed items and were therefore returned and the purchase price refunded. He suggested Requena seek confirmation from canteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 19, 2011, Requena filed a grievance claiming Warden Sam Cline and his unit team managers, Schneider, Williams, and Riemann, had denied him hygiene supplies since entering disciplinary segregation and he could not reorder the supplies until the previous amounts were refunded to his account. On October 21, 2011, Riemann formally responded to the grievance stating prison policy prohibits inmates from possessing certain items while in disciplinary segregation. Although acknowledging that such inmates are entitled to hygiene items, he informed Requena that because he had ordered both prohibited and permissible items, the entire order was returned. He said the amount of the October 3 order had been refunded to his account and the purchase price of the second order should soon be refunded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Warden Sam Cline rejected Requena's subsequent appeal on November 10, 2011, finding his account had since been refunded for both canteen orders. He also concluded that based on Requena's previous stints in segregation, he should have known how personal property is handled in administrative and disciplinary segregation. Requena appealed to the Secretary of Corrections, Ray Roberts. Douglas Burris, the Secretary's designee, denied relief. Requena received hygiene supplies on November 2, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his complaint, Requena alleged Schneider, Riemann, Williams, Cline, Burris, and Roberts violated his Eighth Amendment rights by denying him hygiene supplies (soap, toothpaste, and toothbrush) for 30 days. The judge decided \"[t]he deprivations alleged, while unpleasant, do not suggest that [Requena] suffered any injury or that he was denied all access to hygiene. His access to hygiene supplies was limited due to his segregated status, but inmates in that status are issued at least small amounts of hygiene supplies.\" (R. Vol. 1 at 1152.) He concluded the allegations were \"not sufficient to state an objectively serious threat to [his] wellbeing or demonstrate deliberate indifference by prison officials, as required to state a claim under the Eighth Amendment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The judge was mistaken in part-Requena was without any hygiene items in October 2011. But the mistake is understandable considering Requena's undisciplined approach to litigation. The complaint and the materials attached thereto reveal there were two relevant periods of time in which Requena was in segregation-first in October 2011 and then again in February 2012. During both stints, he complained of a lack of hygiene supplies. However, during the February 2012 period, the materials attached to the complaint show he was provided some hygiene items upon entering segregation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the October 2011 stint, on the other hand, he alleges he was without hygiene supplies for 30 days and the materials attached to the complaint do not show otherwise. It is this 30-day period in October 2011 of which he complains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judge is correct, however, that the complaint did not allege any injury resulting from the lack of hygiene supplies in October 2011. \"A deprivation of hygiene items without any corresponding injury would not state an Eighth Amendment violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitington v. Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5200305\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/804/#p808\">\n    472 F.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808 (10th Cir. 2007) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penrod v.

Dismissal for failure to state a claim was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, as previously stated, the judge did not explicitly say an amendment of the complaint would be futile. On appeal, in the caption of the argument concerning\n   this issue, Requena contends that as the result of the denial of hygiene supplies, he \"acquired rashes on his body from not being able to wash off dirt and ... sustained scars from the rashes.\" (Appellant Br. at 13.)

Requena filed a post-judgment motion to alter or amend judgment but did not seek leave to amend the complaint in that motion or allege an actual injury resulting from the denial of hygiene items, even though the judge's dismissal order alerted him to this deficiency. Even on appeal, he has not argued he should have been allowed to amend the complaint to cure its deficiencies. Whatever prompted him to forgo a motion to amend, it was not a lack of notice.

Before donating it, however, Pettay gave Requena another opportunity to say how he wished to dispose of the television; he again refused to do so. The Committee concluded \"Requena lost his incentive level as a consequence of his own behavior, and he twice waived the right to make a decision about the disposition of his television.\" (R.

He was subsequently found guilty of impermissibly having those items in his cell. As a result of his actions, prison officials removed the drumsticks which had been in the Native American callout for decades. Believing other Native American inmates would retaliate against him for causing the drumsticks to be removed, Requena twice spoke with unit team manager Newkirk, \"express[ing] his concern that something might happen to him\" and requested to be transferred. (R. Vol. 1 at 741.) Newkirk told him a transfer \"might take a couple [of] weeks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On May 31, 2012, Requena talked to Cranston (apparently a mental\n   health provider) about his fears. The next day, June 30, he was brutally beaten with a blunt object by two members of the Native American callout during the evening mealtime. He also claimed Correctional Officer Crotts knew a fight was about to occur because inmates were \"table hopping,\" yet he prevented another officer from doing anything because he \"wanted to see a fight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 742.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a result of the June 30 incident, Requena was placed in administrative segregation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July, he sent Jon Graves, an administrative attorney, a Request to Staff seeking not to be returned to the general population and two letters \"expressing his concerns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 742.) He also sent a Request to Staff and grievance to correctional officer Dusseau seeking to be transferred to another facility. Dusseau denied the grievance, stating Requena was not the only inmate involved in altercations. On July 30, 2013, Requena was told by an unknown correctional officer that, per the order of Dusseau, if he refused to be released to the general population, he would be issued a disciplinary report for disobeying orders. He was released to the general population and placed in a cell \"right next door\" to one of the inmates who had beaten him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 743.) He spoke to Newkirk, who told him he would be moved the next day. The next day, July 31, 2012, he was again beaten by \"another\" inmate.

Newkirk and Cranston were allegedly aware of his fear of retaliation by members of the Native American callout but did nothing and he was subsequently beaten by two members of the callout. Crotts allegedly knew a fight was about to occur and prevented another officer from averting it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, he fails to state a claim against Graves or Dusseau for failure to protect as to the July 31 beating. Although he does not indicate in the complaint the nature of his fear of returning to general population, we assume it pertained to further\n   retaliation from callout members. But he does not allege that the inmate who beat him on July 31 was a member of the Native American callout or acting on behalf of such member. Thus he has not alleged and cannot allege Graves or Dusseau were aware of the risk of harm that ultimately came about. Moreover, in his brief, he only criticizes Dusseau and Graves for placing him in a cell next to one of the inmates who assaulted him. But there is no allegation that he suffered any harm from that placement-both beatings occurred in the dining hall, not his cell or its environs, and the July 31 beating occurred at the hands of a different inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Dismissal of Requena's Eighth Amendment claim for failure to protect against Newkirk, Cranston, and Crotts was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    2. Denial of Medical Care\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the complaint, Requena alleged he suffered a head injury as a result of the June 30 attack and has suffered vision and hearing loss as a result. He claimed Nurse Debra Lundry denied him medical assistance on September 27, 2012, because his medical problems were due to allergies, not a head injury. Yet, she let his allergy medication run out without any follow up or concerns. He also claimed he had to wait seven months for an eye exam and glasses and fifteen months for a hearing exam. Although he was fitted for a hearing aid by an audiologist in January 2014, and Burris, the Secretary of Corrections' designee, acknowledged this, he alleged he has not yet received it (as of April 2014, the date of the complaint). Requena also claimed that Dr. Shaver (apparently an audiologist) told Requena he had significant hearing loss but he could not determine if it was caused by the head injury, whereas the Director of Nursing, David Rogge, suggested he had only mild hearing loss. He further alleged he requested mental health treatment for the psychological problems he sustained from the brutal beatings but Wilson and Barnt have denied his requests. According to Requena, Wilson and Barnt know he wants to work on anxiety and anger stemming from the attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The judge dismissed this claim without discussion. Dismissal was appropriate and the materials attached to the complaint show amendment would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Estelle v.

The materials attached to the complaint fill in the blanks; they indicate that in denying two of Requena's grievances, Burris, the Secretary's designee, found Requena had been seen by an audiologist on January 31, 2014, and fitted for a hearing aid. Those same materials show Requena was informed on March 12, 2014, that a nurse had called Dr. Shaver's office about the hearing aid and was waiting for a callback. A week later, Rogge informed Requena that the audiologist's finding suggested only mild hearing loss at low frequencies which does not indicate the need for hearing aids.

His allegations against Lundry show, at most, a misdiagnosis; such negligence is insufficient. Nor did he allege he sought medical assistance from her and she refused it; the materials attached to the complaint do not show otherwise.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p104\">\n     429 U.S. at 106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p104\">\n     97 S.Ct. 285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[A] complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.

As for Wilson and Barnt, he did not allege any facts to suggest his mental health needs-anxiety and anger-are sufficiently serious. And the materials attached to the complaint do not show he was diagnosed with these conditions by a physician as needing treatment or that these conditions were so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Riddle v.

In the body of the argument, he refers to McGehee's filing of a report in alleged retaliation for his filing a grievance against Lamb. We have already addressed and resolved that claim. He also refers to the overturned disciplinary report filed by Wagner, claiming it was filed because Wagner was \"mad that he had to pack out [Requena]'s property when he was brutally beaten by other inmates.\" (Appellant's Br. at 21.) To the extent he is raising a retaliation claim against Wagner, he fails to state a claim because he has not alleged Wagner's filing of the disciplinary report was in retaliation for Requena's exercise of a constitutionally protected activity, but rather because Wagner was upset he had to pack out Requena's cell (which is not protected activity).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Shero\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5637570\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/1196/#p1203\">\n     510 F.3d at 1203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Heck\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     512 U.S. at 486-87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     114 S.Ct. 2364\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"We hold that, in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\" (footnote omitted) );\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Edwards v.
