Before 2008, Defendants filled the tanks with 17 pounds of propane.

In 2010, the plaintiffs and AmeriGas settled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Pre-Filled Propane Tank Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202008837\">\n    2010 WL 2008837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.

The district court explained (1) the statute of limitations accrued on August 1, 2008, the latest \"all Defendants began selling fifteen pound tanks\"; and (2) new purchases of tanks after that date did not restart the statute of limitations.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     :\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pre-Filled Propane Tank Antitrust Litig.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012791756\">\n    2015 WL 12791756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (W.D.

It dismissed as time-barred the indirect purchasers' state-law-damages claims. The district court ruled that, like direct purchases, new indirect purchases did not restart the statute of limitations. For the same reason, the district court dismissed the indirect purchasers' federal-disgorgement claim. But it allowed the federal-injunctive claim to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To address the statute of limitations, the\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs moved for leave to amend to add three new subclasses asserting damages: (1) a six-year statute-of-limitations subclass, for violations of Maine, Vermont, and Wisconsin law; (2) a new-purchaser subclass, for violations of Kansas antitrust law; and (3) a new-purchaser subclass, for violations of the laws of \"\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   repealer states.\" The new-purchaser subclasses included individuals who bought propane tanks for the first time after March 27, 2011. The\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs also proposed another federal-disgorgement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court ruled that the amendments to add the disgorgement claim and the new-purchaser subclasses would be futile because the claims are time-barred. According to the district court, first-time purchases after March 27, 2011, are irrelevant\n   because the statute of limitations accrued in August 2008, and-as it previously concluded-new purchases did not restart the clock. The district court did, however, rule that the six-year statute-of-limitations subclass raised timely claims. Filed on October 16, 2015, the\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   amended complaint retains the federal-injunctive claim, in addition to asserting the six-year statute-of-limitations subclass's state-law-damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court later dismissed the federal-injunctive claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), concluding (1) the indirect purchasers lack standing, and (2) the doctrine of laches bars the claim. Meanwhile, on July 21, 2016, another group of indirect purchasers (\"the\n   <em>\n    Orr\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs\") not named in the\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   complaint sued Defendants. The\n   <em>\n    Orr\n   </em>\n   complaint-consolidated into the same multidistrict proceeding with\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   -includes the federal-disgorgement claim and the new-purchaser subclasses that the\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs tried to add to their complaint, along with a six-year statute-of-limitations subclass damages claim and a federal-injunctive claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ferrellgas moved for summary judgment against the\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, arguing the\n   <em>\n    Propane I\n   </em>\n   release barred the claims of the six-year statute-of-limitations subclass. The release says:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [T]he Releasing Persons hereby fully, finally, and forever release, relinquish, and discharge the Released Persons from any and all liabilities, claims, rights, suits, and causes of action, of any kind whatsoever, that the Releasing Persons may have or may have had ... whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, threatened, asserted, or unasserted ... that were or could have been sought or alleged in the Litigation related to the filling, purchase, sale or exchange of Ferrellgas's 20-pound propane gas cylinders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court ruled that the release \"does not contain the clear language necessary to constitute a release of future claims. Thus, the release provision only bars assertion of claims that had accrued at the time of the release.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Pre-Filled Propane Tank Antitrust Litig.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206963058\">\n    2016 WL 6963058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (W.D. Mo. Sept. 2, 2016) (internal citation omitted). The plaintiffs argued that \"their current claims are for post\n   <em>\n    In re Propane I\n   </em>\n   purchases of propane tanks, and that those purchases could not have accrued into claims until after the purchases were made, and thus, after the release.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206963058\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district disagreed, granting Ferrellgas summary judgment, again ruling that the claims accrued only once-\"in August 2008\"-and the limitations period did not restart upon new purchases. The district court also granted summary judgment for AmeriGas on the basis of standing. Finally, the district court dismissed the\n   <em>\n    Orr\n   </em>\n   complaint based on its rulings in\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The indirect purchasers in\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Orr\n   </em>\n   appeal.

The FTC orders say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Defendants are prohibited from] [e]ntering into, attempting to enter into, adhering to, participating in, maintaining, organizing, implementing, enforcing, inviting, offering or soliciting any combination, conspiracy, agreement, or understanding between or among [Defendants] and any Competitor to raise, fix, maintain, or stabilize prices or price levels of Propane Tanks through any means, including modifying the Fill Level contained in Propane Tanks sold by [Defendants] and/or its Competitors, or coordinating Communications to customers of [Defendants] and/or their Competitors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The indirect purchasers argue: \"Even if competitors are enjoined from agreeing to fix prices and stop doing so, they may still agree to allocate markets, and due to the resulting lack of competition, have the ability to charge supra-competitive prices independent of a continuing agreement to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The indirect purchasers, however, ignore the \"through any means\" language in the FTC orders. In the amended complaint, they allege that market-share allocation is a means of fixing prices: \"AmeriGas and Blue Rhino also agreed to allocate customers and markets between themselves in furtherance of their collusion to maintain prices at supracompetitive levels.\" As the district court noted, \"Plaintiffs do not allege the existence of a market share allocation agreement divorced from any allegations of price fixing.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pre-Filled Propane\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206963059\">\n    2016 WL 6963059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Under the indirect purchasers' own theory, market-share allocation violates the FTC orders' ban on fixing prices. The first injunction ground does not exceed the scope of the FTC orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On the second ground, the indirect purchasers want Defendants to void any existing co-packing agreements, refrain from making new co-packing agreements, and refrain from sharing pricing information or information about tank fill levels. In the amended complaint, they allege that the co-packing agreements \"facilitate[ ] the exchange of pricing information between two direct competitors\" and \"present[ ] ample opportunities for conspiratorial communications.\" But the FTC orders cover those issues by prohibiting Defendants from exchanging \"Competitively Sensitive Non-Public Information.\" That includes \"pricing, pricing strategies, Fill Level strategies, costs, revenues, margins, output, business and strategic plans, marketing, customer information and Communications with customers, advertising, promotion or research and development.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The indirect purchasers counter, asserting that both the first and second injunction grounds are necessary because \"there exists some cognizable danger of recurrent violation.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
