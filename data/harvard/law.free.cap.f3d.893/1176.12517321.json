In other words, whether such lists are more like a telephone book, that the Supreme Court has held lacks any creative spark, or more like Joyce's Ulysses that changed the course of 20th century literature. The answer, it turns out, lies somewhere in between, but closer to a telephone book. The name and address pairings are only entitled to limited protection under the copyright laws. If proper safeguards are maintained, the lists may also be protected as trade secrets. We hold in this case that the Plaintiff, Experian Information Solutions, Inc., (\"Experian\"), established that its lists were copyrightable but failed to establish that its copyright had been infringed. We therefore affirm the District Court's summary judgment in favor of the Defendant, Nationwide Marketing Services, Inc., (\"Natimark\"), on the copyright infringement claim, but reverse the state law trade secret claim and remand it for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Experian is in the business of compiling databases and licensing portions of them to companies for use in their marketing campaigns. Since 1998, it has compiled what is now known as the ConsumerView Database (\"CVD\") that has a copyright\n   registration for the \"selection, coordination, arrangement and compilation of data ....\" The CVD contains more than 250 million records, each pertaining to an individual consumer, and includes hundreds of \"fields,\" each denoting a particular attribute of the consumer, such as age, earnings, or purchase habits, as well as behavior predictions. This litigation concerns compiled pairings of names and addresses. These represent one of the most lucrative components of the CVD, because mail marketers pay substantial amounts for licenses to utilize Experian's name and address pairings. The value, according to Experian, results from the process by which Experian determines the accuracy of its pairings and the utility of the selection of the pairings it includes in the CVD for its marketing clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Experian obtains its name and address data from a variety of sources, such as catalogue purchase data, cable company records, real estate deeds, and warranty cards signed by consumers at retail stores. For its database, Experian picks from roughly 2,200 public and proprietary sources that it believes have reliable, value-adding data. In determining whether to include a new source in its database, Experian runs the source through tests to measure the potential new data's quality and to identify the differences between the new source's data and existing data in the CVD. Experian's employees review the test results and do not add any data to the CVD until they approve the source. Even if a source is validated, however, not all name and address data are added to the CVD. Experian excludes name and address pairings it believes are not valuable to its clients. Excluded are business addresses and addresses of individuals in prison and the very elderly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Experian also resolves conflicts between data sources. Such conflicts are resolved utilizing thousands of \"business rules\" or algorithms to analyze data from each source and determine which name and address pairing should be included in the CVD. The data must be kept current, and the business rules are regularly updated on the basis of client feedback. Experian estimates that it expends more than $10 million annually to compile and update the CVD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Experian is not alone in the database compiling industry. There are at least four other major compilers. Their respective methodologies also yield lists, but according to Experian, the lists have material differences in content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Natimark is a smaller and more recent addition to the consumer database compilation industry. It is located in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2011 it acquired a database, the National Consumer List (\"NCL\") in order to resell the data. The NCL has data for approximately 200 million consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The seeds of this litigation were sown in April 2012 when a data broker acting on behalf of Natimark attempted to sell Experian a data compilation of children's birthdays, coupled with the name and address pairings of their parents. When Experian tested the name and address pairings in the sample the data broker provided, and compared them with Experian's own CVD pairings, Experian found a match rate of more than 97%, leading it to suspect that the data had been stolen. Experian's expert later compared Natimark's pairings with Experian's and found similar match rates of approximately 94%. Also suggesting stolen data was the price Natimark paid for the data which, according to Experian, was unusually low and unaccompanied by a customary written agreement with industry-standard restrictions on maintenance and use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After confronting Natimark with its conclusion that the data had been copied, Experian filed this action in March 2013 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona claiming copyright infringement. When the District Court ruled that the allegedly-infringed pairings were not copyrightable, Experian added a claim for trade secret misappropriation, and argued that the pairings were trade secrets that had been stolen. The District Court granted summary judgment for Natimark, holding that Experian did not have a valid copyright or trade secret in its compilation of names and addresses. The court held that the compilation of pairings lacked sufficient creativity or originality to merit copyright protection. It similarly held that the pairings of names and addresses could not constitute trade secrets and, even if they could, Experian had not established a triable issue with respect to its claim that Natimark knew or had reason to know that the pairings were either secret or stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Experian filed a timely appeal with respect to both the copyright and trade secret claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    I.

Creativity was lacking because industry conventions, such as those in the legal profession, made the choices obvious.

Second, the creativity that suffices to establish copyright protection in factual compilations is minimal.\n   <em>\n    Feist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318883\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/340/#p344\">\n    499 U.S. at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318883\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/340/#p344\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Key Publ'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522928\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/945/509/#p511\">\n    945 F.2d at 512-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Experian's selection process in culling data from multiple sources and selecting the appropriate pairing of addresses with names before entering them in the database involves a process of at least minimal creativity. The listings are compiled by first collecting and comparing multiple sources, and then sorting conflicting information through the creation of business rules that Experian created to select from among the conflicts. As the Fifth Circuit said in\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   , selection is sufficiently creative when the compiler makes \"choices ... independently ... to select information from numerous and sometimes conflicting sources.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516551\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/135/#p141\">\n    967 F.2d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Experian also argues that the District Court erred in focusing solely on Natimark's knowledge with respect to its acquisition of a trade secret, as opposed to use, in granting Natimark summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The evidence of Natimark's knowledge in this case is sufficient to survive summary judgment. Experian has established triable issues of fact as to whether Natimark knew or had reason to know that it acquired and used a trade secret that was obtained through improper means.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"216998\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/197/144/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    JustMed, Inc. v. Byce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223954\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1118/#p1129\">\n    600 F.3d 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1129-30 (9th Cir. 2010), we considered a similar provision of Idaho law, and recognized that improper acquisition and improper use of protected works are independent bases for trade secret liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, evidence of the low price that Natimark paid for the data goes to whether Natimark had constructive knowledge that the data it obtained were acquired through improper means. According to Experian, Natimark paid less than 1% of the market rate for a one-time license to obtain actual ownership of data, and this would indicate knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Syntex Ophthalmics, Inc. v. Novicky\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Cow.%206257\">\n    80 C 6257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1982%20WL%2063797\">\n    1982 WL 63797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, *11 (N.D. Ill. May 6, 1982) (holding $20,000 payment for technology that cost $1 million to develop demonstrated constructive knowledge for trade secret claim). Natimark's obtaining ownership of data through an invoice, which Experian argues is unusual in the industry, as opposed to obtaining limited use rights in the data through a written agreement, is further evidence of constructive knowledge. Experian also submitted evidence of Natimark's President's prior experience that should have put him on notice of an improper acquisition. Experian therefore submitted sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on the issue of whether Natimark knew or had reason to know that it acquired and used a trade secret that was obtained through improper means.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 44-401(2). The District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Natimark on the trade secret claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The District Court correctly granted Natimark summary judgment on Experian's copyright claim. Experian's name and address pairings are factual compilations entitled to only thin copyright protection. Experian failed to establish infringement. The District Court erred in granting Natimark summary judgment on the trade secret\n   claim, because there are triable issues of fact as to Natimark's knowledge of misappropriation. We reverse and remand for further proceedings on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part and REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
