The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Lemus Martinez's administrative appeal. The Board reasoned that the Missouri statute under which Lemus Martinez was convicted was overbroad but divisible. Based on the record of conviction, the Board concluded that Lemus Martinez was convicted of both a controlled substance offense and an aggravated felony. Lemus Martinez disputes that conclusion, and we review the Board's legal determination\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the time of Lemus Martinez's offense,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20195.211.1\">\n    Mo.

Not all of the controlled substances listed in the Missouri drug schedules, however, appear in the federal schedules. Missouri forbids the possession with intent to deliver salvia divinorum,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20195.211.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 195.017.2(4)(jj), and ephedrine,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20195.211.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 195.017.8(6); the federal statute does not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6), 812. The two removable offenses at issue here incorporate the federal drug statute. The controlled substance offense is a violation of state law relating to a controlled substance \"as defined in Section 802 of Title 21.\" Similarly, the aggravated felony is illicit trafficking in a controlled substance \"as defined in Section 802 of Title 21.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because \u00a7 195.211 encompasses drugs that are not included in a federal schedule, the state offense sweeps more broadly than the two removable offenses. The Board concluded, however, that the state offense is divisible, because the identity of the controlled substance is an element of the crime. Lemus Martinez was convicted of possession with intent to deliver methamphetamine, a drug that is listed on the federal schedules, so the Board determined that he was convicted of a removable offense. Lemus Martinez counters that the state offense-including trafficking in salvia and ephedrine-is indivisible, because the different controlled substances represent different ways or means of committing a single offense. On that view, the Missouri crime is broader than the removable offenses defined by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To resolve this dispute over means versus elements, we look first to state law. After considering the statutory text, the approved jury instructions, and state court decisions, we conclude that the Missouri court decisions provide the best answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two decisions of the Missouri Court of Appeals satisfy us that the identity of a controlled substance is an element of the offense.

Salmons urged that \"all of the elements of the felony of possession of pseudoephedrine are contained in the felony of the manufacture of methamphetamine,\" but the court ruled that knowledge of the specific controlled substance was an element of each charge, so the separate prosecution for possessing pseudoephedrine did not violate double jeopardy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11523225\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/16/635/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11523225\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/16/635/\">\n    at 637-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court explained that \u00a7 195.211.1 forbids the possession or distribution of \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   controlled substance,\" and the use of the singular shows that the statute authorizes separate prosecutions for trafficking each of the various controlled substances listed in the schedules.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9032068\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/4/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9032068\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/4/\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lemus Martinez responds by citing two Missouri decisions holding that when a defendant is charged with trafficking or possessing cocaine, the State need not prove which type of cocaine-crack or powder-was involved.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The approved instruction for \u00a7 195.211 states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (As to Count _____, if) (If) you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   First, that (on) (on or about) [\n   <em>\n    date\n   </em>\n   ], in the (City) (County) of ____________________, State of Missouri, the defendant possessed ( [\n   <em>\n    name of controlled substance\n   </em>\n   ] ) (more than 5 grams of marijuana), a controlled substance, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, that defendant (knew) (or) (was aware) of its presence and nature, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Third, that defendant intended to (distribute) (deliver) (sell) the ( [\n   <em>\n    name of controlled substance\n   </em>\n   ] ) (marijuana) to ( [\n   <em>\n    name of persons, if known\n   </em>\n   ] ) (another person) (other persons),\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   then you will find the defendant guilty (under Count _____) of possession of ( [\n   <em>\n    name of controlled substance\n   </em>\n   ] ) (more than 5 grams of marijuana) with intent to (distribute) (deliver) (sell).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   MAI-CR 3d 325.08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lemus Martinez asserts that the placement of \"name of controlled substance\" in brackets within parentheses shows that the type of drug is a means not an element. The guidance for use of the instructions, however, does not support his contention. \"[P]arentheses enclose words or phrases that will be either omitted or included, depending upon the facts of the case being submitted.\" MAI-CR 3d,\n   <em>\n    How to Use this Book\n   </em>\n   . \"Brackets contain directions concerning the use or completion of the instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015448\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/850/876/#p902\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Whether means or element, the identity of a controlled substance will be inserted to complete the instructions when the charge involves a substance other than marijuana. But we must look elsewhere to understand whether the name of the controlled substance describes an element of the offense. In this\n   case, Missouri court decisions show that it is an element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because the identity of the controlled substance is an element of the offense under \u00a7 195.211, the statute is divisible based on the drug involved. The Board properly applied the modified categorical approach to determine whether Lemus Martinez was convicted of violating a state law relating to a controlled substance listed in the federal drug schedules or an aggravated felony. Lemus Martinez's record of conviction establishes that he pleaded guilty to a count charging that he, \"with the intent to distribute, deliver and sell, possessed\n   <em>\n    methamphetamine\n   </em>\n   , a controlled substance, knowing its presence and nature.\" Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , methamphetamine is a Schedule III controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sch. III(a)(3). The Board therefore properly concluded that Lemus Martinez was removable for committing a controlled substance offense and an aggravated felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The petition for review is denied.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
