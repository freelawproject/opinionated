The Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac,\" collectively, with Fannie Mae, \"the Enterprises\") suffered a severe drop in the value of their mortgage portfolios, which previously comprised nearly half of the United States mortgage market and totaled approximately $5 trillion. In response, the United States government deployed numerous measures to keep the Enterprises afloat and combat further systemic breakdown in the financial and housing markets. Among those was Congress' passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (\"HERA\"), Pub. L. No. 110-289,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%202654\">\n    122 Stat. 2654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204511\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ). HERA established an independent agency known as the Federal Housing Finance Agency (\"FHFA\" or \"the Agency\") to be the regulator of the Enterprises and the twelve Federal Home Loan Banks. Exercising a power provided by that statute, on September 6, 2008, FHFA's Director placed the Enterprises under the Agency's conservatorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case concerns several provisions of HERA, and poses the following questions: can FHFA, as conservator, \"succeed to\" ownership of the mortgages that were securitized by the Enterprises pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), when those mortgages are also \"held in trust\"?

(\"SFR\") owns several pieces of real property in Nevada. Five of them (\"the Properties\") are at issue in this case. The Properties were sold to SFR by Nevada homeowners' associations (\"HOAs\") following foreclosures on liens for unpaid association dues. Plaintiffs FHFA and the Enterprises sued SFR in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking a declaration that \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(3) preempts any Nevada law that would permit a foreclosure on a superiority lien to extinguish a property interest of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while they are under FHFA's conservatorship,\" that \"the HOA Sale did not extinguish the Enterprises' interest in the Properties and thus did not convey the Properties free and clear to any Defendants,\" and that \"title to the Properties is quieted in either Fannie Mae's or Freddie Mac's favor insofar as the Defendants' interest, if any, is subject to the interest of the Enterprises or, if applicable, the interest of the Enterprises' successors.\" The district court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, and denied SFR's Motion to Dismiss.

Meanwhile, interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages rose.

In the case before us, the original owners of the Properties became delinquent on their homeowners' associations' dues. The HOAs thus imposed liens on their respective Properties for the outstanding balance of HOA dues, and ultimately foreclosed upon the liens on the Properties.

In lieu of filing an answer to FHFA's complaint, SFR moved to dismiss on October\n   23, 2015. On May 2, 2016, the district court denied SFR's motion to dismiss, and granted FHFA's motion for summary judgment.

Accordingly, the HOA foreclosure sales on the Properties did not extinguish Fannie Mae's or Freddie Mac's interests in the Properties and thus did not convey the Properties free and clear of their deeds of trusts to SFR. Moreover, title to the Properties is quieted in either Fannie Mae's or Freddie Mac's favor insofar as SFR's interest, if any, is subject to the interest of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or, if applicable, the interest of Fannie Mae's or Freddie Mac's successors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Judgment was entered May 4, 2016.

SFR argues that FHFA did not \"succeed to\" the mortgages at issue in this case because they were instead \"held in trust\" by FHFA pursuant to \u00a7 4617(b)(19)(B). SFR contends that the \"General Exceptions\" found under \u00a7 4617(b)(19) apply directly to the \"General Powers\" found under \u00a7 4617(b)(2), because both are labeled \"General\" and are structurally linked. SFR further argues that FHFA cannot \"succeed to\" \"Mortgages held in trust,\" because Congress omitted the phrase \"shall succeed to\" from 4617(b)(19)(B), the provision covering \"Mortgages held in trust,\" and instead used the phrase \"shall be held by.\" Much\n   of SFR's remaining argument restates this statutory construction and emphasizes the dominance of the verb \"held\" in \u00a7 4617(b)(19)(B)(i)-(iii), while emphasizing the absence of the phraseology \"succeed to.\" In sum, SFR argues that FHFA did not, and could not, \"succeed to\" the mortgages at issue here, and thus the Federal Foreclosure Bar, \u00a7 4617(j)(3), neither applies nor preempts the Nevada Foreclosure Statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We conclude that SFR's textual arguments lack merit. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , FHFA's right of succession appears under \u00a7 4617(b)(2), \"General Powers,\" in \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)(i) : \"The Agency shall, as conservator or receiver, and by operation of law, immediately succeed to all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the regulated entity, and of any stockholder, officer, or director of such regulated entity with respect to the regulated entity and the assets of the regulated entity[.]\" Section 4617(b)(19) contains \"General Exceptions,\" and \u00a7 4617(b)(19)(B) covers \"Mortgages held in trust.\" Section 4617(b)(19)(B)(i) specifies that \"[a]ny mortgage ... held in trust ... by a regulated entity for the benefit of any person other than the regulated entity shall not be available to satisfy the claims of creditors generally.\" Subsection (ii) explains that mortgages held in trust \"shall be held by the conservator ... for the beneficial owners of such mortgage ... in accordance with the terms of the agreement creating such trust.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(19)(B)(ii). The following subsection (iii) directs FHFA to \"estimate[ ]\" any \"contingent or unliquidated claim relating to the mortgages held in trust\" according to \"regulations of the [FHFA] Director.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4617(b)(19)(B)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The plain text of these provisions does not state or imply that FHFA may either \"succeed to\" mortgages or \"h[o]ld [them] in trust,\" rather than perform\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   of these actions in regard to a securitized mortgage loan. Section 4617(b)(19)(B) nowhere disallows FHFA from \"succeed[ing] to\" mortgages held it trust. Subsection (i) merely contains the general ban on liquidation of securitized mortgages \"held in trust\" to satisfy the claims of general creditors. Meanwhile, subsection (ii) clarifies that FHFA shall continue to hold and manage those securitized mortgages for their various beneficial owners pursuant to the contractual arrangement underlying the relevant securitization pool, originally established with one of the Enterprises. This provision offers assurances to purchasers of mortgage-backed security certificates, who pay a lump sum in exchange for a certificate representing the right to a future stream of income from the mortgage loans' principal and income payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nomura Holding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263623\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/85/#p105\">\n    873 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsection (iii) additionally permits FHFA to promulgate reasonable regulations to cabin the damages available on claims relating to the securitized mortgages held in trust. Thus, it is patent that \u00a7 4617(b)(19)(B) confers\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   protections upon the Enterprises' securitized mortgage loans, which FHFA succeeds to\n   pursuant to \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(19)(B)(i)-(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Since the statutory protection from creditors effected by \u00a7 4617(b)(19)(B) does not prevent FHFA from \"succeed[ing] to\" the Enterprises' securitized mortgage loans upon inception of conservatorship, that protection complements the bar on nonconsensual foreclosure and sale of FHFA property imposed by the Federal Foreclosure Bar, \u00a7 4617(j)(3). SFR's reading necessitates that the conservator of the Enterprises would not succeed to securitized mortgage loans that are integral to the Enterprises' Congressionally-chartered function. Indeed, though asserting that Congress' structural decisions in drafting HERA evince intent to exempt mortgages held in trust from succession, SFR fails to articulate\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   Congress would make such a decision. By contrast, justifications for FHFA's reading are readily apparent. Mortgage-backed securities are financial instruments central to the Enterprises' collective function as secondary mortgage market-maker. FHFA, as conservator, would normally be able to liquidate any asset belonging to the Enterprises in order to fulfill the claims of general creditors. However, when the Enterprises were placed into conservatorship at the height of the subprime mortgage crisis, their mortgage portfolios constituted nearly half of the United States mortgage market and were freefalling in value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275833\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/591/#p599\">\n    864 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   599 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276123\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/160/#p163\">\n    861 F.3d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Congress provided that the mortgage loans backing mortgage-backed securities would receive additional safeguards in order to combat further systemic breakdown in the American housing market. Thus, \u00a7 4617(b)(19)(B) prevents FHFA from liquidating those securitized mortgage loans in order to fulfill the claims of general creditors, protects certificate holders, and grants FHFA some control over related damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, HERA's plain text permits FHFA to \"succeed to\" securitized mortgage loans, which are held in trust, pursuant to \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)(i), and we see no reason to inject a rule to the contrary into the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

First, SFR argues that the Federal Foreclosure Bar is unconstitutional because it lacks a process to request consent or an opportunity to contest FHFA's decision not to consent to a foreclosure sale.

The Enterprises introduced evidence in the district court showing one of them acquired each of the loans securing the Properties prior to each of the HOA foreclosure sales. The district\n   court based its finding that an Enterprise had an interest in each Property on the fact that, in each case, a servicer acquired a beneficial interest in the respective Property's deed of trust, and serviced the respective mortgage loan on behalf of one of the Enterprises. Each acquisition of a Property's deed of trust by a servicer occurred on a date prior to the respective HOA foreclosure sale. The district court thus found that FHFA, which succeeded to the Enterprises' assets per HERA, held an interest in the Properties prior to the sales. Accordingly, the named beneficiary under the recorded deed of trust in each case is someone other than the note owner, one of the Enterprises.

Accordingly, the HOA foreclosure sales on the Properties did not extinguish the Enterprises' interests in the Properties and thus did not convey the Properties free and clear of their deeds of trust to SFR.
