The district court found neither of Reinhart's prior convictions constituted prior convictions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2015, the government charged Reinhart with two counts of possession of child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). The charges were based on images of child pornography discovered during an undercover online investigation\n   and execution of a search warrant on Reinhart's residence. Reinhart pleaded guilty to both counts without a plea agreement. At sentencing, the parties disputed whether Reinhart's prior California convictions constituted prior convictions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) and whether Reinhart should be sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 2252(b)(2)'s ten-year mandatory minimum. Prior to sentencing, both the government and Reinhart submitted sentencing memoranda arguing their respective positions on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Previously, in 2002, Reinhart was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of violating California Penal Code \u00a7 311.11(a), possession of child pornography, and one misdemeanor count of violating California Penal Code \u00a7 311.3(a), sexual exploitation of child. The convictions arose from police officers' search of Reinhart's apartment where the officers found printed images of children that qualified as child pornography under California law. At sentencing in the present case, the district court considered whether these prior California convictions triggered the federal sentencing enhancement, \u00a7 2252(b)(2), which would require the court to impose a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. Section 2252(b)(2) is a recidivist penalty and sentencing enhancement for those, such as Reinhart, convicted federally of possession of child pornography under \u00a7 2252(a)(4), and who have certain prior offenses. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   if such person [convicted under \u00a7 2252(a)(4) ] has a prior conviction under ... the laws of any State\n   <em>\n    relating to\n   </em>\n   aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward, or the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography, such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 20 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00a7 2252(b)(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At sentencing before the district court, the government argued that the words \"relating to\" in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) should be read broadly to encompass state statutes even if the state statutes of conviction do not categorically match the definition of federal child pornography offenses. Reinhart contended that the usual categorical approach should apply, and under that analysis, Reinhart's prior California convictions were not a categorical match and were overbroad as compared to the federal definition of child pornography offenses in \u00a7 2252(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court agreed with Reinhart and concluded that Reinhart's prior California convictions were not predicate offenses constituting convictions \"relating to ... child pornography\" under \u00a7 2252(b)(2). The district court relied on the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mellouli v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589908\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1980/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589908\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1980/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), and found that because \"child pornography\" was a federally-defined term, the district court had to apply a narrower reading of \"relating to\" in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) under the categorical approach. Applying the categorical approach, the district court compared the elements of Reinhart's California statutes of conviction, \u00a7 311.11(a), possession of child pornography, and \u00a7 311.3(a), sexual exploitation of child, to the federal definition of \"child pornography.\" This required the district court to look at the federal definition of \"sexually explicit conduct,\" a defined term within the definition of \"child pornography\" at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on this district court's\n   prior case law, the court held that California Penal Code \u00a7 311.11(a) was categorically broader than any offense described in the federal counterparts\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2251A, or 2252.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavez-Solis v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346874\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1004/\">\n    803 F.3d 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2015). The district court also found that \u00a7 311.11(a) was indivisible. The district court found California Penal Code \u00a7 311.3(a), sexual exploitation of a child, was overbroad because it included broader conduct than under the federal statutes, and that it was also indivisible. Because neither of Reinhart's prior California convictions was a categorical match to the federal definition of child pornography, the offenses did not constitute predicate offenses under \u00a7 2252(b)(2), and the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Without the mandatory minimum, Reinhart's sentencing guideline range was 78 to 97 months imprisonment. The district court sentenced Reinhart to 78 months imprisonment with a ten-year supervised release term to follow. The government appeals the district court's determination that \u00a7 2252(b)(2)'s sentencing enhancement did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, we must determine whether the words \"relating to\" in the ten-year mandatory minimum statutory sentencing provision at \u00a7 2252(b)(2) require us to break from our usual, elements-based categorical approach for determining when state statutes of conviction trigger a federal sentencing enhancement and instead, apply a broader comparison between the state statutes and the federal statutes. Here, we consider whether Reinhart's prior California statutes of conviction fall under the federal definition of \"child pornography\" offenses as used in \u00a7 2252(b)(2). We review de novo whether prior convictions support statutory mandatory-minimum enhancements.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, we inquire whether the statute, though overbroad, is nevertheless divisible.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

With those additional facts, the court may then be able to determine whether the particular state offense falls under the relevant federal statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, the portion of the federal sentencing statute at issue applies when an individual has a prior state conviction \"relating to ... the ... possession ... of child pornography.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

Despite this, as\n   <em>\n    Mellouli\n   </em>\n   cautioned and as the\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   dissent reiterated, \"[the 'relating to' language's] interpretation must somehow be anchored to prevent it from drifting aimlessly.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   . at 1327 (Hartz, J., dissenting). Here, that anchor is the federal definition of child pornography defined in the same chapter as \u00a7 2252(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The government argues that applying the usual categorical approach will have the effect of making \u00a7 2252(b)(2) inapplicable in numerous states that define child pornography more broadly than the federal definition. Indeed, this may be true. Because of the way Congress has drafted the federal definition of child pornography, in some cases the federal definition is more restrictive than state definitions.
