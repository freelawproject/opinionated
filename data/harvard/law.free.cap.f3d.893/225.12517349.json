In 1995, environmental groups brought suit seeking to compel EPA action because West Virginia had not submitted TMDLs for any of its impaired waters. That litigation resulted in a consent decree, pursuant to which EPA developed TMDLs for West\n   Virginia from 1997 to 2003. During this same period, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (\"the State Agency\") began building a TMDL program and, in 2004, it started developing TMDLs on its own. By 2009, either the State Agency or EPA had developed all of the TMDLs required under the 1995 consent decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The present litigation, which does not implicate the requirements of the 1995 consent decree, stems from a change in West Virginia's methodology for assessing biological impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under state law, West Virginia defines \"biological impairment\" based on narrative water quality criteria; one of these criteria prohibits \"[m]aterials in concentrations which are harmful ... to man, animal, or aquatic life.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20R.%20%C2%A7%2047-2-3.2\">\n    W. Va. Code R. \u00a7 47-2-3.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .e. From 2002 until 2010, West Virginia used the West Virginia Stream Condition Index (\"the Index\") methodology to identify biologically impaired waters. For some of its 573 biologically impaired waters, West Virginia identified \"ionic toxicity\" as a cause of the impairment; for others, it did not identify a cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2012, the West Virginia Legislature enacted SB 562, which directs the State Agency to develop a new tool (to replace the Index) to assess the health of biological communities in the State's waters.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-11\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 22-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -7b(f). The agency interpreted SB 562 to preclude the use of the existing Index for measuring biological impairment. Therefore, the agency decided to \"postpone\" the development of TMDLs for all of its biologically impaired waters until it developed a new methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2014, West Virginia responded to objections from Plaintiffs and EPA by projecting specific dates for developing ionic toxicity TMDLs; these dates ranged from 2020 to 2025. But the State Agency has neither promulgated a new methodology to determine biological impairment nor has it developed any biological impairment TMDLs for these 573 waters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2015, Plaintiffs filed this citizen suit, alleging that EPA had a nondiscretionary duty to promulgate TMDLs for these biologically impaired waters given that West Virginia had not done so and would not do so until 2020 at the earliest. In February 2017, the district court granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on their claim under the Clean Water Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that order, the district court applied the doctrine of \"constructive submission,\" concluding that, since West Virginia had not submitted any TMDLs for the challenged waters, EPA had not performed its nondiscretionary duty to approve or disapprove West Virginia's \"constructive submission\" of no TMDLs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After failing to obtain a stay pending appeal, EPA issued a decision in which it conditionally approved West Virginia's \"constructive submission\" of \"no\" biological impairment TMDLs. EPA conditioned its approval on West Virginia's adherence to a Memorandum of Agreement, in which West Virginia agreed to complete all of the TMDLs at issue here by June 30, 2026. EPA, however, reserved its right to withdraw its decision or revise the Memorandum of Agreement if it prevails in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, as in the district court, EPA challenges Plaintiffs' standing and the district court's application of the \"constructive submission\" doctrine in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review standing determinations\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v.

These waters are located throughout the State and span 23 of the 26 watersheds affected by this suit. On appeal, EPA argues that Plaintiffs have standing only with respect to this subset of impaired waters.

There, it was \"undisputed\" that in the ten years since the identification of the challenged waters, \"the State ha[d] not submitted a single TMDL to the EPA\" and had \"failed to complete even the first stage of the TMDL process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1425.

West Virginia has done both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, the State has established some TMDLs that address biological impairments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs concede that West Virginia has developed pollutant-specific TMDLs that may mitigate biological impairment, but argue that these steps do not directly address ionic toxicity or the State's narrative biological impairment criteria. While this may be true, West Virginia's actions cannot be construed as a clear abdication of its responsibilities with respect to the biologically impaired waters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, the Memorandum of Agreement between EPA and West Virginia demonstrates that West Virginia has a plan to develop and implement biological impairment TMDLs, including for ionic toxicity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   West Virginia has similarly acknowledged its obligations under the Clean Water Act and has repeatedly stated that it \"agrees\" it must develop TMDLs \"for all 303(d) listed impairments,\" including biological impairments. Although the State Agency is not scheduled to complete all of the TMDLs at issue here until June 30, 2026, West Virginia has committed to \"develop TMDLs as soon as practicable.\" We recognize that EPA has reserved the right to withdraw from this Agreement pending the results of this litigation. But we credit EPA's assurances that it will make good-faith efforts to continue to implement the Agreement as written to ensure that West Virginia meets the target completion dates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Clean Water Act itself requires only that each state submit its TMDLs \"from time to time\" and \"in accordance with [its] priority ranking.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(c), (d)(2). It may well be, as the district court concluded, that West Virginia has used SB 562 to delay the development of TMDLs for biologically impaired waters. But, thus far, these postponements have not\n   <em>\n    yet\n   </em>\n   amounted to a constructive submission of no TMDLs as recognized by other courts. Continued intransigence could change that. As of now, however, we cannot conclude that West Virginia has \"clearly and unambiguously\" refused to submit TMDLs in violation of the Clean Water Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485931\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/1017/#p1024\">\n    264 F.3d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because West Virginia has demonstrated that it is making-and will continue to make-good-faith efforts to comply with SB 562,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   because West Virginia has a credible plan in concert with EPA to produce ionic toxicity TMDLs, we hold that if the constructive submission doctrine were to apply, a decision we do not reach, it would not be satisfied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The district court's order granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs is therefore\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    REVERSED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Plaintiffs also brought suit pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, claiming that EPA's approval of TMDLs for six watersheds was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or contrary to law because the TMDLs for each watershed did not include TMDLs for waters impaired by ionic toxicity.

But this EPA guidance recognizes that shorter or \"slightly longer\" times may be needed depending on specific factors and circumstances. Given that the waters at issue in this litigation were listed as biologically impaired from 2002 through 2008, West Virginia's timeline is not completely out of line with this EPA guidance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
