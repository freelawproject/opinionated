Bobby was the sole owner of corporations that operated the homes (the Operating Corporations). They were S corporations under section 1362(a). Brenda owned interests in companies that bought and leased the homes to the Operating Corporations (the Nursing Home LLCs). The Nursing Home LLCs were partnerships under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20301.7701-3\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7701-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). All the entities had net operating losses, which the Hargises deducted on their joint tax returns for the years 2009 and 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Commissioner issued the Hargises a notice of deficiency for 2009 and 2010. The Commissioner disallowed deduction of most of the nursing home losses, due to the Hargises' insufficient basis in their companies. As a result, the Hargises owed $281,766 more for 2009 and 2010, combined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Hargises claim that each had greater basis in their companies. The Tax Court ruled for the Commissioner. This court reviews \"the tax court's fact findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bean v.

The Operating Corporations, with no real assets or working capital, borrowed to finance operations when revenues were insufficient. They borrowed from commercial lenders, the Nursing Home LLCs, and each other. All the money was paid directly to the Operating Corporations to operate the homes. Bobby signed the loans as co-borrower or guarantor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bobby admits that, on their face, none of the loans shows indebtedness of\n   the Operating Corporations to him. The lender of each loan is a third party-not Bobby. Bobby invokes the economic outlay doctrine.

But this court has rejected this argument for guarantees and pledges of collateral. A shareholder's \"guaranty of a corporate loan\" or \"pledge of personally owned property, without more, is not an economic outlay and is insufficient to create basis in the S corporation.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bean\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1950004\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/268/553/#p556\">\n    268 F.3d at 558-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This, he argues, means he was \"directly liable.\" He cites this court's language that \"guarantees ... do not increase the shareholder's basis ... because the shareholder is only secondarily and contingently liable. Only where the shareholder provides his own money (or\n   <em>\n    money he is directly liable for\n   </em>\n   ) to the S corporation, will basis increase.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Oren\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9062029\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/854/#p857\">\n    357 F.3d at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But this reference to \"money he is directly liable for\" means that a shareholder who \"borrows money in an arm's length transaction and then loans the funds to the S corporation, is entitled to an increase in basis.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9062029\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/854/#p857\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   This is not the situation here.

Signing as co-borrower may increase the chances of being forced to pay. But this does not change the fact that \"unless that eventuality transpires, he will not have increased the basis of his investment in the corporation.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Maloof\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3349841\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/645/#p647\">\n    456 F.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"That [the shareholder] cosigned the loan and that he could one day be asked to pay it does not by itself alter this conclusion because until that contingency transpired the S corporations remained indebted to the bank, not to [the shareholder].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, Bobby thinks he made an actual economic outlay, because the lenders looked primarily to him for payment. He relies on an Eleventh Circuit case. That circuit acknowledges the general rule that a shareholder that guarantees an S corporation's debt \"must ... absolve [the] corporation's debt before she may recognize an increased basis....\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Selfe v.

Bobby stresses that when he sold the Operating Corporations in 2014 to a member of the Nursing Home LLCs, he received a price that was discounted due to the Operating Corporations' debt.

Brenda believes her basis is greater than that. The Tax Court ruled she did not present enough evidence to shift the burden of proof to the Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Blodgett v. Commissioner\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042561,9170627\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/1030/\">\n    394 F.3d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1035 (8th Cir. 2005) (burden of proof \"may shift to the I.R.S. ... if the taxpayer introduces 'credible evidence' \"-\"evidence, which after critical analysis, the court would find sufficient upon which to base a decision on the issue\n   <em>\n    if no contrary evidence were submitted\n   </em>\n   (without regard to the judicial presumption of IRS correctness).\" (emphasis in original) (citing \u00a7 7491) ). Brenda disagrees. \"The question of whether a taxpayer produced evidence sufficient to shift the burden of proof ... is a legal one which we review de novo.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042561,9170627\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/1030/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Brenda did not present sufficient evidence of her basis in 2009 and 2010 or provide any precise calculation. She did present agreements showing bank loans to the Nursing Home LLCs in 2005 and 2009 and claims an increased basis due to her share of those liabilities. (The K-1s, however, showed that Brenda's share of partnership liabilities was zero.) As evidence of her share of liabilities, another member of the Nursing Home LLCs testified that liabilities were allocated to members \"proportionally upon a percentage of ownership in the LLC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But a partner's share of liabilities depends on several \"factually intensive determinations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Powers v.

Primarily, whether the debt is \"recourse\" or \"non-recourse.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.752-1\">\n     26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.752-1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    - 3\n   </strong>\n   . A partner's share of liabilities includes recourse debt if the partner bears the \"economic risk of loss\" and an allocation of non-recourse debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    \u00a7 1.752-1-3\n   </strong>\n   . Brenda provided no evidence whether the debt was recourse or non-recourse, the economic risk of loss, or the allocation of non-recourse debt. The generalized testimony of the other member-who\n   conceded he was not \"involved in the preparation of the tax returns at all\"-is not sufficient to calculate Brenda's share of the bank loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Even if Brenda provided some evidence of her share of the bank loans, that shows only a one-time increase in her basis. This is just one factor in determining her adjusted basis for the later years. This one-time increase could have been offset by a number of other events. Ultimately, \"[t]here is a wholly unsufficient evidentiary basis for any reasonable computation or estimate of [Brenda's] adjusted basis in [her interests in the Nursing Home LLCs].\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Oates v.
