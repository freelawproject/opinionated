At this juncture, however, there is only one dispositive legal question: Does repeatedly shooting, and encouraging others to shoot, a handgun \"in the general direction\" of a small lake in a residential area of Kansas City, Missouri, which results in a young child's death, qualify as \"gross negligence\"? We believe it does. For this reason, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Whispering Lake Limited Partnership owned an apartment complex in a residential area of Kansas City, Missouri. Yarco Company, Inc., managed apartment complexes for others. Whispering Lake and Yarco entered into a contract, the \"Management Agreement,\" where Yarco agreed to manage Whispering Lake's apartment complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the Management Agreement, Whispering Lake appointed Yarco as the \"exclusive agent for the management of the [apartment complex].\" The agreement also included indemnity provisions (the \"Indemnity Clause\"), allocating liability between Whispering Lake and Yarco depending on the type of liability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (a) Except for fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of [Yarco], [Whispering Lake] shall hold and save [Yarco] (and [Yarco]'s directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners and affiliates) free and harmless from any claim, cause, proceeding, or suit arising out of, or in connection with, any actions by [Yarco] in accordance with this Agreement or acting under the express or implied direction of [Whispering Lake]. Subject to the same exceptions, [Whispering Lake] shall reimburse [Yarco], upon demand, for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and for any monies which [Yarco] is required to pay in connection therewith or shall, if requested in writing by [Yarco], defend promptly and diligently, at the sole expense of [Whispering Lake], any claim, action or proceeding against [Yarco] which arises out of, or in connection with, the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (b) [Yarco] shall assume sole responsibility for and hold and save [Whispering Lake] free and harmless from any claim, cause or proceeding or suit and any costs or expenses incurred by [Whispering Lake] arising out of, or in connection with, any fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of [Yarco] or any of its employees or affiliates. [Yarco] shall reimburse [Whispering Lake] upon demand for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and for any monies which [Whispering Lake] is required to pay in connection therewith or shall, if requested in writing by [Whispering Lake], defend promptly and diligently, at the sole expense of [Yarco], any claim, action or proceeding against [Whispering Lake] which arises out of, or in connection with, the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Whispering Lake and Yarco each acquired insurance policies covering commercial liability. Each acquired a \"primary\" policy and an \"excess\" or \"umbrella\" policy, extending coverage to itself and certain others. Whispering Lake acquired a primary insurance policy with Indian Harbor Insurance Co. and an umbrella policy with Great American Insurance Co. The Indian Harbor policy provided $1 million in coverage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Great American policy provided $10 million in coverage. Similarly, Yarco acquired a primary policy with Zurich American Insurance Co. and an umbrella policy with Federal Insurance Co. The Zurich policy provided $1 million in coverage, and the Federal policy provided $25 million in coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The incident giving rise to this case occurred on Independence Day, July 4, 2011. On that day, Yarco's employee, Aaron Sullivan, worked at the apartment complex's pool as a \"pool monitor.\" In this role, Sullivan had a \"responsibility to watch over the pool area and to take steps to keep a peaceful area around the pool.\" During his shift, Sullivan retrieved a handgun. To supposedly \"celebrate\" Independence Day, Sullivan proceeded to shoot the handgun an unknown number of times. He also allowed other individuals to shoot the handgun numerous times. Sullivan instructed those individuals to direct their shots \"away from the pool [and] in the general direction of [a] lake\" bordering the apartment complex's property. This property, again, was located in a residential area of Kansas City. One of the bullets traveled across the lake and struck an eleven-year-old girl in the neck, shattering a cervical vertebra and damaging her spinal cord. The girl died the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State of Missouri later charged Sullivan (but not the others) for the incident. Sullivan pleaded guilty to Involuntary Manslaughter in the First Degree (Reckless Killing),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20565.024\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 565.024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The girl's mother brought a wrongful-death lawsuit against Sullivan and Yarco. The insurers stepped in, based on their duties to defend their insureds. The parties eventually settled the suit for a confidential amount. Each of the insurers paid a part of the settlement, but each reserved its rights to litigate its respective obligation for the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Federal then filed this action in federal district court, seeking a declaratory judgment determining the parties' obligations and any priority of coverage. Zurich filed a claim as well, and the court eventually realigned the parties (with Federal and Zurich as plaintiffs and Great American as the defendant). Federal and Zurich filed motions for summary judgment on their claims against Great American. Great\n   American filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Federal's and Zurich's claims. The district court entered an order (and then a judgment), granting Federal's and Zurich's motions and denying Great American's cross-motions. The court held that Great American was obligated to reimburse Federal and Zurich for the amounts they contributed to the settlement because Yarco's employee Sullivan was not grossly negligent. The court then issued an amended judgment, denominating the monetary amounts and interest. Great American timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Great American raises several challenges. Great American first asserts that the district court incorrectly concluded that the Management Agreement's Indemnity Clause required Whispering Lake to indemnify Yarco. Great American argues that Sullivan's conduct qualified as \"gross negligence\" and that the Indemnity Clause exempted Whispering Lake from liability for claims arising out of gross negligence. For this reason, Great American claims, it did not have a duty (as Whispering Lake's insurer) to indemnify Federal or Zurich (as Yarco's insurers). Great American then challenges several other legal conclusions from the district court's order. We do not address those other challenges, however, because we decide this appeal on the basis of Great American's \"gross negligence\" challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"We ... review de novo the district court's resolution of cross-motions for summary judgment viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and giving the nonmoving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    LaCurtis v.

Great American argues that Sullivan's conduct qualified as gross negligence and therefore its insured, Whispering Lake, did not have a duty to indemnify Yarco. The district court rejected Great American's argument as \"based on opinion and supposition.\" The court further found, \"Sullivan [had] testified that he was actually trying to\n   <em>\n    avoid\n   </em>\n   injuries by shooting into the lake,\" though the court\n   relied on testimony outside the underlying pleadings. Based on this conclusion, the district court held that the Indemnity Clause obligated Great American (standing in the shoes of Whispering Lake) to indemnify Federal and Zurich (standing in the shoes of Yarco).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties first dispute what evidence a court may consider in determining liability among the insurers for a settlement agreement. Federal and Zurich argue that a court may consider\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the underlying pleadings of the settled action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Great American, on the other hand, claims that the court also may consider extrinsic evidence not included in the underlying pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In fact, Great American contends that Sullivan's conviction for Reckless Killing is binding as a matter of collateral estoppel, based on\n   <em>\n    James v.

The tortfeasor thus agreed not to contest the victim's personal-injury action against the tortfeasor, and the victim framed the action so as to obtain a fact-finding that the tortfeasor's conduct was\n   <em>\n    unintentional\n   </em>\n   (based on mental disorders and alcoholism).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087932\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/678/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087932\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/678/\">\n    at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After obtaining a judgment against the tortfeasor based on this fact-finding, the victim brought a garnishment action against the tortfeasor's insurer (and the tortfeasor).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087932\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/678/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The insured responded that the tortfeasor's guilty plea collaterally estopped the victim from re-litigating whether the tortfeasor's conduct was intentional (and, thus, whether the insurance policy excluded coverage for the stabbing).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087932\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/678/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087932\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/678/\">\n    at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Missouri Supreme Court agreed, concluding that collateral estoppel applied\n   based on equitable considerations. The court reasoned, \"Both [the victim] and [the tortfeasor] stood to profit from [the tortfeasor]'s duplicity in admitting intentional wrongdoing in the criminal proceeding while, in effect, denying it in the [personal-injury action]. Applying collateral estoppel in this [garnishment action] serves to prevent the potential of collusive litigation as well as promoting the other policies of finality, consistency and judicial economy....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087932\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/678/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087932\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/678/\">\n    at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , however, differs from this case. Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , there was no collusive litigation between the alleged tortfeasors (i.e., Sullivan, Yarco, and Whispering Lake) and the victim (i.e., the young girl's estate). Also, even assuming Sullivan's criminal conduct and the interpretation of the term \"gross negligence\" are identical issues, we believe it would be inequitable for Great American to use collateral estoppel against Federal and Zurich-neither of which were parties in Sullivan's criminal proceeding, nor were they involved in a litigation scheme like the victim in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   . Applying collateral estoppel in this case would be inequitable, and we therefore decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nevertheless, we conclude that, in determining insurance coverage, we may consider Sullivan's criminal conviction because that fact was finally determined through a proper adjudication. This Court previously concluded that under Missouri law, \"in deciding whether losses suffered are covered by a liability policy, courts look to the allegations in the underlying complaint and compare them to the language in the insurance policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Stein\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.3d at 910. The Missouri Supreme Court subsequently declared, \"The duty to indemnify is determined by the facts as they are established at trial or as they are\n   <em>\n    finally determined\n   </em>\n   by some other means, for example through summary judgment or settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    McCormack Baron Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Am. Guar. &amp; Liab. Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11616597\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/989/168/#p173\">\n    989 S.W.2d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (Mo. banc. 1999) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arch Ins. v.

If the relevant testimony at the hearing contradicts or\n   <em>\n    adds facts\n   </em>\n   necessarily indicating the absence of coverage, then the insurer will have no duty to indemnify the insured.\" (citation omitted) ). Because Sullivan's criminal conduct was \"finally determined\" through the criminal proceeding in state court, we conclude that it is appropriate to consider his conviction for Reckless Killing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We now turn to the contractual language at issue. The Indemnity Clause provided that Whispering Lake would indemnify Yarco for \"any claim, cause, proceeding, or suit,\" except those for, among other types, \"gross negligence.\" Relatedly, the Indemnity Clause obligated Yarco to indemnify Whispering Lake for \"any claim, cause or proceeding or suit and any costs or expenses ... arising out of, or in connection with any ... gross negligence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under Missouri law, \"the primary rule of [contractual] construction is that the intention of the parties shall govern.\"\n   <em>\n    Andes v. Albano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10018628\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/853/936/#p941\">\n    853 S.W.2d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 941 (Mo. banc 1993). Neither the Management Agreement nor the Indemnity Clause defined \"gross negligence.\" When a contract governed by Missouri law does not define an unambiguous term, we must ascertain that term's plain, ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw Hofstra &amp; Assocs. v. Ladco Dev., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741542\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/819/#p825\">\n    673 F.3d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825 (8th Cir. 2012). Helpful here, Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"gross negligence\" as: \"1. A lack of slight diligence or care. 2. A conscious, voluntary act or omission in reckless disregard of a legal duty and of the\n   consequences to another party, who may typically recover exemplary damages.... 3. See\n   <em>\n    criminal negligence\n   </em>\n   .\" Black's Law Dictionary 1134 (9th ed. 2009) (citations omitted). \"Criminal negligence\" is then defined as \"[g]ross negligence so extreme that it is punishable as a crime. For example, involuntary manslaughter or other negligent homicide can be based on criminal negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741542\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/819/#p825\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We think this definition aptly describes the incident here. Even considering only the underlying pleadings and Sullivan's conviction for Reckless Killing, Sullivan's conduct constituted gross negligence. While serving as an employee at the property that day, Sullivan fired his handgun an unknown number of times to \"celebrate\" Independence Day. Sullivan not only allowed others to fire his handgun, but also encouraged them to do so. And Sullivan and the others repeatedly shot the handgun in a populated, residential area of Kansas City, Missouri. Based on Sullivan's decisions and actions, a bullet struck and killed an eleven-year-old child. Federal and Zurich contend that Sullivan's act directing the others to shoot the handgun \"away from the pool [and] in the general direction of the lake\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was conduct \"promoting safety\" (as they describe it), rather than conduct of gross negligence. This contention is wholly without merit, for the reasons just expressed.

This conviction, demonstrating \"criminal negligence,\" further supports our conclusion that his conduct qualified as \"gross negligence,\" as understood under the Indemnity Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

But this argument contradicts the contractual terms. Under the Indemnity Clause, Yarco agreed to indemnify Whispering Lake \"from\n   <em>\n    any claim, cause or proceeding or suit and any costs or expenses\n   </em>\n   incurred by [Whispering Lake]\n   <em>\n    arising out of, or in connection with,\n   </em>\n   any ... gross negligence ... on the part of [Yarco] or any of its employees or affiliates\" (emphases added). This broad language required Yarco to indemnify Whispering Lake for any claims or costs arising from a Yarco employee's gross negligence; this provision did not divide liability between the parties based on the underlying action's formulation of the claims. The costs from the settlement here clearly arose out of, or were in connection with, Sullivan's gross negligence. The Indemnity Clause therefore obligated Yarco to indemnify Whispering Lake for any claims or costs arising from Sullivan's gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because Sullivan's conduct was \"gross negligence,\" Whispering Lake did not have an obligation under the Indemnity Clause to indemnify Yarco or Sullivan for the settlement. Similarly, Yarco had an obligation to indemnify Whispering Lake for \"any costs or expenses ... arising out of, or in connection with,\" Sullivan's gross negligence. As such, the district court erred in relying on the Indemnity Clause to require Whispering Lake's insurer (Great American) to indemnify Yarco's insurers (Federal and Zurich). Because the district court erred in relying on this erroneous legal conclusion when granting Federal's and Zurich's motions for summary judgment and in denying Great American's cross-motions for summary judgment, we vacate the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The question remains: Who is liable for the settlement amount? Great American claims that the terms of the applicable insurance policies-i.e., the policies issued by Great American, Federal, and Zurich-set the priority of coverage. This is the general rule under Missouri law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed. Ins. v. Gulf Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953534\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/162/160/#p164\">\n    162 S.W.3d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005). Federal and Zurich, on the other hand, assert that the Indemnity Clause allocated liability to either Whispering Lake's or Yarco's \"tower of insurance coverage.\" Stated otherwise, Yarco's insurers (Federal and Zurich) would indemnify Whispering Lake's insurer (Great American)-or vice versa-depending on which insured was liable under the Indemnity Clause. For this assertion, Federal and Zurich rely on the Missouri Court of Appeals's decision in\n   <em>\n    Federal Insurance v. Gulf Insurance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953534\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/162/160/#p164\">\n    162 S.W.3d at 164-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and this Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

This is an exception to the general rule that the insurance policies' terms determine priority of coverage. Under this exception, an indemnity clause-rather than insurance policies-determines the insurers' liability, in certain circumstances. The above cases identified several factors to analyze before a court may apply this exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on the district court's erroneous conclusion that the Indemnity Clause obligated Whispering Lake to indemnify Yarco, the court did not analyze these remaining issues regarding liability. Specifically, the court did not discuss whether the priority of coverage was governed by the insurance policies or the Indemnity Clause. Assuming the general rule applies, the district court did not discuss or determine whether the Federal policy or the Great American policy (i.e., the two \"umbrella\" policies\") were \"mutually repugnant\" or whether one was \"excess\" to the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.
