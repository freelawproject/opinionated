Defendant Harbor Plaza Center, LLC, originally filed an answer and took other actions but, before trial, failed to appear. The district court eventually struck the answer, entered a default judgment against Defendant, and awarded fees pursuant to a local rule. By eschewing the ordinary considerations that apply when calculating fees in ADA cases, the district court abused its discretion. Accordingly, we vacate the award of fees and remand for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Martin Vogel is a paraplegic who uses a wheelchair when traveling in public. He visited the Harbor Plaza Shopping Center and, in the parking lot, encountered barriers that prevented him from fully enjoying the shopping center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2014, Plaintiff filed this action against the shopping center's owner, Defendant Harbor Plaza Center, LLC. He alleged violations of state law and the ADA, and he sought declaratory and injunctive relief, statutory damages, and attorney's fees. In July 2014, Defendant, represented by counsel, filed an answer to the complaint. The court scheduled trial for October 2015. In September 2014, Defendant filed a request to substitute counsel, which the court approved. The request was signed by Defendant's initial lawyer, its new lawyer, and its representative (Defendant's vice-president). Defendant and Defendant's lawyer thereafter stopped appearing. In the meantime, Plaintiff dutifully prepared for trial and, pursuant to the district court's scheduling order, filed motions in limine, a witness list, an exhibit list, and a pretrial brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the scheduled pretrial conference, in September 2015, Defendant and its lawyer failed to appear. Plaintiff expressed concern that Defendant was unaware of the proceedings. The court shared that concern and noted that, in 2005, Defendant's lawyer had been convicted of a federal corruption charge. The court continued the pretrial conference and ordered Plaintiff to provide notice to Defendant's lawyer and to Defendant's representative of the now-postponed conference. Plaintiff provided notice, but Defendant and Defendant's lawyer failed to appear at the continuation\n   of the pretrial conference. The court struck Defendant's answer and ordered that Plaintiff \"may proceed by way of entry of default and then default judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for default, which the court entered. But Plaintiff remained concerned that Defendant was unaware of the proceedings. Instead of filing a motion for default judgment, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for the court to reschedule the pretrial conference and to order Defendant's representative to appear personally. The district court denied the application without explanation. The court later ordered Plaintiff, upon pain of dismissal, to file a motion for default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff then filed a motion for default judgment, seeking injunctive relief, statutory damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Plaintiff sought $36,671.25 in attorney's fees. In an attached declaration, Plaintiff's lawyer provided the court with a seven-page itemized list of the work that his firm had performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court granted Plaintiff's motion for default judgment. The court entered an injunction ordering Defendant to make specific structural changes to the parking lot:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) install a handicap and van-accessible parking stall with a width greater than or equal to 132 inches, with (a) appropriate signage; (b) a curb cut offering walkway access to the entrance of Defendant's Shopping Center located at 13011-13129 Harbor Boulevard, Garden Grove, CA 92843; and (c) an adjacent access aisle at least 60 inches wide that is nearly level in all directions to the parking spaces they serve, with a slope no steeper than 2.082%; and (2) ensure that no disabled parking spaces have slopes or cross-slopes exceeding 2.082% due to encroaching build-up curb ramps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court awarded Plaintiff statutory damages of $4,000, and it awarded Plaintiff all of his requested costs, $3,590.83.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, the district court consulted the Local Rules of Practice in Civil Proceedings before the United States District Court for the Central District of California. In particular, Local Rule 55-3, titled \"Default Judgment-Schedule of Attorneys' Fees,\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   When a promissory note, contract or applicable statute provides for the recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees, those fees shall be calculated according to the following schedule:\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-23\"><strong>Amount of Judgment</strong> <strong>Attorneys' Fees Awards</strong> $0.01-$1,000 30% with a minimum of $250.00 $1,000.01-$10,000 $300 plus 10% of the amount over $1,000 $10,000.01-$50,000 $1200 plus 6% of the amount over $10,000 $50,000.01-$100,000 $3600 plus 4% of the amount over $50,000 Over $100,00 $5600 plus 2% of the amount over $100,000</pre>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   This schedule shall be applied to the amount of the judgment exclusive of costs. An attorney claiming a fee in excess of this schedule may file a written request at the time of entry of the default judgment to have the attorney's fee fixed by the Court. The Court shall hear the request and render judgment for such fee as the Court may deem reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Consulting the local rule's formula, the district court calculated fees of $600. The court held that, because it was awarding Plaintiff the full amount of his requested costs, \"[t]he Court does not believe ... that further modification of the Local Rule's recommended attorneys' fees award is necessary here. The Court therefore awards Plaintiff $600 in attorneys' fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff timely appeals, challenging only the district court's calculation of fees. Defendant declined to file a responding brief, and we granted Plaintiff's request that we decide this appeal without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We review for abuse of discretion a district court's award of attorney's fees under the ADA.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

But we review de novo questions of law that underlie a court's fee award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9341276\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/965/#p970\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9341276\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/965/#p970\">\n    at 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the central legal issue underlying the district court's award of fees is the proper interpretation of Local Rule 55-3. Ordinarily we give great deference to a district court's interpretation of its own local rules.\n   <em>\n    Bias v. Moynihan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046929\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1212/#p1223\">\n    508 F.3d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1223 (9th Cir. 2007). That deference rests on the idea that a court that creates a rule is in the best position to apply it to the circumstances of particular cases.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Morgan Distrib.

But where, as here, the interpretive question is a purely legal one and the judges of the district court have been inconsistent in their interpretation of the rule, the amount of deference that we owe is diminished.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Instead, the court looked to the schedule of fees described\n   in the Central District's Local Rule 55-3. The local rule's schedule of fees provides a default calculation of fees amounting to a small percentage of the monetary component of a default judgment. Applying the schedule, the court calculated fees of $600. Local Rule 55-3 also provides that, upon timely written request, the district court \"shall hear the request and render judgment for such fee as the Court may deem reasonable.\" In response to Plaintiff's detailed written request, the district court concluded that no \"modification\" of the $600 calculation was warranted. In effect, the court interpreted the rule as prescribing a\n   <em>\n    presumptively correct\n   </em>\n   award of fees in cases in which prevailing parties claim fees in excess of the scheduled amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We read the local rule to require a different procedure. If a party seeks a fee \"in excess of\" the schedule and timely files a written request to have the fee fixed by the court, then the court must hear the request and award a \"reasonable\" fee. That process does not describe a \"modification\" of the schedule of fees. Rather, it prescribes an alternative process when a party invokes it in the proper way at the proper time. When a party invokes that process, the court is obliged to calculate a \"reasonable\" fee in the usual manner, without using the fee schedule as a starting point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our reasons for reading the local rule in this manner are straightforward. First, the text of the rule provides that, when a lawyer claims a fee in excess of the scheduled amount, the lawyer is asking \"to have the attorney's fee fixed by the Court.

We have found no decision by our court or by our sister circuits holding that the lodestar fee is the presumptively reasonable fee in substantially uncontested default judgment cases. In this case, the district court applied a local rule that set a presumptive fee for the default judgment of $600. The appeal seeks more than $36,000 for work claimed by counsel. The majority's new rule means starting with more than $36,000 as the presumptive fee in this default judgment, where the defendant filed an answer and did nothing else to oppose the claim. I think the district court properly used the local rule's fee schedule for default judgments as the starting point and acted within its discretion to reject an increase, so we should affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The majority's new rule is not supported by the statute or existing law. It will likely generate an unreasonable and oppressive result in this case and in default judgment cases generally. A lot of little pizza joints, convenience stores, used book stores, seamstress shops, dry cleaners, and the like, will likely be put out of business by this new rule. And the money will not go to wheelchair ramps or toilet stalls accommodating the disabled. It will go to the lawyers who bring the cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The ADA says that attorneys' fee awards are discretionary and must be \"reasonable\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In any action or administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to this chapter, the court or agency, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs, and the United States shall be liable for the foregoing the same as a private individual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The statute does not say that \"reasonable\" means claimed hours multiplied by claimed rates.

Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In state courts, vast numbers of default judgments are rendered in bill collection cases. State courts use fee schedules for default judgments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in some cases more generally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We apply these state court fee rules in appropriate diversity cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Federal courts have less debt collection work, but still plenty. Vogel's counsel undoubtedly would have been familiar with the use of fee schedules in his home state of California, both in state and federal courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The majority errs in suggesting that federal district courts, as a rule, use lodestar\n   to set attorneys' fees in default judgment cases. Courts often rely on local fee schedules to set a presumptive fee or reduce the lodestar calculation, even in cases where a higher award is sought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, we have affirmed the use of the Central District's fee schedule to set a reasonable fee in an ADA default judgment case, albeit in an unpublished decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The concerns noted by the Federal Courts Study Committee and the Third Circuit Task Force have particular force in substantially uncontested default judgment cases. There is a clear distinction between the lodestar cases and substantially uncontested default judgments. The distinction makes a difference. In a contested case, the opposing side can be expected to challenge whatever claimed hours are unfair. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Moreno v. City of Sacramento\n   </em>\n   , \"it may be difficult for the district court to identify the precise spot where a fee request is excessive,\" so \"the burden of producing a sufficiently cogent explanation can mostly be placed on the shoulders of the losing parties, who not only have the incentive, but also the knowledge of the case to point out such things as excessive or duplicative billing practices.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in substantially uncontested default judgments, where the opposing party has not appeared to contest the claimed fee, there is no such check against the ills noted by the Federal Courts Study Committee and the Third Circuit Task Force. The majority opinion says that district courts must bear the burden of pouring through the materials supporting the fee request. But as\n   <em>\n    Moreno\n   </em>\n   suggests, this may be difficult for district courts lacking the \"knowledge of the case to point out such things as excessive or duplicative billing practices.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is there any good reason to impose this task on busy judges, whose courts have adopted fee schedules like those recommended by the Advisory Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Using lodestar as the starting point for fees in such cases is an invitation to fraud or abuse in the form of excessive hours, duplicative billing, unjustified work, and inflated rates. By shifting the focus to lodestar, the majority replaces a presumptively reasonable fee award with a calculation based upon uncontested claims for time spent and hourly rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The majority says that the justification for starting with lodestar is that this is a civil rights case. But differentiating civil rights cases on default judgment so that plaintiffs' attorneys can run up large amounts of fees is contrary to how the Supreme Court has described lodestar. The Supreme Court has held that in such cases, \"reasonable fees ... are to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Starting with the local rule's fee schedule establishes a presumptive fee that is precisely \"the prevailing market rate[ ] in the relevant community.\" What other lawyers get in a default judgment case, the market rate, is typically the scheduled fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The majority cites\n   <em>\n    Fair Housing of Marin v. Combs\n   </em>\n   as its only authority for extending lodestar to substantially uncontested default judgments, but that race discrimination case was heavily litigated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The default stemmed from a sanction based on the defendant's obdurate refusal to provide discovery and misrepresentations to the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Fair Housing v. Combs\n   </em>\n   was more or less the opposite, in terms of the extent of counsel's efforts, of the case before us. There was a defendant on the other side from beginning to end, litigating vigorously and unfairly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Fair Housing v. Combs\n   </em>\n   , Vogel's case was not heavily litigated. It was barely litigated at all. After filing an answer, the defendant engaged in no litigation whatsoever. The defendant made no misrepresentations to the court, as had been made in\n   <em>\n    Fair Housing v. Combs\n   </em>\n   . The concerns raised by the Federal Courts Study Committee and the Third Circuit Task Force, along with the concerns I have raised about applying lodestar in default judgment cases, all materialized in the case before us. Vogel's attorneys ginned up a $36,000 claim for doing nothing besides generating papers to make it look like the parties were doing something.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Vogel's counsel characterized this as a \"year and a half\" of litigation, which is misleading. The details make it clear that this was a fairly routine default. Vogel's lawyers, the Disabled Advocacy Group, filed Vogel's complaint on June 16, 2014. Albert Robles, Esq., filed an answer on July 30, 2014, with various denials and affirmative defenses. Tafoya &amp; Garcia withdrew as counsel a couple of months later, on September 18, 2014, after no litigation, substituting Robles as defense counsel of record. Evidently the defense was initially farmed out by Tafoya &amp; Garcia to Robles (who filed the answer in the first place), and then Robles became counsel of record when Tafoya &amp; Garcia withdrew. Robles never filed another paper in the case. Nor did Tafoya &amp; Garcia file any other papers, except to withdraw as counsel. Nor did either of them do anything else to litigate the case, so far as the record shows. They never showed up for hearings, never argued in court, and never filed any papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At the scheduled pretrial conference a year after the substitution of counsel, Robles did not appear. The judge noted that Robles had not participated in the preparation of any of the pretrial documents, nor in the pretrial conferences, nor in anything else. Vogel's lawyer moved that the answer be stricken and the defendant defaulted. The judge, after requiring notice both to Robles and to the defendant, did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   An easier case for Vogel to win cannot be imagined. There was no active litigation. Vogel's counsel filed several papers labeled \"joint\" that were not really \"joint\" at all. The record shows no participation by anyone from the defense. The \"Joint Rule 26(F) Report\" that Vogel's lawyers filed, for example, says that \"Plaintiff and Defendant\" \"request\" a procedure, \"believe\" something, \"estimated\" something, and so forth, but it was never signed by the defense. The defense did not participate in the preparation of this document. There was no reason to think that the defense requested, estimated, or believed anything attributed to it by Vogel's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The mediation also appears to have stemmed from the falsely labeled \"joint\" request and another, declaring that \"the parties\" request mediation, again signed only by Vogel's counsel. The defense never participated in the preparation of this document, either. Though Vogel's papers made this look like a lawsuit with two sides participating, it was not. In Vogel's attorney's declaration in support of the entry of default, he admitted that the defendant and its attorney \"did not participate in the preparation of any pretrial documents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Vogel's lawyers obtained a $2,947.44 sanction award for hours claimed for the mediation that never occurred. But after the default, they claimed at least an additional $3,150 relating to that mediation, even though the district court had already granted all of the mediation fees Vogel's lawyers requested in its earlier sanction award. Vogel's lawyers put a lot of paper through the printer on pretrial motions, motions in limine, and other filings, but in fact they had no reason to think that there would be a trial or any other contest in the case, and indeed none took place. Oddly, Vogel's lawyers even claimed hours spent to \"prepare and file [an] answer to [the] complaint,\" even though Vogel was the plaintiff and did not file an answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Vogel's counsel had engaged in this sort of litigation conduct before. The Central District has an extensive history with Vogel and with this law firm, which it doubtless considered in applying its discretion to the $36,000 claim for attorneys' fees. In one ADA case, the court noted that the firm's \"mischaracterization of [its] hourly rates in case law is unsettling.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court noted that the firm claimed \"excessive\" hours for \"unopposed and/or duplicate motions\" that were \"nearly identical\" to others from the \"hundreds, if not thousands, of cases\" it had filed on Vogel's behalf, \"many of which have identical legal issues and similar factual issues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court noted that the firm copied a court order \"almost word for word,\" then claimed that the filing took \"nearly seven hours to draft.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   In another ADA case, the court noted that it \"is extremely concerned about [the firm]'s potential misrepresentations with respect to [c]ounsel's hourly rates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court noted that the leader\n   of the firm \"almost double[d] [his] rates in the span of two months,\" which the court concluded was \"patently unreasonable\" and a \"blatant misrepresentation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Central District recently noted that the leader of the firm has been \"suspended from the practice of law\" for making \"misrepresentations to the [c]ourt and opposing counsel[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was after the firm \"falsely represented to this [c]ourt and [d]efendant, over many months of litigation, that [Vogel] encountered access barriers during a prefiling visit to the restaurant that he\n   <em>\n    never actually made\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other district courts have faced similar problems with this same law firm,\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   noting in one ADA case, for example, that the firm billed \"one hour [for] drafting the boilerplate complaint ... when it was identical, except for the names of defendants and the establishment, to the thirty others his client in this case had filed in this district.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   We upheld terminating sanctions against Vogel and this same law firm in another ADA case for falsifying evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   The district court, on the basis of evidence before it, reasonably determined that both Vogel and his attorney participated in a pattern of falsification of evidence that amounted to bad faith. Despite multiple requests ... Vogel never produced any documentation supporting a different pre-Complaint visit. Nor did Vogel provide a sworn statement explaining why he described in such detail the facts of a visit he later acknowledged did not occur, although he could have attached such a declaration to his Errata Sheet, to his amended motion for summary judgment, or to his opposition to the motion for sanctions. On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion by issuing terminating sanctions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We upheld sanctions against the firm's lead attorney in yet another ADA case, where he falsified the signature of his deceased mother in an attempt to secure a favorable settlement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Any rational attorney representing a plaintiff in an ADA access case would know that if his client died, the defendants would want to know about it, especially before signing a settlement agreement that promised prospective relief. And by sending the defendant an agreement after his mother's death that purported to contain her signature when it was not in fact her signature, Hubbard created the impression that she was still alive. Hubbard provides no coherent innocent explanation for this conduct, and the most logical conclusion to be drawn is that he intended to deceive the defendant. Such conduct rises to the level of recklessness and bad faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This kind of history likely and permissibly influences a district court's exercise of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Not every law firm representing litigants deserving of special protections is itself a knight in shining armor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Of course, this is an ADA case, and removing barriers to access for the disabled is a good cause. The statute encourages private attorneys general accordingly by adopting the English rule, awarding reasonable attorneys' fees, in place of the usual American rule. But even a good cause can be abused. Today's majority decision encourages abuses of this sort by creating an incentive to puff up the presumptive fee in default judgment cases. Starting with the local rule's fee schedule as the presumptive fee makes sense because the Supreme Court has said that starting with what other lawyers get is a good idea, and what other lawyers get in a default judgment case is typically the scheduled fee. Such a presumptive fee, subject to adjustment for reasonableness, is consistent with the ADA, the legal force of local rules, and the Supreme Court and this court's precedents. Today's decision, by failing to distinguish between substantially uncontested default judgments and contested cases, doubtless will generate considerable abuse. There is no good reason to treat the lodestar amount as the presumptively reasonable fee in a substantially uncontested default judgment, even though there is in fully contested litigation. Doing so invites such abuse.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012205\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Antoninetti v.
