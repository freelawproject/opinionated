The issue before us is whether a suit brought by United States military personnel, civilian contractors, and surviving family members (collectively \"Servicemembers\") against Kellogg, Brown, &amp; Root, LLC, and Halliburton Company (collectively \"KBR\") for injuries allegedly caused by KBR's waste management and water services across Iraq and Afghanistan implicates such a political question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This case returns to us after the district court created an extensive factual record through a herculean discovery process and once again concluded that the Servicemembers' suit implicates a political question that federal courts cannot adjudicate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re KBR, Inc., Burn Pit Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   \"). Additionally, the district court held that the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\") preempts the Servicemembers' claims. We agree with the district court that the political question doctrine bars the Servicemembers' suit. Therefore, we need not reach the FTCA preemption issue. Accordingly, we affirm in part and vacate in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Since the United States began its military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001 and 2003, respectively, the U.S. military has depended heavily on contractors to support its mission. For example, as the military established forward operating bases (\"FOBs\") across the two theaters, those bases necessitated extensive contractor support for the management of waste, ammunition, fuel, and facilities, and provision of water treatment and food services, so that the warfighters could focus on combat operations. To provide waste management and water services at the FOBs, the Army awarded KBR a ten-year contract called the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program III (\"LOGCAP III\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Since 2008, through 63 separate complaints, the Servicemembers have sued KBR, alleging that they suffered harms from being exposed to smoke from open air burn pits and drinking impure water.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated and transferred these cases to the District of Maryland for pretrial proceedings. The amended complaint, in large part, alleges that KBR failed to design, manage, and operate the burn pits safely and to treat and monitor water qualities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before any jurisdictional discovery took place, on February 27, 2013, the district court granted KBR's renewed motion to\n   dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re KBR, Inc., Burn Pit Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329410\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/925/752/#p774\">\n    925 F.Supp.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (D.

The district court concluded that (1) the case presented a nonjusticiable political question, (2) KBR was shielded from suit under derivative sovereign immunity, and (3) the FTCA preempted the Servicemembers' state law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329410\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/925/752/#p774\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329410\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/925/752/#p774\">\n    at 765-68, 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Jurisdictional discovery yielded over 5.8 million pages of documents, including almost a million pages of contract documents, and 34 witness depositions. After the conclusion of jurisdictional discovery, KBR moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) based on the political question doctrine and for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 based on FTCA preemption. The district court held an evidentiary hearing during which each side presented a comprehensive case. KBR presented six live witnesses.

The court also cited the testimony of Lieutenant General, retired, John Vines, who assumed command after General Sanchez, that his predecessor's \"standing orders remain[ed] in effect,\" that he did not need to affirmatively re-authorize the use of the burn pits, and that he did not consider alternatives to\n   burn pits to be feasible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J.A. 4917).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court explained that the theater command's decision to use burn pits \"reflected a military judgment ... in the dangerous, wartime contingency environment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court relied on General Vines's testimony that alternatives such as landfills or recycling services were not feasible because \"the slightest movement [of the U.S. forces] expose[d] those moving to hostile actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J.A. 4918). The record also contains a written declaration of General Sanchez who similarly opined that landfills inside the FOBs would have posed a risk of the spread of disease, stench, and vermin, and landfills outside the FOBs would have posed \"an unacceptable level of security risk\" to personnel disposing of waste. J.A. 914.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court further found that the military decided against using incinerators and that KBR could not unilaterally decide to install incinerators to dispose of waste. The court relied on various witness testimonies, establishing that the military had to approve the acquisition, funding, and transportation of incinerators into the Iraqi theater. The district court also cited to General Vines's testimony that \"everything that came in[to] [Iraq] required support sustainment\" and \"had side effects.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J.A. 4918). Bringing the incinerators into Iraq would have required the military to provide a military convoy, potentially diverting combat personnel. Based on this testimony, the district court found that the military-not KBR-decided to forgo the use of incinerators. In addition to the district court's findings, the record contains General Sanchez's written declaration that the acquisition and transportation of the incinerators did not amount to a military priority because, given the \"limited transportation capacity,\" the military focused on transporting \"mission-critical supplies, i.e., ammunition and fuel.\" J.A. 916.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court further found that the military \"made all decisions regarding the location of burn pits on the FOBs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court cited to various witnesses' testimonies stating that every FOB had a base commander who \"exert[ed] total operational and physical control\" over the base, that these base commanders \"decided where everything went,\" including the burn pits, and that KBR could not \"unilaterally move a burn pit from one location to another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J.A. 1076, 1362, 4955). The record also contains General Vines's testimony, explaining that the location for a burn pit implicated a military decision that only the military commanders could make, because the burn pit \"could affect the road network, communications plan, building [of] a quick reaction force, [the ability to] maneuver[ ] around the base in event of infiltration, [the] potential for introduction of disease, [t]he effect of wind direction, the effect of smoke, [and the] operation on an air field.\" J.A. 4923.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In addition to the siting decisions, the district court found that \"[t]he military exercised control over the operation of the burn pits,\" and that \"KBR was at all times acting under the comprehensive direction and control of the military.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 805-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One example of the military's exercise of control, the court noted, was the military's determination as to which items could be burned and which items could not. Based on the two commanding generals' testimonies, various memoranda, and letters of technical direction (\"LOTD\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court observed that\n   the military directed the following items to be burned: plastic water bottles, animal carcasses, dining facility trash, woven fiber filters, and oil filters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the district court cited the declaration of Gerald E. Vincent, a Department of the Army civilian employee who served as the Environmental Program Manager in Iraq, stating that \"[i]f something was not specifically prohibited, then it was allowed to be burned.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J.A. 1797). Relatedly, as the district court noted, the military determined that hazardous materials were \"to be segregated and disposed of by a method other than surface burning\" and \"not authorized to be placed in burn pits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting J.A. 4933).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Other portions of the record, cited by the district court, similarly demonstrate the military's plenary control over the operation of the burn pits. For example, one LOTD, dated January 1, 2006, directs KBR \"to reduce the amount of solid waste being burned at Camp Echo at one time by conducting multiple burns of smaller quantities of trash.\" J.A. 2039. With regard to the hours of operation, the district court cited to one LOTD, dated November 11, 2006, that directed KBR to change the burn pit hours at FOB Summerall, Iraq, from 24 hours to 10 hours a day; and then to another LOTD, dated December 29, 2006, that directed KBR to operate the burn pit at Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan, for 24 hours.\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J.A. 2050, 2052). Lastly, the standard operating procedure in place for the U.S. forces in Iraq provided that \"[f]lames above the burning material must not be higher than (2) Feet.\" J.A. 4394.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, the district court found that \"the military retained a high level of control over KBR's provision of water services in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and that the military's control was \"not limited to the 'what' of providing water, but rather included highly detailed specifications concerning 'how' it was to be provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record demonstrates that water services amounted to a critical element of \"force health protection\" because it concerned prevention of dehydration, disease, and other non-battle injuries which could seriously undermine the readiness of the U.S. forces.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1596, 1613. Yet, General Sanchez testified that water services presented a unique challenge to the military in theater as it \"could not tap into Iraqi sources of water.\" J.A. 4839. The only options were to rely on reverse osmosis water purification or bottled water. The record indicates that bottled water was disfavored because transporting water was not as critical as transporting ammunition and fuel. Thus, the military units and civilian contractors produced potable water through reverse osmosis purification, \"filtering and treating a variety of raw water sources, e.g., rivers and wells.\" J.A. 1818.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The district court found that the military \"retained ultimate control over KBR's performance of [water] services and tested the water to ensure that the detailed military standards and methods were being met.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In making this finding, the district court relied on the written declaration of Lieutenant Colonel Tara Hall, the former Chairperson of the Multi-National Corps-Iraq Water Quality Board, who stated that the \"Army Preventive Medicine had oversight over water operations in Iraq and supervised the production, testing, and distribution\n   of potable and nonpotable water.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J.A. 1818). In that declaration, Hall further explained that \"the Army routinely tested potable and nonpotable water to ensure the water was safe for human uses\" and \"routinely certified and inspected [reverse osmosis water purification units] to ensure safety and sanitation.\" J.A. 1818. Although the district court acknowledged that \"KBR was, at times, responsible for testing and ensuring the quality of water that it delivered,\" the court nevertheless found that \"the military retained ultimate control.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court relied on testimonial and record evidence indicating that \"Preventive Medicine personnel in theater were required, and regularly conducted, surveillance of the potable water at base camps.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting J.A. 2192).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After finding that the military retained control over water quality, the district court cited various documents to further find that the military directed KBR on how to produce water, detailing the quantity, frequency, and location of production.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record contains various documents, such as Task Order 89 which listed the varied amounts of water to be produced and stored at eight FOBs, directed KBR to \"distribute potable water daily (seven days per week) to units within 250 km from [the specified locations],\" and authorizing the use of reverse osmosis purification. J.A. 4100. Additionally, the record includes various LOTDs directing KBR to, for example, provide 52,000 gallons of water, fill water tanks, test water to a new dining facility, and operate certain water wells for up to 8 hours a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With regard to the military's contracting process, the district court found that \"[t]he operational arm of the military dictated all requirements\" and that the military's contracting arm \"implemented these decisions through the contracting process.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the relevant federal acquisitions practices, only contracting professionals-such as contracting officers or administrative contracting officers-can alter the terms of a government contract or issue contract guidance through written documents such as LOTDs or administrative change letters. The military's uniformed contracting professionals do not fall under the operational chain of command; instead, they often fall under a separate chain of command under the Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\"). DCMA receives delegated contract administration authority from a contracting agency, such as the Army Materials Command, and ensures that \"both the contractor and the Government comply with the terms and conditions of the contract.\" J.A. 1066. In war zones, although there existed a formal divide between the operational arm and the contracting arm of the military, the contracting arm did not have the authority to change the requirements identified by the operational command. In other words, the contracting arm merely translated the operational command's requirements into contractual terms and conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Relatedly, during KBR's performance of the contract, the military had several methods of evaluating and controlling KBR. DCMA conducted real-time inspections and quality assurance audits. If KBR failed to meet the commander's intent, the military and KBR could informally address the deficiencies. The military also possessed formal methods including the issuance of formal directives to take corrective actions. Because LOGCAP III was a performance-based contract, KBR received its fee upon the government's evaluation of its work. Accordingly, the military evaluated\n   KBR's performance through semi-annual award fee evaluation boards consisting of both contracting and operational military personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Lastly, the district court found that \"KBR was integrated into the military's chain of command and its waste and water services were essential to the military's mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district court further relied on the deposition testimony of Sari Berman, a former KBR employee, stating that KBR was \"functionally under [military] command.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (citing J.A. 1343). Berman's testimony further revealed that KBR participated in the military's weekly primary staff briefings, daily battle update briefings, monthly maintenance meetings, and command briefs.

Under the LOGCAP III contract, the military contracted with KBR to provide waste management and water services. The facts found by the district court plainly show that KBR had little to no discretion in choosing\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   to manage the waste. The military mandated the use of burn pits as a matter of military judgment. KBR could not unilaterally choose to use landfills, recycling, or incinerators instead. Additionally, the military exercised plenary control over where to construct the burn pits, what could or could not be burned, when KBR could operate the burn pits, how high the flames should be, and how large each burn should be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   With regard to water services, KBR similarly had little discretion to choose\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   to provide potable water. KBR could not unilaterally bring bottled water from outside of Iraq, as it depended on the military supply chain to transport anything. As the evidence showed, the military directed the frequency and quantity of potable water to be produced and dictated how much should be stored. The fact that KBR lacked discretion differentiates this case from\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , where the military's control was not plenary because the contractors retained significant discretion, but makes it similar to\n   <em>\n    Carmichael\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670425\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/1271/#p1276\">\n    572 F.3d at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which \"[e]ach of the[ ] critical determinations was made exclusively by the military.\" We conclude that the military's control over KBR's waste management and water services was plenary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Next, the military's control over KBR was actual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/#p156\">\n    840 F.3d at 156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari IV\n   </em>\n   , this was not a case involving merely on-paper military control that was plagued by a lack of actual command presence. Although KBR did not officially fall within the military chain of command, the military exercised extensive control and oversight\n   over KBR's burn pit operations and water services. Operationally, the commanders and their staff officers interfaced with KBR contractors on a regular basis. The operational command determined the methods of waste management and water services that KBR was to use, dictated their requirements for support, and directed KBR to provide the necessary services through the contracting arm. The military also retained the ultimate responsibility for testing water quality. Furthermore, the military continuously and meticulously evaluated whether KBR was meeting the commanders' intent. Accordingly, we conclude that the military's control over KBR's waste management and water services was actual and plenary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Servicemembers raise numerous unpersuasive arguments as to why the military lacked control over KBR. First, the Servicemembers argue that the district court clearly erred in finding that the military authorized KBR to utilize burn pits across Iraq and Afghanistan. To support this argument, the Servicemembers note that pursuant to LOGCAP III, KBR could not use burn pits without written authorization. Because the record only contains written authorization for burn pits at 18 locations, the Servicemembers argue that KBR therefore did not have authorization for every burn pit. We reject this argument. The district court's factual findings regarding the authorization of the use of burn pits is compelling in light of the entire record, easily surpassing the requirement that we uphold the finding so long as it is simply \"plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Wooden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516580\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/591/#p602\">\n    887 F.3d at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The record overwhelmingly shows that the military not only authorized but mandated the use of burn pits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In a written declaration, the Servicemembers' own witness, Lieutenant Colonel Damon Walsh, stated that \"it is highly improbable that KBR could have located, constructed, and/or operated an enduring burn pit without the awareness and authorization of the military units.\" J.A. 1077. Likewise, David Palmer, a KBR employee, testified at deposition that he was not \"aware of any instances where KBR operated a burn pit without the government's knowledge.\" J.A. 998. And Matthew Hersch, the military's quality assurance representative, testified that, \"in [his] experience at Camp Bucca,\" there were no \"instances where contractors were performing unauthorized work.\" J.A. 4982-83. Thus, the district court's conclusions that the military decided, authorized, and mandated the use of burn pits at all FOBs and that there were no instances of unauthorized use of burn pits are well supported by the record evidence. In other words, regarding the district court's finding that the military authorized KBR to use burn pits, the Servicemembers fail to leave a \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    470 U.S. at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, the Servicemembers argue that the district court clearly erred in finding that the military exercised any control over KBR because the military-or at least its operational command-cannot directly issue an order to KBR. They argue that only the military's contracting arm could direct KBR through contractual agreements, thus subjecting KBR not to military control but to contractual obligations. This argument is factually and legally unavailing. Factually, though the most immediate control over KBR came from DCMA, DCMA acted at the behest of the operational command. Although part of a separate chain of command, DCMA did not have its own separate mission\n   apart from the operational command; rather, its mission was to support the operational command. This is clear from the fact that DCMA did not have the authority to change the substance of the operational command's requirements. Therefore, we agree with the district court's conclusion that it is \"irrelevant here that the military's operational commanders ... effectuated [their] orders by using DCMA (which is part of the military) as a conduit.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, as the Army's\n   <em>\n    Contractor Deployment Guide\n   </em>\n   shows, \"[c]ontractor employees [were] expected to adhere to all guidance and obey all instructions and general orders issued by the Theater Commander or his/her representative.\" J.A. 812.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, the Servicemembers' argument is one that places form over substance.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/#p156\">\n    840 F.3d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, although the military had formal control over the contractor's interrogation tactics, the inquiry turns on \"\n   <em>\n    what actually occurred in practice\n   </em>\n   during those interrogations\" (emphasis added)). The Servicemembers ask us to abstractly look only to the formal, contractual relationship between the military and KBR while ignoring the actual, operational relationship between them. We decline to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Third, the Servicemembers argue that the district court's findings regarding the military's control are clearly erroneous because there is evidence of KBR burning hazardous material, despite the military's prohibition against burning such material, thus showing the military did not actually control KBR. This argument has both factual and legal dimensions. Factually, the Servicemembers maintain that the district court's finding of control was clearly erroneous. Legally, the Servicemembers similarly argue that \"KBR's repeated violations show a lack of military control over KBR,\" just like the lack of control in\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari IV\n   </em>\n   . Appellant Br. 39-40. We reject this argument on both fronts. Factually, the district court found the allegations that KBR burned hazardous material \"vague [and] non-specific\" and insufficient to \"negate the conclusion that the military retained control.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266005\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/778/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We find no clear error in that finding. And legally, a few instances of non-specific allegations do not amount to the type of systematic failure of oversight and lack of command presence found in\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari IV\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari IV\n   </em>\n   , there were extensive findings of systematic violations at Abu Ghraib by the Executive Branch. Here, the Servicemembers make only vague allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that the first\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factor is satisfied. The military's control over KBR was plenary and actual, making KBR's decisions pertaining to waste management and water services \"de facto military decisions\" unreviewable by this Court.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p408\">\n    658 F.3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we agree with the district court that the political question doctrine bars the Servicemembers' suit. Because the first\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factor requires dismissal, we need not discuss the second\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factor and decline to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120402\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/326/\">\n    744 F.3d at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because this case is nonjusticiable under the first\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factor, we believe that the proper disposition is to affirm the dismissal and to vacate the portion of the district court's opinion discussing the FTCA issue. The FTCA waives the United States' sovereign immunity in certain tort cases.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202674\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But under the FTCA's combatant activities exception, the United States remains immune from \"[a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j). As relevant here, the combatant activities exception preempts state tort claims against contractors if \"a private service contractor is integrated into combatant activities over which the military retains command authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Burn Pit III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120402\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/326/\">\n    744 F.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Saleh v.

Cir. 2009) ). Below, the district court concluded that KBR's activities were integrated into the military's combatant activities. Therefore, the district court held that the FTCA's combatant activities exception preempted the Servicemembers' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p408\">\n    658 F.3d at 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"because we agree with the district court that the political question doctrine applies here, the second appellate issue-whether [the Servicemembers' claims are] preempted by the FTCA's combat[ant] activities exception-is rendered moot.\" We decline to review the district court's analysis of the FTCA issue, because the result \"would be little more than an advisory opinion ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mindful of our duty to decide only cases and controversies, we will not \"stray into the practice of advisory opinion-making, solving questions that do not actually require answering in order to resolve the matters before [us].\"\n   <em>\n    Karsten v.

In the Servicemembers' view, because the language of LOGCAP III and the contract in\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    is identical, the military's control over KBR in this case would similarly not be plenary. We reject this argument.

As such, they cannot prevail under clear error review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
