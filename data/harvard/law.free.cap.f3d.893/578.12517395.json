Massive Lake Lahontan spread from the Sierra Nevada to the Carson Sink, the Black Rock Desert, and as far as California and Oregon. \"The world,\" they said, \"was all water.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lake Lahontan has slowly vanished over the years, and now survives only in the form of a few desert lakes, including the subject of this case, Walker Lake, the terminus of the Walker River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Walker Lake has suffered since the 1860s, when the River's waters were first diverted for agriculture, and the Lake's volume has plummeted precipitously in recent years. In response, federal, state, tribal, local, and private organizations and\n   authorities have banded together to save the Lake. The federal program at issue in this case is a voluntary water rights leasing program managed by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (\"NFWF\") to convey water from Walker River downstream to the Lake as part of the federal Walker Basin Restoration Program. Like duck stamps and emissions markets, NFWF's program proposes to employ free market forces to restore a natural balance between the competing demands of agriculture and conservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Nevada State Engineer and the California State Water Resources Control Board approved change applications for NFWF's program over the objections of farmers (\"the Farmers\") who claim injury to their water rights. The Farmers brought their complaints to the district court which, as the Decree court, has maintained in rem jurisdiction over the waters of Walker River since 1902 in accordance with the Walker River Decree of 1936. The Decree court rejected the state agency rulings, and found that the program, as proposed, would injure the Farmers' water rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We examine two questions. First, did the Decree court properly reject the state agency rulings-that NFWF's program would not cause any cognizable injury to the Farmers' water rights-based on its de novo review of the Walker River Decree? Second, does the export restriction of the Walker River Decree prohibit delivering water to Walker Lake because it is \"outside of\" the Walker River Basin? We answer both questions in the negative, reverse the judgment of the Decree court, and remand for approval of the change applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The River and the Lake\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Walker River consists of two forks that begin in California and end in Nevada. The West Walker River springs from the Emigrant Wilderness of Stanislaus National Forest, and flows through Topaz Lake and north into Nevada's Smith and Mason Valleys. The East Walker River springs from the Hoover Wilderness, passes through Bridgeport Reservoir and into Nevada east of the Wovoka Wilderness and Bald Mountain, before streaming into Mason Valley. The forks join by Yerington and flow north to Wabuska, before turning southeasterly through the land of the Walker River Paiute Tribe (\"the Tribe\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Walker River Irrigation Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902523\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/11/158/#p161\">\n    11 F.Supp. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161 (D. Nev. 1935). From there, the River flows through Weber Reservoir and Schurz, and into Walker Lake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 160-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Walker Lake is about 13 miles long by 5 miles wide, tucked against the east side of the Wassuk Range in Mineral County, Nevada. It is one of the last few puddle remnants of ancient Lake Lahontan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For centuries, the Lake served an important ecological role as fishery for the native Lahontan Cutthroat Trout-the state fish of Nevada-and as home and resting grounds for hundreds of species, including fish, insects, migratory birds, and wild\n   horses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Human life at the Lake is quite ancient as well, dating back to the spearheads in Mastodon bones and the petroglyphs carved by the Lake's northern shores.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   By the early 1860s, miners looked to the mountains of the Walker River Basin, seeking the same silver bonanzas unearthed in the Comstock Lode near Lake Tahoe. Following expanded mining operations, innovators in irrigation technology arrived to make the desert bloom. They succeeded. The Smith and Mason Valleys soon became the picturesque and fertile agricultural region they are today. More than half of the valley farmland is dedicated to alfalfa, Nevada's cash crop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As agriculture boomed, water flows to Walker Lake diminished.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DRI Report,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 3, at 7. Between 1882 and 2007, the Lake's volume plummeted from nine million to two million acre feet and its salinity rose from 2,500 mg/L total dissolved solids (TDS) to 16,000 mg/L TDS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just a few years later in 2013, salinity exceeded 20,000 mg/L TDS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lahontan cutthroat trout die in such a saline environment; they and many other Lake residents have vanished. With the death of its aquatic life, migratory birds have begun to abandon the Lake. Even the midges, side swimmers, and damselflies have disappeared from the Lake on a search for a more hospitable habitat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A scum now lines the Lake's receding shores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Decree and River Administration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The action before us was filed in 1924, but traces its history even further back, to 1902, when two cattle kings realized that the Walker River Basin wasn't big enough for the two of them. Miller &amp; Lux, the sprawling ranching enterprise owned by Henry Miller, the \"Cattle King of California,\" filed a quiet title action in Nevada district court against 150 defendants, including arch-rival Rickey Land &amp; Cattle Co. owned by Thomas Rickey, the \"Cattle King of the West.\" Miller &amp; Lux sought a declaration of appropriative water rights to a flow of 943.29 cubic-feet per second (cfs) of the Walker River for use on its Nevada lands.\n   <em>\n    Miller &amp; Lux v. Rickey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3846353\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/127/573/#p575\">\n    127 F. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575-76 (C.C.D. Nev. 1902). Rickey in turn sued Miller in California state court, seeking his own appropriative rights to a flow of 2,079 cfs for use on his California lands. For years the parties disputed the Nevada district court's jurisdiction over California water rights, pleading deficiencies,\n   and application of the now-extinct local action doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Nevada district court granted an antisuit injunction in Miller's favor, and we affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Rickey Land &amp; Cattle Co. v. Miller &amp; Lux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6747284\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/152/11/#p22\">\n    152 F. 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (9th Cir. 1907). Because any given usufructory right to a flow has an inherent connection to all other such rights in the same stream, appropriative rights are conclusively established only by reference to all other competing rights. We held that this naturally requires exclusive jurisdiction over the entire res of the Walker River.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6747284\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/152/11/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6747284\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/152/11/#p22\">\n    at 14-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Article II recognizes in their entirety the rights established in the 1919 Rickey Decree. Articles III-VII and IX provide for the flow and storage rights of new private parties. Article VIII recognizes WRID's storage rights in the Topaz and Bridgeport reservoirs with respective priority dates of 1919 and 1921, and the attendant authority to distribute the water stored there. Article X permits rightsholders to change the manner, means, place or purpose of use, or the point of diversion in the manner provided by law \"so far as they may do so without injury to the rights of other parties hereto, as the same are fixed hereby.\" Articles XI-XII provide that no party may relitigate a claim to water rights in the Walker River Basin, in the Nevada District Court or any other court, that was litigated in the original case as of April 14, 1936. Article XIII permits rightsholders to rotate their use of water, i.e., collectively or individually rotate water usage for improved efficiency, so long as no other rights are thereby injured. Article XIV establishes the district court's continued jurisdiction \"for the purpose of changing the duty of water or for correcting or modifying this decree; also for regulatory purposes, including a change of the place of use of any water user,\" but stipulates that \"no water shall be sold or delivered outside of the basin of the Walker River ....\" Article XV permits the Decree court to designate a water master, which it did in 1937 by creating the U.S. Board of Water Commissioners (\"the Water Commissioners\")-a six-member board overseen by a Water Master who apportions and distributes the River's waters. Finally, Article XVI sets the irrigation season, which is today set at March 1 to October 31. By establishing its continued jurisdiction over the action and the river, the district court became the \"Decree court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Walker Basin Restoration Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In 2002, Congress began to allocate funds for desert terminal lake conservation. In 2009, it established the Walker Basin Restoration Program \"for the primary purpose of restoring and maintaining Walker Lake.\" Pub. L. No. 111-85, \u00a7\u00a7 207-08,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Stat.%202845\">\n    123 Stat. 2845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2858-60 (2009); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3839bb-6. The Program is designed as a voluntary water rights acquisition, trading, and leasing scheme to be jointly administered by NFWF and WRID. Under the program, NFWF leases or purchases flow and storage rights from willing sellers, and uses those rights to convey water downstream to feed the Lake. NFWF negotiated the program details with the Tribe and WRID. WRID thereafter adopted a regulation permitting rightsholders along the River to participate in the program by leasing their claims for instream use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   NFWF purchased a number of claims with priority dates from 1874 to 1906, which cumulatively provide for 7.745 cfs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an effort to avoid injury to other rightsholders, NFWF entered into stipulations with WRID, Lyon County, the Tribe, the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs, and several private rightsholders. Per these stipulations, NFWF agreed that program water would be limited to the consumptive use portion of its decreed claims: 4.122 cfs out of 7.745 cfs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The consumptive use portion of a water right reflects the amount of water that is actually used and consumed by agriculture. When an upstream user appropriates water for irrigation, some portion of the water-the non-consumptive use portion-is not consumed by the crop and returns as runoff to the river, and for another rightsholder's use downstream. For example, if Farmer A calls for a constant flow of 10 cfs, some variable non-consumptive portion returns to the river, say 4 cfs; the difference (6 cfs) is Farmer A's consumptive use portion. The 4 cfs that returns to the river is then available for Farmer B's use. Effectively, Farmer A has the right to call for 10 cfs, but is consuming only 6 cfs. The consumptive and non-consumptive use portions of any given water right will vary depending on crop type, volume of irrigation water, and environmental factors. In this example, if Farmer A seeks to change the claim's use by removing the entirety of the 10 cfs from the river, Farmer B's right is injured through deprivation of the nonconsumptive 4 cfs runoff. Determining whether a change to Farmer A's use will injure Farmer B's right thus requires determining how the change will affect the disposition of the non-consumptive portion of Farmer A's water right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, NFWF acquired the rights to call for 7.745 cfs. NFWF's hydrologists calculated a historic consumptive use portion at a flow rate of 4.122 cfs. The difference, 3.623 cfs, is the river runoff that was historically available to downstream rightsholders. So as not to injure these downstream claims, NFWF stipulated that it would call for program water only in the flow amount of 4.122 cfs over the course of the irrigation season, that is, approximately 53 percent of its total appropriative rights to 7.745 cfs. NFWF further stipulated that the non-consumptive use portion of its claims-a flow of 3.623 cfs-would be administered by the Water Commissioners \"in [their] discretion ... to avoid conflict with and injury to existing water rights ... and to mitigate hydrologic system losses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    State Agency Rulings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Under Article X of the Decree, as well as the 1953 Rules and Regulations and the\n   1996 Administrative Rules and Regulations, both of which were approved by the Decree court, change applications-meaning any proposed changes in purpose or place of use-must first be presented to the state agencies for their approval.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applicants with Nevada water rights submit applications with the Nevada State Engineer, and applicants with California water rights submit applications to the California State Water Resources Control Board (\"the California Control Board\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   1. The Nevada Ruling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In 2011, NFWF applied with the Nevada State Engineer for approval of two changes to its claims to a cumulative 7.745 cfs. First, NFWF requested changing the place of use to \"within the Walker River from the Weir Diversion Structure through the USGS Wabuska Gauge, then through Weber Reservoir into and including Walker Lake.\" The previous rightsholders had diverted the flow from the Weir Diversion Structure into the West Hyland Ditch, downstream from Yerington. Second, NFWF requested changing the purpose of use from irrigation to wildlife purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NEV. REV. STAT. \u00a7 533.023. Effectively, NFWF sought approval not to remove the water obtained through exercise of its water rights, so that water acquired from prior rightsholders may flow, as it naturally would, into Walker Lake. Appropriative rights in Nevada may be applied for a beneficial use instream, regardless of whether the water flows to areas not owned by the rightsholder. NEV. REV. STAT. \u00a7 533.040(2) ;\n   <em>\n    State Bd. of Agric. v. Morros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558438\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/104/709/#p766\">\n    104 Nev. 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558438\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/104/709/#p766\">\n    766 P.2d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Water Commissioners and a group of private parties (\"the Farmers\") objected to both change applications. The objecting Farmers hold so-called New Land Stored Water Rights. That is, they operate farms on acres lacking associated decreed claims, and instead have contractual arrangements with WRID. They pay assessments to WRID, which provides them with surplus reservoir water from Topaz and Bridgeport. In other words, these are nondecreed rights to reservoir water, not appropriative flow or storage rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Water Commissioners and Farmers pressed two arguments. First, they argued that the changes would impermissibly injure their New Land Stored Water Rights. NFWF expects to call continuously for water during the irrigation season when in priority, whereas the farmers who previously owned the claims would on certain days occasionally not call for water, such as on harvesting days, which permitted the flow claims to be redirected by the Water Master for reservoir storage. As such, the Farmers argued that a continuous call would impermissibly injure their rights,\n   because it would ultimately decrease the amount of reservoir water later available to meet their irrigation needs. Second, they argued that Walker Lake lies outside of the Walker River Basin. Thus, directing water to the Lake would violate Article XIV of the Decree: \"[N]o water shall be sold or delivered outside of the basin of the Walker River.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Nevada State Engineer, following public hearings, rejected both arguments and granted NFWF's application. With respect to the question of injury, the Nevada State Engineer found that under NFWF's consumptive use stipulation, no party would suffer injury. The State Engineer considered NFWF in the position of \"an irrigator who has a decreed right to call for water on March 1st for the duration of the irrigation season,\" and \"as the holder of claims senior in priority to new lands storage rights, [NFWF] has the right to seek a change in the manner and place of use.\" The State Engineer rejected any possibility that injury could occur under NFWF's stipulations, because it had dedicated the nonconsumptive portion of its decreed rights to the Water Commissioners to remedy any injury or hydrological efficiency loss caused by a continuous call of the consumptive use portion of its decreed appropriative rights. The State Engineer's ruling adopted and incorporated the consumptive use stipulations in their entirety. Finally, the Engineer concluded that \"Walker Lake is included in the Walker River basin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   2. The California Ruling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Likewise, WRID applied to the California Control Board to temporarily change the place and purpose of use of its decreed storage rights for Topaz and Bridgeport. This change would allow WRID to distribute 25,000 acre-feet of stored water per season to Walker Lake to meet the in-stream water calls made by rightsholders within WRID who participate in the program. The temporary changes were intended to give WRID the time and flexibility to run the program for a trial season while preparing its application for permanent changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The California Control Board reviewed WRID's temporary one-year change application under California Water Code \u00a7 1727. As relevant here, a party applying for a temporary change must show that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   [t]he proposed temporary change would not injure any legal user of the water, during any potential hydrologic condition that the board determines is likely to occur during the proposed change, through significant changes in water quantity, water quality, timing of diversion or use, consumptive use of the water, or reduction in return flows.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   CAL. WATER CODE \u00a7 1727(b).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   CAL. WATER CODE \u00a7 1707(b)(2) (changes may not \"unreasonably affect any legal user of water\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The California Control Board overruled the objections of the Water Commissioners and the Farmers. It found that WRID had carried its burden because \"petitioners do not request any changes in the diversion of water to storage; instead they only request changes in the place and purpose of use upon release from storage.\" By contrast, the Water Commissioners and Farmers had failed to demonstrate \"any right, under contract or otherwise, to the stored water that will be injured by the proposed temporary change.\" As the California Control Board explained, under California law, changes to the purpose or place for which WRID releases reservoir water under its control cannot give rise to an injury, because WRID-not the Farmers-holds the statutory and decreed right to distribute this water to legal appropriative users.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens v. Oakdale Irrigation Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1451419\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/13/343/\">\n    13 Cal.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20P.2d%2058\">\n    90 P.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60-61 (1939) (noting that a downstream user has no right to a continued release of artificial flow). Accordingly, the California Control Board concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   It is not enough for a water user to show that it will receive less water as a result of the change. Instead, a water user claiming injury must demonstrate that it has a right to the greater amount of water claimed and that the proposed change will interfere with that right. ... None of the commenters have demonstrated any right, under contract or otherwise, to the stored water that will be injured by the proposed temporary change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Like the Nevada State Engineer, the California Control Board rejected the argument that Walker Lake is not part of the Walker River Basin, noting that the Lake sits within the same hydrological drainage basin as the River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On motion for reconsideration, the California Control Board affirmed its decision with an amendment noting that \"a stored water transfer ... is not limited to the consumptive use portion of the water right,\" because \"a downstream water user who does not have a right to stored water cannot be injured by changes in releases of the stored water.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAL. WATER CODE \u00a7 1725 (permitting transfers of amounts that have been \"consumptively used or stored\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Decree Court Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Decree court rejected the Nevada State Engineer's and California Control Board's rulings, refused to grant the change applications, and remanded to the state agencies. First, the court found that the stipulated program water quantity would injure New Land Stored Water Rights, because NFWF would not mimic the historical consumptive use watering patterns of prior users who had occasionally suspended calls for water on harvesting days. The court reasoned that even if NFWF was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   limited to the historical use amount at any given time, it is likely to call for that amount on every day during the irrigation season, whereas its predecessors-in-interest did not in practice call for water during harvests and certain other periods, so the overall effect of the change will likely be to reduce the amount of water available for storage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Decree court found that, although NFWF had properly limited program water to the consumptive use portion of its flow on a\n   <em>\n    per second\n   </em>\n   basis, NFWF would continuously call for its claims to be serviced, and thus would consume more water\n   <em>\n    per season\n   </em>\n   as compared to its predecessors-in-interest. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A limit on the rate of consumption per second during days of use does not suffice to satisfy the no injury rule if the total amount of consumption per year is nevertheless increased. Where NFWF will in practice consume water at the same rate as its predecessors-in-interest but on more days throughout the year, its greater number of days of consumption per year could result in increased consumption per year (and therefore less available storage water available for junior users).... [T]he no injury rule prohibits NFWF from consuming more water per second\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   per year than its predecessors-in-interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The court remanded to the Nevada State Engineer to determine the average number of days per year that each of NFWF's predecessors-in-interest historically called on their respective claims and to limit approval of the change application accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As to the California Control Board's ruling concerning changes to WRID's storage\n   rights, the Decree court found that changes to such rights must also be limited to the consumptive use portion of the rights. In this regard, the court held that the Farmers' rights are injured where a change application effectively reduces the amount of stored water available to the users of those stored water rights. The California Control Board had determined that because the amount of storage water in the change would be limited to water that would have otherwise been consumed or stored by WRID, no injury would occur. The Decree court rejected this finding, and remanded for the same historical consumptive use calculations it had required with regard to the Nevada State Engineer's ruling. Specifically, the Decree court set out a four-part procedure requiring the California Control Board to: (1) identify each separate \"piece\" of program water temporarily sold to WRID; (2) multiply those pieces by the respective portions of those pieces historically attributable to consumptive use; (3) calculate the sum of the consumptive use pieces; and (4) limit the change applications accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Decree court also rejected both the Nevada and California change applications on the grounds that in-stream delivery of program water to Walker Lake would violate the Decree's export restriction, which prohibits delivering water \"outside of the basin of the Walker River.\" The court found that the \"basin\" comprises only agricultural lands and waters named in the Decree. The court concluded, however, that despite this, NFWF could still effectively send water to the Lake by simply sending it to the most terminal point of the River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   These appeals followed.

In reviewing change applications to water rights, the Decree court's activities are primarily legal-the evidence and facts underlying the change applications are elicited and marshaled in proceedings before the respective state agencies.

WRID's storage rights did not arise until the construction of the reservoirs in 1919 and 1921, and thus the California Control Board had authority to rule on WRID's change applications. Here, the Board issued its Order and Modified Order in its role as state agency and submitted a report to the Decree court in its role as Special Master. Insofar as the California Control Board exercised lawful agency authority under California law in adjudicating change applications to WRID's post-1914 water rights, the Decree court should have afforded the Board the same degree of deference that California courts do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Appellants claim two errors. First, they argue that NFWF's promise to limit its in-stream use to the historic consumptive use portion of its claims precludes any possibility of injury to other rightsholders. Second, they argue that the court erred by interpreting the Decree's export restriction as a prohibition on delivering water to the Lake. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Article X of the Decree states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Any of the said parties shall be entitled to change the manner, means, place or purpose of use or the point of diversion of the said waters or any thereof in the manner provided by law, so far as they may do so without injury to the rights of other parties hereto, as the same are fixed hereby.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   This \"no-injury\" provision in the Decree recognizes the duty of each appropriator to manage its water use so as to avoid injury to other appropriators, including junior appropriators. The Nevada State Engineer and the California Control Board both concluded that because NFWF agreed to limit program water to the consumptive use portion of the claims, there is no material change in its usage and no other rightsholders will be injured. The Decree court rejected this conclusion. We conclude that the Decree court failed to defer to the findings and conclusions of the state agencies. To the extent the Decree court entered its own findings, we conclude that those findings are clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   1. Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Almost all states employ one of three water rights regimes: a regime of\n   riparian rights common in the East, a regime of rights acquired by prior appropriation common in the West, or a hybrid system such as in California. While riparian rights inhere in the land appurtenant to the waterway, vary in quantity based on flow, remain vested even if unused, and are subject to reasonable use, appropriative rights are untethered from land ownership, are acquired and maintained by active beneficial diversion of water, provide for a fixed flow of water, and are tiered as senior and junior rights based on chronological claim priority. As the Supreme Court explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   The right to water by prior appropriation ... is limited in every case, in quantity and quality, by the uses for which the appropriation is made. ... The appropriation does not confer such an absolute right to the body of the water diverted that the owner can allow it, after its diversion, to run to waste and prevent others from using it for mining or other legitimate purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   What diminution of quantity ... will constitute an invasion of the rights of the first appropriator will depend upon the special circumstances of each case, considered with reference to the uses to which the water is applied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Atchison v.

Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   When NFWF acquired decreed appropriative rights with priorities from 1874 to 1906, it acquired the right to a flow of 7.745 cfs. But NFWF's prior appropriators did not consume all 7.745 cfs. Their consumptive use was only 4.122 cfs, the remaining 3.623 cfs finding its way back to the Walker River as runoff. NFWF agreed, consistent with the historic use of the prior rightsholders, to divide its right into a consumptive use portion of 4.122 cfs to be used as program water, and the remaining non-consumptive use portion of 3.623 cfs to be used to mitigate hydrological system loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Nevada State Engineer and the California Control Board approved NFWF's and WRID's proposed change applications, but the Decree court refused to approve the changes. According to the court, NFWF's changes would \"injure other users with decreed rights.\" The court acknowledged that NFWF would take only \"the former consumptive use amount,\" but found that NFWF was \"likely to call for that amount on every day during the irrigation season, whereas its predecessors-in-interest did not in practice call for water during harvests and certain other periods.\" Specifically, the court was referring to the historical harvest days identified in the evidence submitted to the Nevada State Engineer, indicating a total of four alfalfa harvest days in the Mason Valley beginning around June 3 each year. In the Decree court's view, because \"the no injury rule prohibits NFWF from consuming more water per second\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   per year than its predecessors-in-interest did,\" \"the overall effect of the change will likely be to reduce the amount of water available for storage.\" The Decree court was concerned that, although NFWF's\n   <em>\n    flow rate\n   </em>\n   was consistent with historic usage, the\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   amount of water to be taken by NFWF would exceed the water historically called for by its predecessors-in-interest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   The Court finds that under the no injury rule, the changes must be limited not only to the prior consumptive use per second, but also to the prior total amount of consumptive use per year. A limit on the rate of consumption per second during days of use does not suffice\n   to satisfy the no injury rule if the total amount of consumption per year is nevertheless increased. Where NFWF will in practice consume water at the same rate as its predecessors-in-interest but on more days throughout the years, its greater number of days of consumption per year results in increased consumption per year (and therefore less available storage water available for junior users).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Water can be calculated as a flow or as a volume. Appropriative flow rights under the Decree are calculated in cubic-feet per second (cfs), while annual consumptive use is calculated as a volume in acre-feet per acre per irrigation season (afa).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BECK &amp; KELLEY , 1-1 WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS \u00a7 1.02 (2017). The Net Irrigation Water Requirement (NIWR) of alfalfa in the Mason Valley is 3.1 afa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.L. Huntington &amp; R.G. Allen, Nevada Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources, EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND NET IRRIGATION WATER REQUIREMENTS FOR NEVADA 215 (2010) (\"NIWR Report\"). The NIWR is synonymous with consumptive use per year. This figure means that over the course of an irrigation season, one acre of alfalfa in the Mason Valley will consume 3.1 acre-feet of irrigation water-anything beyond that is runoff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   NFWF's stipulations contained three provisions pertinent here. First, NFWF stipulated to an annual consumptive use volume of 3.1 acre-feet of water per acre (afa), which is the total consumptive requirement for an acre of alfalfa, the crop grown by NFWF's predecessors-in-interest. Second, out of NFWF's total rights to 7.745 cfs, only 4.122 cfs-the consumptive use portion of the flow-would be used as program water. Third, the remaining portion of its rights-the non-consumptive use portion of 3.623 cfs-would be at the Water Commissioners' disposal to mitigate any possible injury to other water rights, including the storage rights belonging to WRID.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Nevada State Engineer received testimony on the consumptive use as measured per second (cfs) and annually (afa). And, specifically, that testimony addressed whether NFWF's proposed use accounted for the harvest days of its predecessors-in-interest. The Nevada State Engineer credited the testimony of hydrologist Dr. Greg Pohll, who stated that the 3.1 afa in the NIWR included both \"variable start dates for irrigation in Mason and Smith Valleys, and individual simulated cuttings as part of the calculations.\" Similarly, the Engineer heard from David Yardis, Director of the Walker Basin Restoration Program, who \"reiterated Dr. Pohll's testimony that the consumption figures of 3.10 acre-feet per acre accounted for variable weather situations, [evapotranspiration], and regular cuttings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Nevada State Engineer\n   found that \"Dr. Pohll's interpretation of the methodology of the NIWR is correct, and that the NIWR consumptive use figure of 3.10 acre-feet per acre in the Walker River Basin for alfalfa takes into account a variable irrigation start date and multiple simulated cuttings during the irrigation season.\" The Nevada State Engineer found that the Commissioners' and the Farmers' arguments \"concerning impacts to new land storage rights are addressed within the calculation of the 3.10 acre-feet per acre consumptive use amount.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Decree court failed to defer to the findings of the Nevada Engineer, whose findings are presumed correct. NEV. REV. STAT. \u00a7 533.450(9)-(10) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alpine Land &amp; Reservoir Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7817515\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/919/1470/#p1474\">\n    919 F.Supp. 1470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1474 (D.Nev. 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558406\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/699/\">\n    819 P.2d at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once we consider the record before the Nevada State Engineer, the Decree court's concerns are unfounded, and the Nevada State Engineer properly found that \"a transfer [to NFWF] limited to the consumption portion ... would avoid conflict and injury to other existing water rights.\" Because these findings are supported by substantial evidence and the State Engineer applied the correct legal rule, the Engineer's conclusions are entitled to deference. It was error for the Decree court to reject those conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   To the extent the Decree court made its own findings of fact, those findings are clearly erroneous. The Decree court found that there was a difference between NFWF's proposed per second consumption rate (cfs) and its annual consumptive volume (afa). The Nevada State Engineer concluded there was not, and the math bears this out. NFWF's stipulated flow of 4.122 cfs, if called for continuously over the irrigation season, does not exceed the annual consumptive use volume of 3.1 afa. They are identical. We convert the stipulated flow and consumptive use volume into total acre-feet of water per irrigation season, and compare. To determine the total volume of water delivered to Walker Lake if the stipulated cfs is continuously called for, we multiply the stipulated flow (4.122 cfs) by seconds in a day (86,400 s), and then by days in the irrigation season (245 d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   which produces 87,254,496 cubic-feet or 2,003.091 acre-feet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   To determine the total volume of irrigated water previously consumed per irrigation season in acre-feet, we multiply the total acreage of farmland whose decreed claims NFWF acquired (646.160 acres), by the consumptive use by each acre (3.1 afa). That produces a volume of 2,003.096 acre-feet of water. If NFWF were to call for a continuous flow of its maximum diversion rate of 4.122 cfs during the entire irrigation season, the total amount of program water will be 0.005 acre-feet less than that consumptively used by its predecessors-in-interest, which appears to be a rounding error. Whether we calculate the program water as a rate (cfs) or as a volume (afa), the quantities are the same. The Decree court erred when it concluded that the Nevada State Engineer had not accounted for the harvest days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Decree court's rejection of the California Control Board's ruling was also error. WRID holds combined licenses to store between 71,310 and 76,060 acre-feet of water annually. It requested permission to use up to 25,000 acre-feet of water stored at the Bridgeport and Topaz Reservoirs for in-stream use at Walker Lake. The California Control Board approved the temporary permit, finding that the amount of storage water in the transfer would be limited to water that would otherwise be consumed or stored by WRID, and thus no injury would occur. The Board found that the Farmers objecting to WRID's proposed change did not have \"any right under contract or otherwise, to the stored water,\" and thus could not be injured by the proposed change in use. According to the Board, stored water is considered an artificial flow, and a downstream user has no right to the discharge of stored water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Decree court rejected the Board's conclusions and substituted its own conclusion that WRID's temporary permit to release stored water would injure \"junior storage right[s]\" because WRID was \"reduc[ing] stored water that would otherwise be available to a user with storage rights.\" The court concluded that WRID's proposal thus ran afoul of the \"no injury rule.\" The court's reliance on injury to \"junior storage right holders\" is misplaced, both as a matter of the Decree and California law. The Decree's \"no injury\" rule refers to \"injury to the\n   <em>\n    rights\n   </em>\n   of other parties hereto, as the same are fixed thereby.\" Art. X (emphasis added). The no injury rule does not extend to persons who do not have decreed rights. Under Section VIII of the Decree, WRID is declared to be \"the owner of the flow and use of the flood waters of East Walker River and its tributaries for storage in Bridgeport Reservoir\"; it likewise is the owner of the flood waters of the West Walker River for storage in the Topaz Reservoir. Any permits issued to WRID by the California Control Board are \"subject to vested prior rights\" and stored water must be distributed \"to the lands in the District entitled thereto, in accordance with their respective rights.\" Accordingly, the Decree gives WRID distribution rights over the stored water, which it must exercise consistent with the Decree and Nevada law. The Decree recognizes appropriative and storage rights in numerous private parties throughout the Walker River Basin, but it gives WRID alone the right to store and distribute the waters of Topaz and Bridgeport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   California's no injury rule is codified in various sections of California's Water Code, each of which prohibits injury to a \"\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   user of water.\" CAL.

Insofar as the Farmers complaining here hold no decreed rights to the waters WRID is storing, they cannot claim any legal injury caused by changes to how and where WRID distributes flow to the rightsholders of decreed, appropriative rights. As the California Control Board explained, \"[i]t is not enough for a water user to show that it will receive less water as a result of the change. Instead, a water use claiming injury must demonstrate that it has a right to the greater amount of water claimed and that the proposed change will interfere with that right.\" The Control Board found that \"[n]one of the [objectors] have demonstrated any right, under contract or otherwise, to the stored water that will be injured by the proposed temporary change,\" and that the \"[l]andowners in [WRID] will continue to be allocated their portion of the stored water.\" It thus concluded that \"[o]nce the water is diverted to storage in a manner consistent with water right priorities, water stored in Topaz and Bridgeport Reservoirs is previously stored water to which the [objectors] have not demonstrated any legal interest.\" In sum, the Control Board found that the proposed changes \"would not injure any legal use of the water.\" That finding is consistent with the Decree and in accord with California law, and it was error for the Decree court to refuse to approve the California Control Board's Report approving WRID's change application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Basin\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Under Article XIV of the Decree, \"no water shall be sold or delivered outside of the basin of the Walker River.\" The Water Commissioners argue, and the Decree court held, that delivering river water to Walker Lake would violate this export restriction, because the Lake is \"outside of the basin of the Walker River.\" The court's interpretation rested on several grounds: that there are no decreed rights to appropriate water from the Lake; that the Decree does not mention the Lake, but rather mentions other lakes as tributaries to the River; and that the Decree concerns appropriative rights only to the River and its tributaries, but not the Lake. On this basis the court held that \"basin,\" as used in the export restriction, unambiguously refers only to those agricultural lands that beneficially use the River's waters and those waters that are mentioned by name in the Decree, but not the Lake itself.

The Decree court itself used the term \"basin\" according to this plain hydrological and geographic meaning, when it opened its Order by observing that the Walker River Basin is approximately 4,050 square miles \"from its origins in the southwestern elevations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains to its terminus, Walker Lake.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Even if the term \"basin\" were ambiguous, interested extrinsic sources support the interpretation urged by NFWF and found by the Nevada State Engineer and the California Control Board. The State of Nevada refers to the Walker River Basin, including Walker Lake, as \"Hydrographic Region No. 9.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The USGS calls it \"Accounting Unit 160503,\" composed of hydrological sub-units East Walker, West Walker, Walker, and Walker Lake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the USGS's Nevada Water Science Center places the Lake at \"the lowest point in the basin.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the Nevada Supreme Court views the Lake as part of the Walker River system and subject to the Decree court's jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Decree court itself once noted that the Basin includes \"sub-basin[ ] ... 110B,\" which the State of Nevada titled the \"Lake Subarea.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress understood no differently when it enacted the legislation to save Walker Lake under the aptly titled Walker Basin Restoration Program.

The Decree's export restriction is not structured as an inclusionary list of those places to which water may be sent. That Walker Lake itself-an obvious and dominant physical feature in the Basin-was not mentioned by the court or counsel means little in light of the Decree's text and purpose. The Commissioners' interpretation flies in the face of history and logic and that ancient and simple maxim\n   <em>\n    aqua currit et debet currere ut currere solebat ex jure naturae\n   </em>\n   : water runs and ought to run as it is accustomed to run, according to the law of\n   nature.\n   <em>\n    Wholey v.
