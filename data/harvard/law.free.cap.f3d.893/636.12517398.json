Plaintiff-Appellant Nu Image, Inc., brought suit in federal district court under section 301(a) against Defendant-Appellee International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada, AFL-CIO (\"IATSE\"). Nu Image claimed that IATSE engaged in intentional and negligent misrepresentation to induce Nu Image to enter into a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") and sought a declaratory judgment that part of the CBA was invalid. The district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that section 301(a) grants jurisdiction only for suits that claim a violation of a CBA, which Nu Image did not do.\n   <em>\n    Nu Image, Inc. v.

These CBAs governed their relationship on a per-motion-picture basis. After 2006, Nu Image and IATSE entered into negotiations for an \"Overall CBA\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   that would govern all motion picture productions. The Overall CBA required Nu Image to make residual contributions to the Motion Picture Industry Health and Pension Plans (the \"Plans\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During negotiations for the Overall CBA, Nu Image alleges that it told IATSE \"it would not agree to an Overall CBA if it were required to remit Residual Contribution payments to the Plans.\" 3 ER 318. Nu Image claims that IATSE orally represented that neither IATSE nor the Plans would seek contribution. Between 2006 and 2009, Nu Image did not pay into the Plans and neither the Plans nor IATSE took the position that Nu Image was required to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 13, 2013, however, the Plans sued Nu Image for breach of the Overall CBA for failure to pay residual contributions to the Plans from 2006 to 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nu Image informed the Plans of the prior oral agreement between Nu Image and IATSE; however, IATSE denied that any oral agreement occurred. On March 9, 2015, IATSE filed a grievance under the Overall CBA against Nu Image for its failure to pay into the Plans, which IATSE maintained was a \"continuing breach of the parties' [CBA].\" 3 ER 224. Nu Image and IATSE thereafter entered in arbitration. Nu Image soon hired new counsel, put the arbitration on hold, and filed the present suit. Asserting jurisdiction under section 301(a), Nu Image claimed that as a result of IATSE's intentional and negligent misrepresentation, Nu Image incurred and will continue to incur significant costs. Nu Image also claimed that IATSE claimed \"that Nu Image breached the CBA ... by failing to pay Residual Contributions.\" 3 ER 314. Nu Image finally sought declaratory relief requesting \"a judicial determination that the Residual Contribution provisions in the [Overall CBA] do not apply to Nu Image.\" 3 ER 324. IATSE filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction arguing that Nu Image's complaint was not a suit for violation of a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). The district court agreed and dismissed the action. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Nu Image argues that the LMRA grants a district court jurisdiction to hear any case in which a party, or third party, has alleged a violation of a CBA. According to Nu Image, it does not matter whether the plaintiff in a given case specifically alleges a violation of a CBA as an element of its claims. As a result, Nu Image contends that the district court has jurisdiction to hear this case because it arises out of the fact that IATSE accused Nu Image of violating the Overall CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   IATSE, on the other hand, argues that section 301(a) grants jurisdiction to hear only those cases in which the plaintiff alleges a claim based on a violation of a CBA. Because Nu Image does not allege that there has been a violation of the Overall CBA as an element of any of its claims contained in its complaint, IATSE argues that section 301(a) does not provide the district court with subject matter jurisdiction\n   to resolve Nu Image's claims. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 301(a) grants federal courts jurisdiction to hear \"[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

First, in its view, the examples provided in\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   (after invocation of the \"gateway\" metaphor) are all examples of the types of cases that automatically pass through the gateway and by holding otherwise, we are ignoring \"clear guidance\" in the form of Supreme Court dicta. Second, the dissent suggests that Nu Image is without recourse and our result favors\n   IATSE. Neither reason is persuasive. Under the dissent's view, section 301(a) as a jurisdictional grant is limitless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We reject the first reason because the dissent's broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   's gateway language does not make sense in context. Supreme Court dicta should be given \"due deference,\" but it is the Court's holding that is ultimately binding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Montero-Camargo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455871\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/208/1122/\">\n    208 F.3d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132 n.17 (9th Cir. 2000).\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   's very next sentence-\"the federal court's power to adjudicate the contract's validity is ancillary to, and not independent of, its power to adjudicate '[s]uits for violation of contracts' \"-belies any notion that a party may pursue non-contract violation claims without first alleging a violation of contract. Concerning the second reason, Nu Image cannot complain about inequity, having intentionally withdrawn from arbitration to pursue a federal forum. The dissent also gives no reason, and we see none, why Congress cannot create a jurisdictional statute that at times allows one party into federal court but not another. It is not strange at all that Nu Image cannot file in federal court because IATSE\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   file a claim.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franchise Tax Bd. of State of Cal. v.

Any party seeking to invalidate a contract would have a federal forum merely by alleging that another party claimed,\n   <em>\n    in any context\n   </em>\n   , a contract violation. Section 301(a), a limited jurisdictional grant, cannot sweep so broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IATSE also argues that\n   <em>\n    Rozay's Transfer\n   </em>\n   was implicitly overruled by the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Granite Rock Co. v.

(\"Nu Image\") is an independent movie production and marketing company. Defendant-Appellee International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada (\"IATSE\") is a labor union that represents motion picture production crew members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2006, Nu Image and IATSE negotiated a universal CBA to govern their future dealings (the \"Overall CBA\"). The Overall CBA incorporated by reference a form CBA used by IATSE to govern its relationship with a variety of production companies. The form CBA included a provision that required production companies to make \"residual contribution\" payments to certain defined benefit plans (the \"Plans\"). During negotiations, Nu Image claims that it made it clear that it would not enter into the Overall CBA if it were required to make residual contribution payments to\n   the Plans. Nu Image claims that, in response, IATSE represented to Nu Image that neither IATSE nor the Plans would seek residual contribution payments from Nu Image. The parties then entered into the Overall CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For seven years, Nu Image and IATSE operated and worked under the Overall CBA. Nu Image did not make residual contribution payments to the Plans. Neither the Plans nor IATSE requested residual contribution payments. In May 2013, however, the Plans, as beneficiaries to the Overall CBA, sued Nu Image for failure to make the residual contribution payments from 2006 through 2010 (the \"First Plans-Nu Image Lawsuit\"). Nu Image asked IATSE to inform the Plans that Nu Image was not required to make those payments, and to execute a side letter to that effect, but IATSE declined to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   When IATSE refused to execute the requested side letter, Nu Image filed a grievance against IATSE under the Overall CBA alleging that IATSE had fraudulently induced Nu Image to enter into the Overall CBA (the \"Nu Image Grievance\"). Importantly, Nu Image could not raise these arguments in the First Plans-Nu Image Lawsuit because fraud in the inducement of the underlying contract is not a defense in certain ERISA actions, such as the First Plans Nu-Image Lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sw. Administrators, Inc. v. Rozay's Transfer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549911\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/791/769/#p775\">\n    791 F.2d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775 (9th Cir. 1986). As a result, Nu Image's only remedy was to seek indemnification from IATSE against the claims brought by the Plans in the First Plans-Nu Image Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In 2015, while the Nu Image Grievance was pending, Nu Image settled the First Plans-Nu Image Lawsuit with the Plans. But, in the meantime, the Plans sued Nu Image again, this time alleging that Nu Image had failed to make the required residual contribution payments from 2011 through 2014 (the \"Second Plans-Nu Image Lawsuit\"). The Second Plans-Nu Image Lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice to allow the Plans to conduct a further audit of Nu Image.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In March 2015, IATSE submitted a grievance against Nu Image, pursuant to the overall CBA. It claimed that Nu Image breached the overall CBA by failing to make the required residual contribution payments and that Nu Image's failure to make those payments was a \"continuing breach\" of the Overall CBA (the \"IATSE Grievance\"). IATSE sought to recover the difference between the residual contribution payments Nu Image should have made under the Overall CBA and the amount Nu Image had paid to the Plans to settle the First Plans-Nu Image Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nu Image and IATSE moved toward arbitration on both the Nu Image Grievance and the IATSE Grievance. However, Nu Image then retained new counsel, who put the grievance proceedings on hold. Subsequently, Nu Image filed a complaint against IATSE in the District Court for the Central District of California (the \"Complaint\"). The Complaint alleges claims for Intentional Misrepresentation, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Declaratory Relief. In the Complaint, Nu Image seeks a judicial determination that residual contribution provisions of the Overall CBA do not apply to Nu Image and a finding that IATSE must indemnify Nu Image for any damages Nu Image incurs as a result of the Plans' lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Complaint asserted that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to section 301(a) of the LMRA, which allows district courts to hear \"Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . IATSE filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the Complaint was\n   not a suit \"for violation of\" a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). The district court agreed with IATSE and dismissed the Complaint. In response, Nu Image filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This case presents a difficult question, made more difficult by complicated precedent, regarding the scope of the federal court jurisdiction granted by section 301(a) that is complicated by precedent. Nu Image argues that the LMRA grants district courts jurisdiction to hear any case in which a party, or third party, has alleged a violation of a CBA, regardless whether the plaintiff in a given case specifically alleges a violation of a CBA as an element of its claims. IATSE, on the other hand, argues that section 301(a) grants jurisdiction to hear only those cases in which the plaintiff alleges a claim based on a violation of a CBA. Because Nu Image does not allege that there has been a violation by IATSE of the Overall CBA as an element of any of the claims in its Complaint, IATSE argues that section 301(a) does not provide the district court with subject matter jurisdiction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As the majority recognized, we have previously allowed claims substantively identical to Nu Image's to proceed under section 301(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rozay's Transfer v.

Thus if, in the course of deciding whether a plaintiff is entitled to relief for the defendant's alleged violation of a contract, the defendant interposes the affirmative defense that the contract was invalid, the court may, consistent with \u00a7 301(a), adjudicate that defense.\n   <em>\n    Similarly, a declaratory judgment plaintiff accused of violating a collective-bargaining agreement may ask a court to declare the agreement invalid.\n   </em>\n   But in these cases, the federal court's power to adjudicate the contract's validity is ancillary to, and not independent of, its power to adjudicate \"[s]uits for violation of contracts.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504110\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   Court went on to note that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [T]he Union neither allege[d] that Textron has violated the contract,\n   <em>\n    nor [sought] declaratory relief from its own alleged violation\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, as far as the Union's complaint disclose[d], both parties [were] in absolute compliance with the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement. Section 301(a) jurisdiction does not lie over such a case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504110\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   When read in conjunction, these two statements imply that had the union in\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   sought \"declaratory relief from its own alleged violation\" of the CBA, the district court would have had jurisdiction under section 301(a). Because Nu Image seeks precisely that sort of relief in this case, these statements from\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   support the conclusion that the district court had jurisdiction over Nu Image's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The majority makes much of the\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   court's statement regarding the \"gateway\" through which parties must pass into federal court. But the majority's reading of that passage is both strained\n   and inconsistent with other portions of\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   . It is true that section 301(a) creates a \"gateway\" through which parties must pass before a district court may exercise jurisdiction over a claim that a CBA is invalid. But the\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   court provides two examples of cases that have passed through the jurisdictional gateway other than by alleging a violation of a contract as an element of a claim. First, a\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   in a section 301(a) suit who raises the invalidity of the CBA\n   <em>\n    as a defense\n   </em>\n   in a breach of contract action. Second, a\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   who brings a declaratory judgment action seeking relief from the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff's\n   </em>\n   alleged violation\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of a CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   court clearly meant both examples it gave to serve as illustrations of cases\n   <em>\n    where the parties had passed through the gateway\n   </em>\n   erected by section 301(a). That understanding is further confirmed by the\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   court's later statement that the district court lacked jurisdiction, in part, because the union did not seek \"declaratory relief from its own alleged violation\" of the CBA, implying that the district court would have had jurisdiction had the union sought declaratory relief from its alleged violation of the CBA. Seeking declaratory relief from an alleged violation of a CBA is sufficient to pass through section 301(a) 's gateway. If these two examples given by the\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   Court do not provide an illustration of situations in which federal courts have jurisdiction to hear disputes regarding CBAs, in addition to cases in which a plaintiff asserts a breach of contract action, what\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   Court's words mean? The majority opinion elides an answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In this case, because Nu Image seeks relief from its accused violation of the Overall CBA, it has passed through section 301(a) 's \"gateway,\" and its claims should be allowed to proceed in federal court. This result makes sense. After all, a breach of contract claim and a claim seeking declaratory relief from an alleged violation of a contract are flip sides of the same coin. It would be strange indeed if a district court could exercise subject matter jurisdiction over one, but not the other. Instead, the Supreme Court correctly recognized that the power to hear declaratory judgment actions seeking relief from an accused violation of a contract is \"ancillary\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to, or part and parcel with, a court's\n   power to hear the underlying breach of contract action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Aside from its reference to the\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   court's \"gateway,\" the majority provides no support for its decision to discard clear guidance from the Supreme Court. Ignoring the Supreme Court's direction, the majority insists that a violation of the CBA must be \"an element of [Nu Image's] claim,\" a requirement found in neither the statute nor\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   . Such a formalistic approach defies the\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   court's reading of section 301(a) as providing jurisdiction over suits \"filed because a contract has been violated.\" Simply put, a suit seeking declaratory relief from an alleged violation of a contract is a suit filed \"because\" of an accused violation of the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Additionally, the majority's opinion means that parties in Nu Image's position cannot independently choose to present their arguments in a judicial forum. As discussed above, Nu Image could not raise its arguments regarding the validity of the CBA's residual contribution payment provision in the First or Second Plans-Nu Image Lawsuits because our precedent bars such arguments in certain ERISA cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 642-43. Thus, Nu Image was left to pay the Plans and seek compensation from IATSE after the fact. But while the majority's decision means that section 301(a) empowers IATSE to sue Nu Image in federal court for failure to make the residual contribution payments-a right the Plans also have under ERISA-it deprives Nu Image of the opportunity to press its claims or defenses in that same court unless IATSE chooses a judicial forum. This result is not only inefficient, it also gives one party-IATSE, in this case-the power to dictate whether another party-here, Nu Image-can raise its arguments in a judicial forum, or only in the grievance forum, which IATSE now prefers. The majority's opinion fails to justify this strange outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To summarize, an examination of\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   in the context of this case would lead me to two holdings. First, I would hold that\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   has abrogated the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Rozay's Transfer\n   </em>\n   . Not all suits asserting that a CBA is void invoke the district court's jurisdiction pursuant to section 301(a). Second, following\n   <em>\n    Textron\n   </em>\n   's guidance, I would hold that a district court has jurisdiction to hear a declaratory judgment action brought by a plaintiff seeking relief from what a counterparty to the CBA has alleged is a violation of a CBA. Because Nu Image's Complaint seeks just this sort of relief, I would hold the district court had jurisdiction under section 301(a) to hear Nu Image's claims and erred in dismissing those claims for want of subject\n   matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <em>\n     Textron\n    </em>\n    did not directly address our opinion in\n    <em>\n     Rozay's Transfer\n    </em>\n    .

That interpretation is unpersuasive for a number of reasons. First, Justice Scalia did not specifically invoke the doctrine of \"ancillary jurisdiction,\" which allowed federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over certain claims because they were closely related to claims over which the court had subject matter jurisdiction and was ultimately replaced by statute by the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction. More importantly, by the time\n    <em>\n     Textron\n    </em>\n    was decided, the concept of \"ancillary jurisdiction\" had been replaced with \"supplemental jurisdiction,\" which would make a reference to a legal doctrine that was defunct at the time odd at best.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (1990). It would be uncharacteristic of a punctilious wordsmith such as Justice Scalia to use a superseded term, without adding at least an \"obs.\" (for obsolete) after \"ancillary.\" Finally, Justice Scalia's statement regarding declaratory judgment plaintiffs came in the context of his examples of when a court could \"adjudicate the validity of a contract under \u00a7 301(a).\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504110\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/653/\">\n     523 U.S. at 657-58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504110\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/653/\">\n     118 S.Ct. 1626\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This context indicates that these examples, including that of a declaratory judgment plaintiff, are examples where the court has jurisdiction under section 301(a).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 180-82 (2012) (noting that the Harmonious-Reading Canon requires that \"[t]he provisions of a text should be interpreted in a way that renders them compatible, not contradictory\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The majority contends that my reading of\n    <em>\n     Textron\n    </em>\n    would \"expand section 301(a) beyond recognition\" and grant any party access to federal court \"merely by alleging that another party claimed,\n    <em>\n     in any context\n    </em>\n    , a contract violation.\" This characterization ignores\n    <em>\n     Textron\n    </em>\n    's limiting guidance: a suit for violation of a contract is a suit \"filed because a contract has been violated.\" This language demonstrates that there must be some causal link between the alleged contractual violation and the lawsuit. Thus, a plaintiff's mere allegation that another party had alleged a contract violation in a wholly unrelated context would be insufficient to invoke Section 301(a) 's jurisdictional grant. Here, however, Nu Image seeks declaratory relief\n    <em>\n     from the very violation\n    </em>\n    IATSE has alleged.
