After a Virginia jury convicted Lee Boyd Malvo of two counts of capital murder based on homicides that he committed in 2002 when he was 17 years old, it declined to recommend the death penalty, and he was instead sentenced in 2004 to two\n   terms of life imprisonment without parole, in accordance with Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Malvo, again seeking to avoid the death penalty, pleaded guilty in another Virginia jurisdiction to one count of capital murder and one count of attempted capital murder-both of which he also committed when 17 years old-and received two additional terms of life imprisonment without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Malvo was sentenced in those cases, the Supreme Court issued a series of decisions relating to the sentencing of defendants who committed serious crimes when under the age of 18. It held that such defendants cannot be sentenced to death; that they cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole unless they committed a homicide offense that reflected their permanent incorrigibility; and that these rules relating to juvenile sentencing are to be applied retroactively, meaning that sentences that were legal when imposed must be vacated if they were imposed in violation of the Court's new rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roper v.

Accordingly, we affirm the district court's order vacating Malvo's four terms of life imprisonment without parole and remanding for resentencing to determine (1) whether Malvo qualifies as one of the rare juvenile offenders who may, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole because his \"crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility\" or (2) whether those crimes instead \"reflect the transient immaturity of youth,\" in which case he must receive a sentence short of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Over the course of almost seven weeks in the fall of 2002, Lee Malvo and John Muhammad-better known as the \"D.C.

On September 21, Muhammad used a high-powered, long-range Bushmaster assault rifle to shoot two women who had just closed a liquor store in Montgomery, Alabama.

Later, however, when testifying as a witness at Muhammed's first-degree murder trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, Malvo stated that \"he had been the actual shooter of [the 13-year old boy] in Prince George's County and of [the bus driver] in Montgomery County\" and that \"Muhammad had been the actual triggerman on all other occasions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1078.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In January 2003, a grand jury in Fairfax County, Virginia, returned an indictment charging Malvo as an adult with (1) capital murder in the commission of an act of terrorism, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-31\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (13) ; (2) capital murder for killing more than one person within a three-year period, in violation of \u00a7 18.2-31(8) ; and (3) using a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of \u00a7 18.2-53.1. The prosecutor in that case sought the death penalty. Malvo pleaded not guilty to the charges, and, to ensure an impartial jury pool, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for the City of Chesapeake, Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the trial, which took place during November and December 2003, Malvo acknowledged his involvement in the killings but asserted an insanity defense based on\n   the theory that he had been indoctrinated by Muhammad during his adolescence and was operating under Muhammad's control. To that end, defense counsel presented testimony from more than 40 witnesses who collectively described how Malvo was physically abused and largely abandoned as a child growing up in Jamaica and Antigua; how, when he was 15 years old, he befriended John Muhammad, an American veteran who had taken his three children to live in Antigua without their mother's knowledge; how Muhammad became a surrogate father for Malvo and brought him illegally to the United States in May 2001; how Malvo briefly reunited with his mother in the United States but then moved across the country in October 2001 to rejoin Muhammad, who had recently lost custody of his children; and how Muhammad then intensively trained Malvo in military tactics for nearly a year, telling Malvo that he had a plan to get his children back and force America to reckon with its social injustices. The jury rejected Malvo's insanity defense and convicted him of all charges, including the two capital murder charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the sentencing phase of trial, the jury was instructed to choose between the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole. During this phase, Malvo's counsel presented additional evidence on Malvo's background and history, and he stressed Malvo's youth and immaturity in arguing that Malvo should be spared the death penalty. The jury returned its verdict on December 23, 2003, finding \"unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt after consideration of [Malvo's] history and background that there [was] a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that constitute a continuing serious threat to society\" and also \"that his conduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved depravity of mind.\" Nonetheless, the jury, \"having considered all of the evidence in aggravation and mitigation of the offense,\" \"fix[ed] his punishment at imprisonment for life\" for each of his two capital murder convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the jury was excused and a presentence report was prepared, the court conducted a final sentencing hearing on March 10, 2004, sentencing Malvo to two terms of life imprisonment, as required by Virginia law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.2-264.4\">\n    Va.

The plea agreement indicated that Malvo's attorney had advised Malvo that he faced death or imprisonment for a term of life for the capital murder charge and a sentence of 20 years to life imprisonment for the attempted capital murder charge. In the agreement, Malvo waived his \"right to an appeal\" and admitted that \"the Commonwealth ha[d] sufficient evidence to convict\n   [him].\" The Commonwealth in turn agreed to dismiss two pending charges and agreed that sentencing Malvo to two terms of life imprisonment without parole, as well as eight years' imprisonment for the firearm offenses, was the \"appropriate disposition in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Spotsylvania County Circuit Court held a plea and sentencing hearing on October 26, 2004, at which it confirmed that Malvo understood \"that by pleading guilty [he was] giving up constitutional rights\"-specifically, his \"right to a trial by jury\" and his \"right to confront and cross examine [his accusers]\"-and that he was also \"probably giving up [his] right to appeal any decisions made by this Court.\" After ensuring that Malvo understood the nature of the charges against him and had concluded, after consulting with his lawyers, that his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea was \"in [his] best interests,\" the court accepted Malvo's guilty pleas, finding that they \"were freely, voluntarily, and intelligently made.\" It also \"accepted and approved\" the plea agreement itself.

After Malvo appealed, his case was placed in abeyance while this court and the Supreme Court addressed whether\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was to be applied retroactively. On January 25, 2016, the Supreme Court held that \"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   announced a substantive rule that is retroactive in cases on collateral review.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we remanded Malvo's case comprising his two habeas applications to the district court for further consideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By memorandum and order dated May 26, 2017, the district court granted both of Malvo's habeas applications, vacating his four sentences of life imprisonment without parole and remanding to the Chesapeake City Circuit Court and the Spotsylvania County Circuit Court for resentencing in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malvo v.

Va. 2017). In entering that order, the district court rejected the Warden's argument that because the trial courts retained discretion under Virginia law to suspend Malvo's life sentences in whole or in part, those sentences were not mandatory and therefore were not covered by the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   rule. The court explained that the constitutional rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and restated in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   provided relief not only from\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   life-without-parole sentences but also potentially from\n   <em>\n    discretionary\n   </em>\n   life-without-parole sentences. The district court also rejected the Warden's argument that in sentencing Malvo, the Chesapeake City Circuit Court had actually considered whether Malvo was one of those rare juvenile offenders whose crimes reflected irreparable corruption, as required by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .

Juveniles inherently lack maturity; they do not have a fully formed character and a fully developed sense of responsibility; and they are both more susceptible to external influences and less able to control their environment than are adults. Juveniles are also more capable of change than adults and therefore more capable of being reformed. Because of these attributes of youth, juveniles are not as morally culpable as adults when engaging in similar conduct. In light of these characteristics, the Court recognizes that juveniles as a class are less deserving of the most severe punishments. But it also recognizes that a rare few juveniles may nonetheless be found to be permanently incorrigible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Giving effect to these observations, the Supreme Court has developed a juvenile-sentencing jurisprudence beginning with its 2005 decision in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   , where it held that the death penalty cannot be imposed on juvenile offenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    543 U.S. at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We consider these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, the Warden contends that because the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   rule is limited to\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   sentences of life imprisonment without parole, it does not implicate Malvo's sentences, which were, under Virginia law, subject to the sentencing court's discretion to suspend the sentence in whole or in part. He argues that because Malvo had the\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   under Virginia law to request that his life sentences be suspended, he did not receive\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   life-without-parole sentences and therefore is not entitled to any relief under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Responding to the district court's conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   clarified that the rule in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applies more broadly than only to mandatory life-without-parole sentences, the Warden contends that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   itself did not sweep so broadly and that only the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   rule applying to mandatory sentences was made retroactive in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, he argues that the district court violated the rule established in\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   \"by crafting a new rule of constitutional law based on\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   's discussion of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and applying that new rule retroactively.\" In other words, as the Warden argues, \"the principles of finality discussed in\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   prohibit federal courts from expanding new rules of constitutional law beyond their holdings,\" and \"the correct approach is to recognize that ...\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's new rule is defined by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   itself, not\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In response, Malvo contends that he did indeed receive mandatory life-without-parole sentences within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   because Virginia law provided then and still provides that when a jury declines to recommend the death penalty for a defendant convicted of capital murder, the defendant must be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.2-264.4\">\n    Va.

He asserts further that Virginia trial courts were not aware at the time of his sentencings in 2004 that they were empowered to suspend capital murder sentences. Finally, he argues that, in any event, the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   rule is not limited to\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   life-without-parole sentences but also applies, as noted in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   life-without-parole sentences where the sentencing court did not resolve whether the juvenile offender was \"irretrievably corrupt\" or whether his crimes reflected his \"transient immaturity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As the Warden asserts, the Virginia Supreme Court has now twice recognized that Virginia trial courts have long had the authority to suspend life sentences in whole or in part even following a capital murder conviction-an interpretation of Virginia law that is, of course, binding here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

But also, as Malvo asserts, it is far from clear that anyone involved in Malvo's prosecutions actually understood at the time that Virginia trial courts retained their ordinary suspension authority following a conviction for capital murder. We need not, however, resolve whether any of Malvo's sentences were mandatory because\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   has now made clear that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's rule has applicability beyond those situations in which a juvenile homicide offender received a\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   life-without-parole sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To be sure, all the penalty schemes before the Supreme Court in both\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   were mandatory. Yet the\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   Court confirmed that, even though imposing a life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile homicide offender pursuant to a mandatory penalty scheme\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   violates the Eighth Amendment as construed in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , a sentencing judge\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   violates\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's rule any time it imposes a discretionary life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile homicide offender without first concluding that the offender's \"crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility,\" as distinct from \"the transient immaturity of youth.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Warden may well critique the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   -as did Justice Scalia in dissent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"It is plain as day that the majority is not applying\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , but rewriting it\")-but we are nonetheless bound by\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   's statement of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At bottom, we reject the Warden's argument that Malvo \"has no entitlement to relief under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   \" on the ground that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applies only to mandatory life-without-parole sentences and instead conclude that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's holding potentially applies to any case where a juvenile homicide offender was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Warden next contends that even if\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applies to discretionary life-without-parole sentences, \"Malvo received all that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   would entitle him to during his trial in Chesapeake,\" and thus the two life-without-parole sentences that he received in that proceeding must be permitted to stand. In advancing this argument, the Warden notes that \"[o]ver the course of six weeks, the jury heard an enormous amount of mitigation evidence that was nearly all focused on [Malvo's] youth, upbringing, and impressionability,\" and that it also \"heard from multiple expert witnesses who testified specifically about how Malvo's age and upbringing affected his competency.\" He argues further that \"the trial court and the jury actually considered [Malvo's mitigation] evidence in imposing the sentences in this case\" and that \"the jury's finding of future dangerousness and\n   vileness shows that Malvo is the 'rare juvenile offender whose crime reflect[ed] irreparable corruption.' \" Moreover, according to the Warden, the fact \"[t]hat Malvo chose not to use the evidence he introduced to argue for a sentence less than life without parole does not change the fact that he had the opportunity to present the relevant evidence and argue for leniency, which is all that the Eighth Amendment requires.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The problem with the Warden's argument, however, is that, as a matter of Virginia law, the jury was not allowed to give a sentence less than life without parole. It was charged with deciding between the death penalty and life without parole, and it selected the more lenient of the two. Thus, even though the jury did find future dangerousness and vileness, as the Warden notes, it also considered Malvo's mitigation evidence and found that he deserved the lighter of the two sentences that it\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   give-life without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, the Chesapeake City jury was never charged with finding whether Malvo's crimes reflected irreparable corruption or permanent incorrigibility, a determination that is now a prerequisite to imposing a life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile homicide offender. Nor were Malvo's \"youth and attendant circumstances\" considered by either the jury or the judge to determine whether to sentence him to life without parole or some lesser sentence.\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We thus conclude that Malvo's sentencing proceedings in the Chesapeake City Circuit Court did not satisfy the requirements of the Eighth Amendment as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the Warden contends that \"Malvo's voluntary decision to enter into a plea agreement with stipulated [life-without-parole] sentences in Spotsylvania ... waive[d] any claim he would have had under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   \" as to those two sentences. The Warden notes that \"Malvo received a substantial benefit\" in \"avoid[ing] a second trial at which he could have been sentenced to death\" and contends that Malvo must therefore \"be held to the terms of his bargain.\" He cites\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

In\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , the defendant pleaded guilty to a crime that carried the possibility of the death penalty in order to avoid that penalty, receiving instead a 50-year sentence of imprisonment (later reduced to 30 years). When the Supreme Court later held that the death-penalty provision involved in Brady's case was unconstitutional, Brady sought to set aside his plea agreement as invalid. The\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   Court rejected Brady's argument, noting that \"even if we assume that Brady would not have pleaded guilty except for the death penalty provision ..., this assumption merely identifies the penalty provision as a 'but for' cause of his plea,\" but it \"does not necessarily prove that the plea was coerced and invalid as an involuntary act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/\">\n    397 U.S. at 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We noted in\n   <em>\n    Dingle\n   </em>\n   that the Supreme Court had \"not suggested that a substantive rule would stretch beyond the proscribed sentence to reopen guilty pleas with a different sentence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173193\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/171/\">\n    840 F.3d at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Thus, in both\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dingle\n   </em>\n   , the defendants sought to use new sentencing case law to attack their convictions-their guilty pleas-without any claim that the sentences they actually received were unlawful. The question in both cases was thus whether to set aside the guilty-plea\n   <em>\n    convictions\n   </em>\n   when the\n   <em>\n    penalties that induced the pleas\n   </em>\n   were later found to be unconstitutional. In both cases that relief was denied, and the legality\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of the avoided sentences was thus held not to cast doubt on the validity of the guilty plea. In this case, by distinction, Malvo seeks to challenge his\n   <em>\n    sentences\n   </em>\n   , not his guilty-plea\n   <em>\n    convictions\n   </em>\n   , on the ground that they were retroactively made unconstitutional under the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Thus, whereas the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dingle\n   </em>\n   sought to use new sentencing law as a sword to attack the validity of their guilty pleas, here the Warden seeks to use Malvo's lawful guilty plea as a shield to insulate his allegedly unlawful life-without-parole sentences from judicial review. We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dingle\n   </em>\n   do not provide him with that shield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nonetheless, that brings us to the more formidable question of whether Malvo waived his constitutional challenge to his sentences by signing the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In that agreement, Malvo agreed that Virginia's summary of the facts could be proven in the case were it to go to trial, accepting that summary \"in lieu of presentation of any evidence by the Commonwealth.\" And, after expressly waiving his rights to a speedy and public trial by jury, to compel the production of evidence and attendance of witnesses, to have a lawyer, to not testify against himself, and to be confronted by his accusers, he entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   guilty plea and waived his right to an appeal. With respect to punishment, he stated in his plea agreement, \"I understand that the Commonwealth's Attorney has agreed that the following specific punishment is the appropriate disposition in this case\": \"life in prison without parole\" for the offenses of capital murder and attempted capital murder and a term of years for the other offenses. Finally, he acknowledged that \"the Court [could] accept or reject this plea agreement.\" It is noteworthy, however, that in the plea agreement, Malvo did not himself agree that life-without-parole sentences were appropriate punishments for his crimes. That is not to say, of course, that Malvo did not expect that he was avoiding the death penalty by receiving life sentences without parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. S. Ct. Rule 3A:8(c)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   To begin, it is far from clear that a broad waiver of a\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   constitutional right, as the Warden maintains happened here, would even be enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 729, 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"[s]ubstantive rules ... set forth categorical constitutional guarantees that place certain criminal laws and punishments altogether\n   <em>\n    beyond the State's power\n   </em>\n   to impose\" and that, \"[l]ike other substantive rules,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is retroactive because it necessarily carr[ies] a significant risk that a defendant-here, the vast majority of juvenile offenders-faces a punishment\n   <em>\n    that the law cannot impose upon him\n   </em>\n   \" (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He did expressly waive constitutional rights relating to trial and his right to direct appeal, but nothing with respect to the right to pursue future habeas relief from his punishment. Consequently, the Warden's waiver argument must rest on some form of\n   <em>\n    inherent\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    implied waiver\n   </em>\n   of his right to challenge his sentences as unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In the circumstances, we decline to hold that Malvo implicitly waived his right to argue, based on intervening Supreme Court holdings, that his sentences were ones that the State could not constitutionally impose on him.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Class v.

We thus conclude that, while Malvo's convictions remain valid, nothing in his plea agreement precludes him from obtaining habeas relief under the new rule in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .

The Commonwealth of Virginia understandably sought the harshest penalties then available under the law, and the Warden now understandably seeks to sustain the penalties that were then legally imposed with arguments that are not without substantial force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But Malvo was 17 years old when he committed the murders, and he now has the retroactive benefit of new constitutional rules that treat juveniles differently for sentencing. Because we are bound to apply those constitutional rules, we affirm the district court's grant of habeas relief awarding Malvo new sentencings. We make this ruling not with any satisfaction but to sustain the law. As for Malvo, who knows but God how he will bear the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   AFFIRMED\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
