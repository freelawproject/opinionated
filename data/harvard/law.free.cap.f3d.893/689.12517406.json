Resentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rather than remedy Lavis' improper methodology or call the Veras' co-conspirators to testify about their dealings with the defendants, the government instead relied heavily upon the co-conspirators' plea agreements to establish the quantities of drugs attributable to the Vera brothers. In effect, the government swapped out the wiretapped calls for the plea agreements. The district court recognized as much in its sentencing order. It explained that it found the government's sentencing memoranda \"more credible\" than the presentence investigation reports and Armando's sentencing memorandum because it was the \"least dependent on interpretation of [the] recordings.\" It also recognized that the plea agreements were the government's \"single most significant data source.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   These plea agreements, which the government drafted, frequently pointed fingers at the Veras. Of the twelve plea agreements relied upon by the government, ten named Armando as a co-conspirator. Five of those also named Salvador. The factual bases of some of the plea agreements referenced the Veras more specifically. One provided that a co-conspirator \"conspired to distribute between five and 20 grams of cocaine base with Armando,\" and another stated that a co-conspirator \"obtained cocaine base\" from him. These and several other plea agreements also catalogued wiretapped calls between both Vera brothers and their co-conspirators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over the defendants' objections, the district court found these plea agreements reliable. Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), (the statement-against-interest exception to the hearsay rule), the district court concluded that the co-conspirators' \"admissions in [the] plea agreement[s] clearly amount[ed] to declarations against interest.\" \"Moreover,\" the district court explained, \"the Government provide[d] specific corroboration for a number of the plea agreements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After applying some additional sentencing enhancements, the court re-sentenced Salvador to 324 months' and Armando to 168 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But that information must still have \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). Here, the district court relied heavily upon the co-conspirator plea agreements to determine the drug quantities attributable to the Veras, concluding that the plea agreements were reliable statements against interest under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3). This was reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The text of Rule 804(b)(3) explains why a purely inculpatory statement is deemed reliable: \"a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made [it] only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it ... had so great a tendency ... to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability.\" Fed.

And \"[w]hile we encourage and appreciate express findings by a district court regarding the reliability of hearsay statements introduced at sentencing,\" we have not reversed for failure \"to articulate such findings\" where the statements' reliability \"is apparent from the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084394\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/971/\">\n    258 F.3d at 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On this record, however, we do not find \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support [the plea agreements'] probable accuracy\" as to drug quantity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). It was the question of drug quantity, not conspiracy, that was before the district court. And thus it was quantity, not conspiracy, that required corroboration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As corroboration for the plea agreements, the government has offered other co-defendants' plea agreements and the intercepted calls admitted at trial, as well as the criminal complaint, investigative reports, and DEA laboratory reports that the government submitted with its sentencing memoranda. While these sources may have corroborated the plea agreements as to the Vera brothers' participation in the drug-trafficking conspiracy, they were not corroborative as to the drug quantities attributable to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Turning first to the plea agreements themselves, we reject the government's contention that they corroborate each other. The twelve plea agreements in the record-all drafted by the government-collectively listed over forty narcotics transactions. Each transaction included the specific type and quantity of drugs purchased or sold. Of all these transactions, we found only four that were specifically\n   referenced in the factual bases of more than one plea agreement. None of these four specifically referenced involvement by either Vera brother. The plea agreements therefore do not corroborate each other as to the drug quantities attributable to the Veras.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Nor do the majority of the wiretapped calls. In our review of the record, we found only five transactions listed in the plea agreements that the calls corroborated as to quantity. And while the government argues that encoded words like \"rock\" or \"pants\" are corroborative, unless those terms are preceded by quantity designations, we decline to find they corroborate anything more than the Veras' participation in the drug-trafficking conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The government also offers the criminal complaint, investigative reports, and DEA laboratory reports as corroboration. Assuming without deciding that a criminal complaint can be used against a defendant at sentencing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   we found that only two transactions in the plea agreements were indeed corroborated by the complaint as to quantity. Likewise, though we recognize that investigative reports may be relied upon at sentencing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784548\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/1036/#p1039\">\n    523 F.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1039 (9th Cir. 2008), we found that only two transactions in the plea agreements were corroborated by the reports. And finally, while the DEA laboratory reports may indicate the reliability of the methamphetamine quantities listed in one co-conspirator's plea agreement, neither the plea agreement nor the DEA laboratory reports directly ties the Veras to these methamphetamine sales, and we decline to make this inference without factual support in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Reversal may be necessary when a district court bases a sentence on sources whose reliability is not apparent from the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084394\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/971/\">\n    258 F.3d at 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And \"remand is required\" when a \"sentencing judge considers unreliable information\" that was \"demonstrably made the basis for the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Huckins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"573150\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/276/#p280\">\n    53 F.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280 (9th Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the factual bases in the plea agreements were neither inherently reliable as statements against interest nor corroborated by other information that made their reliability apparent. They were also demonstrably made the bases of the Veras' sentences. Accordingly, we vacate the sentences and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At oral argument, the government argued for the first time that there was ample evidence to support the sentences without considering the plea agreements, so any reliance on the plea agreements was harmless. And while that may ultimately be true (and this appears to be a much stronger argument than the one presented in the appellate briefs), we think it best for the district court to consider this argument on remand: it previously considered the plea agreements to be the \"single most significant data source,\" for its drug-quantity calculations, and it is better positioned to reassess the reliable evidence and make factual findings in the first instance. We also decline to review the other sentencing enhancements at this time, as\n   we remand this case to the district court to resentence on an open record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    For consistency with\n    <em>\n     Vera I\n    </em>\n    , we refer to the defendants by their first names, Salvador and Armando.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    We also vacated the sentences because the district court failed to require that the government lay an adequately specific foundation for Lavis' testimony or to instruct the jury that Lavis was testifying as both an expert and lay witness.\n    <em>\n     Vera I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266228\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1232/#p1253\">\n     770 F.3d at 1243-44\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Proceeding without a sentencing jury meant that the Veras faced (1) no mandatory minimum sentence, and (2) a smaller statutory maximum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(C).
