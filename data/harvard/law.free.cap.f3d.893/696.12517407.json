As no judge on the original panel or the en banc court requested that a poll be called, the request for en banc reconsideration is likewise denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Trayon Williams was convicted of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The conviction led the district court to consider the sentence, beginning (as required) with the sentencing guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peugh v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p541\">\n    569 U.S. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p541\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p541\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). To apply the guidelines, the district court classified Mr. Williams's prior conviction for aggravated battery under Kansas law as a crime of violence. This classification triggered enhancement of the offense level. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Williams challenges the enhancement on the ground that his prior conviction was not for a crime of violence. Mr. Williams is mistaken. In Kansas, aggravated battery is a crime of violence because the crime involves general criminal intent, requiring the knowing use of force. Thus, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Mr. Williams's sentence level was enhanced under \u00a7 2K2.1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a guilty plea, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report for Mr. Williams. The probation officer did not treat aggravated battery as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1 of the sentencing guidelines. As a result, the probation officer calculated the guideline range at 27 to 33 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The government objected, arguing that the Kansas crime of aggravated battery constituted a crime of violence. The district court sustained the objection and set the guideline range at 46 to 57 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr.\n   Williams appeals the enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. We must determine whether aggravated battery in Kansas constitutes a crime of violence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Section 2K2.1 requires enhancement of the offense level when the defendant has a prior conviction for a \"crime of violence.\" The definition of \"crime of violence\" appears in \u00a7 4B1.2. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n.1. There a \"crime of violence\" is defined as a felony that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). Focusing on this definition, Mr. Williams argues that his conviction does not constitute a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To address this argument, we engage in de novo review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The mens rea for aggravated battery in Kansas suffices for a crime of violence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Williams argues that the mens rea requirement for aggravated battery does not suffice for a crime of violence. For this argument, Mr. Williams asserts that his statute of conviction encompasses conduct that is reckless and unintentional.

We ordinarily define \"knowing\" conduct as conduct undertaken with an awareness that a particular result \"is practically certain.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But Mr. Williams's response had not included an argument that Kansas's definition of \"knowing\" conduct was equivalent to recklessness.
