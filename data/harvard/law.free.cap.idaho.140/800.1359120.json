The Hearing Committee found that the attorney engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice and recommended that he receive a private reprimand. The attorney, who was prosecuting a defendant in a criminal case, obtained a transcript of the grand jury testimony in that case without an order of the court and then gave a copy of that transcript to a third party engaged in civil litigation against the same defendant. We affirm the findings of the Hearing Committee and impose the sanction it recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-21\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b845-22\">The petitioner Defendant A is an attorney who, at the time of the conduct involved herein, was a deputy attorney general engaged in prosecuting a criminal action against Richard Hoyle. The criminal action had been instituted by a grand jury indictment, and the grand jury proceedings had been reported by a court reporter. Hoyle obtained an order in the criminal case allowing him to obtain a transcript of the grand jury proceedings. Defendant A then obtained a transcript directly from the court reporter, without first securing an order of the court permitting him to do so. He later gave a copy of that transcript to a third party, who was engaged in an ongoing civil lawsuit against Hoyle. While participating in the execution of a search warrant at Hoyle\u2019s accountant\u2019s office, Defendant A obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>copies of Hoyle\u2019s income tax returns, which he also turned over to that third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">On December 8, 1998, a complaint was made to the Idaho State Bar regarding Defendant A\u2019s conduct in giving copies of the grand jury transcript and Hoyle\u2019s income tax returns to the opposing party in Hoyle\u2019s civil litigation. In October 1999 another complaint was made to the Bar regarding Defendant A\u2019s alleged conduct while executing a search warrant of Hoyle\u2019s business on May 20, 1997. Bar Counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> began a four-year investigation, and by letter dated December 16, 2002, he concluded that Defendant A had not violated the Idaho Rules of Professional Conduct (IRPC).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">With respect to the grand jury transcript, Bar Counsel noted that Hoyle\u2019s counsel had obtained a court order allowing him to have a transcript of the grand jury proceedings and that such order did not include any conditions upon the use, dissemination, or publication of the transcript by Hoyle\u2019s counsel. Although Defendant A had not obtained an order permitting him to have a transcript of the proceedings, Bar Counsel assumed that Defendant A obtained his copy of the transcript as a result of the order obtained by Hoyle\u2019s counsel. Since there were no restrictions upon Hoyle\u2019s counsel regarding the transcript, Bar Counsel reasoned that there would likewise be no restrictions upon Defendant A.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">With respect to Hoyle\u2019s income tax returns, the allegation had been that Defendant A violated Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3076, which made it a felony for an agent of the state tax commission to divulge any tax return or tax information obtained directly or indirectly in the discharge of his duties except as provided by statute, court order, or rules of the tax commission. Bar Counsel concluded that because Defendant A was not an agent of the tax commission, he did not violate the statute, and therefore did not violate the IRPC. Bar Counsel also concluded that Defendant A\u2019s alleged conduct while participating in the execution of the search warrant did not violate the IRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">On December 30, 2002, Hoyle filed a letter with the Clerk of the Professional Conduct Board in which he expressed his dissatisfaction with Bar Counsel\u2019s resolution of the matter. On July 16, 2003, he filed a second letter in which he explained in greater detail why he wanted the Professional Conduct Board to review Bar Counsel\u2019s decision. On October 10, 2003, this Court appointed a Hearing Committee of the Professional Conduct Board to hear the matter. By letter to the Board dated December 10, 2003, Defendant A objected to the appointment of the Hearing Committee on the ground that Hoyle had not timely requested review of Bar Counsel\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The Hearing Committee heard the matter, and on December 29, 2003, it issued its written decision in which it addressed four issues. First, it found that, when read broadly, Hoyle\u2019s letter filed with the Professional Conduct Board on December 30, 2002, was a timely request for review of Bar Counsel\u2019s decision and that the Committee therefore had jurisdiction to review the complaints. Second, it found that Defendant A had violated Rule 8.4(d) of the IRPC when he obtained the copy of the grand jury transcript and provided it to the third party engaged in litigation with Hoyle. The Committee found that such conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice and recommended a public reprimand for that violation. Third, the Committee concluded that it could not decide whether Defendant A violated the IRPC when he turned a copy of Hoyle\u2019s income tax returns over to the third party that was engaged in civil litigation with Hoyle. The Committee stated that the issue hinged upon an issue of law that it lacked the authority to resolve and remanded that issue to Bar Counsel. Finally, the Committee upheld Bar Counsel\u2019s determination that Defendant A\u2019s conduct during the execution of the search warrant did not violate any provisions of the IRPC. On January 16, 2004, the Hearing Committee issued a substitute opinion. The only material change was modifying its recommendation of a public reprimand to a private reprimand. Defendant A timely peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>tioned for review by this Court of the Hearing Committee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">II. ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">A. Did Hoyle timely request review of Bar Counsel\u2019s disposition of the complaints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">B. Was the Hearing Committee\u2019s decision that Defendant A violated Rule 8.4(d) clearly erroneous or arbitrary and capricious?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">C. Did the Hearing Committee err in remanding to Bar Counsel the issue of whether Defendant A was an agent of the state tax commission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">D. What sanction is appropriate?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">In an attorney discipline matter, this Court reviews the hearing committee\u2019s decision to see if it was clearly erroneous or arbitrary and capricious. <em>Wilhelm v. Idaho State Bar, </em>140 Idaho 30, 89 P.3d 870 (2004); Idaho Bar Comm\u2019n Rule 509(c)(9).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When doing so, this Court independently reviews the record and assesses the evidence to see if the misconduct was proven by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Wilhelm v. Idaho State Bar, </em>140 Idaho 30, 89 P.3d 870 (2004). The disciplined attorney bears the burden of showing that the evidence does not support the findings. <em>Id. </em>If the finding of misconduct is upheld, this Court bears the ultimate responsibility for determining what sanction should be imposed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\"><em>A. </em>Did Hoyle Timely Request Review of Bar Counsel\u2019s Disposition of the Complaints?</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">Bar Counsel issued his decision by letter dated December 16, 2002. After stating his decision that Defendant A did not violate the IRPC, Bar Counsel informed the parties that they could seek review of the decision \u201cby filing a written request with the Clerk of the Professional Conduct Board, Idaho State Bar, P.O. Box 895, Boise, Idaho 83701, within fourteen (14) days of receipt of this decision. The written request should specify the reason^) for seeking review.\u201d On December 30, 2002, Hoyle filed with the Clerk of the Professional Conduct Board a letter in which he criticized various findings by Bar Counsel in his decision, but Hoyle did not expressly request review of that decision. On July 16, 2003, Hoyle filed a second letter with the Clerk of the Professional Conduct Board. In that letter, Hoyle stated that he had called the Idaho State Bar\u2019s investigator, who informed him that his first letter had not been interpreted as a request to review Bar Counsel\u2019s decision. Therefore, in his second letter he expressly requested review and addressed in greater detail his reasons for seeking review.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-20\">The relevant portion of Idaho Bar Commission Rule 509(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-21\">Request for Review. Either the grievant or the defendant may request review by a hearing committee pursuant to this Rule of Bar Counsel\u2019s disposition under subsections (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-22\">(1) Mode and Content of Request. A written request for such review, stating the reasons for the request, shall be filed with the Clerk of the Professional Conduct Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-24\">(A) Time for Filing. The request for review shall be filed within fourteen (14) days following the receipt by the grievant or defendant of notice under subsection (B) of this Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-25\">(2) Service of Request. The written request shall be served upon Bar Counsel and the defendant or grievant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-26\">If Hoyle\u2019s first letter were construed as a written request for review, then his request was timely. If it was not, then it was untimely. The Hearing Committee determined that Hoyle\u2019s first letter was sufficient to constitute a request for review under Rule 509(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-27\">On appeal, Defendant A argues that Hoyle\u2019s first letter should not be considered a request for review because it did not ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>pressly request review. The Rule does not specify a particular form for the request for review. It only requires that it be filed with the Clerk of the Professional Conduct Board. Hoyle\u2019s first letter was addressed to the \u201cClerk of the Professional Conduct Board,\u201d and the salutation stated, \u201cDear Professional Conduct Board.\u201d He then proceeded to criticize various aspects of Bar Counsel\u2019s decision. There is no reason for Hoyle to have addressed the letter to, and filed it with, the Clerk of the Professional Conduct Board unless he was seeking review of Bar Counsel\u2019s decision. The Hearing Committee found that Hoyle\u2019s first letter was sufficient to constitute a request for review under Rule 509(c)(1). That finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AMRg\">Defendant A also alleges that Hoyle did not timely request review because he did not serve a copy of the first letter upon Defendant A. During the four-year period that Bar Counsel was reviewing Hoyle\u2019s complaint, Defendant A had changed offices, and Hoyle sent a copy of his first letter to Defendant A\u2019s prior address. The Hearing Committee found such service adequate because that was the address Defendant A initially used in corresponding with the Idaho State Bar regarding this matter and there was no indication that Defendant A had informed Hoyle of his change in address. On appeal, Defendant A points out that his current address was listed on Bar Counsel\u2019s written decision from which Hoyle was appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The only time limit in Rule 509 that is applicable to the request for review is the fourteen-day period within which the written request for review must be filed with the Clerk of the Professional Conduct Board. The Rule does not require that the defendant also be served with a copy of the request during that fourteen-day period. Therefore, any failure of Hoyle to serve a copy of the request for review within that fourteen-day period was not jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">B. Was the Hearing Committee\u2019s Decision that Defendant A Violated Rule 8.4(d) Clearly Erroneous or Arbitrary and Capricious?</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Hoyle\u2019s counsel obtained a copy of the grand jury transcript pursuant to a motion and order that provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-9\">COMES NOW the defendant RICHARD W. HOYLE, by and through counsel, who moves the court for its order for production of the transcript of the grand jury proceedings in this case. The transcript is necessary for the preparation of the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-10\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">This matter having come before the Court pursuant to the defendant\u2019s motion, and good cause appearing for the granting of the relief requested, IT IS SO ORDERED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">Defendant A then obtained a copy of the transcript from the court reporter and gave it to a third party engaged in civil litigation against Hoyle. The Hearing Committee determined that Defendant A\u2019s conduct violated the Idaho Criminal Rules applicable to the disclosure- of grand jury proceedings and, therefore, constituted \u201cconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d in violation of Rule 8.4 of the IRPC. The first issue is whether Defendant A\u2019s conduct violated the applicable Idaho Criminal Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">Idaho Criminal Rule 6.4(c) provides, insofar as is relevant, \u201cNo other person present in a grand jury proceeding shall disclose to any other person what was said or done in the proceeding, except by order of any court for good cause shown.\u201d There was no finding by the Hearing Committee, however, that Defendant A was present in the grand jury proceeding. Therefore, that rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">Rule 6.3(c) is the other applicable Idaho Criminal Rule. It provides, \u201cThe district judge by motion shall permit a prosecuting attorney, a person charged in an indictment or the attorney for the person charged ... to obtain a transcript of such proceedings, in the same manner as a transcript of a preliminary hearing.\u201d It further provides, \u201cThe district judge may place conditions upon the use, dissemination or publication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>the proceedings of the grand jury, and any violation of any such condition by a party granted access to the record shall constitute contempt of the order of the district judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The rule requires each person who desires a transcript of the grand jury proceedings to seek court permission. It states that the district judge, by motion, shall permit \u201ca prosecuting attorney, a person charged in an indictment or the attorney for the person charged\u201d to obtain a grand jury transcript. Each of the persons mentioned is in the singular. It does not state that the judge, by motion, shall permit the parties (plural) to obtain the transcript. In fact, the order entered in Hoyle\u2019s case did not provide that both parties could have a copy of the transcript. Hoyle requested a copy for the preparation of his defense, and the district court ordered that he could have one.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Grand jury proceedings are intended, to the extent possible, to be secret. All of the grand jurors are required to take an oath that includes the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">You will keep your own counsel, and that of your fellows, and of the government, and will not, except when required in the due course of judicial proceedings, disclose the testimony of any witness examined before you, nor anything which you or any other grand juror may have said nor the manner in which you or any other grand juror may have voted in any matter before you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19-1011 &amp; -1012. A grand juror who violates that oath commits a misdemeanor. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-4403. In addition, Idaho Code \u00a7 19-1111 limits the persons who can be present during grand jury sessions. Finally, Idaho Criminal Rule 6.3(b) provides that upon the conclusion of each matter presented to the grand jury, the clerk is to seal the record of the proceedings and that the record is not to be examined by anyone or transcribed except upon order of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Consistent with the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, Rule 6.3(c) provides, \u201cThe district judge may place conditions upon the use, dissemination or publication of the proceedings of the grand jury, and any violation of any such condition by a party granted access to the record shall constitute contempt of the order of the district judge.\u201d The rule refers to a violation of the conditions by \u201ca party granted access to the record.\u201d The reference to \u201ca party granted access\u201d is consistent with the requirement that each person seeking access must obtain court permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The court\u2019s conditions upon the use, dissemination or publication of the transcript are intended to preserve, to the extent possible, the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. As Defendant A admitted during oral argument, the prosecutor and the defendant often have different interests in maintaining that secrecy. In some circumstances, only the defendant would want the secrecy maintained in order to prevent the publication of embarrassing or otherwise damaging information. At other times, only the prosecutor may want the secrecy maintained in order to prevent dissemination of information that may compromise other ongoing investigations or to protect the privacy of a victim. Because of the differing interests involved, in a particular circumstance one party\u2019s own self-interest may obviate the need for conditions restricting that party\u2019s use, dissemination, or publication of the transcript. That self-interest would not obviate the need for conditions upon the opposing party\u2019s use of the transcript, however. Therefore, requiring each party to seek court approval for a copy of the transcript would give the opposing party an opportunity to request that the court impose conditions the party asserts are necessary to protect his or her privacy or that of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Defendant A contends that he reasonably interpreted Rule 6.3(c) as authorizing him to obtain a copy of the transcript once Hoyle had obtained a copy. He relies upon the portion of the Rule that provides that the judge shall permit the named persons to obtain a transcript of the grand jury proceedings \u201cin the same manner as a transcript of a preliminary hearing.\u201d He argues that if one party obtains a copy of a preliminary hearing transcript, a copy is automatically given to the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Idaho Criminal Rule 5.2 governs the preparation and dissemination of preliminary-hearing transcripts. Only subsections (a) and (c) of the Rule relate to the manner in which a prosecuting attorney or defense counsel can obtain a copy of the preliminary hearing transcript. Subsection (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that, upon timely motion, the court shall order a transcript of the preliminary hearing be made for the party requesting it and that if such party is the defendant, he or she shall bear the cost of the preparation of the transcript, unless the defendant is indigent. Subsection (e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that once the transcript is prepared, the original and two copies shall be filed with the clerk, who shall serve copies upon the parties by giving them written notice and an opportunity to pick up their copy from the clerk\u2019s office.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Considering the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, the phrase \u201cin the same manner as a transcript of a preliminary hearing\u201d refers to subsection (a) of Idaho Criminal Rule 5.2, not to subsection (c). As discussed above, Rule 6.3(c) provides that each party, by motion, can obtain a copy of a grand jury transcript. Similarly, Rule 5.2(a) provides that upon timely motion by the prosecuting attorney or the defendant, a transcript shall be made \u201cfor such party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Defendant A contends that he interpreted the phrase \u201cin the same manner as a transcript of a preliminary hearing\u201d to refer to the Rule 5.2(c). He argues that under that Rule, once the grand jury transcript was prepared at Hoyle\u2019s request, he was automatically entitled to obtain a copy of it as well. He asserts that since Hoyle did not request any conditions on the use, dissemination or publication of the transcript, and the district court did not impose any such conditions, he was free to give it to anyone he desired. Defendant A\u2019s own conduct, however, belies his contention that that was how he interpreted the Rule at the time. He did not await receipt of a written notice from the clerk of the court informing him that he could come to the clerk\u2019s office and pick up a copy of the transcript, as would have occurred pursuant to Rule 5.2(e). Instead, he obtained the transcript directly from the court reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Defendant A also argues that the transcript may have been publicized eventually during Hoyle\u2019s trial. Whether or not that occurred is not in the record. The transcript itself would not have been admissible under the rules of evidence. Although portions of it could have been read to impeach a witness whose trial testimony contradicted his or her grand jury testimony, the possibility of such occurrence does not excuse Defendant A\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Defendant A also challenges the Hearing Committee\u2019s determination that his conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice. He argues that if he violated Idaho Criminal Rule 6.3(c), there was no evidence that such violation was actually prejudicial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the administration of justice in Hoyle\u2019s case. He contends that we should adopt the rule, \u201cNo harm, no foul.\u201d We have not required proof that the administration of justice must in fact actually have been prejudiced in a particular case in order to find that certain conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice. For example, in <em>In re Lutz, </em>101 Idaho 24, 607 P.2d 1078 (1980), an attorney settled a tort claim arising from a traffic accident and had the opposing party sign a covenant not to testify against the attorney\u2019s client, who was facing criminal charges as a result of the accident. In subsequent disciplinary proceedings, the attorney\u2019s conduct was found to be \u201cconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Even though the trial court in the criminal case had held the covenant not to testify invalid and the person had testified, so that the administration of justice was not actually prejudiced, we upheld the disciplinary sanctions against the attorney. Considering the secrecy inherent in grand jury proceedings and the legitimate interests that either party may have to request that the district court impose conditions on the use, dissemination or publication of the transcript by the other party, we agree that Defendant A\u2019s conduct in obtaining a copy of the grand jury transcript without court approval and giving it to a third party constituted conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">C. Did the Hearing Committee Err in Remanding to Bar Counsel the Issue of Whether Defendant A Was an Agent of the State Tax Commission?</p>\n<p id=\"Ahi\">Idaho Code \u00a7 68-3076 makes it a felony for any agent of the tax commission to \u201cknowingly divulge or make known to any person in any manner any tax return or tax information whatsoever obtained directly or indirectly by him in the discharge of his duties.\u201d The commission of a felony would violate the IRPC. Bar Counsel determined that Defendant A was not acting as an agent of the tax commission when he obtained copies of Hoyle\u2019s tax returns and turned them over to the third party. Bar Counsel found that when Defendant A engaged in that conduct, he was acting as a deputy attorney general who had been assigned to prosecute a criminal action on behalf of the state. The tax commission was also engaged in an investigation of Hoyle and his various businesses, and there was evidence that Defendant A and employees of the tax commission were working together in their respective investigations. The Hearing Committee did not find that Defendant A was an agent of the tax commission, as the term \u201cagent\u201d is typically used. It wondered, however, whether there could be a legal argument for holding that Defendant A was, as a matter of law, an agent of the tax commission. For example, the Healing Committee suggested that because Defendant A, as a deputy attorney general, was an agent of the State of Idaho, he may also be, as a matter of law, an agent of all state agencies, including the tax commission. The Hearing Committee concluded that it lacked the authority to resolve issues of law and remanded the matter back to Bar Counsel for resolution of that legal issue, such as by declaratory judgment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">A hearing committee does have authority to resolve issues of law that arise in connection with its determination of a matter before it. If either party contends that the committee\u2019s resolution of the matter is based upon an erroneous interpretation of law, that party can seek review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The Hearing Committee implicitly found that Defendant A was not an agent of the tax commission, as the term \u201cagent\u201d is typically understood. Otherwise, there would have been no reason to remand that issue to Bar Counsel for a determination of whether there could be a basis for holding that Defendant A was the tax commission\u2019s agent as a matter of law. The finding that Defendant A was not an agent of the tax commission is not clearly erroneous. During oral argument, Bar Counsel stated that he agrees that Defendant A was not an agent of the tax commission. Therefore, we affirm the determination that Defendant A did not violate Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3076.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">D. What Sanction Is Appropriate?</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">This Court bears the ultimate responsibility for determining what sanction should be imposed. <em>Wilhelm v. Idaho State Bar, </em>140 Idaho 30, 89 P.3d 870 (2004). The Hearing Committee recommended a private reprimand. We agree that such sanction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>appropriate under the facts of this ease and impose that sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">We affirm the finding of the Hearing Committee that Defendant A violated Rule 8.4(d) of the IRPC when he obtained a grand jury transcript without court approval and gave it to a third party. We also affirm the finding that Defendant A did not violate Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3076 because he was not an agent of the tax commission when he obtained copies of Hoyle\u2019s income tax returns and gave them to a third party. We impose a sanction of a private reprimand for Defendant A\u2019s violation of the IRPC. Costs are awarded to respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b852-6\">Justices TROUT, KIDWELL, BURDICK and Justice Pro Tern WOODLAND concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">.
