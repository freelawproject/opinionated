The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Raymond L. Morton (Morton) was charged by Complaint filed on November 4, 2002, with the crime of Possession Of Sexually Exploitative Material For Other Than A Commercial Purpose under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-1507 &amp; 18-1507A.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">Oh January 6, 2003, Morton filed a Motion to Dismiss, challenging the constitutionality of the statute on First Amendment grounds. Morton later filed a brief in support of his motion to dismiss on constitutional grounds, stating that the definition of \u201cerotic nudity\u201d as defined in I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e) is unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">Morton was charged by Information on January 14, 2003, for the crime of Possession of Sexually Exploitative Material For Other Than A Commercial Purpose under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-1507A &amp; 18-1507. On March 4, 2003, the district court held oral arguments on the defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on First Amendment Constitutional Grounds, which alleged that the statute is overbroad in violation of the First Amendment. After hearing oral arguments on Morton\u2019s motion, the district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">On March 27, 2003, pursuant to I.C.R. 11(a)(2), Morton entered a conditional guilty plea, which the district court accepted, reserving his right to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Dismiss on First Amendment Constitutional Grounds. Morton appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-19\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-20\">\u2018When this Court considers a claim that a statute is unconstitutional, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling de novo since it involves purely a question of law.\u201d <em>State v. Cobb, </em>132 Idaho 195, 197, 969 P.2d 244, 246 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-21\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-22\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b280-23\">A. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e) Is Not Unconstitutionally Overbroad On Its Face.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-24\">Where a facial overbreadth challenge is presented, this Court\u2019s inquiry is to \u201cdetermine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. 489, 494, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362, 369 (1982). Statutes are not unconstitutional due to facial overbreadth unless the overbreadth is \u201cnot only real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2917, 37 L.Ed.2d 830, 842 (1973). The party challenging the consti tutionality of a statute bears the burden of establishing the statute is unconstitutional and \u201cmust overcome a strong presumption of validity.\u201d <em>State v. Korsen, </em>138 Idaho 706, 711, 69 P.3d 126, 131 (2003) (quoting <em>Olsen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>J.A. Freeman Co., </em>117 Idaho 706, 709, 791 P.2d 1285, 1288 (1990)). \u201cAppellate courts are obligated to seek an interpretation of a statute that upholds its constitutionality.\u201d <em>Korsen, </em>138 Idaho at 711, 69 P.3d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u201cDepictions of nudity, without more, constitute protected expression.\u201d <em>Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 112, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 1697, 109 L.Ed.2d 98, 111 (1990). However, there are limits on the category of child pornography that, like obscenity, is unprotected by the First Amendment. <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 763, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3358, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113, 1126-27 (1982). As a general rule, pornography can be banned only if obscene, but under <em>Ferber, </em>pornography showing minors can be proscribed whether or not the images are obscene under the definition set forth in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 240, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 1398, 152 L.Ed.2d 403, 414-15 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">To defeat a challenge of over-breadth, the conduct to be prohibited must, as written or authoritatively construed, be adequately defined by the applicable state law; the prohibition must be limited to works that visually depict sexual conduct by children below a specified age; the category of \u201csexual conduct\u201d proscribed must be suitably limited and described; and, criminal responsibility may not be imposed without some element of scienter on the part of the defendant. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 764-765, 102 S.Ct. at 3358, 73 L.Ed.2d at 1127-28. In other words, statutes prohibiting the production or distribution of child pornography must sufficiently narrow the scope of them prohibitions to avoid \u201ccriminaliz[ing] an intolerable range of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 112, 110 S.Ct. at 1697, 109 L.Ed.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-1507A and 18-1507 cover the crime of possession of sexually exploitative material for other than a commercial purpose. Section 18-1507A(2) states in relevant part that every person who knowingly and willfully has in his possession any sexually exploitative material as defined in I.C. \u00a7 18-1507 for other than a commercial purpose, is guilty of a felony, and shall be punished. I.C. \u00a7 18-1507A(2). \u201cSexually exploitative material\u201d means, among other things, any videotape that depicts a child being used for explicit sexual conduct. I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(k). A \u201cchild\u201d is defined as a person who is less than eighteen (18) years of age. I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(b). \u201cExplicit sexual conduct\u201d means, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cerotic nudity.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(f). \u201cErotic nudity\u201d is defined, in relevant part, to mean the display of the human male or female genitals or pubic area, the undeveloped or developing genitals or pubic area of the human male or female child, the human female breasts, or the undeveloped or developing breast area of the human female child, for the purpose of real or simulated overt sexual gratification or stimulation of one or more of the persons involved. I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e). The policy rationale behind the enactment of this statute is to \u201cprotect children from the physical and psychological damage caused by their being used in photographic representations of sexual conduct which involves children.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-1507A(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Morton argues that I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-1507A <em>&amp; </em>18-1507 \u2014 -specifically, the definition of \u201cerotic nudity\u201d in I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e) \u2014 are unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment because they criminalize an intolerable range of constitutionally protected conduct by seeking to prohibit possession based upon the thoughts of the possessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-1507A and 18-1507, including the definition of \u201cerotic nudity\u201d in I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e), is not unconstitutionally overbroad because it withstands analysis under <em>Ferber </em>and <em>Osborne. </em>First, it limits its reach to works that visually depict sexual conduct by children below a certain age. The statute limits its scope to \u201csexually exploitative material\u201d such as photographs or videotapes depicting a child under the age of eighteen. I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(b) &amp; (c). Second, it suitably limits the category of \u201csexual conduct\u201d proscribed. The portion specifically under attack is \u201cerotic nudity,\u201d which is limited to display of the genitals, genital area or female breast (or the undeveloped equivalents) \u201cfor the purpose of real or simulated overt sexual gratification or stimulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>one or more of the persons involved.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Under the tests articulated in <em>Ferber </em>and <em>Osborne, </em>the mere \u201cdisplay\u201d of a child\u2019s undeveloped, developing or developed genitals, pubic area, or female breasts, without more, constitutes protected expression. However, by limiting the prohibition of such \u201cdisplays\u201d to material made \u201cfor the purpose of overt sexual gratification or stimulation of one or more of the persons involved,\u201d the statute simultaneously targets child pornography, which is not protected speech, <em>see e.g., Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 764, 102 S.Ct. at 3358, 73 L.Ed.2d at 1127, and reduces the possibility that the statute will be used to prohibit protected speech. So limited, the statute does not reach constitutionally protected materials depicting nude children for family, educational, medical, artistic or other legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Additionally, when the \u201cpurpose\u201d portion of I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e) (i.e., \u201cfor the purpose of real or simulated overt sexual gratification or stimulation of one or more of the persons involved.\u201d) is considered, the scope of the prohibited conduct narrows significantly because the only conduct prohibited by the statute is conduct which is <em>not </em>morally innocent, i.e., the possession or viewing of the described material for prurient purposes. As written, then, the statute\u2019s proscription is not so broad as to outlaw all depictions of minors in a state of nudity, but rather only those depictions that constitute child pornography. Moreover, to the extent such constitutionally protected works may come within the reach of the statute, it is \u201cseriously doubt[ful] ... that these arguably impermissible applications of the statute [will] amount to more than a tiny fraction of the materials within the statute\u2019s reach.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 773, 102 S.Ct. at 3363, 73 L.Ed.2d at 1133. Finally, I.C. \u00a7 18-1507A contains an element of scienter because, to be guilty of such possession, the possessor must do so \u201cknowingly and willfully.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-1507A(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Nevertheless, Morton argues that <em>State v. Bonner, </em>138 Idaho 254, 61 P.3d 611 (Ct.App.2002) controls in this case. Although persuasive, Court of Appeal\u2019s decisions are not binding case law precedent in this Court. <em>Dachlet v. State, </em>136 Idaho 752, 757, 40 P.3d 110, 115 (2002). Notwithstanding that fact, the Court of Appeals\u2019 <em>Bonner </em>decision, finding I.C. \u00a7 18-1508A unconstitutionally overbroad, is inapplicable to this case because, as discussed above, the definition of \u201cerotic nudity\u201d in I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e) passes constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">As such, the definition of \u201cerotic nudity\u201d in I.C. \u00a7 18-1507(2)(e), as referred to by I.C. \u00a7 18-1507A, is not unconstitutionally over-broad because it sufficiently narrows the scope of its prohibition and avoids \u201ccriminaliz[ing] an intolerable range of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 112, 110 S.Ct. at 1697, 109 L.Ed.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-1507A and 18-1507 are not unconstitutionally overbroad because they sufficiently narrow the scope of their prohibition and avoid criminalizing an intolerable range of constitutionally protected conduct. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-12\">Chief Justice TROUT and Justices SCHROEDER, EISMANN, and BURDICK concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
