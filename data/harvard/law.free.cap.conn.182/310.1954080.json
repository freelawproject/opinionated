Elliott, Stephen K. Elliott, Morris Stein, A.C. Bassett, \u00bf/k/a Albert C. Bassett, and Roger Hubney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 appeal contests the propriety of the action of the trial court, <em>Stoughton, J., </em>in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in denying the defendants\u2019 motion for leave to file an amended answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment was supported by proper documentation. Piled after the pleadings between these parties had been closed; see Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 379; it relied upon the contents of the pleadings, an affidavit by the plaintiff\u2019s president detailing, on the basis of his personal knowledge, the defendants\u2019 indebtedness, a copy of the underlying note and a copy of the defendants\u2019 partnership agreement. On the basis of this supporting documentation, the motion established, prima facie, that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, and hence sought judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 384. <em>Town Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>176 Conn. 304, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>306, 407 A.2d 971 (1978); <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 488, 280 A.2d 359 (1971); Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (1979 Sup.) \u00a7 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The defendants filed no counteraffidavit directly contesting the motion for summary judgment, hut asked instead for leave to amend their answer. That request was supported by an affidavit by one of the defendants stating that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in setting off part of the defendants\u2019 indebtedness against a special deposit account\"created an issue about the amount of the defendants\u2019 indebtedness. Even if this affidavit is considered as an affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, it is conspicuously devoid of evidentiary matter contesting the underlying indebtedness or relating the allegedly improper setoff to the amount of the indebtedness. We have repeatedly held that \u201c[i]n order to oppose successfully a motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must recite facts in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 300 [now \u00a7 381] which contradict those offered by the moving party.\u201d <em>Dorazio </em>v. <em>M.B. Foster Electric Co., </em>157 Conn. 226, 229, 253 A.2d 22 (1968); <em>McColl </em>v. <em>Pataky, </em>160 Conn. 457, 460, 280 A.2d 146 (1971); <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Kielak, </em>160 Conn. 14, 17, 273 A.2d 716 (1970); <em>Loubet </em>v. <em>Loubet, </em>155 Conn. 695, 696, 230 A.2d 552 (1967); see also James <em>&amp; </em>Hazard, Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1977) pp. 149-50. A party seeking to resist summary judgment may not rely on underlying pleadings containing only general denials, or upon the pleadings of someone not a party to the motion for summary judgment to establish the existence of a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to a material fact. <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 490, 280 A.2d 359 (1971); <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>378-79, 260 A.2d 596 (1969); see also <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Merchants Fire Ins. Co., </em>204 F. Sup. 311, 314 (D. Conn.), aff\u2019d, per curiam, 308 F.2d 806 (2d Cir. 1962). In the absence of documents properly controverting the evidence offered by the plaintiff, the trial court was therefore fully justified in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment both as to liability and as to damages. See Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 384 and 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The trial court was equally justified in deciding, in the exercise of its discretion, not to permit further amendment of the defendants\u2019 answer after the pleadings had been closed and the motion for summary judgment filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only in rare circumstances will this court overturn the decision of a trial court to grant or to deny motions for belated amendments to the pleadings. <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Godfried, </em>181 Conn. 214, 216, 435 A.2d 15 (1980); <em>Powel </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>178 Conn. 384, 392, 423 A.2d 97 (1979); <em>DuBose </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>161 Conn. 254, 263, 287 A.2d 357 (1971). There is no evidence of abuse of discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> Certain other defendants named in the complaint were not named as parties to the motion for summary judgment and are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\"> The record reveals the following timetable: plaintiff\u2019s complaint, August 19, 1977; defendants\u2019 answer, May 14, 1979; amended cross complaint, August 2, 1978; plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, November 5, 1979; defendants\u2019 request to amend answer with reference to a July 9, 1979 set-off, November 19, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
