J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atd\">The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether an executor may utilize the hearing described in General Statutes \u00a7 12-367 (b), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>effect on February 17, 1973, to contest and alter Ms own appraisal of an asset reported on a duly filed succession tax return after the tax commissioner failed to object to the executor\u2019s reported appraisal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-359 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The parties stipulated to the facts and those pertinent to this appeal are: The decedent, Bessie Miller Lyons, was a settlor of a trust dated September 6, 1968, involving certain real estate located in Norwalk; she died testate on February 17, 1973. In November of 1973, the executor of the decedent\u2019s estate filed the Connecticut succession tax return (form S-l), reporting the previously noted trust as item 1 on schedule 10. In the column of schedule 10 designated as \u201cTotal Value at Date of Death,\u201d the executor listed the value of the corpus of the trust as $549,300. In the adjacent column calling for concessions of tax-ability, the executor claimed the trust was not taxable. The tax commissioner objected to the executor\u2019s claim of nontaxability but did not object to the executor\u2019s valuation of the trust. After a hearing on the tax commissioner\u2019s objection, the Nor-walk Probate Court entered a decree on May 21, 1975, holding the trust to be not taxable for Connecticut succession tax purposes. An appeal by the commissioner to the Superior Court, however, was sustained and the executor did not appeal the Superior Court\u2019s decree holding the trust to be taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">On June 3, 1976, the plaintiff tax commissioner computed the Connecticut succession tax based on the succession tax return as filed and included the trust estate, found taxable by the Superior Court, at the value of $549,300 placed on it by the defendant executor. The trust was added to other con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ceded taxable property to form a gross taxable estate of slightly over $1,000,000. On June 21,1976, the defendant filed an application under General Statutes \u00a7 12-367 for a hearing upon the computation of the tax before the Norwalk Probate Court. The executor\u2019s claim, as set forth in his application, was that the value placed on the trust in the succession tax return was excessive and that a lower figure should be used in computing the tax on the trust. After a hearing, the Probate Court entered a decree reducing the value of the trust in question for purposes of the Connecticut succession tax from $549,300 to $387,000. The tax commissioner\u2019s appeal from this decree of the Probate Court was sustained by the Superior Court, that court having concluded that the defendant was not, under \u00a7 12-367, entitled to a hearing as to the value of the trust, and it is from that judgment that this appeal by the defendant executor is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The present case involves solely the interpretation of \u00a7\u00a712-359 (a), 12-359 (b) and 12-367 (b) of the General Statutes in effect on February 17,1973, the date of the decedent\u2019s death. Thus, we first examine the statutory scheme in these provisions before reviewing the arguments underlying the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in sustaining the tax commissioner\u2019s appeal. See <em>Hopkins </em>v. Pac, 180 Conn. 474, 477, 429 A.2d 952; <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 554-55, 295 A.2d 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Section 12-359 (a) of the General Statutes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sets forth what shall be included on the succession tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>return. Section 12-359 (b) delineates the method of objecting <em>to </em>valuations and concessions of taxability of individual items set forth in the succession tax return and sets out the scope of the Probate Court hearing and determination on the objections.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 12-359 (b) further provides the method of determining the gross taxable estate upon which the tax computation shall be based.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 12-367 (b) in 1973 provided for an application for a hearing to challenge the tax commissioner\u2019s computation of the succession tax.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The defendant executor argues initially that, on its face, there is no limitation regarding the issues which may be heard in a hearing held pursuant to \u00a7 12-367 (b) and that he could raise the issue of valuation as he did before the Probate Court. This argument ignores our cardinal rule concerning statutory construction, viz.: \u201cIn the construction of ... statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language.\u201d General Statutes \u00a71-1 (a). See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 7, 434 A.2d 293; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 423, 426 A.2d 1324. Section 12-367 (b), the words of which the defendant executor does not quote or rely on in making his claim, fails to mention or allude to valuation, concessions of taxability or the determination of the gross estate already fixed under \u00a7 12-359. Under \u00a7 12-367, a hearing is restricted to questions on the tax\u2019s \u201ccomputation,\u201d an expression which is repeatedly iterated in the provision. \u201cCompute\u201d commonly means \u201cto determine or ascertain esp. by mathematical means: arrive at an answer to or sum for . . . vi: to make calculations.\u201d Webster, Third New International Dictionary. See also <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Shapiro Bros. Shoe Co., </em>234 A.2d 326, 330 (Me.) (computation is the act or process of computing; calculation, reckoning); <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Bethesda Discount Corp., </em>221 Md. 271, 276, 157 A.2d 265 (same); <em>Mudd </em>v. <em>McColgan, </em>174 P.2d 646, 651 (Cal. App.) (determination of a deficiency in an income tax was a \u201ccomputation\u201d of a tax within the sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>tute). Thus, the hearing appears definitely to be restricted to questions such as whether the mathematics are correct or whether a full exemption was granted. Nothing suggests that the fiduciary has an opportunity under \u00a7 12-367 (b) to question his own reported valuations.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Nonetheless, although words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings and courts do not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for it; see, e.g., <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>164 Conn. 369, 374, 321 A.2d 444; because the defendant contends that as a whole and as applied to the present facts the statutory scheme created by \u00a7\u00a7 12-359 and 12-367 is confusing and ambiguous, we review his other arguments to see whether any ambiguity can reasonably be imputed to these provisions. Our further review is also impelled by the principle that statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Murtha, </em>179 Conn. 463, 466, 427 A.2d 807; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 58, 392 A.2d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Initially in support of his claim that \u00a7 12-367 (b) permits the question of valuation to be raised at a hearing before a Probate Court, the defendant contends that the entry of $549,300 on schedule 10 of the succession tax return in question was only a pro forma informational figure which had no legal significance and was not binding on the defendant. Not only does this argument disregard the clear language of \u00a7 12-359 (a) and the defendant\u2019s actions in conformity with the directions on the succession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>tax return itself, but it also fails to take into account the significance of the entry of valuation for the tax commissioner under the statutory framework created by \u00a7\u00a712-359 (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The succession tax return utilized was in conformity with the mandatory language of \u00a7 12-359 (a), and schedule 10 of that return (where \u201cTransfers During Decedent\u2019s Lifetime\u201d are reported) has a column for the description of the asset, another for the valuation of the asset, and a third column for concessions of taxability concerning the asset. Thus, the succession tax return statute and the succession tax return itself clearly indicate that an asset must be reported at its fair market value, regardless of concessions of tax-ability which form a distinctly separate issue. As the stipulated facts reveal, the defendant executor followed both the requirements of \u00a7 12-359 (a) and the succession tax return prepared and disseminated in furtherance of the statutory directions. Finally, as the defendant himself conceded at oral argument, when the tax commissioner raised questions of taxability concerning the entries on the succession tax return under \u00a7 12-359 (b), he was also at that time bound to object to questions of valuation or forfeit the opportunity to challenge the executor\u2019s valuation. In light of the foregoing, the defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive that the entry of valuation on the succession tax return before the issue of taxability was finally determined was merely a pro forma matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">In conformity with the initial language of \u00a7 12-359 <em>(b); </em>see footnote 2; the tax commissioner objected to the defendant\u2019s claim of nontaxability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>for the trust in question, but did not object to the defendant\u2019s reported appraisal of fair market value for the trust. Although the Superior Court sustained the tax commissioner\u2019s objection and held the trust to be taxable in its entirety and the defendant did not appeal to this court, he nonetheless argues that if a hearing is not permitted on valuation after the Superior Court\u2019s determination of taxability, \u00a7 12-359 (b) does not permit the addition of the trust to the decedent\u2019s taxable estate. The defendant\u2019s contention is premised on the fact that the three methods of determining the gross taxable estate for purposes of tax computation as described in \u00a7 12-359 (b); see footnote 3; do not mention explicitly adding any asset determined taxable in judicial proceedings beyond the hearing provided for in the Probate Court. Even if we assume that the defendant\u2019s construction is conceivable, it is settled that when two constructions are possible, courts will adopt that construction which makes the statutes effective and workable, and not one which would lead to difficult and unfathomable results. <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>170 Conn. 567, 582, 368 A.2d 103; <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. </em>15, 169 Conn. 613, 621, 363 A.2d 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The defendant\u2019s construction fails to take into account that \u00a7 12-359 (b) provides for an appeal from the Probate Court\u2019s decision and thus would make a successful appeal, as is true in this case, meaningless if the asset judged taxable in that successful appeal could not be added to the gross taxable estate. The executor\u2019s argument here also leads to another untenable conclusion in that if the tax commissioner prevails in his objection to a claim of nontaxability under \u00a7 12-359, he cannot compute the tax until the executor files a second return, setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>forth a new value or restating the old value for the asset at issue. The relevant statutes supply no support for this scenario. The only viable construction of \u00a7 12-359 (b) is the one on which the tax commissioner acted in computing the succession tax. He used the gross value as set forth in the tax return, and added to that amount only the value of the trust as set forth in the return and as determined to be taxable by the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The defendant also contends that the 1978 alterations of \u00a7 12-367 (b) by the general assembly were intended only to clarify the allegedly ambiguous language of that provision. We do not, however, view the amendments brought about by Public Aets 1978, No. 78-195 as merely clarifying the previous language of the provision. See <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 727, 433 A.2d 1009. As the language and the statutory history of the amendment clearly indicate, among the changes effected by the amendment is one which allows questions of valuation or of taxability to be raised by a fiduciary at the hearing provided for in \u00a7 12-367 (b). Compare <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>173 Conn. 232, 244-45, 377 A.2d 305. This language and statutory history reinforce the presumption that amendments effect a change in existing law. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 21 n.6, 434 A.2d 293; <em>Stamford </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>107 Conn. 596, 606, 141 A. 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Section 12-367 (b) was amended by Public Acts 1978, No. 78-195 to read in pertinent part: \u201cWithin sixty days after the mailing of the computation by the commissioner of revenue services, the fiduciary or transferee or any other party in interest may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>make written application to the probate court for a hearing upon the determination of tax or the computation thereof. . . . The commissioner or any person interested may appear before such court at such hearing and be heard on any matter involved in the determination of the tax or the computation thereof, including, if no hearing has been held previously under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 12-359, . . . any matter which would have been heard at such a hearing.\u201d Thus, after Public Acts 1978, No. 78-195, the hearing under \u00a7 12-367 (b) became a forum for raising questions on the \u201cdetermination of the tax\u201d as well as on the computation of the tax. See Wilhelm, Conn. Estates Practice Death Taxes (Rev. Ed. Cum. Sup.) \u00a7 84, p. 37 (\u201cEffective January 1, 1979, the fiduciary may at the time of objecting to the \u2018computation,\u2019 also raise any issues pertinent to the \u2018determination\u2019 of the tax which have not been raised before. Issues which may be raised include those relating to valuation, and taxability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The statutory history is equally clear regarding the effect of the language of Public Acts 1978, No. 78-195. While presenting the bill which became Public Acts 1978, No. 78-195, Senator George Guidera stated: \u201c[T]his bill would make several changes in the procedures relating to the payment of succession [taxes]; . . . and generally would make those procedures less restrictive.\u201d 21 Sen. Proc., Pt. 6, 1978 Sess., p. 2442. See also 21 H. R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1978 Sess., pp. 2119-20.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The executor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>cannot take advantage of the change wrought by Public Act No. 78-195. See General Statutes \u00a7 55-3. Substantive rights are affected and so the amendment at issue is to be given prospective application only. <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>supra, 729; <em>East Village Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>173 Conn. 328, 331-33, 377 A.2d 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The defendant\u2019s final contention is that if he is denied a hearing on the question of valuation for succession tax purposes he will be denied constitutional due process. We fail to perceive what deprivation is involved in denying the defendant a hearing on a valuation which is designated as entirely for the defendant to determine as an initial matter. It is his own action of which the defendant complains, not the lack of opportunity to be heard created by statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compare, e.g., <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 91 S.

This is a desirable change since when the fiduciary receives the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>putation of the tax this is the first official word that he has as to the amount actually owed by the estate for succession tax purposes. This is the time when the fiduciary would review his file and determine whether the tax has been correctly computed in accordance with law. If he has any disagreement with the way the tax has been computed and cannot reach a satisfactory agreement with the Tax Commissioner\u2019s office, then he should have the right within this fixed period of time to [go to] the Probate Court and have it decided before the tax becomes final. If the fiduciary has obtained any further information with respect to any estate asset such as an item being overvalued on the original return, or erroneous concession of taxability, or misdeduction, then all of these things should be able to be taken into consideration at this time so that the tax computed at this time would be accurate insofar as possible. This bill would allow for that flexibility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\"> We note that General Statutes \u00a7 12-359 allows the fiduciary a nine-month period from the date of death, plus extensions when necessary, to arrive at his own valuations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
