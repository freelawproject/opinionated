J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">In this action the plaintiff, individually and as administratrix of the estate of her daughter, seeks to recover damages from the defendant physicians for alleged negligence which she claims resulted in the death of her minor daughter. The second count of the complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>alleges a cause of action on behalf of the plaintiff in her individual capacity for physical, mental and emotional harm caused by witnessing the death of her daughter which was alleged to be the result of the defendants\u2019 malpractice. The facts upon which the plaintiff relies under this count in seeking a recovery individually allege that she witnessed the deterioration of her daughter\u2019s health and the momentary stopping of her daughter\u2019s heart while being administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by the plaintiff, and that she participated in the decision to discontinue extraordinary life-support methods. The defendants\u2019 motion to strike the second count of the amended complaint on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action which is cognizable in this state was granted by the trial court. The court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants as to that count from which the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The plaintiff urges this court to \u201cadopt a simple negligence analysis, predicated on foreseeability\u201d in this appeal and to abrogate the rule expressed in <em>Strazza </em>v. <em>McKittrick, </em>146 Conn. 714, 719, 156 A.2d 149, that \u201c[e]ven where a plaintiff has suffered physical injury . . . there can be no recovery for nervous shock and mental anguish caused by the sight of injury or threatened harm to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Where an appeal is taken from a judgment following the granting of a motion to strike, we take the facts to be those alleged in the amended complaint construed in a manner most favorable to the pleader. <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 472, 427 A.2d 385; <em>Stradmore Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>164 Conn. 548, 550-51, 324 A.2d 919; <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Hope, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>156 Conn. 92, 97, 239 A.2d 486; <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 549, 557, 227 A.2d 418. For purposes of appeal, all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted. <em>DeMello </em>v. <em>Plainville, </em>170 Conn. 675, 677, 368 A.2d 71; <em>McAnerney </em>v. <em>McAnerney, </em>165 Conn. 277, 282, 334 A.2d 437. See Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 151. The following facts are alleged in the amended complaint: On or about April 21, 1975, the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, Jennifer, who was a patient of the defendants, Dr. Peter R. Cunningham and Dr. Alan C. Mermann, began to wheeze heavily and had difficulty breathing. On or about that same day, the plaintiff contacted Hermann and requested that he see Jennifer because of her respiratory problems. Hermann did not examine Jennifer but did renew a previous prescription of penicillin and NovaHistine. Jennifer\u2019s condition worsened during the following week causing the plaintiff to take her to the defendants\u2019 office on or about Sunday, April 27, 1975, where she was examined by Cunningham and allowed to return home. In the early morning hours of April 28, 1975, Jennifer began gasping for breath and her heart stopped momentarily while her mother was administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Jennifer was rushed to the hospital where she died two days later after extraordinary life-support methods were discontinued. The complaint alleges that the defendants were negligent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in failing to properly diagnose and treat Jennifer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>disease and that such negligence was the proximate cause of her death and of the plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress. The sole issue in the present appeal, which is confined to the second count, is whether the plaintiff, suing in her individual capacity, has satisfied her burden of alleging sufficient facts to establish a cognizable cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">There is a divergence of opinion among the jurisdictions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> regarding the recognition of a cause of action for emotional distress to a bystander arising from witnessing the negligently inflicted injury of another.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Until very recently, the prevailing rule had been to deny such recovery. See generally annot., \u201cEight to Eecover Damages in Negligence for Fear of Injury to Another, or Shock or Mental Anguish at Witnessing Such Injury,\u201d 29 A.L.R.3d 1337. This view is based on the consideration that the emotional injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a witness to the tortfeasor\u2019s negligence are too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>remote from the defendant\u2019s negligent act or that no duty is owed to the plaintiff to prevent the shock or distress that comes from witnessing that act. See <em>Strazza </em>v. <em>McKittrick, </em>146 Conn. 714, 156 A.2d 149; <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>24 N.Y.2d 609, 249 N.E.2d 419; <em>Waube </em>v. <em>Warrington, </em>216 Wis. 603, 258 N.W. 497.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The rationale underlying the denial of recovery to a bystander for negligently inflicted emotional harm was articulated in <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>supra, where the New York Court of Appeals held that a cause of action does not lie for emotional injury sustained by a plaintiff solely as a result of injuries negligently inflicted directly upon another regardless of the relationship of the parties or the fact that the plaintiff was an eyewitness to the negligent act. In <em>Tobin, </em>the plaintiff mother sought recovery for emotional distress which she suffered when her two-year-old son was struck by an automobile negligently operated by the defendant. The plaintiff was inside a neighbor\u2019s home when the accident occurred and did not witness the accident. The plaintiff, however, heard the screech of brakes, noted the absence of her child and immediately went outside and saw her child lying injured on the ground. The issue, as framed by the court, was whether to create a new legal duty and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>fore a new cause of action. Noting that there were \u201cno new technological, economic, or social developments which have changed social and economic relationships,\u201d the court stated that a \u201cradical change in policy\u201d was required before the cause of action urged by the plaintiff would be recognized. Id., 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The primary consideration militating against adoption of the cause of action urged by the plaintiff in <em>Tobin </em>was the inability to place reasonable limitations on the scope of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability; such liability would therefore become unduly burdensome.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Basing the existence of a cause of action solely on the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the court in <em>Tobin </em>believed, would not resolve the problem. \u201cIf foreseeability be the sole test, then once liability is extended the logic of the principle would not and could not remain confined. It would extend to older children, fathers, grandparents, relatives, or others <em>in loco parentis, </em>and even any other affected bystanders. Moreover, in any one accident, there might well be more than one person indirectly but seriously affected by the shock of injury or death to the child.\u201d Id., 616. Similarly, a rule requiring that the plaintiff witness the accident, it was decided, would not provide the desired limitation. As the court stated: \u201cAny rule based solely on eyewitnessing the accident could stand only until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the first case comes along in which the parent is in the immediate vicinity but did not see the accident. Moreover, the instant advice that ones\u2019 child has been killed or injured by telephone, word of mouth, or by whatever means, even if delayed, will have in most cases the same impact. The sight of gore and exposed bones is not necessary to provide special impact on a parent.\u201d Id., 617. The court also noted that, assuming there are cogent reasons for extending liability in favor of victims of shock, there appears to be no rational way to limit the scope of liability except by establishing arbitrary distinctions. Id., 618. See Prosser, Torts (4th Ed.) \u00a7 54, pp. 334-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">A growing number of jurisdictions, beginning in 1968 with the California decision in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>68 Cal.2d 728, 441 P.2d 912, have recently recognized a cause of action for emotional distress in favor of a bystander to the negligently caused injury of another party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Dillon, </em>a minor child was killed when she was struck by an automobile negligently operated by the defendant. The complaint alleged, inter alia, a cause of action for physical and mental pain and suffering inflicted upon the victim\u2019s mother and sister both of whom witnessed the accident. The trial court rendered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant as to the mother\u2019s cause of action and denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the sister\u2019s count on the grounds that the mother was not in the zone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of danger from the defendant\u2019s negligence whereas the sister may have been within that zone. A divided court (four to three) held that the cause of action alleged by the plaintiff mother was cognizable.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The central issue facing the court in <em>Dillon </em>was whether to recognize a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff mother. In the court\u2019s view, the issue was essentially to determine whether the risk of emotional harm to the plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable in the particular factual setting of the ease.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Recognizing the need \u201cto limit the otherwise potential infinite liability which would follow every negligent act\u201d; id., 739; the court enunciated three factors which, when considered in light of the facts of a particular case, determine whether the injury to the plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable and thereby gives rise to a duty of care owed by the defendant: \u201c(1) Whether plaintiff was located near the scene of the accident as contrasted with one who was a distance away from it, (2) Whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence, (3) Whether plaintiff and the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship.\u201d Id., 740-41. In <em>Dillon, </em>the appellate court found that all of those factors were pleaded in the plaintiff mother\u2019s complaint which hence alleged a prima facie cause of action. It is obvious that <em>Dillon </em>adopts a rule which is not uniform in application and \u201ccontemplates that courts, on a case-to-case basis, analyzing all the circumstances, will decide what the ordinary man under such circumstances should reasonably have foreseen. The courts thus mark out the areas of liability, excluding the remote and unexpected.\u201d Id., 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The plaintiff urges the adoption of the rule expressed in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>supra, which she claims would permit the cause of action for malpractice alleged in her complaint. An examination of the cases following <em>Dillon </em>indicates, however, that recognition of the alleged cause of action would require an extension of <em>Dillon </em>which even the California Supreme Court has refused to allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In <em>Dillon </em>recovery was permitted because the shock to the plaintiff resulted from a direct emotional impact upon her from the \u201csensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident.\u201d Subsequently in 1977, in <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>19 Cal. 3d 59, 562 P.2d 1022, the court recognized that the requirement of \u201csensory and contemporaneous observance\u201d does not require a visual perception of the impact<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> although it does require that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tiff bystander otherwise apprehend the event. In <em>Krouse, </em>the plaintiff husband was sitting in his parked car and his wife was standing on the curb when the defendant\u2019s car, approaching from the rear, straddled the curb and struck and killed the plaintiff\u2019s wife before colliding with his car. Although the plaintiff did not actually see the defendant\u2019s car strike his wife, he was nonetheless allowed recovery for emotional injuries arising from the injury to his wife inasmuch as \u201che fully perceived the fact that she had been so struck, for he knew her position an instant before the impact, observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle approach her at high speed on a collision course, and realized that the defendant\u2019s car must have struck her. Clearly, under such circumstances [the plaintiff husband] must be deemed a percipient witness to the impact causing [his wife\u2019s] catastrophic injuries.\u201d Id., 76. See also <em>Corso </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>119 N.H. 647, 406 A.2d 300. Merely observing the consequences of the defendant\u2019s negligence towards another person without perceiving the actual negligent behavior, however, is insufficient to maintain a cause of action for emotional distress to a bystander.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1977, in <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, </em>19 Cal. 3d 564, 565 P.2d 122, for example, the court, in reaffirming the principles underlying <em>Dillon </em>and reemphasizing the need to limit potentially infinite liability, denied recovery for emotional distress to the plaintiff hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>band who was present in the hospital delivery room when, during the delivery, he witnessed the prolapsing of the umbilical cord and heard the attending physician announce that the fetus had died. The court stated that \u201calthough the plaintiff was in attendance at the death of the fetus, that event was by its very nature hidden from his contemporaneous perception. ... To put it another way, he had been admitted to the theater but the drama was being played on a different stage.\u201d Id., 584. See also <em>Hoyem </em>v. <em>Manhattan Beach City School Dist., </em>22 Cal. 3d 508, 585 P.2d 851. Other jurisdictions in which the <em>Dillon </em>approach has been adopted are in accord that in order to allege a cognizable cause of action the plaintiff bystander must have had contemporaneous sensory perception of the negligent conduct of the defendant. See, e.g., <em>Leong </em>v. <em>Takasaki, </em>55 Haw. 398, 520 P.2d 758; <em>Corso </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>supra; <em>Sinn </em>v. <em>Burd, </em>486 Pa. 146, 404 A.2d 672; <em>Caparco </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>121 R.I. 710, 402 A.2d 1180 (recovery denied because the mother only witnessed the daughter\u2019s resultant injuries and not the accident). Cf. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Russell Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., </em>570 S.W.2d 861 (Tenn.).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In addition to the requirement that the plaintiff bystander perceive the negligent act, it appears that recovery for emotional distress resulting from injury inflicted upon another is also restricted to situations where the injury to the third party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>manifest contemporaneously with the negligent act. In <em>Jansen </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, </em>31 Cal. App. 3d 22, 106 Cal. Rptr. 883, the mother of a five-year-old child alleged a cause of action for physical and emotional trauma caused by witnessing the progressive deterioration and ultimate death of her daughter which occurred in the hospital allegedly due to the negligence of the hospital and its staff in failing to diagnose the child\u2019s ailment. In refusing to extend the principles enunciated in <em>Dillon, </em>the court held that recovery by the plaintiff mother was precluded because there was no sudden and brief event which proximately caused the child\u2019s injury and which could be the subject of sensory perception by the mother. In <em>Mobaldi </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of University of California, </em>55 Cal. App. 3d 573, 127 Cal. Rptr. 720, however, the plaintiff foster mother was found to be a percipient witness to the injury inflicted upon her foster son where, while she was holding the child in her arms, he became convulsive and comatose from an improper intravenous solution negligently being administered to him by the defendant doctors. Both of these eases, which were cited approvingly by the California Supreme Court in <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, </em>supra, construe <em>Dillon </em>as imposing a policy limitation upon the liability for emotional distress suffered by a witness to alleged negligence by requiring that the plaintiff observe a negligent act contemporaneously causing injury to the third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">It is clear from the preceding discussion that even were we inclined to adopt the approach taken in <em>Dillon, </em>and the cases relying thereon, the complaint in the present case would nonetheless fail to state a cognizable cause of action. Without determining whether in fact an alleged negligent diagnosis is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>susceptible to sensory perception, we note that the allegations of the complaint indicate that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff\u2019s child became manifest a considerable period of time after the alleged negligence of the defendants occurred. We do not intend to minimize the injury suffered by the plaintiff; but, the result reached in this case is a recognition<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that liability for negligent behavior cannot be so burdensome as to transcend a reasonable degree of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\"> In the first count of the amended complaint the plaintiff, as administratrix of her daughter\u2019s estate, alleges a cause of action seeking 3.5 million dollars in damages for the wrongful death of her daughter.
