Barnett, </em>public defender, for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-9\"><em>William F. Gallagher, </em>special assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>Arnold Markle, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>John J. Kelly, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">The dispositive issue on this appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s failure to give the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d instruction mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b) is reversible error when the defendant\u2019s trial counsel failed to object to its omission from the charge delivered by the trial court. This case is governed by our recent ruling in <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 333-34, 438 A.2d 93 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">The defendant, George C. Carter, was indicted, tried and convicted of felony murder in violation of Public Acts 1974, No. 74-186, \u00a7 11, now General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54e. The defendant did not testify on his own behalf. The presentation of evidence in his trial was concluded on September 30, 1977, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the court charged the jury the following Tuesday, October 4, 1977. The instructions to the jury did not include the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d charge mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> although that statute had taken effect on October 1,1977. No requests concerning instructions pursuant to the statute were made to the trial court, and no exceptions were taken in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">This case is indistinguishable from <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra. For the reasons there detailed, we will exercise our discretion to review the defendant\u2019s claim despite his failure to make a timely request or objection concerning the charge in the trial court. \u201cWhere the legislature has chosen specific means to effectuate a fundamental right, failure to follow the mandatory provisions of the statute is plain error, reviewable by this court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra, 332. The provisions of \u00a7 54-84 (b) require the court, unless the defendant requests otherwise, to instruct the jury that no unfavorable inferences may be drawn from his failure to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra, 333. Failure to follow the mandate of the statute is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 54-84. . . . (b) Unless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. In eases tried to the court, no unfavorable inferences shall be drawn by the court from the accused\u2019s silence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
