Draft 1973). \u201cThe function of the statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>evidentiary, to prevent enforcement through fraud or perjury of contracts never in fact made.\u201d <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The clause challenged as uncertain in the present case was not a promise in the agreement to be performed by the parties, but rather was a condition precedent to performance. See <em>Lach </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>138 Conn. 418, 421, 85 A.2d 481 (1951); Calamari &amp; Perillo, Contracts (2d Ed. 1977), pp. 385, 389. Moreover, the condition was fulfilled because the defendants actually obtained a mortgage commitment in the desired amount for thirty years at 8 % percent per year. Under these circumstances we need not consider the applicability of the statute of frauds because, if we assume that the statute applied, it was satisfied. <em>Heyman </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 215, 220-21, 423 A.2d 887 (1979). The trial court correctly allowed the plaintiffs to enforce the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-11\"> The contract in this case was entered into before the effective date of Public Acts 1976, No. 76-69.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
