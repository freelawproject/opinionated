When the defendant proceeded to turn left onto an adjacent street, the vehicle collided with an oncoming vehicle owned and operated by a Tennessee resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">At the time the accident occurred, both parties were residents and domieiliaries of Connecticut, and were employed by the Aetna Life and Casualty Company in Hartford. Although they worked alternately two weeks in Connecticut and two weeks \u201con the road,\u201d both parties were hired and maintained their principal place of employment in Hartford. The parties were traveling in Tennessee in the course of their employment when the collision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>occurred and both parties received workers\u2019 compensation benefits under General Statutes 'A 31-275 through 31-355 as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The defendant filed a special defense in which she claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s action was barred by Tennessee law which does not permit one employee to sue another in negligence for injuries arising within the scope of their employment. Connecticut law imposes no such barrier. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-293, 31-293a. The defendant argued that Tennessee law applied because the plaintiff\u2019s injuries occurred in Tennessee. The trial court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the special defense and summary judgment was entered in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff appeals from the summary judgment and the court\u2019s denial of her motion to strike the special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Contract Choice oe Law</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The plaintiff, citing <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Lemieux, </em>179 Conn. 501, 427 A.2d 397 (1980), contends that this court should apply the law of Connecticut, the place where the employment contract was made, to determine whether the court erred in denying her motion to strike the special defense. Although the contract choice of law rule is a certain one, easily applied, this approach would present several problems in determining whether an employee can properly avail herself of supplemental workers\u2019 compensation remedies such as the tort action against a third party provided by General Statutes \u00a7 31-293. First, such a rule would serve to preclude the successive incremental awards sanctioned by <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Washington Gas Light Co., </em>448 U.S. 261, 100 S. Ct. 2647, 65 L. Ed. 2d 757 (1980); <em>Industrial Commission of Wisconsin </em>v. <em>McCartin, </em>330 U.S. 622, 67 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>S. Ct. 886, 91 L. Ed. 1140 (1947); Restatement (Second), 1 Conflict of Laws \u00a7 182, comment b;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Restatement, Conflict of Laws \u00a7 403;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 4 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 85.60, pp. 16-29-16-30; because the employment contract is typically made in only one jurisdiction. Where the contract was not made in Connecticut, remedies provided by the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act would not apply. Were all or even a substantial number of jurisdictions to adopt this approach, an employee\u2019s effort to maximize her compensation benefits and remedies would be frustrated because relief would be limited to that provided by the jurisdiction where the contract was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">A second problem encountered by this approach is the possibility that an employer can avoid the full extent of potential liability imposed by the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act simply by making the contract elsewhere, even though all other incidents of employment, such as the place of performance, the employee\u2019s residence and the employer\u2019s place of business, are in Connecticut. In addition, jurisdictions which have adhered to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tract choice of law rule have become immersed in disputes over contract law to determine where the employment contract was made, disputes which bear no relationship to the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. As Professor Larson has stated: \u201cProbably the ultimate blame for these rather artificial arguments [to determine where the employment contract was made] and attempted evasions [to avoid the sometimes harsh results of the rule\u2019s application to the injured employee] rests on the unrealistic character of the place-of-contract test when construed to depend upon the sheer formality of being physically present in a particular geographical subdivision when a signature is scrawled or a word spoken into a telephone mouthpiece. There is nothing in this technicality of relevance to the choice of an appropriate statute for practical compensation purposes.\u201d 4 Larson, supra, \u00a7 87.39, pp. 16-83-16-84. The contract choice of law approach is particularly inappropriate in an action such as this where there is no contract between the parties who are fellow employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Tort Choice oe Law</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The defendant, citing <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Fullin, </em>172 Conn. 407, 411, 374 A.2d 1061 (1977), argues that this court should apply the law of Tennessee, the place where the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were sustained, because the action brought by the plaintiff is a tort. This choice of law rule is also certain and easy to apply. But like the contract choice of law approach, the place-of-the-injury rule affords only an unsatisfactory resolution to the workers\u2019 compensation choice of laws problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The application of Connecticut\u2019s tort choice of law principles to compensation cases would bestow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>upon temporary visitors injured in Connecticut all the relief which the Connecticut compensation act affords, but deny that same relief to Connecticut residents injured while on temporary business outside the state, even when all other incidents of employment, such as in this case, are in Connecticut. Moreover, if this court were to adhere to a strict application of the place-of-the-injury rule, a Connecticut resident and employee of a Connecticut employer under a Connecticut contract, who was injured while on temporary business in another jurisdiction might be left with no tort remedy whatsoever if that other jurisdiction applied a different choice of law rule. For example, if the other jurisdiction applied the contract choice of law rule supported by the plaintiff, the lack of symmetry between the jurisdictions would leave the employee unable to satisfy either state\u2019s choice of law rules and the compensation commissioners unable to award a remedy. 4 Larson, supra \u00a7 84.20, pp. 16-3, 16-7-16-8; see, e.g., <em>House </em>v. <em>State Industrial Accident Commission, </em>167 Or. 257, 117 P.2d 611 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany person who has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer, whether such contract contemplates the performance of duties within or without the state . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-275. Under \u00a7\u00a7 31-293 and 31-293a, such employees may be entitled to damages against fellow employees as well as compensation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The act clearly contemplates an award of damages against the defendant for injuries arising out of and in the course of the plaintiff\u2019s employment while she tem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>porarily performed duties in Tennessee. This is still another reason for rejecting the place-of-the-injury rule argued by the defendant. Given the inapplicability of tort choice of law rules to conflict of laws problems in the workers\u2019 compensation area, there is no reason to discuss the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of Tennessee law or her argument that the rule of lex loci delicti enunciated in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Fullin, </em>supra, 411, and prior cases should be overruled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Workers\u2019 Compensation Choice op Law</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The proper choice of law rules to apply in determining whether the trial court erred in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the special defense are the rules traditionally applied to workers\u2019 compensation conflicts cases. Although there are various widely accepted approaches, all of which have been constructed within the workers\u2019 compensation framework, each of these approaches compels the conclusion that the trial court erred in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike and in rendering summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Washington Gas Light Co., </em>448 U.S. 261, 100 S. Ct. 2647, 65 L. Ed. 2d 757 (1980), the United States Supreme Court adhered to an interests analysis approach to determine whether the District of Columbia could award supplemental benefits to an employee who had already received compensation in the state of Virginia without violating the full faith and credit clause of the United States constitution. The employee was a resident of the District and was hired by a company in the District. Although he worked primarily in the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>triet of Columbia, he also worked in Virginia where he was injured. Virginia law excluded any other remedy \u201cat common law or otherwise\u201d on account of the injury in Virginia. The court held that \u201ca State has no legitimate interest within the context of our federal system in preventing another State from granting a supplemental compensation award when that second State would have had the power to apply its workmen\u2019s compensation law in the first instance. The Full Faith and Credit Clause should not be construed to preclude successive workmen\u2019s compensation awards.\u201d Id., 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">In this case the plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation under Connecticut law. The parties do not question the propriety of such an award. Connecticut\u2019s interest in compensating the injured employee, a Connecticut resident, to the fullest extent possible is clear and legitimate. Connecticut\u2019s other articulable interest lies in permitting the plaintiff\u2019s employer, a Connecticut corporation, to recover from the defendant the amount of compensation already paid or to be paid in the future under General Statutes \u00a7 31-293. Although Tennessee did not in fact award compensation to the plaintiff in this ease, there is no question that Tennessee could have compensated the plaintiff had she applied for compensation there because the state of the injury has an interest in compensating employees injured within its borders. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Lanza, </em>349 U.S. 408, 75 S. Ct. 804, 99 L. Ed. 1183 (1955). To this extent the two states\u2019 interests coincide. Tennessee\u2019s interest in limiting the liability of employers doing business in Tennessee is \u201cnot of controlling importance\u201d; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Washington Gas Light Co., </em>supra, 280; particularly on the facts of this ease. Just as Virginia had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>legitimate interest in preventing the District of Columbia from awarding relief supplemental to that awarded in Virginia, Tennessee has no legitimate interest in preventing Connecticut from providing the injured employee with a right of action for damages against a third party, particularly where both the employee and the alleged tortfeasor are Connecticut residents, the employer is a Connecticut corporation and the employee was hired and is principally employed in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Beyond an interest analysis, both the second Restatement of Conflict of Laws and Professor Larson\u2019s treatise on workers\u2019 compensation; Restatement (Second), 1 Conflict of Laws \u00a7 181; 4 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 87.40, pp. 16-84-16-95; suggest approaches which lead to the same result. The Restatement provides that: \u201cA State of the United States may consistently with the requirements of due process award relief [not merely compensation] to a person under its workmen\u2019s compensation statute, if (a) the person is injured in the State, or (b) the employment is principally located in the State, or (c) the employer supervised the employee\u2019s activities from a place of business in the State, or (d) the State is that of most significant relationship to the contract of employment with respect to the issue of workmen\u2019s compensation under the rules of \u00a7\u00a7 187-188 and 196, or (e) the parties have agreed in the contract of employment or otherwise that their rights should be determined under the workmen\u2019s compensation act of the State, or (f) the State has some other reasonable relationship to the occurrence, the parties and the employment.\u201d Restatement (Second), 1 Conflict of Laws \u00a7 181. On the facts of this case, the right of action provided by the Workers\u2019 Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>pensation Act is clearly available to the plaintiff under (b), (d) or (f) above. The action may also be available to the plaintiff under criterion (c) upon a showing of additional supporting facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">According to Professor Larson, the applicable law in a workers\u2019 compensation case is the law of the place of the employment relation, because \u201cthe existence of the employer-employee relation within the state gives the state an interest in controlling the incidents of that relation, one of which incidents is the right to receive and the obligation to pay compensation.\u201d 4 Larson, supra, \u00a7 87.40, p. 16-84. There is no question that the employment relation in this case exists in Connecticut, not in Tennessee. For all of the foregoing reasons, the right of action provided by the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act cannot be denied the plaintiff by Tennessee law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-11\"> Anthony Simaitis, Catherine Simaitis\u2019 husband, is also a plaintiff.
