Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au0\">After a trial to the jury, the defendant was found guilty of robbery in the second degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (1), and of larceny in the second degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-119 and 53a-123 (a) (1). In his appeal from the judgment rendered thereon, he claims that the court erred in excluding from evidence a third party\u2019s statement against penal interest exculpatory to the defendant, thereby depriving the defendant of his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Those circumstances necessary to set out the factual background include the following: On July 28, 1978, Mark DeMarseilles, who was about to enter his car in a Bridgeport parking garage, was grabbed and robbed by two black males. The assailants fled in DeMarseilles\u2019 car, leaving him at the scene. The defendant was arrested after he was identified by a security guard at the parking garage as the driver of the victim\u2019s vehicle. The guard had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>viewed the occupants of the DeMarseilles car as it sped out of the exit area of the garage. The guard knew the defendant prior to this occasion due to previous altercations. He did not recognize the other robber who was the passenger in the fleeing car. At the trial, the guard also made an in-court identification of the defendant as the driver of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">On December 14, 1978, at the close of the defendant\u2019s case in chief and in the absence of the jury, the defendant made an offer of proof to the court that a person known as \u201cBernie Gant a/k/a Leonard Gant\u201d had committed the robbery charged against the defendant. At that time Charles Samuel testified that on October 31,1978, he and Gant were in the lockup of the Superior Court in Bridgeport. He said that he had a conversation with Gant concerning the defendant and that he asked Gant if the defendant had been in a robbery. Samuel maintained that he then said to Gant: \u201cYou\u2019re the one who got Stanford Frye in jail for the robbery\u201d and that Gant answered: \u201cYes, I did the robbery.\u201d Thereupon, Samuel testified that he told Gant: \u201cYou\u2019re going to straighten that out\u201d and that Gant replied: \u201cNo, that\u2019s his weight. He got to deal with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">At the hearing on the offer of proof, the defense also produced Thomas Ullman, an investigator employed by the public defender\u2019s office. He testified that on December 13, 1978, he went to Gant\u2019s apartment in Bridgeport to attempt to subpoena Gant for the purpose of testifying. Gant was not there but, according to a woman who identified herself as Gant\u2019s mother, \u201c. . . he had just left a short while ago . . . but he would be back.\u201d Ullman left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the subpoena with Mrs. Gant and instructed her to have Gant call him at his office. Gant did call Ullman at about 1:30 p.m. the same day. At that time Ullman informed Gant of the purpose of the subpoena and instructed him to come to the public defender\u2019s office that afternoon or at 10 a.m. the next morning, i.e. December 14, 1978. Gant did not appear at the public defender\u2019s office or in court to testify. The court refused to admit the testimony of Samuel. The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in refusing to admit Samuel\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 426 A.2d 799 (1980), we held that statements against penal interest exculpatory to a defendant were no longer per se inadmissible. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 430 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). In <em>DeFreitas, </em>we adopted a rule consistent with <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973). Courts have extracted from <em>Chambers </em>four general considerations relevant to an investigation of the trustworthiness of a third party confession: \u201c(1) the time of the declaration and the party to whom the declaration was made; (2) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case; (3) the extent to which the declaration is really against the declarant\u2019s penal interest; [and] (4) the availability of the declarant as a witness.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guillette, </em>547 F.2d 743, 754 (2d. Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 839, 98 S. Ct. 132, 54 L. Ed. 2d 102 (1977); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oropeza, </em>564 F.2d 316, 325 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1080, 98 S. Ct. 1276, 55 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1978); <em>Henson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>399 A.2d 16 (D.C. App.), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>444 U.S. 848, 100 S. Ct. 96, 62 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1979); <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>66 Ill. App. 3d 292, 294, 383 N.E.2d 788 (1978). We have recognized that while there can be \u201cno precise formulation of the proof which would constitute sufficient evidence of the trustworthiness of a third party declaration against penal interest, the considerations derived from <em>Chambers </em>indicate the nature of the appropriate inquiry for a trial court faced with the proffer of such a declaration.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 451. The <em>DeFreitas </em>rationale was also in accord with rule 804 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, providing that trustworthy third party statements against penal interest exculpatory to a defendant are admissible if the declarant is unavailable. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 451-52; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 628-29. The state claims that Samuel\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted because there was not a sufficient showing of either the unavailability of the declarant or the trustworthiness of the statement. Since we hold that Gant was not shown to be unavailable, we need not reach the issue of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Exceptions to the hearsay rule have been based on circumstances which demonstrate both the necessity for admitting the statement and the reliability and trustworthiness of the statement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 440; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>107 Conn. 287, 289, 140 A. 486 (1928). The necessity factor, we have said, is reflected in the prerequisite that the declarant be unavailable. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 441-47; see <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Smazer, </em>151 Conn. 226, 232, 196 A.2d 432 (1963). Thus, in <em>DeFreitas, </em>we noted that the threshold requirement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for admitting third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>party declarations against penal interest is the unavailability of the declarant. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 440. Absent a showing by the proponent of the proffered hearsay statement of the unavailability of the declarant, the declarant\u2019s statement will be excluded from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The most common forms of unavailability are those set out in rule 804 (a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Fed. R. Evid., rule 804. Rule 804(a) lists five situations in which the declarant witness may be considered unavailable: (1) the court has determined that the witness has a testimonial privilege; (2) the witness persists in refusing to testify despite a court order to do so; (3) the witness has a lack of memory; (4) the witness is unable to be present or testify because of death or existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; and (5) the witness is \u201cabsent from the hearing and the proponent of his statement has been unable to procure his attendance . . . [or testimony] <em>by process or other reasonable </em>means.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) We note that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>onr criminal rnles, in determining whether or not a deposition is admissible into evidence because the deponent is claimed to be \u201cunavailable,\u201d the term \u201cunavailable\u201d is defined almost identically to include those situations set out in federal rule 804(a). See Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 789-804, especially \u00a7\u00a7 793, 803.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have decided to employ the definition set out in rule 804(a) in determining the unavailability of a witness where the admissibility of statements against penal interest is in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>In this case, the only situation which is even arguably fulfilled in rule 804(a) is the last. Even in this regard, however, the defendant did not demonstrate that Gant was unavailable as a witness. The defendant, who was represented by the public defender\u2019s office, had access to the ordinary process by which the attendance of witnesses in court is required, i.e. the subpoena. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-143; see also 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Witnesses \u00a7 9. Although Ullman went to Gant\u2019s apartment to serve him with a subpoena, no claim is made that the subpoena was validly served on Gant, the absent witness. Rather, because Gant was not at his apartment, the subpoena was left with Mrs. Gant. Other than leaving instructions for Gant to call, and, upon later receiving Gant\u2019s call, directing Gant to appear at the public defender\u2019s office that afternoon or on the next day, nothing further was done to attempt to obtain service on him or to assure his attendance in court. Gant was in Bridgeport, the trial was taking place in Bridgeport. Had Gant actually been served, either on the initial attempt or thereafter, and refused to appear, the court, upon proof of service, had authority to issue a capias for him. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-143; <em>DiPalma </em>v. <em>Wiesen, </em>163 Conn. 293, 298, 303 A.2d 709 (1972). There is no indication that a continuance was requested for the purpose of exhausting reasonable efforts to find him. Mrs. Gant did tell the investigator that Gant had just left and was expected back. There is no indication that the defense requested that either the court or the state aid it in attempting to produce Gant. See <em>United States ex rel. Hunter </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>374 F. Sup. 608, 610 (S.D.N.Y. 1974). A defendant must exercise a reasonably diligent attempt to serve an absent witness where he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>access to proper process. See <em>United States ex rel. Hunter </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 611; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>67 S.D. 481, 294 N.W. 174 (1940); see generally 22A C.J.S., Criminal Law \u00a7 503(b). We conclude that Gant was not unavailable as a witness because the defendant has not demonstrated that he was unable to procure Gant\u2019s attendance at the trial by process or other reasonable means.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> Encompassed within this basie claim is the defendant\u2019s assertion that the court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because of the exclusion of the claimed declaration against penal interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\"> la <em>DeFreitas </em>we noted that \u201c[i]n the scores of eases decided since <em>Chambers </em>[v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.

Ed. 2d 297 (1973)], which have considered the question of admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>bility of third party declarations against penal interest, we have been unable to find a case, nor has the defendant provided us with a citation, where an appellate court has dispensed with the unavailability of the declarant as a condition precedent to admitting such declarations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 443, 426 A.2d 799 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\"> Rule 804 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, entitled \u201cHearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable,\u201d provides in section (a) : \u201cDefinition of unavailability.
