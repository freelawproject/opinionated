The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-23\">This court and the district court are, of course, bound by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Acts of Congress. With this in mind, we turn first to the claim against the State of New Jersey. The United States Supreme Court \u201chas recognized that an unconsenting State is immune from federal-court suits brought by its own citizens as well as by citizens of another State.\u201d Parden v. Terminal Ry. of Alabama, 377 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). There is no suggestion here that the State of New Jersey has consented to be sued in the federal court in this action. Consequently, it was immune from suit here in the district court and that court properly so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-24\">Plaintiff also sued Chief Justice Joseph Weintraub of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. Plaintiff bases his right to sue, in part, on the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983). The United States Supreme Court has held that the common law immunity of a state judge from liability for judicial acts was not abolished by such Act. Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967). The same immunity, in our view, applies to actions asserted under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331 (Federal question). Thus, so far as appears, Joseph Weintraub as Chief Justice, was immune from suit here as the district court correctly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-25\">Plaintiff says that he is suing Joseph Weintraub as an \u201cindividual\u201d and thus the judicial immunity cases are not in point. The only possible basis for such jurisdiction would be found in the so-called diversity statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332. But that statute requires, inter alia, that the controversy be between \u201ccitizens of different States.\u201d Here, so far as appears, both plaintiff and Joseph Weintraub are citizens of New Jersey. Thus, the district court had no diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Nor do we find any basis here for the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he was entitled to have this case heard by a three judge federal district court under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2284. There is no suggestion that any Act of Congress gives him such a right under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\">We therefore conclude that the district court was required to and properly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
