The Board\u2019s finding of a duty to bargain having been founded entirely upon the alleged 8(a) (1) violations occurring before the election, it, therefore, cannot stand. The certification of Local 291, based on the alleged unfair labor practices, discussed above and arising in the Board case No. 13-CA-6492, is set aside. We do not reach or in any manner deal with the petitioner\u2019s effort to obtain a review in this case from Board case No. 13-RC-10492.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-22\">The inconsequential nature of the one alleged 8(a) (1) violation which was proved without dispute (the other party to the conversation having died before trial) makes it inappropriate to enforce an order of the Board dealing with a situation that cannot by its very nature reoccur.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-23\">Enforcement is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
