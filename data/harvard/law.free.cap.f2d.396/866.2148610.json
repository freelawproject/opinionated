Cumberland Farms, Inc., 1 Cir., 1966, 370 F.2d 54. We have considered the Board\u2019s supplemental decision and order and cannot say that its position is unjustified. As we noted at the oral argument of this case, the criteria relied upon by the employer to separate the in-plant production employees from the various out-of-plant employees would, in turn, tend to require the latter to be themselves subdivided into more than one unit. Under the circumstances recited by the Board we are not prepared to overrule its selection of a single unit for the entire group. At the same time we are obliged to agree with the respondent that the Board\u2019s effort to distinguish the factual situation here from that in E. H. Koester Bakery Co., 136 N.L.R.B. 1006 (1962) (where the Board refused to include truck drivers with the in-plant employees) is not very convincing. On balance, however, we are of the opinion that the Board has wide discretion in choosing among appropriate units and that minor factual differences may be sufficient to justify opposite results.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
