Although appellant took no administrative appeal from the board\u2019s decision, he urges that the draft board procedure denied him certain constitutional rights, including the right to counsel, right against self-incrimination, and right to confrontation of witnesses. We affirm because \u201call of appellant\u2019s contentions are foreclosed by his failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d DuVernay v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 979. Appellant\u2019s final assertion, that the government failed to prove that he was called to civilian service in proper sequence, is foreclosed by our recent decisions in Pigue v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 389 F.2d 765; Lowe v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 389 F.2d 51; Greer v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 378 F.2d 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
