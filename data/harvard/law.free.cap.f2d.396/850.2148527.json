The case was tried to a jury which was given seven special interrogatories. The jury answered interrogatories 1 and 2 by finding no unseaworthiness and no negligence on defendant\u2019s part. It therefore did not reach the other issues presented. Accordingly, the district court entered judgment for the defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">The first error asserted by plaintiff relates to certain court instructions given to the jury with respect to interrogatory 2. That interrogatory reads: \u201cWas there any negligence on the part of the defendant shipowner on November 5, 1962, acting through its agents, officers and employees, which was a substantial factor in causing the injuries to plaintiff, Lonnie W. Lowry, Sr. ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">In the trial court the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contended repeatedly that there was no evidence upon which an issue of contributory negligence could be submitted to the jury. When he raised the issue once again on a motion for a new trial, the district court, 284 F.Supp. 640, disposed of it in the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-11\">\u201cBecause it has been determined that plaintiff could have suffered no prejudice from the challenged instructions, it is unnecessary to rule on the sufficiency of the evidence of contributory negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">In view of the district court\u2019s approach, consideration must be given to plaintiff\u2019s contention, made below, that the jury was given an erroneous instruction of material importance regarding interrogatory 2. That interrogatory required the jury to determine whether or not defendant\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The court instructed the jury that \u201c* * * if you found that the sole negligence was that of the plaintiff, then you would answer this question [interrogatory 2] \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d Though the interrogatory was not directed to plaintiff\u2019s negligence, because of the use of \u201csole,\u201d the charge was not erroneous as a matter of logic. Obviously if plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of his injury, the negligence of the defendant, if any, could not have been a cause thereof. This was really the rationale of Donovan v. Esso Shipping Co., 259 F.2d 65 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 907, 79 S.Ct. 583, 3 L.Ed.2d 572 (1958). Thus, had the court stopped at that point no cognizable harm would have been done. But the court later in the charge repeated the substance of the quoted language and, unfortunately, added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-14\">\u201c* * * Obviously, if you find that the plaintiff was careless, that he swung his leg over there too fast, and that caused him to fall, that because all these people went down without incident, and because you accept Mr. Keeler\u2019s testimony as to the impossibility of his own story of how it happened, and so on, then there would be no fault on the part of the shipowner.\u201d '<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">Having in mind that interrogatory 2 required the jury to determine whether defendant was negligent, the jury is told by the court that a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>as to negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part \u2014 -not sole negligence \u2014 required a \u201cno\u201d answer to the interrogatory. The language after the word \u201cObviously\u201d took from the jury any issue as to comparative negligence. Since it is not challenged that the evidence presented a jury issue as to defendant\u2019s negligence, the portion of the charge in question might well have caused the jury to think that a negative answer to the interrogatory was required regardless of any negligence on defendant\u2019s part. Indeed, the jury\u2019s possible confusion could have been compounded by the fact that such instruction concerning the effect of plaintiff\u2019s negligence was given in connection with an interrogatory directed solely to the issue of defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\"> The district court states that \u201cProperly read\u201d the instructions suggest a finding in defendant\u2019s favor if the jury should find that the accident was not caused by any negligence on its part. Recognizing that a charge must be read as a whole, it nevertheless appears that the jury could well have understood that a finding of negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part precluded a finding of any negligence by defendant. Since this, of course, is not the law and since it was a material issue in the case, a new trial is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Since there must be a new trial, it would seem desirable to consider plaintiff\u2019s contention that the evidence did not justify the submission of an issue of contributory negligence to the jury. A bit of factual background is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">On the morning of the accident, November 5, 1962, plaintiff began to descend into the lower hold of defendant\u2019s ship. To do this he had to climb over the coaming at the after end of the hatch. He then had to get his feet into the foothold on the inside of the coaming. He could then proceed down the ladder. On the outside of the coaming there were two blocks and a group of guy wires which descended in the shape of a truncated \u201cV\u201d. These lines were secured on the outside of the coaming at the place where the longshoreman had to climb over the coaming to start down the ladder. The plaintiff was the third man in the gang to go down on the morning of the accident. He testified that he inserted his right foot in the top foothold on the inside of the coaming. He then grasped the top of the coaming with both hands and started to swing his left leg over. As he was doing this, his left foot struck the group of guy wires on his left causing him to lose his balance and fall into the hold. There were no eye-witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">We now consider the possible evidence of plaintiff\u2019s negligence:</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">1. Two larger men preceded plaintiff down the ladder without incident and an eight-man gang went up and down twice that day without incident. It is not apparent how this evidence would create a jury issue as to plaintiff\u2019s negligence. It would certainly require speculation to convert it into affirmative evidence that plaintiff must therefore have been negligent in some way.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">2. The plaintiff had been out of work for about two weeks in October because of a chest cold and had worked only ten hours the week before the accident. There was no evidence of plaintiff\u2019s possible weakened condition on the day of the accident. Indeed, we cannot even tell from the record whether he was ill at all during the week prior to the accident. All we know is that he worked ten hours that week. This evidence lacked probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">3. Plaintiff had a cloth bag containing clothing strapped over his shoulders. He testified that his hands were free. There is not a shred of evidence indicating that the bag contributed to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">4. Defendant\u2019s expert testified that plaintiff would not have fallen into the hold had the accident happened as plaintiff described it. Assuming that the expert made an accurate assumption concerning the testimony, it is not apparent how his testmony constituted affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>tive evidence of plaintiff\u2019s possible negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">5. Plaintiff testified that he \u201cspun\u201d or \u201cswung\u201d his left leg around in going over the top. The uncontradicted evidence was that this really was the normal way to get over the coaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">It thus appears that the evidence relied upon by defendant, whether viewed separately or cumulatively, lacked the probative quality to create a jury issue as to plaintiff\u2019s negligence. If then, on a new trial, the evidence is of the same quality, the issue of contributory negligence should not be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\"> The plaintiff next contends, as he did below, that it was error for the district court, in instructing the jury concerning the doctrine of unseaworthiness, to tell them that they might find that plaintiff suffered his injuries as a result of an unavoidable accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The concept of \u201cunavoidable accident\u201d implies the need to find \u201cfault\u201d as a prerequisite to liability. Compare Yanow v. Weyerhaeuser Steamship Co., 250 F.2d 74 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 937, 78 S.Ct. 779, 2 L.Ed.2d 812 (1958). It is therefore at war with the absolute warranty of seaworthiness. Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 80 S. Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The defendant argues most vigorously that it was not error for the trial court to charge, as it did, that defendant did not have the duty to furnish an accident-free vessel. But plaintiff does not so contend. Plaintiff is complaining about the instruction concerning \u201cunavoidable accident\u201d not \u201caccident-free vessel.\u201d The two concepts are significantly different, the former implying absence of fault generally and the latter relating to the extent of the shipowner\u2019s duty. In the present context the first was objectionable, the second was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">It follows that it was error to give this instruction at least with respect to the issue of unseaworthiness posed by interrogatory 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Plaintiff also claims error in the district court\u2019s refusal to permit him to introduce testimony to rebut defendant\u2019s evidence as to the condition on the deck adjacent to the ladder. A review of the record shows real confusion in the development of this issue by the parties. Since there is to be a retrial, it seems preferable to permit this matter to be developed in orderly fashion. The trial judge can then decide whether the evidence is relevant to any issues properly in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-12\">. While not in issue on this appeal, the defendant did file a third party complaint against the stevedoring company by whom plaintiff was employed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-16\">. After plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the words \u201ctoo fast,\u201d the court recalled the jury and instructed them that they should be governed by their own recollection and that he didn\u2019t \u201crecollect any direct evidence of that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b899-21\">. \u201cYou understand that there can be unavoidable accidents. That happens.'</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
