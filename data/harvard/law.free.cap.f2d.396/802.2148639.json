The able presentation of this claim by presently assigned counsel has not convinced us that representation here fell short of constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Defense counsel had a week or ten days after his appointment in which to prepare for trial. The district court found that counsel had visited and consulted with his client at least once during Nowakowski\u2019s pretrial incarceration. The district court also reviewed in some detail the course of the trial and concluded that the conduct of the defense satisfied the constitutional requirement of adequate representation. Our independent study of the record leads us to sustain that finding and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-17\">. This question is fully discussed in Judge Kalodner\u2019s dissenting opinion at an earlier stage of this litigation. United States ex rel. Nowakowski v. Maroney, 3 Cir., 387 F.2d 324, decided Dec. 28, 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
