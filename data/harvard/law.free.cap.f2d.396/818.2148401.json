A review of the transcript of the hearing below, and of the record as a whole, leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law were not clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
