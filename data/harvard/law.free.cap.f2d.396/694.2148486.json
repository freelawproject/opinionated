The only question raised on this appeal is whether the testimonial record of a prior proceeding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against Atlantic, involving the same stock fraud on which the Commission\u2019s order against petitioner was based, was properly admitted into evidence in this proceeding. Since the witnesses who testified in the prior proceeding were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>made available to petitioner for cross-examination, we find no error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The rules applicable to conventional judicial proceedings are not necessarily applicable to administrative proceedings. In a matter such as this one, involving charges of fraud and manipulation in the issuance of stock, with a lengthy record, it was within the Commission\u2019s discretion to receive the transcribed testimony, while still comporting with fairness to petitioner by offering the opportunity to cross-examine any witness whose transcribed testimony was so received.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-17\">. The Commission\u2019s order was issued pursuant to \u00a7 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(b) (1964 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-18\">. Petitioner was notified in the prior proceeding that, as an associate of Atlantic, under Commission Rule 9(b) he had a right to participate. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.-9(b) (Supp.1968). He declined. <em>See </em>Wallach v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 108, 202 F.2d 462 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b741-15\">. <em>See </em>A.L.I., Model Code of Evidence, Rule 503 (1942); 5 J.
