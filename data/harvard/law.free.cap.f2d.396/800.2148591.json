Joseph M. PETTIS, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b846-5\">No. 18236.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b846-6\">United States Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b846-7\">June 21, 1968.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b846-13\">Boyce F.

Both payees testified that they did not receive the cheeks or cash them. The record is blank as to the actual occurrences between the time the checks were placed in the mails and the time they were presented for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-19\">The government\u2019s proof of defendant\u2019s illegal possession of the checks consisted of the facts above, plus defendant\u2019s fingerprints on the checks and evidence that the endorsement on the back of each check was in his handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">A jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio having convicted defendant on both counts, he was sentenced to three years on each count, to be served consecutively. His appeal from the denial of his motion to correct sentence concerns solely the question as to whether or not the offenses here charged in two counts were in fact unitary under the doctrine of Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-21\">We believe that the act of possessing these two stolen checks was not \u201ca single transaction\u201d within the meaning of <em>Bell </em>(Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 84, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955)) and that the testimony required in this case to establish the offenses charged in the two counts \u201cwas certainly not identical.\u201d United States v. Bennett, 383 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 972, 88 S.Ct. 1077, 19 L.Ed.2d 1184 (1968); Wilburn v. United States, 326 F.2d 903 (5th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
