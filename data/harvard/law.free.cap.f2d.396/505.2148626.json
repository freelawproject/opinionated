We find the affidavit sufficient to establish the validity of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-21\">The affiant, an Alcoholic Beverage Control officer, stated in the affidavit, (1) that an informant who had given him reliable information in the past had on April 12, 1967 informed him that he had observed \u201cnon-taxpaid whiskey\u201d at appellant\u2019s residence and also had seen a truck loaded with sugar go to the residence; (2) the officer had on several occasions observed appellant\u2019s residence and had seen an \u201cunusual amount of traffic\u201d entering and leaving; and (3) that on one occasion the officer had detected the odor of whiskey and mash coming from the residence. Under the principles enunciated in United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684, and McCray v. State of Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 87 S.Ct. 1056,18 L.Ed. 2d 62, these statements provided the magistrate with probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. Therefore, the evidence obtained by means of a search pursuant to the warrant was properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">Upon notice of appeal appellant\u2019s sentence was amended by the District Court. On motion of appellant with the concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>rence of appellee and the District Court, the amendment is vacated and the original sentence is hereby reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Conviction affirmed; amendment of original sentence vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
