As to surface water, the owner of the higher lot has no right to concentrate and collect it and cause it to be discharged in quantities and in such manner as would be different from that in which the water would be received by the lower estate if it simply ran down upon it from the upper by the law of gravitation. Gill v. First Christian Church, 216 Ga. 454, 117 S.E.2d 164 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">A review of the record shows that there was ample evidence to authorize the trial court to conclude that Appellant improperly collected and discharged surface waters and that such act was the proximate cause of the damages to Appellee\u2019s wall and building.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The proper measure of damages to be awarded in such a situation is the amount necessary to put the Appellee\u2019s improvements in the same useable and safe condition which existed prior to the damage. City of Macon v. Hawes, 27 Ga.App. 379, 108 S.E. 479 (1921). The fact that the original retaining wall was separate from the building and in reconstruction the wall was made an integral part of the building is of no significance for the reason that the evidence supported the conclusion of the trial court that the situation created by the acts of Appellant would result in the subsequent collapse of any separate retaining wall which might be reconstructed identical with the original one, and that the proper measure of damages was that necessary for the Appellee to reconstruct upon its land a building of which the retaining wall was an integral part which would serve the same purpose and to the same degree of safety as that originally built would have done but for the acts of Appellant. The amount of the judgment thus entered was supported by the evidence. Certainly it cannot be said that the award was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Appellant also complains that it was not placed on notice of the excavation undertaken by Appellee before the retaining wall was erected, contending that such notice was required by \u00a7 85-1203 of the Georgia Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such notice was not prerequisite to an assertion of a claim for damages in the circumstances in this case. In any event, there is no evidence that Appellant sustained any damages from failure of such notice to it by Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">. \u201cThe owner of adjoining land has the right, on giving reasonable notice of his intention so to do, to make proper and needful excavations even up to the boundary line for purposes of construction, using ordinary care and taking reasonable precautions to sustain the land of the other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
