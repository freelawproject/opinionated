ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b978-27\">Joseph N. Emmett, while a patient in the appellee hospital, died intestate on July 23, 1964. In this litigation, inaugurated April 15, 1966, our appellant, the decedent\u2019s son and administrator, charges that the hospital and its co-appellee, the decedent\u2019s attending physician, were negligent in the care and treatment of the decedent, thereby caus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>ing his death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As dealt with m the proceedings under review, appellant\u2019s suit is for damages under both the Survival<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Wrongful Death <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">By our local law, actions for negligent personal injury may be brought within three years,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but those for wrongful death must be commenced within one year following death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With appellant\u2019s case in the latter aspect thus jeopardized, he alleged that appellees bore, a confidential relationship to the decedent and his family but nonetheless on numerous occasions \u201cwillfully and wrongfully withheld\u201d the decedent\u2019s medical records from appellant\u2019s examination \u201cfor the purpose of preventing\u201d him \u201cfrom obtaining any information regarding the circumstances of\u201d the death. Continuing, appellant stated that he was unable to get into court within the one-year period because of appellees\u2019 conduct in \u201cconcealing the facts so as to prevent the plaintiff from obtaining knowledge thereof and so as to prevent the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s family from obtaining knowledge of the wrongful acts of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Appellees, prior to answering, moved for dismissal, and alternatively for summary judgment, on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the death claim was fatally untimely. On that much of the case the District Court awarded summary judgment in appellees\u2019 favor,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>allegations tendering factual issues which if material necessitated a trial,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> our task is to decide whether the circumstances charged could operate to toll the limitation period the Wrongful Death Act specifies. Concluding in the affirmative, we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">We first consider appellees\u2019 twin contentions that appellant was not entitled to inspect the decedent\u2019s medical records and that they were not obliged to make them available to him. Both the challenge to appellant\u2019s right and the asserted absence of duty rest upon the theory that the physician-patient privilege required appellees to preserve the confidentiality of the records against all save the decedent\u2019s \u201clegal representative.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant had not been appointed his father\u2019s administrator when his several demands for examination were made, and appellees say that the preexisting parental relationship was not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-20\">Even if we were persuaded that the privilege obtains in the situation at bar, we would find this argument unacceptable. Certainly a duly qualified personal representative, when there is one, is the decedent\u2019s \u201clegal representative\u201d for purposes of gathering information with a view to prosecuting a wrongful death claim,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but this does not mean that the information may with impunity be withheld from the decedent\u2019s immediate family. The quoted term, we have said, \u201crefers to the persons who are entitled to enforce the particular substantive right of the patient which is involved in a particular case.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>Thus we have held that an intestate grantor\u2019s heirs seeking to annul a conveyance of realty on the ground of mental incapacity could, as against the grantee, waive the ancestor\u2019s privilege.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And while a suit for wrongful death must be brought by the decedent\u2019s personal representative,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> ****it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>solely for the benefit of \u201cthe spouse and the next of kin of the deceased person.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In our view, a son and only child has so vital an identification with any cause of action potentially arising upon his father\u2019s negligently caused demise as would enable him to waive the privilege as to pertinent medical data when there is no personal representative to act in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">We think, too, that the statute defining the physician-patient privilege is inapposite here. In terms it operates only \u201c[i]n the courts of the District of Columbia,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and this lawsuit had not taken shape when appellant asked that the records be made accessible. To his endeavor neither the letter nor the spirit of the statute had application.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">The responsibilities of physicians and hospitals to protect their patients\u2019 medical facts from extrajudicial exposure spring from the confidential nature of the relationship. We find in the fiducial qualities of that relationship the physician\u2019s duty to reveal to the patient that which in his best interests it is important that he should know.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And we would consider anomalous in this age any rule that would immunize from a similar obligation a hospital which is the repository of such knowledge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">This duty of disclosure, we hold, extends after the patient\u2019s death to his next of kin.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To be sure, medical pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>fessionals can and should vigilantly safeguard the patient\u2019s secrets from unauthorized scrutiny.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> They may, prudently and conscientiously, take such precautions, including suitable identification, as may be necessary to enable determination of the propriety of a requested revelation, and we would consider qualifiedly privileged any divulgenee reasonably made to one apparently entitled to it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But we could not justify a refusal to yield the information to a qualified recipient, whether or not it stems from the dictates of self-protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">While it is well settled that fraudulent concealment of the existence of a cause of action tolls the running of a conventional statute of limitation,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> its effect upon the type of time proscription contained in the Wrongful Death Act is not so clear. We have had occasion to note, although as to this legislation not yet to follow,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-17\">\u201c* * * a line of opposing authority which takes the view that as to rights of action of a purely statutory nature, such as the so-called wrongful death statutes, the time thereby prescribed for filing suit operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created by the statute, and not of the remedy alone. It is deemed to be a condition attached to the right to sue. As such, time has been made of the essence of the right, which is lost if the time is disregarded. The liability and the remedy being created by the same statute, limitation of the remedy must be treated as limitation of the right.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWH\">And one finds a number of cases holding, adherently to this analysis, that the period within which a wrongful death action must be brought is not extended by concealment of the facts which give rise to it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>*</p>\n<p id=\"b982-18\">Many courts, however, have dissented from the proposition that a limitation incorporated into a death action statute cannot on an appropriate occasion be suspended.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A few have specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>held that fraudulent concealment of information the moving party needs in order to determine whether there is a litigable dispute is just such an occasion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This position we accept in lieu of a counterpoint so conceptualistic as to obscure both logic and fairness. As we have pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-4\">\u201cIt has often been said that a primary purpose of statutes of limitations in general has been the prevention of fraud. It is freely conceded by appellee here that fraud will toll the running of the so-called remedial statute of limitations. We cannot see a distinction and a difference, so clear and so real, between the two classes of statutes of limitations \u2014 the remedial and the substantive \u2014 as to justify the courts in fully giving effect to fraud in tolling the statute in one type (remedial) and then flatly denying that effect to fraud in the other type (substantive). The ancient maxim that no one should profit by his own conscious wrong is too deeply imbedded in the framework of our law to be set aside by a legalistic distinction between the closely related types of statutes of limitations,\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">Moreover, in Holmberg v. Armbrecht<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the Supreme Court declared that the doctrine of tolling by fraudulent concealment \u201cis read into every federal statute of limitation,\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and we do not feel at liberty to disregard so explicit and unqualified a statement.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Instead, we take it as an admonition to be observed in all instances, irrespective of the nature of the statute as substantive or procedural,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> unless a contrary congressional purpose is evident.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">It is clear that when summary judgment was granted there was a genuine factual issue on the resolution of which depended the efficacy of the statutory limitation to bar the death claim. Surely proof of appellant\u2019s allegations that appellees\u2019 refusal to permit him to canvass the records was evilly motivated, and that it prevented timely institution of suit, would meet the highest standards the law could exact. And with the fiduciary relationship and concomitant obligation of disclosure we find here, it would suffice to show an unprivileged refusal to release properly requested information so material in character that knowledge of a basis for, or intelligent prosecution of, the cause of action was precluded.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Of course, we venture no prediction as to the capabilities of appellant\u2019s evidence to bring success to his litigious efforts. It is enough that appellant, by appropriate allegations, tell us that he wishes to try.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">We call attention, however, to the fact that a fraudulent concealment tolls a statute of limitation only for so long as the concealment endures <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and, as we have held, that \u201c[o]ne well established defense to a claim of fraudulent concealment is that the plaintiff knew, or by the exercise of due diligence could have known, that he may have had a cause of action.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In this connection we note from the record that, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s earlier insistence upon perusal of the medical records appellees kept, he filed his suit, without any consultation with those records, on information derived from independent sources. The significance of this fact, viewed in the totality of all circumstances,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> will deserve careful attention upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">We need add only that we have remained mindful of the consideration that in particular instances the beneficiary of contemplated wrongful death litigation may accommodate an erroneous assertion of medical privilege by securing his appointment as personal representative of the decedent, but we do not feel that such a course is required. The decedent here was without assets at death and, so far as we know, grounds for litigation were not apparent, so there was then no practical reason for an administration. Indeed, the availability of that alternative in this case is open to question. Letters of administration may be granted only where the intestate dies \u201cleaving real or personal estate\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and here the decedent left no estate at all. We have held that an assertible claim for wrongful death supports a grant of administration,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> but we have not held that the bare possibility that such a claim may develop through further exploration meets the statutory prerequisites.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Neither we nor the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Court, however, need undertake a decision of the question. Any showing that might entitle appellant to prevail must necessarily establish a violation of an obligation appellees owed appellant to place the decedent\u2019s medical records at his disposal. And we are unwilling to hold that one to whom a duty to disclose medical data is already owed is compelled by the rule of reasonable diligence to engage in legal proceedings to attain a loftier status.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">We reverse the judgment from which this appeal is taken and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">BASTIAN, Senior Circuit Judge, did not participate in the decision or opinion in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-5\">. The plaintiffs designated by the original complaint were appellant, as the decedent\u2019s son and administrator, and appellant\u2019s mother, as the surviving wife. Appellant was not appointed administrator, however, until April 19, 1906, four days after the suit was instituted. The District Court, on appellees\u2019 motions, dismissed the original complaint with leave to present an amended complaint which appellant, as sole plaintiff, filed on June 22, 1986, stating therein that the action was brought in his representative capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\">.

We have found no case precisely in point, apparently because it is not often that an attending physician and a hospital would withhold information concerning a patient\u2019s last illness and death from his close relatives, but for us the proposition stated in the text is the only sound conclusion which could follow. The duty of disclosure is a concomitant of the patient\u2019s inescapable reliance upon the unadulterated good faith <em>as </em>well as the professional skill of those to whom lie has entrusted his treatment.
