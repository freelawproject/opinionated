Although a massive assault is made here on the convictions, only one point need be considered and then only briefly since it now has been authoritatively assured in the affirmative by the Supreme Court in Marchetti v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889. Do the requirements of the Federal Wagering Tax Stamp statutes violate the appellants\u2019 privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment? We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">Appellants were allegedly engaged in accepting wagers in Florida. That State has a comprehensive statutory system of regulation and prohibition in this area, see Fla.Stats. 849.01-.46, F.S.A., and in fact makes the possession of a Federal Wagering Tax Stamp prima facie evidence of violation of Florida\u2019s gambling laws. Fla.Stat. 849.051, F.S.A. Thus it is apparent that the payment of the tax by Appellants would have presented \u201csubstantial and \u2018real,\u2019 and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination.\u201d Marchetti v. United States, supra, 390 U.S. at 53, 88 S.Ct. at 705, 19 L.Ed. 2d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-18\">At oral argument counsel for the government admitted that if Kahriger<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Lewis<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were overruled by the Supreme Court, the convictions must be reversed. The decision in <em>Marchetti </em>did just that, and we perceive nothing that takes this case outside the scope of the complete defense afforded by the decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently the case must be reversed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the usual directions to dismiss the indictment. See Boehm v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 978; Leonard v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 586; Motley v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 590; Sklaroff v.

In this record there is not the least possible basis for even supposing that the government could show a knowing waiver of this subsequently recognized constitutional right. Under our power to dispose of cases \u201cas may be just under the circumstances,\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2106, in the interest of sound judicial considerations, and following the recent action in numerous of these cases we believe reversal of the convictions is the only proper course to follow \u201cin order to obviate further and entirely unnecessary proceedings below.\u201d Grosso v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 715, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, 914.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
