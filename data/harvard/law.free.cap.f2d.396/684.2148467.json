On March 11, 1965, more than six years after first publication of the foreign edition in France, appellant submitted to appellee an application for registration of a claim to ad interim copyright in the foreign edition. On the same date he submitted an application for registration of a claimed copyright in an American edition of \u201cCandy\u201d which was substantially the same text as the French edition. On March 31, 1965, the Copyright Office refused to register either the claimed ad interim copyright for the French edition or the claim to copyright in the American edition, stating as its reason failure to comply with the provisions of Sections 16,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 22<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 23 of the Coypright Code, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16, 22, 23 (1964). On June 25, 1965, appellant filed the present action in the District Court to compel the Register of Copyrights to issue a certificate of registration covering only the 1964 American edition. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted the Register\u2019s motion, denied appellant\u2019s motion, and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Except when the ad interim provisions of Sections 22 and 23 are met, Section 16 of the Copyright Code allows copyright registration of English-language books by United States citizens only where the first publication is printed in the United States. Implementing these provisions of the Copyright Code pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 (1964), in 1956 the Register of Copyrights promulgated the following regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-14\"><em>\u201cAd interim registrations. </em>(1) An American edition of an English-language book or periodical identical in substance to that first published abroad will not be registered unless an ad interim registration is first made.\u201d 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.4(b) (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGm\">Since the novel \u201cCandy\u201d was first published and printed <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *abroad in the English language and there is no ad interim registration of that edition, registration of the American edition was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">A regulation, of course, is presumptively valid and ordinarily should be upheld unless it is inconsistent with the statute. New York Foreign Freight Forwarders &amp; Brokers Ass\u2019n v. F.M.C., 2 Cir., 337 F.2d 289, 295 (1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 910, 914, 85 S.Ct. 893, 13 L.Ed.2d 797 (1965). The above regulation is not only not inconsistent with the pertinent sections of the Copyright Code, but in our judgment it accurately reflects the intention of Congress. <em>Compare </em>United States v. Zazove, 334 U.S. 602, 611, 68 S.Ct. 1284, 92 L.Ed. 1601 (1948). Even if there were some doubt, we would be required to resolve that doubt in favor of the Register\u2019s interpretation. Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\">Circuit Judge BURGER concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\">. Section 16 requires generally that for an English-language hook to be registered for copyright in the United States it must be printed in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\">. Section 22 requires that the application for ad interim copyright of a foreign edition of an English-language book be made within six months after publication abroad.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-19\">. Appellee concedes that, where a foreign edition is printed in the United States, a subsequent American edition may be registered without compliance with the ad interim provisions of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a722 and 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
