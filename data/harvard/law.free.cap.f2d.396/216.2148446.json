The state brought charges against appellant in the juvenile court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *seeking to have him declared a delinquent child solely on the basis of the non-fatal assault. Appellant\u2019s counsel filed a supplemental petition presenting the fatal assault to the court. The state moved to strike this petition, but the court denied the motion after considering arguments and authorities submitted by both sides. Although the court suggested that an appeal would be appropriate, the state did not challenge the court\u2019s denial of its motion. The juvenile court then heard testimony concerning both offenses, accepted appellant\u2019s confession to both crimes, and adjudged him a delinquent child on the basis of both the assault and the murder. Appellant was committed to the control of the Texas Youth Council until his twenty-first birthday. However, when appellant reached the age of seventeen he was indicted, tried and convicted as an adult of murder with malice in the killing of Linda Ruble, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Appellant has unsuccessfully sought relief on both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>state and federal levels contending that his conviction for murder with malice subjected him to double jeopardy and denied him due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The Supreme Court, although it has had recent opportunity to do so, Chicos v. State of Indiana, 1966, 385 U.S. 76, 87-S.Ct. 271, 17 L.Ed.2d 175, has not rejected the principle enunciated in Palko v. State of Connecticut, 1937, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not impose on the states the federal double jeopardy standard of the Fifth Amendment. However, Palko also teaches that the state may not \u201cviolate those \u2018fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions.\u2019 \u201d Palko v. State of Connecticut, supra, at 328, 58 S.Ct. at 153. Being of the opinion that the state\u2019s actions in this case do not meet the test of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we do not reach the double jeopardy question.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The federal and state courts in Texas have in recent years considered whether the procedure to which appellant was subjected violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Both courts have agreed that \u201cA juvenile cannot \u2018be adjudged a delinquent child and held in custody as such, and, without regard to how he may respond to the guidance and control afforded him under the [Texas] Juvenile Act, be indicted, tried, and convicted of the identical offense after he reaches the age of 17.\u2019 Garza v. State, (Tex.Cr.App.1963) 369 S.W.2d 36, 39.\u201d Sawyer v. Hauck, W.D .Texas 1965, 245 F. Supp. 55, <em>57.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Texas Court in <em>Garza </em>and the District Court below attempted to distinguish appellant\u2019s situation because appellant\u2019s attorney rather than the state had presented the murder charge to the Juvenile Court. Those courts reasoned that appellant\u2019s attorney should not be allowed to thwart the state\u2019s strategy of holding a charge against a juvenile until he comes of age and can be tried as an adult. The short answer is that the action of appellant\u2019s attorney before the Juvenile Court was explicitly authorized by Texas law. Section 7, Art. 2338-1, V.A.T.S.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Evidence concerning the murder was presented to the Juvenile Court in a legal manner, the court took jurisdiction, declared appellant a delinquent child and deprived him of his liberty on the basis of the murder. Appellant was later indicted, tried and convicted of the identical offense. Appellant\u2019s case is, therefore, indistinguishable from <em>Garza </em>and <em>Sawyer. </em>His conviction as an adult was obtained in violation of the principles of fundamental fairness and thus constituted a deprivation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Reversed and Remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-14\">.

However, the Texas procedure to this effect has recently been held unconstitutional by a federal district court judge, in a habeas corpus action. Sawyer v.
