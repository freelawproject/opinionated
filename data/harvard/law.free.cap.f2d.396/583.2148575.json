Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company, 10 Cir., 396 F.2d 578, to which reference is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-23\">Here we are concerned with a tract about 40 acres in size on which the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway Company obtained a reservoir easement in 1902. The appellees-defendants are abutting landowners. The railroad abandoned the easement at some unstated date. In 1955 some of the appellees obtained a judgment against the successor to the original holder of the easement in which it was found that the reservoir use had been abandoned. The trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of the abutting landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-24\">This case is controlled by Choctaw Nation v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Company, supra. On the abandonment of the easement, the title vested in the abutting landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
