Since defendant does not dispute that the vehicle was stolen and was transported in interstate commerce, this question is limited to the sufficiency of the proof of defendant\u2019s knowledge that the vehicle he possessed was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-21\">To prove the fact in issue, the government presented evidence of defendant\u2019s having used a false serial number on the purported title documents for the vehicle, defendant\u2019s having titled the vehicle in the name of his son, defendant\u2019s having postponed notarization of the bill of sale for an unreasonable period, and defendant\u2019s having advanced several conflicting explanations of how he obtained possession and purported ownership of the vehicle. Although, to our view, defendant satisfactorily explained some of these items of proof, those remaining unexplained provided an evidentiary basis from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant received and concealed a stolen motor vehicle with knowledge that it was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-22\">The judgment of the lower court is</p>\n<p id=\"b865-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
