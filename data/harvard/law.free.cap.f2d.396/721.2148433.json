Hatfield contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the damage issue, where the jury answered all of the special interrogatories submitted with the general verdict in his favor, but assessed a manifestly inadequate amount of damages. Seaboard contends by way of cross-appeal that the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, on the grounds that Seaboard was not negligent as a matter of law and/or Hatfield was contributorily negligent as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">The injuries complained of were the result of Hatfield\u2019s colliding with a guard rail erected by Seaboard several feet from the paved portion of the highway, at a point where the public highway is overpassed by Seaboard\u2019s trestle bridge. By answers to special interrogatories the jury found (1) that the portion of the guard rail with which Hatfield collided was situated on the public highway; (2) that Seaboard was guilty of negligence; (3) that its negligence was the proximate cause of Hatfield\u2019s injuries; (4) that Hatfield was not guilty \u201cof any negligence which contributed in the slightest degree to his injuries\u201d; and (5) that the amount of damages sustained by Hatfield was $1.00. The general verdict was in favor of Hatfield for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">Uneontradicted testimony at the trial tended to show that Hatfield suffered multiple facial injuries, requiring surgery; paresis of the right lateral erectas muscle, causing temporary crossing of his right eye; partial loss of vision in his right eye; marked fragmentation of the superior and lateral walls of the antrum and of the lateral wall of the orbit; fracture of his skull and mandible; and considerable pain and suffering. Undisputed evidence of special damages, without objection to the reasonableness of any hospital or doctor bills, set the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>medical expenses and lost wages at $2,-795.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Seaboard's cross-appeal is without merit. The trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding defendant Seaboard\u2019s duty to this plaintiff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a substantially correct statement of the law applicable to this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If anything it is overly favorable to Seaboard in light of the jury\u2019s answer to the first special interrogatory. Seaboard contends, however, that there was insufficient evidence to submit the first interrogatory. While there is some question as to the need for the interrogatory, there was sufficient evidence to warrant the submission of the issue to the jury and to sustain their finding thereon. Likewise with regard to the issue of contributory negligence. The evidence was conflicting and the issue hence properly submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">Hatfield\u2019s appeal presents a more serious question. While the scope of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s action on a motion for new- trial is necessarily narrow, this court has held, along with a majority of circuits, that a trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial may be reversed upon a showing that such refusal was an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>We find such an abuse in the particular circumstances of this case. The record reflects that the issues of liability were strongly contested, that there was some confusion on the part of the jury with regard to the contributory negligence issue, that the jury took two days to reach a verdict, and that neither party urged acceptance in the trial court of the verdict finally rendered. The verdict award of nominal damages in the teeth of an uncontroverted showing of substantial damages lacks any support in the record and cannot stand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>These same circumstances, which lead this Court to reverse the decision below, further convince us that the new trial must be on all the issues in the case, and not on the damage issue alone. They point irrefutably to some kind of jury impropriety which could not help but affect the verdict as a whole. It is highly unlikely that the jury, upon proper deliberation, found the first four interrogatories in accordance with the trial court\u2019s instructions, and then, in contravention of those same instructions, refused, either through misunderstanding or through willfulness, to assess the damages ensuing. On the contrary, the nominal damage award can be seen only as the result of either a compromise on one of the liability issues or as an attempt to render a verdict for Seaboard with Seaboard paying the costs. In either event the misconduct necessarily contaminated the entire verdict, and precludes a new trial on the damage issue alone.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">This case is thus distinguishable from those in which the erroneous damage finding clearly had no effect on the findings of liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">The instant case is analogous to a case in which the jury\u2019s findings on special interrogatories are inconsistent, either internally or with the general verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, while the answers are not inconsistent on their face, the record reveals that if Seaboard is liable, it is liable for at least $2,795.75, thus presenting a conflict between the liability findings and the award of only $1.00 in damages. Such a conflict cannot be resolved by an appellate court assuming that the liability issues were answered correctly and that only the damage issue was incorrectly decided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Substantial justice and each party\u2019s right to a jury trial require a new trial of all the issues.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-6\">.

Once again, as so many times in the past, the utility and ultimate justice derived from the use of the Rule 49(a), F.R.Civ.P., general charge and special verdict is demonstrated. A general verdict for defendant would have been shrouded in mystery. Was it a verdict based on no primary negligence? Was it a verdict based on contributory negligence? Moreover it would have left unilluminated the basic inconsistency between the Jury\u2019s answers on negligence, contributory negligence, and damages. But in the spotlight of a special verdict, little doubt remains and the legal issues are excised for our consideration unobscured by the usual impenetrable fog. See Martinez v. Rodriguez, 5 Cir., 1968, 394 F.2d 156; Grey v. First Nat. Bank, 5 Cir., 1968, 393 F.2d 371; Weymouth v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 5 Cir., 1966, 367 F.2d 84, 93 n. 31; American Oil Co. v.
