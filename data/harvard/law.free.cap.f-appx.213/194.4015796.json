For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">Creech filed an application for supplemental social security income, alleging disability caused by various medical and mental health conditions. Her claim was denied. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) also denied her application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">Creech requested review of the ALJ\u2019s decision and the Appeals Council vacated the ALJ\u2019s decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. The order of the Appeals Council identified two deficiencies in the ALJ\u2019s decision: (1) the ALJ\u2019s decision failed to properly evaluate mental impairment according to the applicable regulatory criteria set forth in 20 CFR \u00a7 416.920a (2005), and (2) the ALJ\u2019s decision failed to perform a function-by-function assessment in analyzing residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">After a second hearing, the ALJ issued a new decision, again denying Creech\u2019s application for benefits and concluding that she is capable of medium, unskilled work. After the Appeals Council denied Creech\u2019s request for review, she appealed to the district court. A magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation recommending reversal of the ALJ\u2019s decision. The magistrate\u2019s report concluded that the ALJ failed to comply with the Appeals Council\u2019s order on remand. The magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>trate judge also found that the ALJ\u2019s analysis was inadequate in several respects: (1) the ALJ failed to evaluate the claimant\u2019s mental impairment in accordance with the applicable regulations and document its evaluation as directed in the remand order, (2) the ALJ failed to provide its rationale with references to the evidence to support its conclusion regarding the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, and (8) the ALJ failed to properly specify the basis for its assessment of the claimant\u2019s credibility. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and entered an order reversing the ALJ\u2019s decision and remanding for further administrative action.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Creech then filed a motion in district court requesting approximately $4000 in attorneys\u2019 fees under the EAJA. The district court concluded that the Commissioner\u2019s litigation position was substantially justified and denied the motion for fees. Creech noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">A claimant is entitled to an award of fees under the EAJA if: (1) the claimant is a prevailing party; (2) the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified; (3) no special circumstances make an award unjust; and (4) the claimant timely filed his petition supported by an itemized statement. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. The government\u2019s position is \u201csubstantially justified\u201d if there is a \u201cgenuine dispute ... or if reasonable people could differ as to the appropriateness of the contested action.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The government need only be \u201cjustified in substance or in the main \u2014 that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541 (internal quotation marks omitted), and the government can be substantially justified even if it loses. <em>Id. </em>at 566 n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 2541; <em>see also Roanoke River Basin Ass\u2019n v. Hudson, </em>991 F.2d 132, 139 (4th Cir.1993) (affirming the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees, even though plaintiffs had prevailed on two issues, because the government\u2019s overall position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d). The court must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the government\u2019s position is substantially justified. <em>See Comm\u2019r, INS v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 161-62, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990) (\u201c[T]he EAJA \u2014 like other fee-shifting statutes \u2014 favors treating a case as an inclusive whole, rather than as atomized line-items.\u201d); <em>Roanoke River Basin, </em>991 F.2d at 139 (\u201c[W]e look beyond the issue on which the petitioner prevailed to determine, from the totality of circumstances, whether the government acted reasonably in causing the litigation or in taking a stance during the litigation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s determination of whether the government is substantially justified under the EAJA for an abuse of discretion. <em>Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 562-63, 108 S.Ct. 2541. A district court abuses its discretion \u201conly if its conclusions are based on mistaken legal principles or clearly erroneous factual findings.\u201d <em>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney, </em>263 F.3d 359, 370 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and find no error in the district court\u2019s decision. The district court properly considered the applicable legal standard and did not abuse its discretion in concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>that the Commissioner\u2019s litigation position was substantially justified. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> In her brief on appeal, Creech states that on remand, the ALJ issued a decision granting ' her application for benefits without holding a hearing. That decision is not in the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
