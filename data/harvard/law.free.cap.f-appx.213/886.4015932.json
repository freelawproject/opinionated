Sandra Varela Jimenez (\u201cVarela\u201d) is the lead petitioner. She and her son, Johan Sebastian Vasquez Varela (\u201cJohan\u201d), were admitted to the United States in Miami, Florida on April 29, 2000, as non-immigrant visitors with authorization to remain until October 28, 2000. Varela\u2019s husband, Nestor Vasquez Vargas (\u201cVasquez\u201d), had been admitted to the United States in Los Angeles, California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>on October 15, 1999, as a visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain until April 14, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">On February 23, 2001, Varela filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and relief under United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). She did so on behalf of herself, her husband and her son. On April 19, 2001, Varela was interviewed by an Asylum Officer, who concluded that she was not credible and therefore was not eligible for asylum. On April 25, 2001, she, her husband and son were served with Notices to Appear, which alleged that they were subject to removal because they had remained in the United States beyond the period of authorization. All three admitted the allegations and conceded removability at an initial hearing before an Immigration Judge (IJ). The judge told Varela that her application had \u201cnothing in it,\u201d and suggested that she supplement the application. She did so on July 16, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">On October 10, 2002, the IJ held an evidentiary hearing on Varela\u2019s application. He determined that Varela\u2019s testimony was not credible, denied her application for asylum and withholding of removal, and ordered petitioners removed. Varela appealed the order to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Because the record of the evidentiary hearing was inadequate \u2014 the tape of the proceeding was blank in part \u2014 the BIA remanded the case to the IJ, who held a new evidentiary on January 30, 2005. Once again, the IJ found Varela\u2019s testimony not credible and denied the application in full. Varela appealed to the BIA, which affirmed on June 15, 2006, adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, with certain exceptions and additional comments, and dismissed the appeal. Varela now petitions this court for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Varela raises three issues in her brief on behalf of the three petitioners:</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">1) Whether the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s finding that Varela\u2019s testimony lacked credibility;</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">2) whether the BIA erred in denying petitioners\u2019 application for asylum where Varela provided substantial testimony and documentary evidence that she suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a guerilla group, on account of her political opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and her membership in a particular social group; and</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">3) whether the BIA erred in denying withholding of removal by concluding that Varela failed to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she will be persecuted on her return to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is de novo. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir. 2001). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>(11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.8d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (considering withholding-of-removal claim). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). With these principles in mind, we turn to petitioners\u2019 first issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Petitioners submit that the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. When the IJ enumerates an applicant\u2019s inconsistencies and is supported by the record, we \u201cmay not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to its credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). An IJ must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). The IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for the adverse credibility findings. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (llth Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">An alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Further, an adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider all of an applicant\u2019s evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Varela\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with her asylum interview concerning when she first received threats from the FARC. According to the Asylum Officer\u2019s Referral Assessment, Varela said that the FARC began threatening her in December 1998. However, she testified at the asylum hearing before the IJ that the threats began in March 1996. The dates are over two and a half years apart and are not in the same year or month. In short, <em>they </em>are not the product of confusion or mistake. As Varela\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with her statements to the asylum officer, we must say that the adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. Next, as the IJ and BIA observed, Varela\u2019s testimony regarding her participation in political campaigns was inconsistent. Varela did not inform the asylum officer when she began participating in CP activities. However, she stated that she did not continue to volunteer after September 1998. In a supplement to her asylum application, Varela stated that she participated in the CP between the fall of 1995 and the end of 1999. Finally, she testified at the asylum hearing that her participation in the CP ended when she left Colombia, which was April 29, 2000. Varela provided vastly different accounts of when she stopped working with the CP; hence, the adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Although petitioners assert that Varela\u2019s testimony regarding her coworker\u2019s death was not inconsistent, neither the IJ, nor the BIA, relied on the inconsistency in finding that Varela\u2019s testimony was not credible. Moreover, to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>the IJ made improper comments and relied on his assumption in finding that Varela was not credible, the BIA admonished the IJ for his comments and declined to adopt those comments in support of its decision. Varela\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with her prior statements testimony concerning her political activity and threats from the FARC. The inconsistencies pertain to whether she was persecuted on account of her political opinion. Accordingly, the inconsistencies properly form the basis for the adverse credibility finding as they are specific and cogent. The IJ considered the adverse credibility determination to be determinative as his findings were based solely on her credibility, and, as shown below, Varela presented no other credible evidence of her persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Addressing their second issue, petitioners submit that they put forth substantial testimony and documentary evidence of FARC threats to support their claim for asylum and withholding of removal. An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined in the INA as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5n\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [a statutory factor].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotations and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). An asylum applicant may not show merely that she has a political opinion, but must show that she was persecuted because of that opinion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). \u201c[A]n imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a well-founded fear of political persecution within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">While the INA does not define persecution, we have stated that mere harassment is not persecution, and that persecution requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Other courts have generally held that persecution is \u201cpunishment or the infliction of harm for political, religious, or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.\u201d <em>See, e.g. Tamas-Mercea v. Reno, </em>222 F.3d 417, 424 (7th Cir.2000). \u201c[Persecution encompasses more than threats to life or freedom; non-life threatening violence and physical abuse also fall within this category.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>also <em>Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>(1st Cir.2000) (persecution \u201cmust rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering\u201d). Under <em>Antipova v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1265 (11th Cir.2004), the IJ is only required to make a finding regarding past persecution if substantial credible evidence is presented. <em>See id. </em>(evaluating withholding of removal claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that her life or freedom would be threatened upon a return to that country unless the government shows by a preponderance that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened upon her removal, or the alien could relocate within the country and it would be reasonable to expect her to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum or withholding of removal if she can demonstrate a future threat in his country to his life or freedom on a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To establish a well-founded fear, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. However, if the IJ finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of his country, and it would be reasonable to do so, she cannot demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Varela did not suffer past persecution on account of a protected ground. The IJ and BIA found that Varela\u2019s testimony, concerning her political activity and alleged persecution, was incredible, and, as explained above, this finding was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ further found that the documentary evidence she put forth was not reliable as it was too general to support her testimony. Varela only submitted two letters that stated that she left Colombia over security concerns. They did not mention threats from the FARC because Varela participated in CP activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Since petitioners failed to establish past persecution, they are not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. As stated above, the evidence is insufficient to compel a finding that Varela was threatened on account of her political opinion. Thus, that evidence does not compel a conclusion that the petitioners have a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Colombia, in particular, an objectively reasonable fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Finally, as to their third issue, petitioners claim they were eligible for withholding of removal under the INA. In a withholding of removal claim, an alien shall not be removed to a country if her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The alien must show \u201cthat it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to her country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, so an alien who is unable to meet the well founded fear standard for asylum necessarily is unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Petitioners\u2019 withholding of removal claims fail because they did not establish eligibility for asylum, which carries a lower burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-6\">. As an initial matter, petitioners make no argument on review regarding CAT relief and have thus abandoned this issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b914-14\">. Specifically, petitioners contend that they suffered past persecution and have a well-founded fear of future persecution because of threatening phone calls from members of the FARC, which aimed to prevent Varela from campaigning on behalf of the Colombian Conservative Party (CP).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
