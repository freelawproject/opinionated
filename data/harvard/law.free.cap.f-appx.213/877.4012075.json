In his November 2005 complaint, Gomez alleged that the Executive Administrator of DeSoto Memorial Hospital and the Executive Administrator of the DeSoto County Jail acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs by denying him medical treatment for the injuries that he suffered in a car accident in June 1987. The district court concluded that Gomez\u2019s claims were barred by the four-year statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 1983 actions arising in Florida and dismissed his complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). On appeal, Gomez again argues that the defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs, but fails to address the applicability of the statute of limitations to his case. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">Section 1915(e) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides, in part, that any <em>in forma pauperis </em>action or appeal shall be dismissed at any time if it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The running of the statute of limitations is sufficient grounds for dismissing a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1163 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTo dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint as time-barred prior to service, it must appear beyond a doubt from the complaint itself that the prisoner can prove no set of facts which would avoid a statute of limitations bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">Because \u00a7 1983 does not contain a specific statute of limitations provision, courts apply the statute of limitations that governs personal-injury tort actions in the state where the claim arose. <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 276, 280, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1947, 1949, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985). Here, Gomez\u2019s claim arose in Florida. Questions of tolling also are governed by state law. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 105 S.Ct. at 1943. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>In Florida, the applicable limitations period for personal-injury actions is four years. <em>See Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2003). That period may be tolled, however, by the adjudicated incapacity, or previously adjudicated incapacity, of the plaintiff, but, in either event, \u201cthe action must be begun within 7 years after the act, event, or occurrence giving rise to the cause of action.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 95.051(1)(d) <em>&amp; </em>(h). A \u00a7 1983 cause of action accrues, and the statute of limitations begins to run, when a plaintiff knows or has reason to know: (1) \u201cthat he has been injured;\u201d and (2) \u201cwho has inflicted the injury.\u201d <em>Mullinax v. McElhenney, </em>817 F.2d 711, 716 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">According to Gomez\u2019s complaint, the events giving rise to this \u00a7 1983 action happened between June 1987, when the accident occurred, and June 1988, when he was released from DCJ. Thus, at the very latest, his \u00a7 1983 cause of action accrued in June 1988. Even assuming that Gomez is entitled to the maximum permissible period of tolling, he was required to file his \u00a7 1983 action no later than June 1995, but failed to do so until November 2005, over 10 years after the limitations period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">We thus conclude that the district court did not err by dismissing Gomez\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) as barred by the four-year statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 1983 actions brought in Florida. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
