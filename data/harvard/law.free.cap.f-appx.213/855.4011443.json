Osorio and Parra challenge both of the BIA\u2019s orders on the ground that the IJ\u2019s decision was in error, as they established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal due to persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d). The government argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision on the petitioners\u2019 appeal from the IJ\u2019s order because the petition for review is untimely. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we dismiss the petition, in part, and deny the petition, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">As an initial matter, to the extent that the petitioners challenge the BIA\u2019s initial order dismissing their appeal, we lack jurisdiction. We review subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1373 (11th Cir.2006). In order to review a final order of removal, the petition for review must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of the order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1), INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1). \u201c[T]he statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 [and, therefore,] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). The finality of a removal order is not affected by the filing of a motion to reconsider. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">The BIA\u2019s April 13, 2006 order, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, was a final order of removal. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). Because the petitioners did not file their petition for review until July 7, 2006, more than 30 days later, their petition was not timely and, therefore, we lack jurisdiction to address the merits of the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of the petitioners\u2019 request for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3; <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. at 1549. However, as the petition for review is timely as to the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration, we have jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">We review the denial of motions to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). A motion for reconsideration \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact 'in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C), INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(c); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (same). \u201cA motion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">When denying the motion to reconsider, the BIA found that it had considered the arguments made in the motion before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>it rendered its initial decision and declined to revisit them. The petitioners do not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that it considered the arguments made in their motion when it decided their appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision. Instead, their claim of error is premised on generalized arguments as to the merits of their application for asylum and withholding of removal. A review of the petitioners\u2019 notice of appeal, brief to the BIA, and motion for reconsideration shows that the petitioners\u2019 arguments in their motion for reconsideration were not substantively different than their previous arguments. In both instances, the petitioners argued that the evidence demonstrated that they had suffered past persecution by the FARC, had a well-founded fear of future persecution, and could not internally relocate within Colombia or return there because of a threat to their lives. The only law cited in the petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration was our decision in <em>Arboleda v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>434 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir.2006), which formed the basis for their argument that they could not internally relocate. However, in its initial decision, the BIA had relied on <em>Arboleda </em>to reject the IJ\u2019s finding that the petitioners could relocate internally. Under these circumstances, we hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the BIA already found in the petitioners\u2019 favor with respect to their claim of legal error as to the IJ\u2019s internal relocation finding and the petitioners otherwise merely reargued the merits of their already-rejected claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">In light of the foregoing, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">DISMISSED, IN PART, AND DENIED, IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
