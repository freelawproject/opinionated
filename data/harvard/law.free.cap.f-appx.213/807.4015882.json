King Motors filed its motion along with its opposition to plaintiff Russel Musnick\u2019s motion challeng<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>ing the arbitrator\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Musnick brought suit against King Motors, alleging discrimination and retaliation based on religion under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d) and the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992. King Motors filed a motion seeking to compel arbitration that was denied by the district court. However, this court reversed the district court and upon remand, the district court stayed the proceedings to allow for the arbitration. After a hearing, the arbitrator issued Final Judgment on June 22, 2004, in favor of King Motors. King Motors then sought attorneys\u2019 fees under Title VII, which the arbitrator granted by order dated April 13, 2005. Musnick then appealed the arbitrator\u2019s decision to the district court. King Motors filed a reply, dated May 18, 2005, opposing Musnick\u2019s arguments and seeking confirmation of the award. The district court rejected Mus-nick\u2019s arguments to reopen the case and then denied King Motor\u2019s motion to confirm as moot. King Motors appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Under the Arbitration Act, a party has a year from the date of the final judgment of the arbitrator to apply for confirmation. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9. To be eligible for confirmation, the award must not have been vacated, modified or corrected. Additionally, the arbitration agreement does not need to specify that it will be confirmed by a federal court. <em>Ruby-Collins, Inc. v. City of Huntsville, Ala., </em>748 F.2d 573, 576 (11th Cir.1984). Therefore, it appears that this arbitration award is ripe for confirmation. We vacate the district court\u2019s order denying King\u2019s motion to confirm as moot and remand for a decision consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
