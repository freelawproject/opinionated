We will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">According to Mauro\u2019s complaint, the defendant employees of Catholic Charities violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Mauro alleges that the defendants made him \u201csubmit to a search of his person\u201d and \u201cthreatened to secure the termination of [his] employment\u201d in an effort to demonstrate their superiority to Mauro. Mauro also asserts that, in doing this, the defendants \u201cacted on a pretext that they were special prosecutors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). After Mauro submitted a brief in opposition and the defendants replied, the District Court granted the motion. Mauro now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. When reviewing a District Court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them. <em>See Ransom v. Marrazzo, </em>848 F.2d 898, 401 (3d Cir.1988). In order to establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Mauro must show that there was (1) a violation of a federally protected constitutional or statutory right, (2) by state action or action under color of state law. <em>See Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O\u2019Brien &amp; Frankel, </em>20 F.3d 1250, 1264 (3d Cir.1994). Private actors may be deemed to have acted under color of state law if their conduct is fairly attributable to the state. <em>See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 838, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Here, the defendants are not state actors, nor did they act under color of state law. Even if true, Mauro\u2019s allegations that the defendants pretended that they were somehow affiliated with law enforcement for the state of New Jersey, does not suffice to make their conduct attributable to the state. <em>See, e.g., Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">We agree with the District Court that Mauro can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. Accordingly, the appeal is without legal merit and we will dismiss it pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
