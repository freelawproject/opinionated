A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 371 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Floyd has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">. This case was decided by the magistrate judge upon consent of the parties under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1) (2000) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-22\">. To the extent Floyd seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his \u00a7 2254 petition, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
