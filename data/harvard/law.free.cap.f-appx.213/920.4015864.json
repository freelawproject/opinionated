After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b947-24\">Mitschell is currently serving a thirty-year state sentence for aggravated child molestation, cruelty to children, interference with custody, and simple battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-25\">On March 27, 2006, Mitschell filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1986, seeking immediate release from prison and monetary damages against several defendants employed by the Georgia Department of Corrections. Mitsehell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint alleged that he is falsely imprisoned and serving an unlawful sentence in violation of the Fourth Amendment; that he was actually sentenced to thirty years\u2019 probation but \u201csome person\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>altered his conviction and changed his sentence from probation to imprisonment; and that the defendants conspired against him and knowingly contributed to his false imprisonment, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1985(3) and 1986, which caused him emotional distress as well as mental pain and suffering.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mitschell\u2019s complaint thus necessarily implies the invalidity of his state convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The district court dismissed Mitschell\u2019s complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915A and as barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) and <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). The district court concluded that, under <em>Heck, </em>Mitschell was not entitled to money damages because he failed to allege any facts showing that his imprisonment sentence was successfully vacated. As to Mitschell\u2019s request for immediate release, the district court noted that under <em>Preiser, </em>Mitschell should' bring this claim \u201cthrough a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254, not a civil suit brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d Because it was in the \u201crealm of possibility\u201d that Mitschell could still file a timely habeas corpus petition, the district court dismissed Mitschell\u2019s complaint without prejudice. Mitschell now appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Under \u00a7 1915A, the district court shall review, as soon as possible, a prisoner\u2019s complaint in a civil action against a government entity. The district court must then dismiss the complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">Although Mitschell\u2019s complaint asserted multiple grounds for relief, he essentially raised nothing more than a \u00a7 1983 civil rights action for false imprisonment. In a \u00a7 1983 suit for false imprisonment, a plaintiff must first show that his \u201cconviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. If such a suit is brought prior to invalidation of the challenged conviction or sentence, the suit must be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">We conclude that Mitsehell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action for money damages is barred by <em>Heck. </em>First, as noted by the district court, Mitschell has not demonstrated that his imprisonment sentence was invalidated or called into question by any court prior to his filing of his civil complaint. <em>See id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Because Mitschell\u2019s claim necessarily implies that his imprisonment is invalid, Mitschell has failed to state a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number><em>Heck. </em>The district court properly dismissed his complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Further, the district court correctly concluded that Mitschell\u2019s attempt to use \u00a7 1983 to obtain immediate release from prison was improper. Mitschell\u2019s argument that he should be released from prison and placed on probation attacks the duration of his prison sentence, not the conditions of his confinement. <em>See Nelson v. Campbell, </em>541 U.S. 637, 643, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 2122, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004) (stating that claims challenging the fact of conviction \u201cfall within the \u2018core\u2019 of habeas corpus and are thus not cognizable when brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983\u201d); <em>Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 500, 93 S.Ct. at 1841 (\u201c[W]hen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release ... his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Mitschell\u2019s action without prejudice, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-7\">. Mitschell also raised claims pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968. However, he did not raise these issues on appeal and accordingly, they are deemed abandoned. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-8\">. This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>an appeal from a \u00a7 1915A <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>See Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.2001). On appeal, Mitschell raises for the first time claims of kidnaping, cruel and unusual punishment, and double jeopardy. We decline to consider these arguments because \u201carguments not presented in the district court will not be considered for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Sterling Fin. Inv. Group, Inc. v. Hammer, </em>393 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
