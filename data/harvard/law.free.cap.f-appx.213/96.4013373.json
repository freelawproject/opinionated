For the reasons set forth below, we will dismiss Alevras\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Alevras pleaded guilty to bank fraud, making a false claim and unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in March 1997. He was sentenced to an 87-month term of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Approximately one year after he was released from prison and had begun to serve his term of supervised release, Alevras filed a motion seeking termination of the remainder of his term of supervised release on the ground that, while in prison, he had rendered substantial assistance to federal agents who were investigating corrupt corrections officers. Because it acknowledged that Alevras had provided assistance while in prison, the government opposed Alevras\u2019s motion but made its own motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) for a one-year reduction in Alevras\u2019s remaining term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Prior to the hearing before the District Court on this matter, the Probation Office filed a Violation of Supervised Release Report with the District Court, indicating that Alevras had refused to make timely restitution payments in violation of a condition of his supervised release. After holding a hearing, the District Court granted Alevras a conditional reduction in the term of his supervised release. Alevras would receive a one-year reduction so long as he complied with a court-ordered schedule of restitution payments. Should he fail to make those payments, Alevras\u2019s original term of supervised release would be reimposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Alevras contends that the District Court erred by only reducing his term of supervised release by one year and by making that reduction dependent on his continued compliance with a restitution schedule. However, before we may reach the merits of his appeal, we must satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">Alevras first advances the position, held only by the First Circuit, that we have jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See United States v. McAndrews, </em>12 F.3d 273, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1993). However, we have recently expressly rejected this argument and held, as does every other circuit to have addressed this issue, that we exercise jurisdiction over appeals from Rule 35(b) motions under the limited grant given in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>448 F.3d 237, 238 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">As an alternative basis, Alevras contends that under \u00a7 3742 and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we may review the District Court\u2019s grant of the Rule 35(b) motion for reasonableness. This argument is again foreclosed by our decision in <em>McKnight. </em>\u201c[I]n <em>[United States </em>u] <em>Cooper </em>we followed our <em>pre-Booker </em>precedent that we do not have jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s discretionary decision to depart downward from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>McKnight, </em>448 F.3d at 238 (citing <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 333 (3d Cir.2006)). Therefore, we still lack jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a Rule 35(b) motion unless it is imposed in violation of law. <em>Id. </em>Our case law clearly states that the fact that a district court did not reduce a sentence to the extent requested by the defendant is not a sentence imposed in violation of law. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider Alevras\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">For the reasons set forth above, we will dismiss Alevras\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
