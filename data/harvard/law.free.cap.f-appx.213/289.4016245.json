The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court determined that Guerrero\u2019s complaint was barred by the applicable limitations period and, alternatively, that Guerrero was not entitled to relief on the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">Guerrero\u2019s civil rights complaint was not filed within two years of the date that he learned of his injury. <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995); Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem.Code \u00a7 16.003(a). His previous complaint challenging the actions of the defendants was dismissed voluntarily pursuant to Guerrero\u2019s motion and thus did not toll the limitations period. <em>See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>996 F.2d 786, 787 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Guaranty County Mut. Ins. Co. v. Reyna, </em>700 S.W.2d 325, 327 (Tex.App.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">Guerrero\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Guerrero is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous, and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous, count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). He is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
