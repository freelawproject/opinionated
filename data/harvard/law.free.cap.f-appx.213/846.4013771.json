We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">Lambert pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm after previously having been convicted of a felony, in violation of \u00a7 922(g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the police searched Lambert\u2019s house, following an altercation between Lambert and a neighbor, they located 10 guns and 1,099 rounds of ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-18\">With a total offense level of 15, and a criminal history category of I, the probation officer calculated an advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of 18 to 24 months of imprisonment and a fine range of $4,000 to $40,000. His Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) shows that (1) Lambert was completely disabled as a result of an accident in 1985, and (2) the Social Security Administration showed no FICA earnings for him for the years 1993 to 1997 and 1999 to 2006. In 1998, Lambert\u2019s earnings totaled $1,864.38. Lambert (1) filed for bankruptcy in 1998, (2) had no outstanding debts, and (3) had two assets, his truck and the land on which he lived, which together were worth $40,000. Lambert provided information showing that his monthly income from Social Security disability benefits and food stamps was $1,279, but he had a negative monthly cash flow of $111. The probation officer concluded that it was unlikely that Lambert could pay a fine within the Guidelines range, but that he possibly could make payments through the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Inmate Financial Responsibility Program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>(\u201cBOP Program\u201d). The probation officer recommended a sentence of 21 months of imprisonment and a f\u00edne of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">At sentencing, the district judge adopted the PSI, and Lambert\u2019s counsel requested a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range because of Lambert\u2019s physical disability. The judge sentenced Lambert to 24 months of imprisonment and imposed a $1,000 f\u00edne, noting that \u201c[t]he defendant may make payments from any wages he may earn, if able to do so, in prison.\u201d R5 at 14. Lambert\u2019s counsel objected to the f\u00edne based on Lambert\u2019s inability to pay a f\u00edne and to DNA testing being a condition of his supervised release. Although the objection to the fine was not explicitly addressed, the judge apparently overruled it when it overruled Lambert\u2019s objection to the DNA testing as a condition of his supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">On appeal, Lambert argues that the district judge abused his discretion when he imposed a $1,000 fine because Lambert did not have the ability to pay it. He asserts that (1) he has been disabled since 1985, (2) since that time, his sole source of income, with one exception, has been Social Security benefits, (3) his only assets are his truck and his home, (4) after expenses, he has a monthly deficit of $111, and (5) he is represented by a federal defender. Accordingly, he contends that he does not have the present ability to pay the fine. Because of his disability, he argues that he will be unable to pay the fine, even under a payment schedule, because he will be unable to perform manual labor in prison to contribute to the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">He also asserts that the fine will impose a burden on his family, because their sole means of support are his Social Security benefits, which will be suspended while he is imprisoned. Citing <em>United States v. Rowland, </em>906 F.2d 621 (11th Cir.1990), he argues that, under these facts, it was an abuse of discretion for the judge to have imposed a fine. Finally, he contends (1) that the district judge erred when he failed to consider the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2 (Nov. 2005) factors in imposing his fine, and (2) that there was no factual support for the imposition of the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">We review a district court\u2019s imposition of a fine for clear error. <em>United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1307 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). \u201c \u2018The court shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine [ ] even with the use of a reasonable installment schedule.\u2019 [The][d]efendant has the burden of proving inability to pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5E1.2(a), (e)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">\u2018When a fine is found to be appropriate, the sentencing court must \u2018refer to the table setting amounts of fines for different offense levels, then consider seven listed factors, including any pertinent equitable concerns, in deciding the amount of the fine to impose within the range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Paskett, </em>950 F.2d 705, 709 (11th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). The Application Notes to \u00a7 5E1.2 state that \u201cthe fact that a defendant is represented by (or was determined eligible for) assigned counsel [is a] significant indicator[ ] of present inability to pay any fine. In conjunction with other factors, [it] may also indicate that the defendant is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2 cmt. n. 3. In <em>Paskett, </em>we vacated a $100,000 fine and concluded that the record was insufficient to allow review when the district judge failed to discuss explicitly the \u00a7 5E1.2 factors. <em>Paskett, </em>950 F.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Because this case presents a close question, the district judge did not clearly err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>in imposing the $1,000 fine. First, Lambert did not raise any objections to the fine, or any arguments concerning his inability to pay it, until after the judge imposed his fine. R5 at 2-15. He stated only that he did not have the ability to pay the fine. <em>Id. </em>at 15. Although there was information regarding his financial status in his PSI, Lambert did not bring this information to the court\u2019s attention. Lambert\u2019s general objection, unsupported by any proffered facts or evidence, was insufficient to meet his burden to prove his inability to pay the fine. <em>McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Second, although it appears that the district judge implicitly overruled Lambert\u2019s objection to the fine, he did not discuss the fine at all, even after Lambert objected to it. <em>Id. </em>at 15. We have held that, when a district judge fails to discuss explicitly the \u00a7 5E1.2 factors, we are required to remand for resentencing. <em>See Paskett, </em>950 F.2d at 709. At sentencing, the district judge noted that Lambert\u2019s fine could be paid in accordance with the BOP Program, if he were able to work in prison, which indicates that the judge had considered Lambert\u2019s disability when he imposed the fine. R5 at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Third, there are conflicting facts in the record concerning Lambert\u2019s ability to pay the fine. The undisputed facts contained in the PSI show that (1) Lambert has been disabled since 1985, (2) his family\u2019s sole means of support are the Social Security benefits that he and his son collect, (3) his sole assets, collectively worth $40,000, are his truck and the land on which he fives, and (4) he incurs a monthly deficit of $111. The record also shows that he has at least one other asset, namely, the guns that led to his crime in this case. Lambert possessed 10 firearms and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Lambert cites <em>Rowland </em>for the proposition that the district judge abused his discretion because the evidence does not support the fine imposed. In <em>Rowland, </em>the convicted defendant had been arrested when he tried to make a large marijuana purchase from undercover law enforcement agents. <em>Rowland, </em>906 F.2d at 622. At the time when he was arrested, he had $35,000 in cash, which the government later seized, and his PSI indicated that he earned only $100 to $125 a week, had $8,000 in assets, and had child support obligations. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 624. Reasoning that the defendant had $35,000 when he was arrested, and, therefore, had undisclosed assets that could be used to pay the fine, the district judge imposed a $50,000 fine. <em>Id. </em>at 623. We vacated the fine and held that it was not reasonably supported by probative evidence, because there was no evidence that Rowland owned the $35,000. <em>Id. </em>at 624. <em>Rowland, </em>however, is distinguishable from this case. First, Lambert received a $1,000 fine, not a $50,000 fine, which he is more likely to be able to pay, even with his limited financial resources. Second, Lambert apparently did have undisclosed assets, namely, the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Because Lambert presented no facts to the sentencing judge showing that he was unable to pay the fine, and there is some evidence that he had assets that could be used to pay it, Lambert failed to meet his burden of proving that he could not pay the fine. <em>McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d at 1307. Accordingly, the district judge did not clearly err in imposing the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">Lambert has appealed the $1,000-fine portion of his sentence following his plea to \u00a7 922(g), possession of a firearm after previously having been convicted of a felony. Because he did not prove that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>unable to pay the f\u00edne and there was some evidence in the record that he had assets that could be used to pay it, the district judge did not clearly err in imposing his fine. Therefore, the imposition of Lambert\u2019s $1,000 fine is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-13\">.
