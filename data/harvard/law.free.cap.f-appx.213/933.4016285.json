(\u201cSomerby\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Jones\u2019s claims of retaliatory discharge, brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). We find no reversible error; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Jones, a nurse licensed by the State of Alabama, began working at the Birmingham, Alabama, Veterans Affairs facility in 1997. After she was moved from the night shift to the day shift in early 2002, she applied for and went on leave without pay from the VA. She then filed a complaint of race discrimination and retaliation against the VA with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">In April 2002, while on leave from the VA, Jones began working the evening shift at Somerby, a senior residential comm unity located in Birmingham. In April and June 2002, Jones again applied for and received leave without pay from the VA, based on her representations that her son, who was recovering from throat surgery and has Down\u2019s Syndrome, needed constant care. In December 2002, the VA began investigating Jones\u2019s employment at Somerby and contacted Allison Naugher (\u201cNaugher\u201d), Somerby\u2019s human resources director, requesting specific information on Jones\u2019s employment. On 7 February 2003, Naugher questioned Jones about the VA\u2019s investigation; Jones informed her of the EEO complaint. Naugher testified that Jones then told her that the VA was \u201ctrying to take her [nursing] license\u201d and that she was not \u201csupposed to be working.\u201d Jones denies making such statements and maintains that the VA informed Naugher that the VA suspected Jones of falsifying her VA leave documents and that her nursing license was at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">Around 20 February 2003, Naugher received a complaint from one of Jones\u2019s coworkers, Chris Miranda (\u201cMiranda\u201d), who told Naugher that she believed that Jones was tape recording her and that she was intimidated by Jones and afraid to work with her. Naugher then questioned two other co-workers, Shirley Beck (\u201cBeck\u201d) and Gabrielle Warner (\u201cWarner\u201d), who expressed similar worries. Naugher suspended Jones pending an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">On 27 February 2003, Naugher and Eddie Cummings (\u201cCummings\u201d), Somerby\u2019s Director of Assisted Living, met with Jones to discuss the complaints. Naugher and Cummings both testified that Jones was uncooperative and would not respond to their questions, including those about Jones\u2019s dispute with the VA. After this meeting, Vance Holder (\u201cHolder\u201d), Somerby\u2019s Executive Director, decided to terminate Jones\u2019s employment. The decision was based on information from Naugher, Cummings, and \u201cupon advice of counsel.\u201d On 12 March 2003, Somerby\u2019s lawyer sent Jones\u2019s lawyer a letter terminating Jones\u2019s employment; the letter stated \u2014 among other things \u2014 that, based on Jones\u2019s refusal to cooperate and on her conflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>statements to Naugher, Somerby had \u201cconclude[d] that it cannot place trust in your client\u2019s statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Jones filed a complaint with the EEOC, alleging that Somerby terminated her employment in retaliation for filing an EEOC charge against the VA. The EEOC dismissed the charge in June 2003, concluding that no Title VII violation could be established. Jones then filed suit against Somerby, claiming retaliatory discharge in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Somerby moved for summary judgment, arguing that the employment was terminated based on the following factors: (1) Jones\u2019s initial failure to cooperate in Somerby\u2019s internal investigation; (2) concerns about her honesty and trustworthiness; and (3) concerns for the safety of the staff and residents based on the complaints lodged against Jones by her co-workers. Jones responded by arguing that Somerby\u2019s stated reasons were incredible, by alleging that Naugher falsified her written notes of the complaints, and by pointing to discrepancies between the written notes and the employees\u2019 later depositions. Jones also disputed the factual bases for the complaints, as well as several points of Naugher\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The district court granted summary judgment for Somerby. The court determined that Jones failed to present evidence that Somerby\u2019s stated reasons for terminating Jones were pretextual, as Jones\u2019s arguments were \u201cbased on evidence that Naugher was mistaken or wrong,\u201d and that Jones presented no evidence that Holder, the ultimate decision-maker, did not base his decision on the stated reasons. Jones now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all facts in the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor. <em>Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., </em>246 F.3d 1305, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). The moving party must show that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was some causal relation between the two events. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). The employer then has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. <em>Id. </em>If accomplished, the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the reason provided by the employer is a pretext for prohibited, retaliatory conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">The plaintiff may establish pretext \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Carter v. City of Miami, </em>870 F.2d 578, 584 (11th Cir.1989) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The court\u2019s only concern is the honesty of the employer\u2019s explanation, even if the employer was mistaken about the facts underlying those reasons. <em>See Cooper v. Southern Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 730 (11th Cir.2004). To survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must demonstrate \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, <em>or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons ... that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Even assuming \u2014 as the district court did \u2014 that Jones established a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation case, the district court properly granted summary judgment for Somerby because she failed to introduce evidence sufficient to support a jury finding of pretext. At most, Jones\u2019s evidence suggests that Naugher was mistaken about the content of their conversations regarding Jones\u2019s dispute with the VA, about the substance of the co-workers\u2019 complaints, and about Jones\u2019s failure to cooperate. The evidence does not establish that Naugher<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not honestly believe that Jones had been less than forthcoming about her employment with the VA and that Jones was thus untrustworthy. The minor inconsistencies between some of Jones\u2019s co-workers\u2019 signed statements and their later depositions do not contradict that the co-workers did complain to Naugher about Jones, did feel intimidated by her, and did believe that she was recording their conversations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jones produced no evidence to support her assertions that Naugher fabricated the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Also, Jones propounded no evidence contradicting Naugher\u2019s and Cummings\u2019s testimony that she was uncooperative and belligerent during the internal investigation; that Jones may have refused to answer questions that she felt were unfair or beyond the scope of Somerby\u2019s investigation and that she had a legitimate reason for raising her voice (laryngitis) does not show that Naugher and Cummings did not perceive her as uncooperative. Last, contrary to Jones\u2019s assertions, Somerby\u2019s stated reasons for Jones\u2019s termination throughout this litigation have been entirely consistent with the termination letter sent to Jones\u2019s lawyer. In fact, Jones testified that she understood that she was terminated because she was seen as untrustworthy and uncooperative. Thus, although Jones\u2019s evidence may raise a question of fact about whether her termination was mistaken or unfair, she has produced no evidence disputing Somerby\u2019s assertions of honest reliance on the proffered reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Because Jones has failed to introduce evidence that the reasons proffered by Somerby were mere pretexts for retaliation, the district court properly granted Somerby\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-10\">. Jones\u2019s original complaint also named the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\u201d) as a defendant, but Jones resolved the dispute with the VA and did not name the VA as a defendant in the Amended Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-8\">. Jones argues that she never told Naugher that Jones was not supposed to be working and that the VA was trying to take her nursing license. She also contends that her \"uncooperativeness\u201d was solely based on her refusal to answer questions about the pending EEO charge against the VA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">. As acknowledged by the district court, Holden was the actual decisionmaker in this case. On appeal, Jones argues that Naugher used Holden as her \"cat\u2019s paw\u201d and that Naugher should be regarded as the real decisionmaker. <em>See Llampallas v. Mini-Circuits, Lab, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1236, 1249 (11th Cir.1998) (\"[I]f the plaintiff shows that ... the decisionmaker acted in accordance with the harasser\u2019s decision without h[im]self evaluating the employee\u2019s situation!,] causation is established.\u201d). We need not address this argument, which was not raised below, as we conclude that Jones failed to present sufficient evidence to show that Naugher \u2014 much less Holder- \u2014 was motivated by an improper animus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b962-13\">. Jones specifically argues that Naugher added language to both Miranda\u2019s and Beck\u2019s statements indicating that they knew that Jones carried a tape recorder at work. Although both co-workers testified at their depositions that they never actually saw the tape recorder, they also testified that they believed that Jones carried a recorder with her and that they were afraid that she would record their conversations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
