The district court granted the deputy summary judgment in an order entered on May 16, 2006. The court concluded \u2014 from the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Teddie Griffin \u2014 that, when deputy Runyon encountered Griffin, he \u201chad reasonable suspicion to believe that Griffin had engaged in criminal trespass\u201d and, therefore, that he was \u201cauthorized to investigate the matter more fully and ... to detain Griffin for questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. And when Griffin ignored the deputy\u2019s commands to halt and attempted to flee, the deputy\u2019s use of pepper spray to subdue Griffin did not amount to excessive force under the Fourth Amendment. Having concluded that no constitutional violation occurred, the district court did not proceed to determine whether deputy Runyon\u2019s conduct contravened a clearly established Fourth Amendment rule such that Runyon was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Griffin now appeals the summary judgment. Because we agree with the district court that deputy Runyon did not employ excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment. In his answer brief, Runyon argues that we could also affirm the summary judgment on the ground that he is entitled to qualified immunity. Answer brief at 27-32.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree. In addition to denying Griffin\u2019s claim on the ground that no constitutional violation occurred, the district court could have gone on properly to hold that Runyon was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-21\">. Griffin's reply brief is silent regarding the qualified immunity issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
