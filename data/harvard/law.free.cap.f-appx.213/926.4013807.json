Harvey, </em>141 Fed. Appx. 802 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated by, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2980, 165 L.Ed.2d 984 (2006), in light of <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">After receiving the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate, we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs discussing the effect, if any, <em>Burlington Northern </em>has on the present case. After consideration of the supplemental briefs, we once again affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Army on McAdams\u2019s retaliation claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">In <em>Burlington Northern, </em>the Supreme Court considered the scope of the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). The Court held that \u201cthe anti-retaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace,\u201d and \u201cthe provision covers those (and only those) employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant.\u201d 126 S.Ct. at 2409. In our earlier decision affirming the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Secretary, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-15\">The district court properly determined that McAdams did not make out a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation because he failed to establish: (1) a causal connection between his protected activity and his performance evaluation, and; (2) that the elimination of his position and his transfer to a new position constituted an adverse employment action. Thus, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the Army on those claims, and we affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-16\"><em>McAdams, </em>141 Fed.Appx. at 803 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that <em>Burlington Northern </em>does not provide a basis for us to alter our decision on McAdams\u2019s performance evaluation claim. However, it is applicable to McAdams\u2019s job elimination and transfer claim. Despite its applicability, our ultimate decision in this case does not change. This court can affirm a district court\u2019s judgment for any reason supported by the record. <em>Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">We conclude from the record that McAdams\u2019s retaliation-based job abolishment claim fails because there is no genuine issue of material fact about the causal connection and the proffered non-retaliatory reasons for the elimination of McAdams\u2019s job and transfer to a lower-paying one. This is sufficient for us to affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Accordingly, notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burlington Northern, </em>we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
