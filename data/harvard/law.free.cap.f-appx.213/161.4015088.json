Parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal when the United States is a party, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dept. of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 29, 2005. Waters filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), which was denied by the district court on August 23, 2005. The notice of appeal as to the order of July 29, 2005,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dated July 31, 2006, was thus filed over nine months late.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Waters failed to file a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-14\">. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison official for mailing. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-26\">. If, as here, a party timely files a motion to reconsider under Rule 59(e), the time to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>peal runs from the district court\u2019s entry of an order disposing of that motion. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). The tolling of the sixty day period during the pendency of a Rule 59(e) motion does not include any subsequent period for appeal of the denial of the Rule 59(e) motion. Thus, although Waters timely appealed from the August 23, 2005 order denying his Rule 59(e) motion, and his notice of appeal as to the underlying district court judgment of July 29, 2005, was filed within 60 days of this court\u2019s disposition of his appeal from the district court's denial of his Rule 59(e) motion, the pendency of Waters\u2019s first appeal did not toll his responsibility to note an appeal from the July 29, 2005 judgment within 60 days of the lower court\u2019s resolution of his Rule 59(e) motion on August 23, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
