Bilbrew, Texas prisoner # 882188, seeking redress for, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendants\u2019 alleged retaliatory transfer of Bilbrew from one prison unit to another. Summary judgment was awarded the defendants. (Bilbrew\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel on appeal and all other outstanding motions are DENIED.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-26\">Bilbrew claims the defendants retaliated against him for filing grievances and actions concerning alleged mistreatment by prison staff, including the claimed improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>er confiscation of his fan, clock radio, and electric hot pot. The summary-judgment evidence provided by the defendants refuted Bilbrew\u2019s retaliation contention, and Bilbrew did <em>not </em>provide evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. The dismissal of this action was proper. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Resident Council v. United States Dep\u2019t of Hous. and Urban Dev., </em>980 F.2d 1043, 1050 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 820, 114 S.Ct. 75, 126 L.Ed.2d 43 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Bilbrew also asserts that, due to his prison unit transfer, he was denied his constitutional right of access to the court during the district court proceedings, because, <em>inter alia, </em>his transfer interfered with his correspondence with the court. He has <em>not </em>shown any prejudice arising from the defendants\u2019 alleged actions. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350-51, 355, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
