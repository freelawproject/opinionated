New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court determined that Emuchay did not meet the requirements of section 2255\u2019s savings clause and dismissed her habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">The availability of habeas relief under section 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Although collateral attacks on the validity of a federal sentence typically must be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, a provision of section 2255 \u2014 known as the savings clause \u2014 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in limited circumstances. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The savings clause presents these words: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The burden is on the movant to present evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the section 2255 remedy. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>In <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), we explained that the savings clause applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the prisoner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first [section] 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. The savings clause only applies if the prisoner has satisfied all three elements. <em>See id. </em>This showing is significant because a prisoner does not \u201copen the portal\u201d to a section 2241 proceeding until she has demonstrated that the savings clause applies to her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. &amp; </em>n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">In this case, Emuchay has not satisfied the first element of the <em>Wofford </em>analysis because her claim is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. Her attempt to use <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>as retroactively applicable Supreme Court decisions is without merit. <em>See Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867-68 (11th Cir.) (explaining that <em>Blakely </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), do not apply retroactively to section 2255 cases on collateral review), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 - U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 312, 163 L.Ed.2d 269 (2005); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review). Therefore, Emuchay\u2019s section 2241 petition did not satisfy the requirements of section 2255\u2019s savings clause; and the district court properly dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-14\">. We note that Emuchay does not need a certificate of appealability to proceed in this appeal. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that a federal prisoner proceeding under section 2241 does not need a certificate of appealability to appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\">. \"Once the savings clause of [section] 2255 applies to open the portal to a [section] 2241 proceeding, the proper inquiry in that [section] 2241 proceeding will be whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence of the crime for which [s]he has been convicted. ...\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
