In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, 759 </em>F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-21\">The district court entered judgment against Grande on September 12, 2005. Grande filed a \u201cMotion for Delayed Appeal and Appointment of Counsel\u201d on April 30, 2006, and a \u201cMotion of Leave to File Late Defendant\u2019s Notice of Appeal Nunc Pro Tunc\u201d on June 30, 2006. Because Grande failed to file a motion or otherwise obtain an extension of the appeal period, the district court denied his motions. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Grande, </em>No. 1:04-cr-00283GBL (E.D. Va. filed May 22, 2006 &amp; entered May 23, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
