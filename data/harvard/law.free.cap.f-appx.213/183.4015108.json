(J.A. 78-79). On appeal, he raises four issues, whether: (1) the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by him in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (2) his sentence was unreasonable; (3) the district court erred by denying his motion for acquittal; and (4) the district court erroneously denied his \u201cinnocent possession\u201d jury instruction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-23\">In addressing McLachlan\u2019s first two issues, we note that the district court sentenced him in light of <em>Booker. </em>We thus review his sentence \u201cfor unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. In determining the sentence, however, courts are still required to calculate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>and consider the guideline range, as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Here, the district court properly calculated McLachlan\u2019s sentencing range under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and gave its reasons for sentencing him within the range. Thus, the sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 455-56; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-44 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to deny McLachlan\u2019s motion for acquittal. <em>See United States v. Aterre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005) (stating review standard), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1925, 164 L.Ed.2d 667 (2006). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, the verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We find the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Finally, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to deny McLachlan\u2019s request for a jury instruction for \u201cinnocent possession\u201d of the firearm at issue. We have previously rejected this instruction in \u00a7 922(g) cases. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>430 F.3d 215, 218-20 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
