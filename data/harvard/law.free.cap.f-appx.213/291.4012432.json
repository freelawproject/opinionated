He argues that the district court erred when it increased his offense level by two levels for sophisticated means pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(6)(C) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">The district court\u2019s statement at the sentencing hearing regarding Stewart\u2019s objection to the sophisticated means enhancement is subject to varying interpretations. However, when viewed in the context of the remaining portions of the sentencing transcript and the record, it is clear that the district court intended to overrule Stewart\u2019s objection to the sophisticated means enhancement, as well as and as distinct from the objection to the more than minimal planning enhancement, and that in doing so it adopted the PSR and addendum\u2019s recommendation and rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">And the sophisticated means enhancement is supported by the facts and rationale set forth in the PSR and addendum. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Clements, </em>73 F.3d 1330, 1340-41 (5th Cir.1996). Stewart does not dispute those facts. Rather, he argues that the district court erred because the same conduct that formed the basis for the more than mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>mal planning adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(2)(A) also formed the basis for the sophisticated means enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(6)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stewart\u2019s argument misstates the basis for both adjustments. The PSR and addendum based the more than minimal planning enhancement on the fact that Stewart\u2019s offense conduct involved repeated acts over a period of time \u2014 his multiple attempts to secure loans for himself and R &amp; T Sales using a false statement on a loan application and false statements to the bank regarding his assets, income, and collateral \u2014 -while they based the sophisticated means enhancement on the complexity of offense conduct more complex that those simple misstatements \u2014 particularly Stewart\u2019s instructing a bookkeeper to generate separate books to support his misstatements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Stewart\u2019s offense involved sophisticated means. <em>See Caldwell, </em>448 F.8d at 290; <em>Clements, </em>73 F.3d at 1340-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\">. We assume, without deciding, that two enhancements cannot be based on the same conduct. <em>But see United States v. Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 549 (5th Cir.2005) (concluding that two similar enhancements, which were based on essentially the same conduct, could both apply); <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>No. 00-11210, 2001 WL 1131955, at *1 (5th Cir. Sept. 21, 2001) (holding that both enhancements at issue here can apply even if they \"overlap\u201d because they \"measure different aspects of ... behavior\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-23\">. Defendant briefly and obliquely suggests that the double-bookkeeping wasn\u2019t offense conduct, but we do not read that to be an appeal of that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
