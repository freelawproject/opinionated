He argues that the IJ erred by making an adverse credibility finding because inconsistencies in his story were due to \u201cinevitable problems associated with documents and testimony\u201d and not because he was intentionally misrepresenting himself in his testimony. He also claims that inconsistencies between his application and his testimony were minor and non-material and that the failure to include information on his application should not support an adverse credibility finding. Therefore, he asserts that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence. In addition, Posso argues that the assassination of his employer, who was a politician, threatening telephone calls he received, threatening visits he received where guns were displayed, and a threat to his wife constituted more than mere harassment and rose to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTo the extent that the [IJ\u2019s] decision was based on a legal determination, [our] review is <em>de novo.\u201d D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe IJ\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test,\u201d and we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Antipova v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir. 2004). In addition, we cannot find, or consider, facts that were not raised before in the administrative forum. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4G\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he. or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutory factor. <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted) (emphasis in original). An asylum applicant may not show merely that he has a political opinion, but must show that he was persecuted because of that opinion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have held that \u201cpersecution,\u201d as used to illustrate that an alien has suffered \u201cpast persecution,\u201d is an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test, and \u201cthis court may not substitute its judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. In order to review a credibility determination, it must first be established that the IJ made an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIJ\u2019s must make clean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1g\">the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibihty determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-8\"><em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cConversely, an adverse credibihty determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d If an applicant produces evidence beyond his own testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibihty determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">In this case, the IJ cleanly made an adverse credibihty finding which was supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, the contradictions in Posso\u2019s testimony and asylum apphcation are neither minor or non-material and go to the heart of Posso\u2019s claim because they relate to when Posso moved in response to the threats he claims he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Additionally, although the district court still had to look at the other evidence Posso submitted in support of his apphcation, none of the other evidence Posso submitted estabhshed that he had been threatened. Therefore, there is substantial evidence supporting the IJ\u2019s finding that Posso failed to show that he suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, Posso failed to estabhsh that he was entitled to asylum. <em>See Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1287. Likewise, Posso also failed to meet the more difficult standard used for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1292-93. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number><em>CAT Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Posso also argues that the IJ erred in denying his claim for CAT relief. The government responds that this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the denial of Posso\u2019s CAT claim because Posso did not challenge that denial before the BIA. We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir. 2003). We \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The requirements of \u00a7 1252(d) are jurisdictional. <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review immigration claims that are not raised before the BIA. <em>See Femandez-Bernal v. Attorney General, </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Because Posso failed to mention either his CAT claim or torture in either his notice of appeal to the BIA or in the brief supporting his appeal to the BIA, we do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of Posso\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Fernandez-Bernal, </em>257 F.3d at 1317 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">\n<em>BIA\u2019s Affirmance Without Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Finally, Posso argues that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s order without an opinion because the errors by the IJ were material and significant. Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), a single member of the BIA may affirm, without opinion, the decision of the IJ if the member determines that, <em>inter alia, </em>any errors in the IJ\u2019s decision were harmless or nonmaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">We must reject Posso\u2019s claim that the IJ committed harmful and material error. Before the BIA, Posso raised the same arguments he raised on appeal and which have been found to be without merit herein. Because the IJ did not err, the BIA\u2019s affirmance without opinion was neither harmful nor material error.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
