On appeal, he asserts that his sentence was unreasonable because \u201cit is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing.\u201d We have carefully reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the record and Brown\u2019s contentions and find that the sentence imposed by the district court at the bottom of the guideline range was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005) (noting that sentencing courts should determine the sentence range under the guidelines, consider other statutory factors, and impose a reasonable sentence within the statutory maximum). Accordingly, we affirm Brown\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
