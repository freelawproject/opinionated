She appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the defendant\u2019s amended motion to dismiss, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(5), for insufficiency of service of process. In that motion, Metropolitan Transit Authority (Metro) contended that Holly\u2019s service of process was insufficient under Fed. R.CrvP. 4(j)(2) because she had directed the United States Marshal\u2019s Service to send the summons and complaint to a Metro attorney, Deborah Richard, who allegedly has not been designated by Metro to receive process on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5) turns on the legal sufficiency of the service of process. The party making service has the burden of demonstrating its validity when an objection to service is made. <em>Carimi v. Royal Carribean Cruise Line, Inc., </em>959 F.2d 1344, 1346 (5th Cir. 1992). This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(5) for abuse of discretion. <em>Lindsey v. United States R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>101 F.3d 444, 445 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">In the absence of personal delivery, Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(j)(2) required Holly to serve the summons and complaint in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the action was filed. In Texas, Holly was required to serve Metro\u2019s \u201cadministrative head\u201d by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 101.102(c); <em>Wharton v. Metro. Transit Auth. of Harris County, </em>No. 4:05-CV-0413, 2005 WL 1653075, at <em>*2 </em>(S.D.Tex. July 8, 2005). It is not disputed that Holly failed to serve Metro in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-17\">It is true that service of process by pro se, IFP litigants is governed by \u201c[sjpecial,\u201d or more lenient, rules. <em>See Lindsey, </em>101 F.3d at 446. Nonetheless, when the fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ure of effective service may be ascribed to the plaintiffs \u201cdilatoriness or fault\u201d or \u201cinaction,\u201d the case may be properly dismissed. <em>See Rochon v. Dawson, </em>828 F.2d 1107, 1109-10 (5th Cir.1987). Metro filed its amended motion to dismiss on May 31, 2005. Instead of responding to the motion or attempting to correct her improper service, Holly filed a motion for entry of default and a motion for summary judgment. Approximately two months later, the district court granted the motion to dismiss. Because of Holly\u2019s \u201cinaction\u201d in the face of Metro\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of service, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion. <em>See Rochon, </em>828 F.2d at 1110; <em>Lindsey, </em>101 F.3d at 445. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Holly\u2019s motion for production, at Government expense, of a transcript of a July 22, 2005, status conference is DENIED, based Holly\u2019s failure to identify a particularized need for such transcript. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f); <em>Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
