Waddell pled guilty to the charge and was sentenced as a career offender to 190 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Waddell\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that in counsel\u2019s opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Waddell has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging his sentence and arguing that: (1) the court should have granted a downward departure from the calculated sentencing range on the basis of mental and emotional conditions caused by his drug addiction; and (2) his sentence was unconstitutional because the prior convictions used to enhance his sentence were not charged in the indictment, admitted, or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-24\">Waddell\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a downward departure from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range based on mental and emotional conditions is not supported by the record. Moreover, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>if counsel had sought a departure, the court\u2019s decision whether to grant it would have been entirely discretionary. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). The court\u2019s statements at sentencing indicate that it would not have entertained such a request. In addition, Waddell\u2019s assertion that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced is foreclosed by this circuit\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005)(prior convictions need not be charged in the indictment, admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Waddell\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Wad-dell requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Waddell.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
