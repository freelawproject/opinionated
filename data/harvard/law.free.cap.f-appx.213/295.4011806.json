Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2003). \u201c[T]his Court must affirm the decision if there is no error of law and if reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole, supports the decision\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, \u201cthe alien must show that the evidence [of another conclusion] is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it\u201d. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">The Attorney General may exercise his discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A refugee is an alien who is unwilling to return to his country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">Based on inconsistencies in Shabudin\u2019s testimony, his asylum applications, and his sworn statements, the IJ found Shabudin not credible. An IJ\u2019s credibility findings are accorded \u201cgreat deference\u201d. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 904 (5th Cir.2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Shabudin contends: because his statements and testimony were consistent with his general assertion of past, and feared future, persecution in Pakistan, the IJ\u2019s credibility findings were not supported by substantial evidence; and any inconsistencies simply resulted from his providing more details in his hearing testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Contrary to Shabudin\u2019s contentions, there was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations. As the IJ noted, there were multiple inconsistencies in Shabudin\u2019s testimony and written statements, many of which concerned matters central to his claim of past persecution. Shabudin provided inconsistent information regarding his arrest, the timing and number of threats made against him, the treatment of his family members, and whether or when he was shot by members of the Mahzir-Qomeei Movement (MQM). Further, his assertions of continued persecution are questionable in the light of his testimony that he stopped participating in the Pakistan People\u2019s Party after their office was raided in 1998. Finally, contrary to Shabudin\u2019s statements and testimony, evidence in the Country Reports of Pakistan indicated MQM members were not supported by the police, but rather had been targeted by the police for arrests and killings. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s denial of Shabudin\u2019s asylum application was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Moin, </em>335 F.3d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u201cTo be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution upon return.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted). Because of Shabudin\u2019s failure to satisfy the more lenient standard for asylum, he necessarily could <em>not </em>qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The CAT requires an alien to show \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration\u201d. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907 (quotation marks omitted). Because Shabudin has not shown the IJ\u2019s credibility determination should be overturned, his CAT relief claim cannot succeed based on his testimony alone. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
