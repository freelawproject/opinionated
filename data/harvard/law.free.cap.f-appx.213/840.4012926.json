No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161 (1966). Although Escobar-Loaiza also raises issues concerning the proceedings before the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), as we discuss further below, we must dismiss the petition insofar as it concerns the underlying proceedings because Escobar-Loaiza\u2019s petition for review was timely <em>only </em>as to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. Accordingly, we deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">We review our own subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ortega v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>416 F.3d 1348, 1350 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002)). An alien seeking review of a BIA decision must file a petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. See INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). A petition for review is considered to be filed when it is received by the clerk of the Court. Fed.R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">\u201c[T]he fifing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not stay the execution of any decision made in the case.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(f). The Supreme Court has ruled that the fifing of a motion with the BIA does not affect the finality of the order and \u201cdoes not toll the time to petition for review.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>see also Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[sjince the statutory limit for fifing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling\u201d). Thus, a motion to reopen filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Here, the BIA\u2019s final order of removal was issued on February 6, 2006, which was the date on which the BIA dismissed the Escobar-Loaiza\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s order denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a) (providing that \u201c[a]n order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion of proceedings under section 240 of the Act shall become final ... [ujpon dismissal of an appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals\u201d). Although Escobar-Loaiza filed a timely motion to reopen, the fifing of that motion did not toll the limitations period for fifing a petition for review in this Court. <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537; <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Because Escobar-Loaiza did not file his petition for review until May 11, 2006, which was well after expiration of the 30-day time limit of INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal affirming the IJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>underlying decision and dismissing Escobar-Loaiza\u2019s appeal. As for the BIA\u2019s denial of Escobar-Loaiza\u2019s motion to reopen \u2014 the only order over which we have jurisdiction \u2014 Escobar-Loaiza\u2019s arguments do not address that decision and our own review reveals no abuse of discretion on the BIA\u2019s part. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction as to the denial of the motion, and deny the petition as to the denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
