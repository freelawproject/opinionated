Hardy seeks $250,000 in under-insured motor vehicle benefits under a commercial automobile policy, issued by PMIC. Following a September 2005 bench trial, the district court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of PMIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">Because federal jurisdiction is premised on diversity grounds, we apply Mississippi substantive law. <em>See Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). In addition, \u201c[t]he standard of review for a bench trial is well established: findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed <em>de novo </em>\u201d. <em>In re Midr-South Towing, Co., </em>418 F.3d 526, 531 (5th Cir.2005) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, reviewed <em>de novo. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Disability Serv. of the Southwest, Inc., </em>400 F.3d 260, 263 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-19\">The district court ruled: Hardy\u2019s vehicle, operated by the decedent at the time of the accident, was <em>not </em>a covered vehicle under the PMIC commercial policy; instead, it was insured under a personal insurance policy issued by a <em>different </em>insurer. Accordingly, it concluded: because the decedent was <em>not </em>operating a covered vehicle at the time of the accident, there could be no recovery under PMIC\u2019s policy. <em>See Crane v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>19 F.Supp.2d 654, 659 (S.D.Miss.1998) (\u201ccovered vehicle\u201d is a \u201cvehicle insured under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the liability provisions of the subject policy\u201d.); <em>see also </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 83-11-103(b) (1999). This conclusion, <em>not challenged </em>by Hardy, is dispositive of this appeal. (Hardy disputes the district court\u2019s ruling concerning other reasons the decedent was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the terms of the PMIC policy. Because the district court did not err in its not-covered-vehicle ruling, we need not reach this issue.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
