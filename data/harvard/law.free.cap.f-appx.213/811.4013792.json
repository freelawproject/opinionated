Petitioners claimed that, because of Luis\u2019s refusal to comply with this demand, they suffered repeated phone calls, an attempted kidnaping, and an attempted shooting, and would continue to suffer such persecution if returned to Columbia. Petitioners contended that such persecution was on account of Luis\u2019s imputed political opinion, namely opposition of the FARC as demonstrated by his refusing to cooperate with them, and Luis\u2019s membership in a particular social group, namely persons singled out by the FARC for recruitment in raising funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-19\">Where, as here, the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we essentially review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Chacona-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, we apply the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test, under which we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>(quotation omitted). To reverse, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. INA \u00a7\u00a7 208(a)(1), 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(1), 1231(b)(3)(A), 8 C.F.R. 208.16(c). To qualify for asylum, the alien must prove that he is a refugee. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). A refugee is defined in the INA as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s- nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish refugee status, the alien must establish, through specific, detailed facts, (1) his past persecution on account of a protected ground, or (2) his \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that he will be persecuted in the future because of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. As to establishing persecution, \u201cevidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas\u201d or which \u201cmerely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). Likewise, as to claims based on a political opinion or an imputed political opinion, \u201c[i]t is not enough to show that [the alien] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [the alien\u2019s] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). Moreover, as to claims based on membership in a particular social group, \u201c[t]he risk of persecution alone does not create a particular social group within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">To qualify for withholding of removal, the alien similarly must show that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). Likewise, to qualify for CAT relief, the alien must prove that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured by, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official or person acting in an official capacity upon return to his country. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a). Because the more-likely-than-not standard that applies to withholding of removal and CAT claims is more stringent than the well-founded-fear standard that applies to asylum claims, ineligibility for asylum generally precludes withholding of removal and CAT relief eligibility. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93, 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">After careful review of the record, we find that reversal of the removal order before us is not compelled. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Because the FARC\u2019s actions against Luis stemmed from an attempt at criminal extortion, these actions were sufficiently consistent with \u201cacts of private violence\u201d or \u201ccriminal activity\u201d such that they do not constitute persecution. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. Likewise, Luis\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the FARC\u2019s demands does not constitute a political opinion or an imputed political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>opinion. <em>See Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438. Moreover, if those people \u201cat risk of persecution\u201d are not a social group, then those people \u201cat risk of recruitment,\u201d are not either. <em>See Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1198. Finally, since Petitioners failed to meet their burden of demonstrating asylum eligibility, they are precluded from obtaining withholding of removal and CAT relief, as these forms of relief require a higher standard of proof. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93, 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">In fine, as substantial evidence supports the findings that Petitioners did not establish persecution or the required nexus between the FARC\u2019s actions and an enumerated asylum ground, the petition for review must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
