Mueller, Director of the FBI (Defendant) pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>alleging that she suffered adverse employment action in retaliation for statutorily protected activity in which she had engaged. The case was tried by a Magistrate Judge by consent who entered judgment in favor of the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The court concluded that there was not a sufficient causal connection between Allen\u2019s protected activity and the adverse employment action of which she complains. We will only overturn this finding of fact only if it is clearly erroneous. <em>Burrell v. Board of Trustees of Georgia Military College, </em>125 F.3d 1390, 1394 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">After a review of the briefs and relevant portions of the record, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding has support in the record and therefore is not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
