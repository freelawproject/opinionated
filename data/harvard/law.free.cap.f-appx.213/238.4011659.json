To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Bizuneh fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">Because Bizuneh failed to establish that she had a well-founded fear of persecution, she cannot meet the higher standard required for withholding of removal as set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(8) (2000). <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Since substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Bizuneh is ineligible for asylum, she likewise fails to qualify for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
