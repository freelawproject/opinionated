On appeal Williamson argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s determination that he had violated a term of his supervised release, that his sentence was unreasonable, and that the district court judge \u00e9rred in failing to recuse himself from the proceedings after a Government witness allegedly died in chambers. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-20\">While on supervised release, Williamson entered an Alford<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> plea to misdemeanor breaking and entering charges on August 8, 2005, in Rockingham County, North Carolina Superior Court, which served as the basis for the revocation proceeding. Williamson contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that he violated his terms of supervision by breaking and entering. At the revocation hearing, he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tended, through counsel, that, although he admitted to the conviction, he was not the person involved in the breaking and entering for which he was convicted. He argues that he only entered an <em>Alford </em>plea so that he would not be charged as a habitual felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. See <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). An abuse of discretion occurs when the court fails or refuses to exercise its discretion or when its exercise of discretion is flawed by an erroneous legal or factual premise. <em>James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). Factual determinations informing the conclusion that a violation occurred are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir. 2003); <em>United States v. Whalen, </em>82 F.3d 528, 532 (1st Cir.1996). We conclude that there was sufficient evidence, including the testimony of the responding police officer and Williamson\u2019s probation officer, to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Williamson was the person who committed the breaking and entering offense, upon which the supervised release violation was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Next, Williamson suggests that the sentence imposed by the district court after revoking his supervised release was unduly harsh. Williamson does not assert any error in the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines in determining the advisory sentencing range. In <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>this court held that \u201crevocation sentences should be reviewed to determine whether they are \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 with regard to those \u00a7 3553(a) factors applicable to supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d 461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir. 2006). Applying the analysis articulated in <em>Crudup, </em>we find that Williamson\u2019s sentence for violating supervised release is not unreasonable, much less plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">As correctly noted by the district court, the advisory guideline range for Williamson\u2019s violation was eight to fourteen months for a Grade C violation with an original criminal history category of VI. USSG \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Williamson\u2019s prior conviction for mailing threatening communications was a Class C felony, so the statutory maximum sentence on revocation of supervised release imposed for that offense was twenty-four months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 876, 3559(a)(3), 3583(e) (2000). Williamson\u2019s twelve-month sentence was thus within the statutory maximum. Moreover, the district court sufficiently articulated its sentencing deliberations to demonstrate that it did not abuse its discretion in selecting the term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Finally, Williamson alleges that the district court judge should have recused himself from the proceedings after witnessing the death of a Government witness, Bronchia Bethal, in chambers. Because Williamson did not raise this issue below it is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336, 339 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">A judge must recuse himself or herself where the party seeking recusal files a timely and sufficient affidavit stating the judge has a personal bias or prejudice either against the affiant or in favor of an adverse party, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (2000), or where his or her impartiality might reasonably be questioned. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 (2000). However, because Williamson cannot show any evidence that the district court blamed him for the witness\u2019s death or otherwise held an extra-judicial bias, the court properly rejected the argument in the instant case. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994) (\u201cjudicial rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.... [T]hey ... can only in the rarest circumstances evidence the degree of favoritism or antagonism required [to make fair judgment impossible] ... when no extrajudicial source is involved.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Shaw v. Martin, </em>733 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201c[a]lleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case\u201d). Therefore, the district court judge did not err in failing to recuse himself from Williamson\u2019s revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Williamson\u2019s supervised release and imposing a twelve-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\"> <em>North Carolina v.
