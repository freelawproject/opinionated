McCaster (\u201cMeCaster\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her application for child supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d), filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3). After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We review a social security case to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>See Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cWe may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner],\u201d but, rather, \u201cwe must defer to the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (citation omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is defined as more than a scintilla, i.e., evidence that must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established, and such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support the conclusion.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1560 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (internal citation omitted). \u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the [Commissioner]^ factual findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Taylor raises two arguments on appeal. She first contends that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by failing to make a proper credibility determination regarding her testimony, since she was McCaster\u2019s primary caretaker. Taylor also claims that the ALJ erred by relying upon the opinion of Dr. David M. Bortnick. We address each assertion in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">A. <em>Credibility Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYk\">Credibility determinations are for the Commissioner, not the courts. <em>See Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1242 (11th Cir.1983). \u201cA lack of an explicit credibility finding becomes a ground for remand when credibility is critical to the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1562 (citation omitted). We have stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-13\">[although this circuit does not require an explicit finding as to credibility ... the implication must be obvious to the reviewing court.... Thus, where proof of a disability is based upon subjective evidence and a credibility determination is, therefore, a critical factor in the [Commissioner]^ decision, the ALJ must either explicitly discredit such testimony or the implication must so clear as to amount to a specific credibility finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-14\"><em>Tieniber v. Heckler, </em>720 F.2d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.1983) (per curiam). In <em>Tieniber, </em>we held that \u201cthe implied credibility finding [was] not sufficiently clear to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner\u2019s subjective evidence [did] not establish a disability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">Taylor asserts that the ALJ committed reversible error by failing to make any credibility determination regarding her testimony. Taylor argues that such a finding of credibility was critical in this case because she was the person most familiar with McCaster\u2019s functioning. Taylor\u2019s testimony, however, is distinguishable from the \u201ccritical\u201d testimony that was at issue in <em>Tieniber. </em>In <em>Tieniber, </em>\u201cthe insufficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>of the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the subjective evidence [was] particularly crucial\u201d because the claimant and her daughter\u2019s testimony was \u201cthe only direct evidence produced from the disabling period\u201d and \u201c[n]o other evidence discussed by the ALJ refutefd] or otherwise contradicted] this subjective evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254. In contrast, here, Taylor\u2019s testimony was not the only evidence from the period of disability. The ALJ considered other evidence, including McCaster\u2019s medical and school records and testimony from McCaster himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Furthermore, the ALJ did make a credibility determination. Although the ALJ did not make an explicit finding regarding the credibility of Taylor\u2019s testimony, the ALJ stated \u201c[a]fter carefully reviewing all the evidence including the testimony at the hearing, the undersigned gives significant weight to the evidence from Dr. Bortnick. ...\u201d R2 at 18 (administrative record of the Social Security Administration proceedings). Consequently, the implication that the ALJ discredited Taylor\u2019s testimony based on the findings in Dr. Bortnick\u2019s report is \u201cso clear as to amount to a specific credibility finding.\u201d <em>See Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1562 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">B. <em>Dr. Bortnick\u2019s Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Taylor claims that the ALJ\u2019s finding that Dr. Bortnick\u2019s opinion is consistent with the totality of the evidence was not based on substantial evidence. Specifically, Taylor argues that the ALJ committed reversible error in relying on the opinion of Dr. Bortnick, asserting that Dr. Bortnick based his findings on the statements of McCaster, then a four-year old child, who was unaccompanied at the evaluation session, and that Dr. Bortnick allegedly failed to review all of McCaster\u2019s medical and school records.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Upon review of record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find that the ALJ\u2019s decision to give significant weight to Dr. Bortnick\u2019s assessment is consistent with the totality of the evidence and Dr. Bortnick\u2019s evaluation provides substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings. Although McCaster was unaccompanied when Dr. Bortnick evaluated him, Taylor brought McCaster to the evaluation and Dr. Bortnick noted that Taylor \u201cprovided information about [McCaster\u2019s] history and current-status.\u201d R2 at 373. Taylor claims that she would have corrected McCaster\u2019s misstatements; specifically, McCaster indicated that he performed self-care activities by himself, whereas Taylor testified that McCaster wet himself approximately every two days and that she sent extra clothes to school and dressed him. Even assuming Taylor would have clarified this discrepancy, these facts alone would not support a finding that McCaster had marked or severe limitations in light of the other medical evidence of record that supports Dr. Bortnick\u2019s assessment and the ALJ\u2019s decision. The State Agency physicians determined that McCaster had impairments of mixed developmental delay and some motor delay, but that these impairments did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal, an impairment as listed in the applicable regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(d). Both State Agency physicians found that McCaster\u2019s functioning was either less than marked or had no limitation in the areas of acquiring and using information, interacting and relating with others, moving about and manipulating objects, caring for one\u2019s self, and health and physical well-being. Additionally, while Taylor asserts that school records revealed instances of misbehavior, the school and care records also reflected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>instances of acceptable behavior.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Bortnick\u2019s conclusion regarding McCaster\u2019s functional ability is supported by his medical findings and is consistent with the record as a whole. In sum, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that McCaster is no longer eligible for SSI payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Based on the foregoing, the denial of child supplemental security income is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-17\">. Although the ALJ did not specifically discuss McCaster\u2019s school records, \"[o]ur standard of review is ... whether the ALJ\u2019s conclusion as a whole was supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). We do not require the ALJ to \u201cspecifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision,\u201d so long as the decision is sufficient to allow this Court to conclude the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
