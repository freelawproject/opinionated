Plaintiffs assert that Aramark\u2019s stated reason for Cruz\u2019s termination is pretext, and he was actually terminated because of his age and disability. The district court granted Ara-mark\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">Aramark hired Cruz in 1991 as a Food Services Director. In 1993, he was transferred to work at the Zenith plant in Juarez, Mexico. In 1996, Cruz was diagnosed with AIDS, and Aramark subsequently transferred Cruz to El Paso, Texas. Cruz later accepted a 50% reduction in pay and a transfer back to Juarez, Mexico, where he was assigned to the cafeteria at Baxter Convertible. While at Baxter, Cruz approved payment for overtime hours not actually worked by an employee, Cesar Delgado. Delgado had received a raise but had not received the pay increase resulting from the raise because of processing delays. Aramark claims that Cruz\u2019s authorization of the payment to Delgado violated company policy, and it terminated Cruz\u2019s employment on November 14, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Cruz filed a charge of age and disability discrimination with the EEOC on December 2, 1997. The EEOC concluded that the evidence obtained during the investigation established violations of the ADA and the ADEA. After attempts at informal conciliation failed, the EEOC terminated its processing of the charge and issued a notice of right to sue on October 3, 2002. In the five years between Cruz\u2019s filing of his EEOC charge and the ultimate notice of right to sue, Cruz died and numerous witnesses resigned, had their employment terminated, or were laid off. The plaintiffs, Cruz\u2019s descendants, filed their complaint in the Western District of Texas on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>December 20, 2002. The complaint stated causes of action for violations of the ADA and the ADEA, as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of ERISA. The defendant moved for summary judgment as to all claims, and the district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. The intentional infliction of emotional distress and ERISA claims are not on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Prior to entering judgment, the district court gave the plaintiffs an additional thirty days to supplement the record with competent summary judgment evidence. The plaintiffs supplemented the record with additional statements, letters, deposition testimony, and the EEOC determination report. The district court rejected most of this evidence as inadmissible and concluded that the admissible evidence did not establish a fact question. In particular, the district court rejected as inadmissible a signed declaration from Raul Echavarria, Cruz\u2019s supervisor at Baxter. The statement was written in English, and Echavarria only speaks Spanish. The district court therefore deemed this statement hearsay and refused to consider it as competent summary judgment evidence. The court gave the plaintiff an additional seven days to present a signed affidavit in Spanish. The plaintiffs failed to submit the Spanish affidavit, and the district court entered judgment for the defendants. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The plaintiffs appeal two of the district court\u2019s primary evidentiary determinations. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary determinations under an abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In their response to Aramark\u2019s summary judgment motion, the plaintiffs relied on various letters and witness statements in the EEOC file. The district court excluded these letters and statements because they were unsworn and thus did not meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">The plaintiffs argue the district court erred in not considering this evidence. They first argue that the statements were admissible under <em>Smith v. Universal Services, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Smith </em>held that an EEOC investigative report, which consisted of a brief review of the facts developed in the EEOC\u2019s investigation and the EEOC\u2019s finding of probable cause, was admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Smith </em>is misplaced. While the EEOC report is admissible, it \u201cis in no sense binding on the district court and is to be given no more weight than any other testimony given at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More importantly, while the EEOC report may fall within the business records hearsay exception, the same cannot be said of the entire EEOC <em>file.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The business records hearsay exception applies to the EEOC\u2019s report and determination, but it does not apply to the underlying material collected during the EEOC investigation. Rather, the individual evidence contained in the file must be inadmissible on its own grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">The letters from the EEOC file cannot be used to defeat summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ment because they are unauthenticated, they are not in the form of an affidavit, and they do not indicate that they are \u201cmade on personal knowledge\u201d as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, the unsworn statements in the EEOC file are likewise not competent summary judgment evidence. One statement, attributed to Ana Solano, is merely the EEOC investigator\u2019s notes from a conversation with Solano, and it contains no affirmative indication that Solano swore to a statement that was based on personal knowledge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Another \u201cstatement\u201d from Octavio Gildo is actually an unsigned document prepared by the EEOC investigator. The investigator apparently sent the document to Gildo with the notation that \u201c[i]f the above statement is not signed and returned within 10 days, the statement will be considered a true and correct statement.\u201d This \u201csignature by default\u201d method is not sufficient to create a sworn statement, as there is no indication that Gildo even <em>read </em>this statement, let alone swore to its contents. Echavarria\u2019s original declaration to the EEOC suffers from the same inadequacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Plaintiffs alternatively argue that Gildo\u2019s and Echavarria\u2019s statements to the EEOC are admissible as party admissions under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A), which provides that \u201c[a] statement is not hearsay if ... [t]he statement is offered against a party and is the party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity.\u201d Gildo\u2019s statement is dated August 5, 2000, four years after his termination. And Echavarria\u2019s initial EEOC statement is dated August, 22, 2000, over a year after his termination. Under the plain language of Rule 801(d)(2)(A), these statements were not the \u201cparty\u2019s own statement\u201d because Gildo and Echavarria\u2019s were not Aramark employees at the times the statements were made. For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit certain items from the EEOC file into the summary judgment record.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">After the district court had rejected Echavarria\u2019s initial statement to the EEOC investigator as inadmissible, the plaintiffs responded by providing a signed affidavit from Echavarria. However, the sworn affidavit was in English, and Echavarria only speaks Spanish. The district court therefore rejected the English affidavit and gave the plaintiff an additional seven days to provide a Spanish version of the affidavit. Plaintiffs did not respond within seven days and thereafter filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the district court should have admitted the English version because the translation did not create an additional layer of hearsay. Plaintiffs rely on <em>United States v. Cordero, </em>which held that \u201c[ejxcept in unusual circumstances, an interpreter is no more than a language conduit and therefore does not create an additional level of hearsay.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that the circumstances of this case are not \u201cunusual\u201d because Echavarria was merely signing his \u201cown\u201d EEOC statement, which had been translated to him by his attorney, who, it is alleged, is fluent in both English and Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cIn determining whether to treat a translator as a mere conduit, the [Fifth Circuit] look[s] to: (1) which party supplied the interpreter; (2) whether the interpreter had any motive to mislead or distort; (3) the interpreter\u2019s qualifications and language skill; and (4) whether actions taken subsequent to the conversation were consistent with the statements as translated.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When applied to the facts of this case, these four factors suggest that the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney should not be treated as a \u201cmere conduit.\u201d He was acting on behalf of the plaintiffs, and he had a potential motive to distort the translation in his clients\u2019 favor. More importantly, the court has no indication of his skill as a translator, other than his own self-supporting claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the test articulated in <em>Martinez-Gaytcm, </em>the district court\u2019s rejection of Echavarria\u2019s English affidavit was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Having thus limited the summary judgment record to plaintiffs\u2019 admissible evidence, we are left to consider de novo whether plaintiff has established a fact question that can defeat summary judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We assume without deciding that the plaintiffs have established a prima facie case of both age and disability discrimination. Aramark responded with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Cruz\u2019s termination, namely that Cruz violated company policy by authorizing overtime payment for hours not actually worked. The burden then shifted to the plaintiffs to show that Aramark\u2019s stated reason was pretext.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that Ara-mark\u2019s stated reason was pretext because (1) the payment was actually authorized by Cruz\u2019s supervisor, Raul Echavarria, and (2) it was accepted company policy to authorize overtime payment for employees who had received a raise but had not yet received the pay increase resulting from the raise. However, the plaintiffs provide no competent summary judgment evidence that Echavarria actually authorized the overpayment, and the admissible evidence fails to support their claim that authorizing overpayment was accepted company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">The plaintiffs primarily rely on deposition testimony from Ana Solano and Octavio Gildo. Solano stated that Raul Echavarria and Ralph Cruz led her to believe that they could authorize payment for hours not worked. As the district court notes, however, this evidence does not establish that it was accepted company practice to authorize payment for unworked hours, nor does it show that Echavarria or Cruz did so on any other occasion. Gildo stated that he heard Saul Dueas, Cruz\u2019s human resource director, make jokes about Cruz\u2019s age on a regular basis. However, Gildo\u2019s testimony does not raise a fact question on Cruz\u2019s ADEA claim because it does not establish that the age-related commentary was related to the decision to terminate Cruz\u2019s employment, especially since the comments lack tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ral proximity to the decision to terminate Cruz\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Plaintiffs also rely on the EEOC determination report. The district court has the discretion to admit the EEOC determination report, but it is not bound by the EEOC\u2019s determination of reasonable cause.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the determination is not sufficient to defeat summary judgment where the determination is not supported by the summary judgment evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this case, the EEOC determination relies on various statements that are replete with hearsay and are not admissible in court. Because the EEOC\u2019s determination is not supported by admissible, competent summary judgment evidence, we hold that it is insufficient to establish a fact question. We AEFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
