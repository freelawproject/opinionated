Long contends that his designation for sentencing purposes as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)(2000) is precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2581, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Long\u2019s claim is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 286 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>requirement that facts extraneous to a prior conviction be found by a jury does not cover the essential components of a conviction, including integral facts such as the statutory violation and date of offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 350 (4th Cir.) (holding that defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by a jury was not violated by district court\u2019s reliance on his prior convictions for purposes of sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). Moreover, on appeal, Long does not challenge any factual findings regarding the prior convictions, and he does not dispute the factual basis for the district court\u2019s conclusions that he was an armed career criminal. Accordingly, Long\u2019s assertion that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment is without merit. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 523 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that, where defendant did not dispute any of the facts supporting the career offender status in district court, there is no constitutional violation in relying on defendant\u2019s prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Long\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
