Gashi argues that the BIA should have granted his motion to reopen because he presented new and material evidence of changed country conditions in Kosovo that supported his application for asylum. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny Gashi\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">Gashi arrived in the United States under the visa waiver program and was referred to the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) for asylum-only proceedings. Gashi filed an application for asylum, alleging that he was persecuted in Kosovo on account of his nationality as an ethnic Albanian and his status as a member of the Democratic League of Kosovo (\u201cLDK\u201d). The IJ denied Gashi\u2019s applications for relief, finding that Gashi had not met his burden of establishing that he suffered past persecution in Kosovo or had a well-founded fear of persecution there on account of one of the protected grounds. Specifically, the IJ concluded that Gashi had not presented a credible claim that supported his applications for relief. Gashi appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Gashi\u2019s applications for relief on November 15, 2005. The BIA found that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was sufficiently supported by the record. Gashi then petitioned this Court for review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decisions, but we dismissed the petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">On February 7, 2006, Gashi filed before the BIA a motion to reopen his asylum-only proceedings, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), on the grounds that he had new evidence that was material and previously unavailable and that there were changed country conditions in his designated country of removal. In his motion, Gashi contended that he had new evidence in the form of affidavits from witnesses that were previously unavailable and would corroborate the persecution he suffered in Kosovo. He also argued that the death of the President of the LDK changed the country conditions in Kosovo such that, if Gashi were returned there, he would \u201csurely\u201d be persecuted by opposition parties that were beyond the control of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Gashi submitted eight exhibits in support of his motion to reopen. Five of Gashi\u2019s exhibits were affidavits from himself, his wife, and his friends from Kosovo concerning the persecution that Gashi suffered while he was in Kosovo. Gashi claimed that his remaining three exhibits supported his assertions regarding the changed country conditions in Kosovo. First, Gashi submitted a biography of Ibrahim Rugova from the Wikipedia<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> website, which indicated that Rugova was the president of Kosovo and the LDK and had died on January 21, 2006. Second, Gashi included an article from MSNBC.com, entitled \u201cKosovo President Ibrahim Rugova dead at 61: Icon of ethnic Albanian drive to win independence had lung cancer.\u201d The article indicated that Rugova\u2019s death left \u201ca leadership vacuum at the most sensitive time since the Kosovo war ended in 1999\u201d and that the government had \u201cexpressed fears that Rugova\u2019s successor might not share his commitment to nonviolence.\u201d It further stated that ethnic Albanians were a 90 percent majority in Kosovo and that the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan believed that Rugova\u2019s death would not disrupt Kosovo\u2019s drive for independence. Lastly, Gashi submitted an article from USATODAY.com, entitled \u201cKosovo President Ibrahim Rugova Dies,\u201d which included similar information as that in the MSNBC, com article.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">In reviewing Gashi\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA found that Gashi failed to establish that the affidavits he submitted were previously unavailable. The BIA determined, however, that, even considering the statements in the affidavits, they did not contain sufficient factual detail to establish that the IJ clearly erred in its adverse credibility finding. With regard to the news articles that Gashi submitted, the BIA found that they did \u201cnot establish a material change in country conditions or that [Gashi] has a reasonable well-founded fear of return to Kosovo.\u201d The BIA thus denied Gashi\u2019s motion to reopen, concluding that Gashi did not present sufficient evidence to warrant reopening his proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">On appeal, Gashi argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because the BIA did not specify why it found that his evidence of changed country conditions did not warrant a reopening. Gashi contends that the BIA did not consider all of the evidence that he presented regarding the changed conditions in Kosovo. He further argues that his new evidence of changed country conditions was crucial to his claims because it contradicted the IJ\u2019s finding, in his original proceeding, that Gashi failed to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>he could not have sought help from the LDK to avoid persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Gashi filed his motion to reopen based upon changed country conditions and pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), which states that such a motion \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (indicating that an alien may file a motion to reopen based upon changed country conditions in the alien\u2019s country of nationality). Moreover, the BIA \u201chas discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We have previously held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">[a]t a minimum, there are at least three independent grounds upon which [the BIA] may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-7\"><em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">As Gashi indicated before this Court and the BIA, he sought to reopen his asylum-only proceedings based upon changed country conditions in Kosovo. An asylum applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted). Alternatively, an applicant can also establish a well-founded fear of persecution, without showing that he would be singled out for persecution, if the applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">As an initial matter, review of Gashi\u2019s appellate brief indicates that he does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that the affidavits Gashi submitted in support of his motion to reopen were (1) not previously unavailable, and (2) even if they were, they did not establish that the IJ clearly erred in its adverse credibility finding. Gashi argues before this Court only that his motion to reopen was timely and that the BIA erred in its finding with regard to his evidence of changed country conditions. Accordingly, Gashi has abandoned any argument that the affidavits warranted a reopening of his asylum-only proceedings. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that an issue not raised on appeal is abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Concerning Gashi\u2019s claim regarding changed country conditions, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Gashi\u2019s motion to reopen because the documentary evidence presented in support of his motion did not establish a material change in country conditions in Kosovo that would have made Gashi eligible for asylum relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Although Ga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>shi claims that Rugova\u2019s death so changed the country conditions in Kosovo to the extent that Gashi was now eligible for asylum relief, the news articles are not probative of his claims because they showed no incidents of violence against ethnic Albanians. Rather, the articles referred only to the possibility that Rugova\u2019s successor \u201cmight not share his commitment to nonviolence.\u201d In addition to stating that possibility, one article indicated that ethnic Albanians were a 90 percent majority in Kosovo and that the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan believed that Rugova\u2019s death would not disrupt Kosovo\u2019s drive for independence. The articles therefore do not indicate that there is a pattern or practice in Kosovo of persecuting ethnic Albanians or that Gashi would be singled out for persecution on account of his status as an ethnic Albanian. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Thus, the articles do not support Gashi\u2019s fear of returning to Kosovo.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Moreover, to the extent that Gashi claims that the BIA did not address all of his evidence of changed country conditions or provide a reason for its decision, that argument is without merit because (1) the BIA noted that Gashi had submitted articles regarding Rugova\u2019s death, but that those articles did not establish a material change in country conditions or that Gashi had a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Kosovo, and (2) the BIA referenced 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2, which requires that a motion to reopen shall not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material. <em>See Osuchukwu v. INS, </em>744 F.2d 1136, 1142-43 (5th Cir.1984) (explaining that the BIA \u201chas no duty to write an exegesis on every contention. What is required is merely that it consider the issues raised, and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted\u201d). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gashi\u2019s motion to reopen, and, thus, his petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">.
