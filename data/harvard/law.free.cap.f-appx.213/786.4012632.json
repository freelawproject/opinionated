Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Because we find that Linder\u2019s action, if successful, would not necessarily invalidate his prior criminal conviction, we REVERSE and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b812-25\">Linder filed a complaint against four individuals associated with the MiamiDade County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. His complaint appeared to challenge an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>allegedly fraudulent blood test used at his criminal trial. In his complaint, Linder stated that he \u201cnotified the affected parties of a criminal conspiracy on the matter and requested notification in the form of a repudiation of the idea of an esoteric blood test taking place in the toxicology lab of the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner\u2019s Office of an eighteen year old youth named Phillip Conklin.\u201d Rl-1 at 1. His complaint further refers to \u201ca fraudulently amended trial transcript,\u201d <em>id., </em>and requests \u201cexposure in open court\u201d so that \u201cthe complaint can be resolved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">In the district court, a magistrate judge found that <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372, precluded Linder\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim as long as he was currently subject to a criminal conviction, and in his Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), recommended that Linder\u2019s complaint be dismissed. Linder responded to the R &amp; R by moving for \u201csome form of subpoena or response order to the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner regarding the subject Phillip Conklin\u201d and stating that the granting of the motion was \u201cnecessary to life, liberty, freedom, and to efficiently and correctly establish truthful facts.\u201d R1^4 at 1-2. The district judge reviewed the case, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s R <em>&amp; </em>R, and ordered the case dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) of a prisoner\u2019s complaint, and view the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir. 2003). We have held that \u201c[a] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the prisoner can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Harmon v. Berry, </em>728 F.2d 1407, 1409 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (citations omitted). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Under <em>Heck, </em>if a judgment for a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence^] ... the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d 512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. A prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is not barred, however, where the action, \u201ceven if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff....\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372 (emphasis in original). For example, a prisoner is permitted to request DNA evidence that has been used at his trial under \u00a7 1983 because obtaining such evidence does not \u201cnecessarily demonstrate[ ] or even impl[y] that his conviction is invalid.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Pryor, </em>305 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2002). Conversely, a plaintiff seeking declaratory relief and damages based solely on the premise that he \u201cwas the victim of an unconstitutional conspiracy to falsely convict him\u201d merely is attempting to overturn his conviction and is barred by <em>Heck </em>from proceeding. <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1066 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (involving action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), which is analogous to \u00a7 1983 for <em>Heck </em>purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Liberally construing Linder\u2019s complaint, as we must, we discern that he challenges the use of certain evidence at his trial relating to a blood test, and seeks access to the medical laboratory\u2019s records in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>nection therewith. Though the language used in his complaint is somewhat muddled, Linder\u2019s appellate brief sheds further light on his claims, alleging that \u201ca PowerPoint [ ] was plagiarized to create a fictional blood test result ...,\u201d <em>Br. of Appellant </em>at 1, and requesting \u201c[t]he names of the two test subjects of the PowerPoint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Abella, </em>63 F.3d at 1065-66, Linder, by his complaint, does not attempt to overturn his conviction; rather, he seeks access to evidence. Here, as in <em>Bradley, </em>Linder \u201cprevails in this lawsuit once he has access to that evidence or an accounting for its absence. Nothing in that result necessarily demonstrates or even implies that his conviction is invalid.\u201d <em>See </em>305 F.3d at 1290; <em>see also Hughes, </em>350 F.3d at 1160 (permitting \u00a7 1983 action alleging Fourth Amendment violation to proceed, because success would not necessarily imply that the plaintiffs conviction was invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Moreover, and just as importantly, because the circumstances surrounding Linder\u2019s underlying conviction \u201care unknown from the record[,][i]t was impossible ... for the district court to determine that a successful \u00a7 1983 action ... <em>necessarily </em>implied the invalidity of th[at] conviction[ ].\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1161. (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the district court erred in holding that Linder\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is barred by <em>Heck </em>at this stage in the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Because Linder\u2019s allegations, if successful, would not invalidate his conviction, <em>Heck </em>does not bar this action. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal, and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-16\">. Though Linder does not cite 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, he filed a \"complaint for damages\u201d in the district court, seeking relief from state actors for their actions in connection with a federal trial. As such, the district court properly found that Linder\u2019s complaint seeks relief under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
