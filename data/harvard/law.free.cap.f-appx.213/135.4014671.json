We will deny Obi\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-27\">On September 26, 2006, a grand jury indicted Obi, charging him with willfully failing and refusing to apply for travel documents so that his deportation to Nigeria could be effectuated. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a)(1)(B). Pending before us on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>that date was Obi\u2019s petition for review of the Immigration Judge\u2019s final order of removal. Approximately one month later, we denied Obi\u2019s petition for review. <em>Obi v. Atty. Gen\u2019l of U.S., </em>201 Fed.Appx. 905, 907 (3d Cir.2006). Obi contends that the criminal indictment against him was unlawful because of the overlapping pendency in this court of the review of the administrative order. <em>See </em>Mandamus Petition, 2-3 (arguing that his case could only be before one court at a time).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Mandamus is an appropriate remedy only in the most extraordinary of situations. <em>Sporck v. Peil, </em>759 F.2d 312, 314 (3d Cir.1985). To justify the remedy, a petitioner must show that he has (i) no other adequate means of obtaining the desired relief and (ii) a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>See Haines v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 81, 89 (3d Cir.1992) (citing <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)). Obi has not demonstrated a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Review of a final order of deportation is a civil proceeding, making it entirely separate from any criminal prosecution of an alien who fails to cooperate with deportation. <em>See, e.g., INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1038, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). We are aware of no precedent, and Obi points to none, prohibiting the issuance of an indictment while judicial review of separate administrative proceedings is conducted. Certainly, Obi has not demonstrated any \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right that has been breached in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">For the reasons given, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
