Rivera, </em>357 F.3d 290 (3d Cir.2004) <em>(\u201cRivera </em>/\u201d), we described the following relevant background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-17\">From approximately June 2000 until on or about June 5, 2001, Rivera led a drug trafficking conspiracy that imported kilogram-quantities of cocaine powder from his suppliers in Puerto Rico, converted some of that powder into cocaine base, and distributed the cocaine and cocaine base in Camden, New Jersey. On October 9, 2001, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Rivera. Count One charged him with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base and more than five kilograms of cocaine powder in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Count Two charged possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On November 7, 2001, Rivera and the United States entered into an agreement which provided, among other things, that Rivera would plead guilty to Count One of the indictment and the United States would dismiss Count Two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-18\">The district court ultimately adopted the factual findings and recommendations of the Presentence Report and, ... sentenced Rivera to a 324 months term of imprisonment and supervised release of five years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-19\"><em>Id. </em>at 291-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-20\">In <em>Rivera I </em>we vacated Rivera\u2019s 324 month sentence because at sentencing the Government had advocated for a Total Of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>fense Level that was four levels above the parties\u2019 stipulated level in their cooperating plea agreement: the parties had stipulated to a Total Offense Level of 35 and the government advocated for a Total Offense Level of 39. We remanded Rivera\u2019s case for resentencing before a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">On March 18, 2005, the District Court resentenced Rivera. The Court adopted the uncontested factual findings of the PSR and the probation officer\u2019s calculation of a Criminal History Category of III. Following the plea agreement, the Court calculated a Total Offense Level of 35, making the applicable guidelines range 210 to 262 months. The Court sentenced Rivera to 216 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On appeal, Rivera argues that the District Court failed to consider sufficiently his cooperation with the government and as a result sentenced him to a greater amount of time than necessary, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Rivera also argues that his sentence does not comport with his similarly situated co-defendants\u2019 sentences, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">We review a District Court\u2019s imposition of a criminal sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>U.S. v. Dragon, </em>471 F.3d 501, 505 (3d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006). <em>Cooper </em>established the framework for this undertaking, explaining that \u201cwe must first be satisfied the court exercised its discretion by considering the relevant factors.\u201d 437 F.3d at 329. \u201c[T]he court is not required to discuss and make findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2018if the record makes clear the court took the factors into account in sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dragon, </em>471 F.3d at 505 (quoting <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329). Nor are there any magic words that a district judge must use when sentencing, as long as the record shows \u201cthat the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit and factual support in the record.\u201d 437 F.3d at 329. And, as simply put in <em>Dragon, </em>\u201cdistrict judges are not required ... to routinely state that the sentence imposed is the minimum sentence necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\u201d 471 F.3d at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Considering these principles, Rivera\u2019s appeal is without merit because the record reveals that the resentencing court carefully considered the extent of Rivera\u2019s cooperation and the relevance of his co-defendants\u2019 sentences. The Court separately addressed each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and noted, with respect to the history and characteristics of the offense, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">I have been presented material from defense counsel with regard to Mr. Rivera\u2019s efforts to cooperate with the government or give some information that might be useful. I\u2019ve heard from the government that none of that was in fact substantial assistance and there is no 5K application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">I note that no pleas, no charges et cetera ha[ve] resulted from them. I will, however, certainly consider that he has made attempts to provide information and cooperate, which may be part of his efforts to rehabilitate himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">(App. at 160.) The Court then addressed Rivera\u2019s co-defendants\u2019 sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">I have looked at the various sentences as well that have been imposed on others that were related to this offense. I know that has been commented upon by defense counsel as well. I note in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>regard some of the sentences have been very substantial, 262 months, 188 months, 200 months, 100 months, some of whom were involved in a lesser way as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">Of course to the extent that the defendant has urged that the Court impose a sentence of the mandatory minimum of 10 years, ... I find that that sentence would be out-of-line in connection with the others that have been provided ... based upon this defendant\u2019s involvement and the seriousness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">(App. at 161.) Finally, the District Court stated its appreciation that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory and expressed that it found, in Rivera\u2019s case, that a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was consistent with what the Court found appropriate, and no greater than necessary, considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Based on this record it is abundantly clear that the District Court gave meaningful consideration to the extent of Rivera\u2019s cooperation, to his co-defendants\u2019 sentences, and to all of the relevant provisions of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329. We afford deference to the District Court because it is \u201cin the best position to determine the appropriate sentence in light of the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">We have considered all of Rivera\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s sentence was reasonable under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Cooper. </em>Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-15\">. As this Court noted in its February 9, 2004 opinion, the underlying indictment in this case named Rivera as Isaac Burgos a/k/a Isaac Bonilla a/k/a Isaac Rivera. With both parties\u2019 consent, at the change of plea hearing, the District Court granted a motion to deem changed all pleadings and documents to reflect that the defendant (now appellant\u2019s true name is Isaac Rivera, with Burgos and Bonilla listed as aliases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
