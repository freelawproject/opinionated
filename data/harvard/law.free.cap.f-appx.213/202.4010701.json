Manka challenges the immigration judge\u2019s findings that her asylum application was untimely and that she did not establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-23\">The timeliness of an alien\u2019s asylum application is usually a question of fact. <em>See Mehilli v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.2005). On May 11, 2005, Congress enacted the Real ID Act, which added a new subsection to the judicial review provisions. This subsection provides that discretionary and factual determinations are outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005); <em>see also Vasile v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir.2005). An exception to this provision obtains for constitutional claims or questions of law raised by aliens seeking discretionary relief. <em>Higuit v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 417, 419 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2973, 165 L.Ed.2d 955 (2006). Despite Manka\u2019s contentions that the immigration judge erred as a matter of law, the judge\u2019s consideration of evidence at the trial and its subsequent conclusion are factual in nature. Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction to review Manka\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-26\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Manka\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because we find Manka would not be able to show that she is eligible for asylum based on the record presented, we find she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We also hold that Manka fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). We find that Manka fails to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
