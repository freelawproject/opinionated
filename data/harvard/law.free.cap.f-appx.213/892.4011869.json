Cain, </em>433 F.3d 1345 (11th Cir.2005), when we affirmed his conviction and sentencing guideline calculation, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because we previously affirmed Cain\u2019s conviction, and because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Cain\u2019s sentence imposed by the district court on May 17, 2006, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
