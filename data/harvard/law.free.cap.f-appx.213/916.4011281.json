He asserts the district court erred by: (1) holding him accountable for 11,152 marijuana plants, (2) denying a minor-role reduction, and (3) imposing unreasonable sentences. We affirm his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnH\">A. <em>Drug quantity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Gonzalez contends he was involved only with marijuana plants at a residence on Kennel Street. Gonzalez asserts he should not have been held accountable for the marijuana plants located at- the North Zambria residence because his mere knowledge of the plants there did not bring them within the scope of his agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings regarding the scope of the defendant\u2019s criminal activity and the quantity of drugs reasonably foreseeable to that defendant. <em>United States v. Hansley, </em>54 F.3d 709, 714 (11th Cir.1995). The Guidelines provide relevant conduct factors determining the sentencing range include: \u201cin the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity ... all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during commission of ..., in preparation for ..., or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). \u201cBecause a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many participants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant (the \u2018jointly undertaken criminal activity\u2019) is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n. 2). With respect to a jointly undertaken controlled substance offense, the defendant is accountable for \u201call reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may uphold the sentence \u201c \u2018if the record supports the amount of drugs attributed to\u2019\u201d the defendant. <em>Hansley, </em>54 F.3d at 714 (quoting <em>United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1499 (11th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Gonzalez could have foreseen the plants at <em>both </em>the Kennel and North Zambria residences were part of the marijuana-distributing conspiracy. First, Gonzalez admitted during his change-of-plea hearing he knew about the marijuana plants at the North Zambria residence, and \u201cwould grow [] marijuana plants or help in growing them\u201d at the Kennel residence, working alongside codefendants Romero and Guevara for codefendant Vita, so that Vita could sell the plants. Additionally, Gonzalez admitted at sentencing that he knew about the marijuana plants at the North Zambria residence, and he was caring for plants at the Kennel residence. The district court, thus, had a basis upon which to find Gonzalez could have foreseen the conspiracy involved the distribution of plants at both residences. Accordingly, we affirm the drug-quantity finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">B. <em>Minor-role reduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Gonzalez asserts he was entitled to a minor-role reduction because he was: (1) involved only with marijuana plants at the Kennel Street residence, (2) less culpable than codefendant Yoandy Rojas Guevara, and (3) erroneously held to the standard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>prove eligibility for a minimal-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>bane). The Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease in a defendant\u2019s offense level if the court finds the defendant was a minor participant in the criminal activity, and a four-level decrease if he was a minimal participant. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2. A minor participant is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal,\u201d while a minimal participant is one \u201cwho [is] plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n. 4-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Furthermore, \u201cthat a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor ... participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The proponent of the reduction bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">The district court did not clearly err in failing to grant a minor-role reduction. First, as stated above, the district court did not err in determining Gonzalez\u2019s conduct included accountability for the 11,-152 marijuana plants at both the Kennel and North Zambria residences. Second, Gonzalez did not prove he was less culpable than most other participants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> all of whom helped cultivate marijuana plants and further Jose Vita\u2019s conspiracy to sell drugs. <em>Id. </em>While the district court incorrectly stated it was denying the minor-role reduction because Gonzalez was aware of the scope and structure of the conspiracy, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4) (stating \u201cthe defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as minimal participant\u201d), this error was harmless because Gonzalez nonetheless failed to carry his burden of proving he was entitled to the reduction, <em>see De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939 (proponent of reduction bears burden). Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">C. <em>Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">Lastly, Gonzalez contends his 84-month concurrent sentences are unreasonable because he had no prior criminal record and a limited role in the offense, and the district court failed to give \u201cany real effect to the mental health mitigation,\u201d especially where Guevara and Romero re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>ceived very similar sentences despite their lack of mental health issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">We review post <em>-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A party challenging a sentence bears the burden of establishing the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) include: (1) \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;\u201d (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, deter criminal activity, and protect the public from future crimes by the defendant; and (3) \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Gonzalez\u2019s sentences are reasonable. The district court explained it had imposed 84 months\u2019 imprisonment because the Guidelines sentence was one factor to consider, and Gonzalez had been involved with the \u201cenormous quantity\u201d of 11,152 marijuana plants, which could have \u201cfound their way to the streets.\u201d The court also noted Dr. Scronce\u2019s report regarding Gonzalez\u2019s mental status, and stated it could have sentenced Gonzalez to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment, but chose 84 months due to his mental issues and to be consistent with the sentences imposed on his codefendants. Accordingly, besides explicitly mentioning that it had considered \u201call the factors identified in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a)(1) through (7),\u201d the court explicitly considered (1) Gonzalez\u2019s personal characteristics, (2) the seriousness of the offense, and (3) his codefendants\u2019 sentences. Given the court\u2019s thorough analysis and that Gonzalez was sentenced within the Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment, see <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1183-86 (11th Cir.2006) (though not automatically entitled to substantial weight, a Guidelines-range sentence is often warranted), he cannot show his sentences are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The district court did not err by holding Gonzalez accountable for the plants at the North Zambria residence, or denying a minor-role reduction. Additionally, Gonzalez\u2019s sentences are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-7\">. Although Guevara\u2019s vehicle was located outside the North Zambria residence while \u201cseveral young men\u201d transported garden supplies, and Guevara was charged in a separate conspiracy in Miami, Guevara\u2019s criminal conduct does not excuse Gonzalez from his relevant conduct, which conduct the district court considered while ruling on the request for a minor-role reduction, <em>see De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b946-6\">. While the Government argues that plain-error review should apply, we need not address this contention because Gonzalez\u2019s argument fails even under a reasonableness standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
