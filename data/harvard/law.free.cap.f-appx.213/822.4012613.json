Fuenmayor, a staunch Catholic and active opponent of the Bolivarian communist regime in Venezuela, claims political persecution. As the lead petitioner, she contends that we should review the IJ\u2019s decision because the BIA did not make any of its own findings of fact but merely accepted the IJ\u2019s report, which did not articulate a specific credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">We begin with the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Fuenmayor\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s order and its denial of her motion for reconsideration. We must determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the merits of those actions. <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). We review <em>de novo </em>issues of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">Because Fuenmayor did not petition for review of either decision until March 7, 2006, well after 30 days had lapsed following the BIA\u2019s final orders, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of these claims. Section 242(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), states that a petition for judicial review of a BIA order \u201cmust be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d Time limits for judicial review are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). The fact that Fuenmayor filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion to reopen during the 30-day period following each final order does not change our analysis. Filing such a motion has no affect on the finality of the BIA\u2019s order and \u201cdoes not toll the time to petition for review.\u201d <em>Stone v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1544, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (commenting on the predecessor judicial review statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106(a) (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">As a result, we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Fuenmayor\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision or the BIA\u2019s dismissal of her motion for reconsideration. Fuenmayor\u2019s petition for review was filed three months after the November order and a full five months after the September order. Because the petition was filed well outside the 30-day period following each order, we do not have jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">Only the BIA\u2019s denial of Fuenmayor\u2019s motion to reopen is properly before us. The BIA refused Fuenmayor\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>to reopen because: (1) her motion to reopen was filed more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s final decision; and (2) the additional evidence presented in support of her motion was either available at the time of her merits hearing or did not show a change in circumstance sufficiently material to merit reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cIn this particular area, the BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). In denying the motion, the BIA must not have acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985). As a general matter, motions to reopen are disfavored because \u201cevery delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">A party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). Amotion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The 90-day time limit does not apply if the motions to reopen is filed on the basis of changed circumstances in the country of the movant\u2019s nationality. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h). To meet this exception, a movant must show material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Fuenmayor argues that her motion falls under the \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d exception to the 90-day rule. The BIA determined that she failed to present sufficient evidence that the political conditions in Venezuela have materially changed since her asylum hearing. In light of the evidence presented with her motion to reconsider, the BIA\u2019s finding was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The articles and letters submitted showing the conditions in Venezuela did not \u201cmeaningfully alter [Fuenmayor\u2019s] previous assertions.\u201d They offered general information about Venezuelan politics, and much of that information was available at the time of the initial merit hearing. Further, the BIA determined that a list of names of all those who voted against the communist regime in the 2004 referendum as well as the other evidence offered did not show that political conditions in Venezuela had changed substantially for someone in Fuenmayor\u2019s position since its final decision. This finding did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Accordingly, the BIA did not err in denying Fuenmayor\u2019s motion to reopen. The motion was untimely and did not fall within the \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d exception to the 90-day rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
