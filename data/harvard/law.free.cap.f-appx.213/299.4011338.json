He argues that the district court erred in imposing an enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice and in denying him an adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">A district court\u2019s finding that a defendant obstructed justice is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 586 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2363, 165 L.Ed.2d 280 (2006). In imposing the enhancement, the district court relied in part on the fact that Guerra-Mesta did not appear at his first sentencing hearing. Guerra-Mesta argues that he did not have notice of the sentencing hearing at which he failed to appear and that his conduct was therefore not willful. Assuming arguendo that this assertion is correct, the district court did not commit clear error in finding that Guerra-Mesta obstructed justice, as he also failed to contact his probation officer for six months, and his probation officer was unable to locate him during that period. <em>See United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 393-94 (5th Cir. 2005); <em>see also United States v. Phillips, </em>210 F.3d 345, 348 (5th Cir.2000) (identifying obstructive conduct as that which creates an inherently high risk that justice will be obstructed and is the result of more than a spur-of-the-moment decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Guerra-Mesta also argues that the district court erred in denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. A district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is reviewed under a standard even more deferential than the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Ragsdale, </em>426 F.3d 765, 781 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1405, 164 L.Ed.2d 105 (2006). Only in extraordinary cases do adjustments under both \u00a7 3C1.1 and \u00a7 3E1.1 apply. \u00a7 3E1.1 comment.(n.4). Guerra-Mesta points to no extraordinary circumstances in his case which support his argument that he should have received an acceptance of responsibility adjustment despite the imposition of the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement. As the district court did not err in imposing either enhancement, we do not reach Guerra-Mesta\u2019s argument regarding the district court\u2019s imposition of an alternative non-guideline 36-month sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
