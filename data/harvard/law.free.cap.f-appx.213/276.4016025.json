Campos argues that the district court plainly erred by imposing the career offender enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and by not awarding him a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">Because Campos raises these arguments . for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). To establish plain error, Campos must show: (1) error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects his substantial rights; and (4) that affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-18\">Campos concedes that he had one prior felony controlled substance conviction, but correctly asserts that there was no evidence outside of the presentence report that established that he had been convicted of a second \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d as was required for application of the career offender enhancement. The Government argues that Campos\u2019s prior conviction for illegal investment constitutes a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d The district court may not rely on the facts in the presentence report to determine whether the nature of Campos\u2019s prior convictions renders them \u201ccontrolled substance offenses.\u201d Although this error is clear, Campos has not met his burden of establishing that this error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 867 (5th Cir.2006). Campos does not argue that he does not have two prior felony controlled substance convictions. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in enhancing Campos\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-19\">Campos\u2019s assertion that he did not receive credit for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1 is belied by the record, which establishes that his offense level was reduced by three levels under \u00a7 3El.l(a) &amp;(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
