We decline to consider whether the relevant regulations are valid. The regulations were amended May 12, 2006. <em>See </em>71 Fed. Reg. 27, 585. Bediakieh filed a motion to reconsider with the Board soon thereafter for the purpose of considering his application for adjustment of status under the new regulations. The Board denied the motion finding the immigration judge was without jurisdiction. Thus, a remand for the purpose of considering the effect of the amended regulations would be futile. <em>See Alam v. Gonzales, </em>438 F.3d 184, 187-88 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
