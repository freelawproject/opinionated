The district court sentenced Haire based on his status as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e)(1) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 because Haire has three previous convictions for burglary of a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-28\">Although Haire incorrectly characterizes his sentence as falling under the \u201ccareer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>offender\u201d provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than the ACCA and \u00a7 4B1.4, he reiterates arguments that he raised in the district court, where he cited the correct provision of the Sentencing Guidelines. Haire argues that his sentence was unreasonable and violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because a sentence enhancement was required based on the fact of his prior convictions without regard to the underlying facts of those convictions. He contends that the violent nature of his prior convictions had to be found beyond a reasonable doubt. Haire\u2019s arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The ACCA requires a mandatory sentence of at least 15 years for a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who has three previous convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d committed on different occasions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). The statute specifically enumerates burglary as a violent felony. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Haire admitted as part of his guilty plea that he possessed a firearm and that he had been previously convicted of three burglary offenses committed on separate occasions. Therefore, the ACCA was correctly applied. <em>See United States v. Medina-Gutierrez, </em>980 F.2d 980, 982 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 4B1.4. The district court\u2019s sentence of Haire as an armed career criminal did not violate <em>Booker </em>or the Constitution because the additional facts and nature of the prior convictions did not require a finding by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. White, </em>465 F.3d 250, 251 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>437 F.3d 450, 451 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
