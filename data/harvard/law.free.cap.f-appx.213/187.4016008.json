With respect to the order denying Reid\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed. Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-22\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on March 22, 2006. Reid executed his \u201cobjections\u201d on April 13, 2006, which were properly construed by the district court as a motion for reconsideration. Because Reid\u2019s motion for reconsideration was filed more than ten days after entry of judgment, the motion did not toll the period for appeal of the underlying judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A); <em>In re Burnley, </em>988 F.2d 1, 2-3 (4th Cir.1993) (construing motion for reconsideration not filed within ten days of entry of judgment as motion under Rule 60(b)). Therefore, we dismiss the appeal of the underlying judgment for lack of jurisdiction as the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-23\">To the extent that Reid appeals the denial of relief on his motion for reconsideration, the order is not appealable unless a circuit justice of judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appeal-ability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Reid has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
