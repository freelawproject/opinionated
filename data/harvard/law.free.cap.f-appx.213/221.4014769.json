Although the charges carried a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (iii) (West 1999), the district court imposed a sentence of 60 months imprisonment. The government appealed, arguing that the sentence is unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the following reasons, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">The district court held a sentencing hearing on December 1, 2005. The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined Robinson\u2019s total offense level to be 37, which included a two-level role-in-the-offense enhancement. The enhancement was based on Robinson\u2019s statement to the FBI that he supervised two other people in his drug distribution activities. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (increasing the defendant\u2019s total offense level by two levels if \u201cbased on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, ... the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2) (\u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">The district court considered the pertinent part of the PSR, which recounted statements Robinson gave to the FBI indicating he had two people selling crack for him. J.A. 90. While Robinson did not contest the accuracy of this part of the PSR, he disputed that it could serve as a basis for the role enhancement. Robinson argued that the statement did not establish that he was an organizer, supervisor, or leader because the statement did not indicate evidence of decision-making, recruitment, a right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, or any authority or control over others. The government countered that Robinson\u2019s statement amounted to an admission of leadership over two other individuals, thus satisfying the requirement for the leadership enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">After considering the arguments of counsel, the district court declined to impose the role enhancement on grounds that had not been raised. Concluding that the language of the indictment did not explicitly charge Robinson with being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>leader or organizer and that the jury did not find that role, the district court sustained the objection and declined to apply the leadership enhancement. J.A. 56-57. Having concluded that the leadership enhancement did not apply, the court held that Robinson qualified for the safety valve provisions of the guidelines, which permitted the district court to sentence Robinson below the mandatory minimum of ten years. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The district court imposed a sentence of 60 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Thereafter, in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (citations omitted). Because of the similarities between the sentencing scheme at issue in <em>Blakely </em>and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, questions about the constitutionality of the guidelines arose. While some courts concluded that the guidelines were unaffected by <em>Blakely, see, e.g., United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316, 353 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated </em>543 U.S. 1097, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005), others concluded that no guideline enhancements could be applied unless the facts supporting the enhancement were alleged in the indictment and found by the jury, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Fanfan, </em>2004 WL 1723114, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18593 (D.Me.2004). Thus, in the uncertainty between <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker, </em>it was reasonable to assume that enhancements, other than prior conviction enhancements, had to be pled in the indictment and the facts supporting those enhancements found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The Supreme Court resolved this issue with its opinion in <em>Booker. </em>The Supreme Court applied <em>Blakely </em>to the guidelines and concluded that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment is violated when a district court, acting pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines, imposes a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury alone.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738). The Supreme Court remedied the constitutional violation by excising the mandatory language from the sentencing guidelines, so that \u201cthe discretion of a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the sentencing guidelines are now advisory post <em>Booker, </em>it is clear that the facts supporting a sentencing enhancement need not be alleged in the indictments to be used in the proper calculation of a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233, 259,125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">In the wake of <em>Booker, </em>the district court when sentencing a criminal defendant must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">(1) properly calculate the sentence range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range and within statutory limits serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sentence that does serve those factors; (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) articulate the reasons for selecting the particular sentence, especially explaining why a sentence outside of the Sentencing Guidelines range better serves the relevant sentencing purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The government argues, and Robinson concedes, that the absence of any leadership facts in the indictment does not preclude application of a leadership enhancement when calculating the advisory guidelines sentencing range. We agree. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Based on the foregoing, we vacate Robinson\u2019s sentence and remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b250-10\">GREGORY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AO2\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">I agree that the district court must re-sentence Robinson because <em>United States v. Booker, 548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, </em>160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not require a sentencing enhancement to be alleged in the indictment. I write to emphasize that, notwithstanding the error in sentencing, this Court does not resolve the question concerning applicability of_ the leadership enhancement. It is the district court\u2019s province to decide, at the resentencing hearing, whether the United States has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Robinson acted in such a leadership capacity as to warrant the application of the two-level leadership enhancement.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b250-12\">SHEDD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9a\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">I agree that the district court erred and that Robinson must be resentenced because of this error. I write separately to note that at the time of the sentencing, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), had (as Judge Traxler explains) clearly established \u201cthat the facts supporting a sentencing enhancement need not be alleged in the indictments to be used in the proper calculation of a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d Therefore, regardless of the reasonableness of any <em>pre-Booker </em>assumption on this point, there was no basis for the district court\u2019s contrary <em>sua sponte </em>ruling in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
