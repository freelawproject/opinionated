Njehiah, a native and citizen of Kenya, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals adopting and affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). As Njehiah does not substantively challenge the denial of asylum and withholding of removal in his opening brief, we find that he has abandoned those claims on appeal. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999). Next, we uphold the IJ\u2019s finding that Njehiah failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Kenya. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">We accordingly grant the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for review in part with respect to the asylum and withholding of removal claims. We deny the petition for review with respect to Njehiah\u2019s CAT claim and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
