The magistrate judge explained to Mr. Ross that a student has no claim under Title VII and informed him that he would have to file a complaint stating facts justifying a claim under a federal statute. The magistrate judge again explained that a claim under the American Disabilities Act would have to state what a defendant did to him that would be a violation of the statute. Then Mr. Ross was given a final chance to explain his complaint or have his lawsuit dismissed. He failed to do this and his case was properly dismissed. His filing with this court fails to state a federal claim also. His help is not in a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
