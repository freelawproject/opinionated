Bloom, Office of United States Attorney, Harrisburg, PA, for Joseph Smith.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b152-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">In 1997, in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, George Sepulveda was convicted of various RICO-related offenses, including racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), and a violent crime (murder) in aid of racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959. \u2022 Sepulveda was sentenced to life imprisonment. After his conviction and sentence were affirmed in 1999, Sepulveda moved for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This motion was denied, as were a subsequent \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus and a coram <em>nobis </em>petition. More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Sepulveda\u2019s application for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">Sepulveda, who is currently incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, has filed another petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 2241 with the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The District Court dismissed that petition, and Sepulveda appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Sepulveda argues that \u00a7 2255 would be an inadequate or ineffective remedy because his claim is not based on newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law. Instead, he alleges that he was unable to raise a claim that his jury was not selected from a representative cross section of the community (and that the district court erred by not conducting a hearing on this issue) in his prior \u00a7 2255 motion because the census statistics necessary to support such a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>were not available until after his initial \u00a7 2255 motion was due. He further contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to request fees for expert investigation work and census statistics under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Motions pursuant to \u00a7 2255 \u201care the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Unless a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2241 cannot be entertained by the court. <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because a petitioner is unable to meet its stringent gatekeeping requirements. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). Rather, the \u201csafety-valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow, and has been held to apply in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for actions later deemed to be non-criminal by an intervening change in law. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Sepulveda\u2019s claims fall within the purview of \u00a7 2255 because they challenge the validity of his conviction. We agree with the District Court that Sepulveda has not demonstrated that \u00a7 2255 is an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d remedy under the circumstances presented here. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538 (\u201cIt is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">For these reasons, the District Court properly dismissed Sepulveda\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. We will, therefore, summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
