In No. 06-1628, Consolidation Coal Company cross-petitions for review of the Board\u2019s affirmance of the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that St. Clair\u2019s claim for benefits was timely filed. Our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>St. Clair v. Director, OWCP, </em>No. 05-548-BLA (B.R.B. Mar. 28, 2006). We deny St. Clair\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
