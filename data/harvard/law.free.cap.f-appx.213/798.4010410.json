In 1991, authorities arrested Fernandez after he had attempted to participate in a drug \u201crip off\u201d of 50 kilograms of cocaine. Authorities recovered several firearms on his person and from a rental vehicle, which was going to be used for the cocaine \u201crip off.\u201d Fernandez was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922 and 924(e). He pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The base offense level used to calculate his sentence for his \u00a7 922(g) conviction was determined by his attempt to \u201crip off\u201d 50 kilograms of cocaine and then was enhanced by two levels on the ground that Fernandez possessed several dangerous firearms during the commission of the attempted offense. In October 2005, Fernandez filed the instant motion for modification of his sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing, among other things, that Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), permitted a reduction of his sentence. The district court denied Fernandez\u2019s motion for modification, finding that: (1) Amendment 599 was inapplicable to his case because it applies only to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), criminalizing the carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a drug offense, and not to convictions under \u00a7 922(g); and (2) a <em>Booker </em>claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">On appeal, Fernandez argues that the district court abused its discretion in determining that Amendment 599 does not apply to convictions under \u00a7 922(g)(1), as the Sentencing Commission\u2019s intention that Amendment 599 also applies to \u00a7 922(g) convictions is evidenced by the Commission\u2019s use of a case involving a \u00a7 922(g) conviction, in the absence of a \u00a7 924(c) conviction, to illustrate the proper application of the amendment. He argues that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s intent to prohibit double counting would be frustrated if a district court could calculate a defendant\u2019s base offense level using an offense not charged, and then enhance the sentence for possession of firearms in connection with that offense, all the while the defendant is actually being convicted of a firearm possession offense. Additionally, Fernandez argues that the district court erred because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>amounts to a \u201cformal \u2018clarification\u2019 \u201d of the guidelines, and thus, can be applied retroactively under \u00a7 3582(c)(3) to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">We review a district court\u2019s decision of whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). According to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court is permitted to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence if his sentencing range subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">Amendment 599 amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, which provides the base offense level for individuals who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>have violated either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 844(h), 924(c), or 929(a). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. Amendment 599 provides that, \u201c[i]f a sentence under [\u00a7 2K2.4] is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristics for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C., Amendment 599. The purpose of Amendment 599 was \u201cto clarify under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe first sentence of the new application note reinforces what courts have always known when a defendant is convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) violation and an underlying offense, the defendant\u2019s possession of a weapon cannot be used to enhance the level of the underlying offense\u201d). It was intended to prevent double counting for firearm use in any one criminal event. <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1180 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines is inapplicable to Fernandez, because he did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 844(h), 924(c), or 929(a). Additionally, because the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, is not a guideline amendment made retroactively applicable, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fernandez\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
