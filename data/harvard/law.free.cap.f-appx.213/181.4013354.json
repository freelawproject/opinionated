The district court sentenced Curry to mandatory life imprisonment after the Government notified Curry pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) of its intent to seek enhanced statutory penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">Curry\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tioning (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to convict Curry on Counts 1, 2, and 4, and (2) whether Curry\u2019s prior conviction for felony possession of cocaine under North Carolina law qualified as a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 802(44) (West Supp.2006), for purposes of applying enhanced statutory penalties. Counsel states, however, that he has found no meritorious grounds for appeal. Curry has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Counsel raises as a potential issue the sufficiency of the evidence on Counts 1, 2, and 4, based upon the small amount of crack and cash seized from Curry\u2019s apartment. Our review of the trial transcript convinces us that the evidence was sufficient to convict. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.) (discussing standard of review for denial of motion filed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Snow, </em>462 F.3d 55, 70-71 (2d Cir.2006) (discussing elements of \u00a7 856 offense); <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing elements of possession with intent to distribute); <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002) (discussion \u00a7 924(c) offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Curry also contends on appeal that his North Carolina conviction for felony possession of cocaine did not qualify as a felony drug offense for purposes of applying the enhanced statutory penalties in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2006). Counsel correctly concedes, however, that this claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. We have carefully reviewed the issues raised in Curry\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we affirm Curry\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
