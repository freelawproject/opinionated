McPhatter\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but addressing the validity of McPhatter\u2019s plea and sentence. McPhatter has filed a pro se supplemental brief, arguing that his sentence was based on a greater drug quantity than that to which he admitted. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-21\">We find that McPhatter\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. McPhatter was properly advised of his rights, the offense charged, and the mandatory minimum and maximum sentences for the offense. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">McPhatter contends that his sentencing exposure should be limited to the 1.5 kilograms of cocaine powder that he admitted to in his statements to the government. However, during the plea hearing, McPhatter was fully advised that other drug amounts could be considered at sentencing as relevant conduct and could increase his sentence. McPhatter acknowledged his understanding of the relevant conduct provisions and expressed his desire to continue in his guilty plea. We find that the additional drug amounts were properly considered by the district court in determining McPhatter\u2019s guideline range. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.3 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">We find that the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the 216-month sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006); <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005). Additionally, we find that the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated [guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm McPhatter\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McPhatter\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
