Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-18\">Nibert first argues that the district court erred in its application of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 3A1.1 (2005) by not specifying how the victim was particularly vulnerable to the offense. In reviewing the calculation of the advisory sentencing guideline range, this court \u201creviewfs] the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006). We find that the district court did not clearly err in its determination of the victim\u2019s unusual vulnerability and Nibert\u2019s targeting of that vulnerability pursuant to our decision in <em>United States v. Singh, </em>54 F.3d 1182, 1190-91 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-19\">Nibert also argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility, USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 (2005). <em>United States v. May, </em>359 F.3d 683, 688 (4th Cir.2004). We conclude from the materials before us on appeal that the district court did not clearly err in refusing to apply an acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-20\">Accordingly, we affirm Nibert\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
