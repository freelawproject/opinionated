We find it sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The defendants were tried jointly on a charge of attempted robbery. From the evidence it appeared that the complaining witness, with $600 of her employer\u2019s money in a suitcase, was driving to work in a small coupe. ' A big sedan drove up, stopped in front of her, the co-defendant alighted, then the big sedan drove over to a near-by street. The co-defendant made an attempt to rob the complaining witness of her suitcase, but she resisted, physically \u2022 and vocally, with the result that he gave up. his endeavor and fan over to the waiting sedan and made his escape. This evidence was clearly sufficient to warrant the jury in concluding that an attempted robbery had taken place, and with other evidence justified the inference that the driver of the big sedan aided and abetted in its commission. If appellant was sufficiently identified as that driver his conviction must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">No one had a perfectly satisfactory look at the driver of the big sedan, but even so, there was plenty of evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that appellant was the driver. Of importance was the testimony of one of the carpenters, who came to the rescue of the complaining witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>that the appearance of the appellant and of the driver in question was similar, that he was not absolutely positive, but that he believed appellant was the party. This evidence was competent; the weight to be given it was a problem for the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rolfe, </em>(1882) 61. Cal. 540, 543; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>(1919) 41 Cal. App. 373, 377 [182 Pac. 766]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>(1928) 94 Cal. App. 628, 633 [271 Pac. 765].) Of significance, because in harmony with this identification, was the proof that the big sedan was owned by appellant; he was driving it when arrested the evening of the day the robbery was attempted; at the time of his arrest there reposed in the tonneau of the car an automatic gun similar to that used by the co-defendant in the morning drama; he gave conflicting stories about his whereabouts with his co-defendant the night before; and he and his co-defendant lived together.  Several witnesses described the driver as a person dressed in a woman\u2019s clothes, but looking like a man. It was pertinent, in view of this circumstance, to prove that appellant had masqueraded as a woman a few months before the day in question. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>149 Cal. 325, 337 [86 Pac. 671].) If it was error to allow testimony of another similar act four years earlier, it was due to its remoteness, and under the circumstances does not warrant a reversal. <em> </em>Nor does the refusal of the court to strike the statement of a witness that \u201cI thought it was a man,\u201d require us to set the judgment aside. The statement was made in answer to the question: \u201cDid this party have the appearance of being a man or woman?\u201d and the jury undoubtedly understood that-if it was a conclusion, it was a conclusion based on an affirmative answer to the question asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">We are of the opinion that the evidence is sufficient, and appellant has suffered no error prejudicial to his rights. The judgment and the order denying appellant\u2019s motion, for a new trial, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Conrey, P. J., and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
