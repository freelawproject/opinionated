Illinois, 1964, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977, but long before Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. Conley filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas which was denied without written opinion on May 23, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">After Conley\u2019s arrest, incriminatory statements were extracted from him which were introduced in evidence against him upon his trial. The testimony at the federal habeas corpus hearing was undisputed that Conley was not advised of his right to remain silent. The evidence was in dispute as to whether he requested the aid of counsel before making the admissions, but there was no dispute that he was not offered counsel or advised of his constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">The district court granted the writ of habeas corpus without prejudice to the right of the State to retry Conley upon the indictment within a stated reasonable time. The district court based its decision solely on the failure to warn Conley of his right to remain silent, thereby following its earlier decision in Payton v. Beto, C.A. No. 66-H-291, S.D. Tex., Oct. 14, 1966. That decision was later reversed by this Court. Texas, et al. v. Payton, 5th Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">There are many factual differences between this case and <em>Payton </em>but none requiring a different result. So much written in the full opinion reversing <em>Payton </em>has application to this case that to repeat much the same thoughts would be superfluous. For the reasons fully set forth in that opinion, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded with instructions to deny the relief requested and dismiss the Writ, without prejudice to Conley to reapply in the State court in which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-18\">.
