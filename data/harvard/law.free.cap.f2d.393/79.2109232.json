The ultimate issue in this case is whether the commitment hearing is a critical stage in Georgia criminal procedure. Hamilton v. State of Alabama, 1961, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114; White v. State of Maryland, 1963, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">It should be noted at the outset that if the Georgia commitment hearing is a critical stage, then a defendant would have to be informed of his right to counsel \u2014 and to appointed counsel if he were indigent \u2014 regardless of whether he made any request. A defendant \u201cwhose sophistication or status had fortuitously prompted him to make a request\u201d should not have the right by virtue of his request when one of less sophistication might not think to make any request. See Miranda v. State of Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. That Kerr requested a lawyer to be present at his commitment hearing is thus irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-23\">\u201cThe Georgia appellate courts have held that the commitment hearing in Georgia, for the purpose of determining whether there is probable cause to believe the accused guilty of the crime charged and bind him over for indictment by the grand jury, is not inherently a critical stage of a criminal proceeding.\u201d Moore v. State, 1966, 113 Ga.App. 738, 149 S.E.2d 492; Blake v. State, 1964, 109 Ga.App. 636, 137 S.E.2d 49, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 924, 85 S.Ct. 281, 13 L.Ed.2d 337; Molignaro v. Balkcom, 1965, 221 Ga. 150, 143 S.E.2d 748; Smith v. Fuller, 1967, 223 Ga. 673, 157 S.E.2d 447.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And this Court has recently held that an incarcerated defendant does not have a constitutional right to a preliminary commitment hearing in Georgia. Scarbrough v. Dutton, 5 Cir. 1968, 393 F.2d 6 (1968).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It would follow that denial of appointed counsel at such a hearing, when it is accorded, does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-24\">White v. State of Maryland, supra, and Hamilton v. State of Alabama, supra, are inapposite. In <em>White </em>the defendant pleaded guilty without a lawyer at the preliminary hearing after having been in custody for over two months. Then at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>his trial, even though he pleaded not guilty, his original plea entered at the preliminary hearing was allowed in evidence against him. In <em>Hamilton </em>it was decided that the Alabama arraignment proceeding was a critical stage in the criminal proceeding because some basic motions, such as a plea of insanity, had to be pleaded there or lost. Kerr here alleges no prejudicial or detrimental effect from his appearance at the hearing without counsel. \u201cWhere no plea was called for or made, and no prejudice was shown, White does not require compulsory furnishing of counsel.\u201d Delgado v. Pagan Cancel, 1 Cir. 1966, 363 F.2d 105; United States ex rel. Cooper v. Reincke, 2 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 608, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 909, 85 S.Ct. 205, 13 L.Ed.2d 181; DeToro v. Pepersack, 4 Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 341, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 909, 85 S.Ct. 198, 13 L.Ed.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-14\">. In Manor v. State, 1961, 221 Ga. 866, 148 S.E.2d 305, the court, apparently outraged at the treatment of the defendant in the Savannah jail, observed that the commitment hearing was a \u201cvaluable right\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s decision, made without benefit of counsel, to waive his commitment hearing was \u201ccrucial\u201d. In subsequent cases this decision lias been ignored, see cases cited in text, and distinguished away, Cannon v. Grimes, 1967, 223 Ga. 35, 153 S.E.2d 445; Whisman v. State, 1967, 223 Ga. 124, 153 S.E.2d 548. Viewing the cruel and inhumane manner in which the defendant in <em>Manor </em>had been treated in the jail, the Georgia court nullified all of the proceedings in the case. We consider <em>Manor </em>as have the Georgia courts, as limited to the extraordinary facts and circumstances of that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-26\">. As a general rule there is no constitutional right to a preliminary hearing prior to indictment or trial. Graves v. Eyman, 9 Cir. 1967, 373 F.2d 324, 325; United States v.
