The term of occupancy was from November 1, 1961 to June 30, 1969, but there was a proviso in the agreement that the \u201cpermittor\u201d could revoke the \u201cpermit at any time.\u201d On May 8, 1964, the United States deeded the premises to plaintiff. The deed provided, inter alia, that plaintiff took title subject to all existing \u201ceasements\u201d and \u201cservitudes\u201d. Plaintiff gave defendant notice to quit the premises on August 12, 1964, effective January 12, 1965. Defendant refused to quit and this action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The Municipal Court held that plaintiff was entitled to immediate possession of the premises and was not liable to defendant for any damage resulting from eviction, but the Court in exercise of its \u201cequity powers\u201d stayed eviction for three months \u201cin view of the difficulty in finding suitable premises. * * * \u201d College of the Virgin Islands v. Vitex Manufacturing Co., Ltd., 5 V.I. 34, 49 (1965). The Municipal Court\u2019s judgment was affirmed in all respects by the District Court which found: (1) that the agreement between defendant and the Virgin Islands Corporation was a lease and not a license and therefore not a \u201cservitude\u201d under the deed between the United States and plaintiff; (2) that parol evidence of an alleged oral \u201cagreement\u201d between defendant and the president of the Virgin Islands Corporation at the time of the lease\u2019s execution that it would only be revoked' in the event of a national emergency, was not admissible; and (3) that equitable estoppel did not apply with respect to the alleged oral agreement because Virgin Islands Corporation\u2019s president lacked authority to make such representations and defendant should have known of his lack of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">On review of the record we find no error. The Order of the District Court of November 18, 1966 affirming the decision of the Municipal Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Thomas and St. John, with costs to plaintiff-appellee, will be affirmed for the reasons so well stated by Judge Gordon in his opinion, subject to the modification that the defendant-appellant shall have three months from the date of our mandate within which to vacate the premises, provided that defendant-appellant continues to pay rent accruing during the term of its occupancy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
