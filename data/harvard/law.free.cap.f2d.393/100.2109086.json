The district court, after a hearing, made extensive findings, and among other matters, found appellant was vigorously represented by able and competent trial counsel of his own choice; that certain witnesses were not called because of trial strategy known to and discussed between appellant and his attorney; that appellant was advised by his counsel of his right to appeal, and knowingly waived that right; that he had had a fair trial, and a fair hearing on his \u00a7 2255 motion, when he was represented by able and competent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
