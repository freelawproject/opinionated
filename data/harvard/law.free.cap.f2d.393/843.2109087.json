It was appellant\u2019s position that appellee\u2019s registered mark is a substantial duplicate of its marks and trade name, and is applied to goods identical with those sold by appellant. Appellant concludes its petition with the averment that appellee\u2019s use of the registered mark here in issue will damage appellant because of the likelihood of confusion and deception as to the origin of appellee\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Briefly stated, the board concluded that there is no likelihood of confusion between appellant\u2019s mark \u201cRIDGE PIKE HOMES\u201d and appellee\u2019s mark \u201cBLUE RIDGE HOMES\u201d even though used on similar goods. It found appellant\u2019s record insufficient to show rights in \u201cRIDGE HOMES\u201d prior to the filing date of appellee\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Appellant contends here, as it did below, that the record proves that it had used \u201cRIDGE PIKE HOMES\u201d and \u201cRIDGE HOMES\u201d from a date commencing earlier than the earliest date which can be relied on by appellee as its first date of use of \u201cBLUE RIDGE HOMES\u201d ; that the goods of the parties are identical; and that the dominant portion of the respective marks constitutes the term \u201cRIDGE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">We have reviewed the record as to appellant\u2019s asserted use of the mark \u201cRIDGE HOMES.\u201d On the record we agree with the board that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-12\">* * . * There is however no evidence of any use by petitioner [appellant] of \u201cRIDGE HOMES\u201d prior to February 1963 and the mere statement by the witness that petitioner has been so referred to is wholly insufficient to establish that petitioner was publicly known as \u201cRIDGE HOMES\u201d from March 1956 until its adoption as a mark in 1963. Petitioner has not established superior rights in \u201cRIDGE HOMES\u201d and said mark cannot be considered in determining whether petitioner is damaged by respondent\u2019s [appellee\u2019s] registration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Thus, the issue to be determined here is the likelihood of confusion arising from the use of the marks \u201cRIDGE PIKE HOMES\u201d and \u201cBLUE RIDGE HOMES\u201d on the respective goods of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Comparing the marks in their entire-ties, the words \u201cRIDGE\u201d and \u201cHOMES\u201d are used in both marks. However, the qualifying term \u201cPIKE\u201d as used in appellant\u2019s mark and the qualifying term \u201cBLUE\u201d as used in appellee\u2019s mark make the marks different in sound, appearance and meaning. We agree with the board that confusion would not be likely, and support this conclusion, as the board did, by the statement in its opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-15\">* * * The term \u201cBLUE RIDGE\u201d is a unitary term having reference to the southeastern range of the Allegheny Mountains. The term \u201cRIDGE PIKE\u201d is also a unitary term and is the name of the road on which petitioner [appellant] is located. The impression created by each of these terms is completely different. Further, considering respondent\u2019s [appellee\u2019s] mark in its entirety, there is very little resemblance between that mark and petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>er\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] mark in appearance and we also note a substantial difference in sound between \u201cBLUE RIDGE\u201d and \u201cRIDGE PIKE.\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\">. Registration No. 693,036, for \u201cprefabricated building components \u2014 namely, roof trusses and wall panels,\u201d in Class 12, issued February 16, 1960. The word \u201cHOMES\u201d is disclaimed apart from the mark. Appellee alleges a date of first use of May 29, 1959.
