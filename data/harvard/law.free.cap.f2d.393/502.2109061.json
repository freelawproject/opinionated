The district court stayed the action pending arbitration demanded by the union pursuant to another provision in the agreement and the company appeals. Jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1292(a). Hilti, Inc. v. Oldach, 1 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">The company properly, at least in a case where the union asserts there was no strike, does not contend that by striking over its alleged grievance the union waived whatever right it had to insist on arbitration. Drake Bakeries, Inc. v. Local 50, American Bakery, etc., Workers, 1962, 370 U.S. 254, 82 S.Ct. 1346, 8 L.Ed.2d 474. Rather, it stakes all on a claim that arbitration was not required under the agreement. The pertinent provisions are found in Article 8, the \u201cGrievance Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-16\">8.1 The term \u201cgrievance\u201d means a difference or dispute between the Company and the Union, or between the Company and any employee with respect to the interpretation, meaning, application, claim of breach or violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-17\">8.2 All grievances must be taken up within ten (10) working days of their occurrence or they shall not be deemed valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-18\">8.3 Any grievance as described above shall be settled in accordance with the following procedure:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-19\">First: Employees in the first instance may register grievances with the Steward who shall present such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>grievances to the immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor\u2019s answer shall be given as soon as possible but not to exceed one working day. Matters unsettled at this point shall be reduced to writing and given to the Manager of Industrial Relations of the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">Second: [We omit reproduction of this, and also of step three, both of which provide for continuation of the employee-initiated grievance commenced under step one.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">8.4 Within sixty (60) days of the date of the Company\u2019s answer of the Third Step, the Union will notify the Company in writing of its intention to (a) accept the Company\u2019s answer as final disposition, (b) withdraw the grievance, or (c) submit the grievance or grievances to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">8.5 Any grievance not settled in the grievance procedure may be submitted to arbitration by either party. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The company properly concedes that, standing alone, Art. 8.1 is broad enough to describe employer grievances as well as employee grievances. However, we point out that this is because of the generality of its language, as distinguished from a specific statement. Arts. 8.3 and 8.4 are very clearly in terms limited to employee grievances. We cannot accept the union\u2019s contention that this is a \u201cstrained interpretation.\u201d Rather, if we stop here we must agree with the company that this particularization in Arts. 8.3 and 8.4 calls into effect the principle that a subsequent specification impliedly limits the meaning of a preceding generalization. J. E. Faltin Motor Transp., Inc. v. Eazor Express, Inc., 3 Cir., 1959, 273 F.2d 444; Rice Growers Ass\u2019n of Cal. v. F. Carrera &amp; Hno., Inc., 1 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 843; Antonio Marcaccio, Inc. v. Santurri, 1931, 51 R.I. 440, 155 A. 571; 4 Williston, Contracts \u00a7 619 (3d ed. 1961). When Art. 8.3, which speaks only in terms of employee-initiated grievances, incorporates \u201cAny grievance as described above,\u201d that is, all grievances described above, the indication is that the limitation apparent on the face of this article was equally intended for the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The union\u2019s response is that this indication is contradicted by Art. 8.5, which permits \u201cAny grievance not settled in the grievance procedure\u201d to be submitted to arbitration by \u201ceither party.\u201d If there were a necessary inconsistency between Art. 8.5 and the clear language of Arts. 8.3 and 8.4 we would have a serious ambiguity in the agreement. However, we do not so read it. The phrase \u201cAny grievance not settled in the grievance procedure,\u201d as we have said, refers to and relates back to the grievances to which the grievance procedure was applicable. This in no way advances the union\u2019s position. Nor, in our opinion, does the fact that Art. 8.5 permits \u201ceither\u201d party to call for arbitration. While at first blush it might be wondered why the company would want to arbitrate an unsettled employee grievance, we find it significant that this agreement is drafted with the intent of handling disagreements in the format of employee-initiated grievances. See, for example, Arts. 14.3(b) and (d). Yet Art. 8.4(b) expressly provides that the union may withdraw a particular grievance without accepting the adverse outcome. The company, however, might wish the matter settled. It could, in such instances, utilize Art. 8.5 to seek arbitration. We lack expertise to know whether, alternatively, the company, in the interest of good relations, might wish to yield to a particular grievance temporarily, but not to do so permanently, and hence not treat the grievance as \u201csettled.\u201d If so, again it could turn to Art. 8.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">We recognize that the strong policy favoring labor arbitration requires doubts to be resolved in favor of arbitration. United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 1960, 363 U.S. 574, 582-583, 80 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409. However, where the undertaking in question was in all other respects oriented towards employee grievances only, the mere fact that the agreement contains a clause which might be more broadly construed if it were not limited by specific provisions is not a sufficient ambiguity. Nor is the belief that it would be preferable had the agreement been broader sufficient reason to make it so. That only employee grievances should be arbitrated is not a result absurd on its face. Cf. Boeing Co. v. International Union, 3 Cir., 1967, 370 F.2d 969. Our duty to determine whether under a proper construction of the agreement the parties agreed to arbitrate, Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., 1962, 370 U.S. 238, 82 S.Ct. 1318, 8 L.Ed.2d 462; Drake Bakeries, Inc. v. Local 50, American Bakery, etc., Workers, supra, does not require us to do violence to principles of contract interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The stay order is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
