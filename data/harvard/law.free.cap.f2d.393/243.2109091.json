JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"ABqh\">This is a petition to review, pursuant to section 7482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a decision of the Tax Court, Theodore Tannenwald, Jr., Judge, T.C. Memo 1966-192, assessing income tax liabilities against the petitioner<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>for the years 1958, 1959 and 1960. The Tax Court held that the taxpayer was not entitled in 1961 to a deduction from regular income for her loss on the sale or exchange of stock issued by Windmill Food Stores of Hewlett, Inc. (herein Hewlett) under section 1244 of the Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the deduction was held invalid, the net operating loss it was alleged to have created in 1961 could not be carried back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>to the tax years in issue. We hold that the loss qualified as an ordinary loss under section 1244 and reverse and remand for determination of the Commissioner\u2019s alternative contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In 1958, Hewlett was organized. Petitioner was the sole stockholder and paid $40,000 for her 40 shares pursuant to a corporate motion and resolution of March 31, 1959 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provided that on April 6, 1959 the petitioner was to pay $40,000 for 40 shares of Hewlett issued pursuant to section 1244 of the Code. Early in 1961, Hewlett filed a petition in bankruptcy under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act together with a plan of reorganization which was approved by the referee and confirmed. At that point the petitioner was owed $62,000 by Hewlett. Petitioner waived any right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>payment she might have under the plan. In March of 1961, petitioner entered into an agreement with Pick \u2019N Save, Inc., under which the latter agreed to buy and the petitioner agreed to sell her 40 shares in Hewlett. The purchase price was $100,000 plus the value of certain security deposits, other items, and the value of Hewlett\u2019s inventory on the date of closing less credits for certain secured liabilities. All payments on account of the purchase price were to be deposited in escrow for one year after the closing for the purpose of paying any claims of Hewlett\u2019s creditors for moneys due and owing at the day of closing. At closing, the petitioner was to deliver an executed release of all obligations due it from Hewlett. On April 13, the plan of arrangement was confirmed. The next day, Hewlett reaffirmed its obligations to the petitioner on its indebtedness to her, in a resolution which stated that the petitioner would accept as full payment of her claims any sum paid by Pick \u2019N Save left with the escrowee after the other creditors had been paid. On the same day, petitioner\u2019s sale of stock to Pick \u2019N Save was closed. After payment of Hewlett\u2019s other creditors, the escrowee had $30,000 left for payment to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Petitioner claims that the $30,000 was received as final payment on Hewlett\u2019s indebtedness to her, that her stock in Hewlett was worthless in 1961, and that she was therefore entitled to a regular loss under 1244 of the Code. The government contends that the stock in question was not 1244 stock so that all she was entitled to was a capital loss. Or, alternatively, if the stock is 1244 stock, the $30,000 received from Pick \u2019N Save was received for it, so that the regular loss available is -only $10,000, and that an unresolved question of fact, remains as to the year in which the $10,000 loss was incurred. The Tax Court held for the government, relying on a finding that the stock in question was not 1244 stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> The Tax Court\u2019s holding that the Hewlett stock was not 1244 stock was based upon a factual finding that the stock was not issued pursuant to a <em>written plan </em>as required by the Statute and Regulation 1.1244(e)-l(c). See Bruce v. United States, 68-1 USTC par. 9112 (S.D.Tex.1967); Morgan v. Commissioner, 46 T.C. 878, 888-890 (1966); Spillers v. Commissioner, 26 T.C.M. 1069, 1073-74 (1967); Warner v. Commissioner, 48 T.C. 49 (1967). We disagree. The corporate minutes are a sufficient writing under the circumstances here to meet the requirements of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The regulations were not adopted until a time subsequent to the stock issue here, and we cannot charge the taxpayer with knowledge of their provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The purpose of 1244 was to encourage the formation of small business units found to be socially and economically desirable in spite of the high risk shown by the high percentage of failure of such units in their formative years, by granting favorable tax treatment to losses incurred by investors in the formation of the small business units. At least during the period prior to the adoption of regulations spelling out under the authorization in the statute to promulgate such regulations, the details required of the plan, we think that fidelity to the purpose of the statute calls for liberal application of its language. Here the very formation of the corporation and issue of its stock was expressed to be in conformity with and limited to the conditions required by section 1244, the amount and period of time actually involved were within the statutory limitations, and the contemplated loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The Commissioner relies on the Tax Court decisions in Shapiro v. Commissioner, 25 T.C.M. 654 (1966); Morgan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>v. Commissioner, supra; Warner v. Commissioner, supra, and Spillers v. Commissioner, supra. These cases, even if correctly decided, are clearly distinguishable. In <em>Shapiro </em>there was apparently no proof that the stockholder-directors had 1244 in mind or knew of its requirements, nor was there any proof of the value of the property exchanged for the stock in order to establish its basis. <em>Morgan </em>involved two payments into the corporation, one of which failed to qualify because made before any plan was adopted or entered in the minutes, the second because made after the corporate purpose had failed, in order to complete corporate liquidation and hopefully salvage something by 1244 treatment of the deficit, not for the bona fide purchase of stock. In <em>Warner </em>there was no reference to sec. 1244 in the minutes and the plan for stock purchase contemplated periodic stock purchases (over an indefinite period of time which might well extend beyond two years) from a trust whose rate of purchase depended on trust receipts from a percentage of salary payments by and for employes of another corporation. In <em>Spillers </em>there was no reference to sec. 1244 in the corporate minutes concerning the purchase of stock, and a stock voting agreement of the same date contemplated possible future issues, uncertain in time and amount. In Bruce v. United States, supra, the first purchase was prior to the adoption of the minutes relied on, and in none of the resolutions was there any reference to sec. 1244 or its requisites except for one which, as in <em>Morgan, </em>was after dissolution had been determined on and was held not a bona fide purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Subsequent to oral argument, the Commissioner has called our attention to the case of Spiegel v. Commissioner, 49 T.C. -, filed February 23, 1968, denying deduction for lack of a written plan. However, there were in that case no corporate minutes referring to the adoption of a see. 1244 plan, such as existed here, and even then Judge Dawson recognized that the court was \u201cindeed faced with a close question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The taxpayer complied with the terms and the spirit of the statute as it stood when the stock was issued. There was no attempt to delay election of the form the transaction should take, or create a hedge against the future. The purpose of the plan requirement, to give unequivocal evidence of the taxpayer\u2019s commitment to investment in the covered type of small business enterprise, is met here. She is entitled to the benefit of the deduction under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The decision is reversed and remanded to the Tax Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b291-26\"> Since the petitioner and her deceased husband filed joint returns, and acted to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>gether on all the relevant transactions, we have treated all transactions as if they were solely the petitioner\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-5\">.
