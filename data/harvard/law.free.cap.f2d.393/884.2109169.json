Goings v. United States, 377 F.2d 753 (8 Cir. 1967). Defendant was retried and found guilty under Counts II and III of the indictment and was sentenced to three years on the second count and two years on the third count, the sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-22\">Defendant raises upon appeal four alleged errors occurring in the trial: (1) improper cross examination of the government\u2019s own witnesses, (2) an erroneous direction by the trial court to the state\u2019s witnesses to answer all questions unless the court told them otherwise, (3) restriction of defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross examination and (4) error in the improper balancing and positioning of the instructions relating to the specific intent of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-23\"> We have thoroughly reviewed all points raised by the defendant. We are unimpressed. The grounds raised necessarily relate to the trial area within the broad discretion of the trial judge in conducting the litigation. See 377 F.2d at 762. An advocate\u2019s technical disagreement with a trial judge\u2019s discretionary rulings does not constitute grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-24\">Defendant emphasizes the court\u2019s prejudicial instructions to certain witnesses. It is apparent these witnesses were in the middle of \u201ca tug of war\u201d between the state and defendant\u2019s counsel, as to whether they could or perhaps more accurately stated, whether they should assert Fifth Amendment privileges to transactions for which they had already pleaded guilty. We are convinced that the court with unusual restraint properly handled the situation without prejudice to anyone\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-25\">The instructions adequately covered the defense of intoxication. The instructions given were suggested by this court in its first opinion. See 377 F.2d at 757, n. 3. Defendant asserts that the instructions are arranged in a disadvantageous position and misstate the defendant\u2019s legal defense and are therefore misleading. Instructions are entitled to be read as a whole. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>is presumed to have followed their direction. This is not a case where there is inconsistent or confusing phraseology.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The evidence clearly sustains the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
