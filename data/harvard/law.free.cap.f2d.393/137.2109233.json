Patterson drove his own automobile from the Naval Base to his home in Virginia Beach, a distance of about seven miles, ate his evening meal with his family and commenced his return trip to the Base.

The district court held that there was no liability on the United States and dismissed the action for the reason that, at the time and place of the accident, Lt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Patterson was not acting \u201cin line of duty\u201d or \u201cwithin the scope of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AH7\">The facts and the reasons assigned by the district court in support of the order dismissing the action are fully stated in a memorandum opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on which we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-24\">.
