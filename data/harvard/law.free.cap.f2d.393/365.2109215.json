We held that it did not in Shearer v. Bakery and Confectionery Workers\u2019 International Union of America, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>294 F.2d 235 (1961). At that time the survival statute in this jurisdiction (12 D.C.Code \u00a7 101) referred only to \u201ctort actions\u201d in limiting damages to physical injury; and the legislative history made crystal clear the Congressional purpose to exclude from that group libel and slander claims. In 1963 the statute was amended, as part of a general Code revision, to refer to \u201ctort actions for personal injuries\u201d; and appellant asserts that this dictates a different result. \u25a0 We do not agree. The Congress disclaimed any purpose to do more in the 1963 re-codification and revision than \u201cto put that law in a form that will be more useful and understandable\u201d; and it explicitly disavowed any intent to effect substantive change. H.R.Rep. No. 377, S. Rep. No. 743, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. (1963). The language change is not of such a nature as to belie this purpose, nor to undermine our holding in <em>Shearer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
