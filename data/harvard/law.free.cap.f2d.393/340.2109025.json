Until 1960 Ryan had always resided in Illinois. His home, his work and his social and fraternal ties had all been in Chicago. However, in that year he and his wife left that city, coming to Los Angeles to live near their married daughter. Ryan soon learned that he could no longer engage in his lifelong vocation. While in high school he had started working part time in a pharmacy, and shortly afterwards secured a license as an apprentice. Having been so licensed prior to 1917, he had been permitted to take the Illinois pharmacists examination, under a waiver of the customary educational requirements, and had passed. But California did not extend reciprocity to pharmacists from other states and Ryan lacked the educational qualifications required of its applicants. Finally, in the fall of 1961, he took a job as a clerk in a pharmaceutical supply house; while working he fell from a ladder and suffered some injury to his left shoulder which, although painful, did not prevent him from continuing. However, in December he was fired. In the words of his immediate superior in charge \u201cRyan was an efficient man, but his disposition was so bad that it was becoming intolerable. He had to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">He did not work at all throughout 1963 and in 1964 went back alone to Illinois, where he resumed his occupation as a pharmacist. However, after a short time and for reasons other than medical, he returned to his home in California. He has since been unsuccessful in holding any job.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">While it is true that Ryan suffers from many afflictions common to advancing age, in the opinion of several examining doctors, including one specializing in psychiatry, his inability to engage in gainful activity is neither physical nor the result of mental disease, but is the emotional product of a chronic anxiety aggravated by frustration and bitterness in his present environment. But, as the Hearing Examiner aptly stated in his report: \u201cThese circumstances are not the criteria for entitlement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">None of the other points urged by Ryan having merit,</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\">. After the parties had filed their briefs, Congress amended Section 223 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423] to add a definition of \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201cFor purposes of this subsection, a \u2018physical or mental impairment\u2019 is an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Pub.L. No. 90-248, \u00a7 158, 81 Stat. 821 (Jan. 2, 1968), 1967 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 923, 983. We discovered this development after the matter had been submitted for decision and the draft opinion had been agreed upon. We then requested supplemental briefs and the Secretary alone responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-17\">In the recent case of Dean v. Gardner, 9th Cir., 393 F.2d 327 (decided on March 29, 1968) this court held that the amendment was applicable to cases, such as this, which were pending on appeal. See Whitt v. Gardner, 6th Cir., 389 F.2d 906 (decided on February 17, 1968). The requirement in the amendment that the impairment be \u201cdemonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques\u201d serves to emphasize the need for objective medical evidence of disability. In the present case Ryan\u2019s inability to secure employment is the result of emotional and environmental factors rather than the result of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment. We therefore conclude that the amendment serves to provide additional support for the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
