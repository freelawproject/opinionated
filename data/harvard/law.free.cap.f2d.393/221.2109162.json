Otherwise, this agreement shall continue from November 1 through October 31 from year to year and can be changed only by mutual consent or through negotiations started by written notice of one of the parties to the other, on or before September 1st of any succeeding year. Should either party propose such amendments or a new contract, and an agreement proves impossible, the difference or differences shall be arbitrated as herein provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">By letter dated August 30, 1965, the Union gave notice of its desire to make changes and add new provisions to the contract. Collective bargaining sessions were then conducted on September 29, December 2 and December 3, but no final agreement was achieved. The apparent stumbling block was a \u201cmanning provision\u201d not included in the original contract. Concluding that an impasse had been reached, the Union informed the Company on December 7, 1965, of its intention to submit the issue to arbitration. The Company refused, advising the Union that it considered the contract expired as of October 31, 1965, and that it was therefore no longer obligated to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-19\">The Union thereupon instituted this action under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for damages and to compel the Company to arbitrate the unresolved differences as provided in their collective bargaining agreement. Each party filed a motion for summary judgment and, after oral argument, the District Judge granted the Union\u2019s motion, obligating the Company to arbitrate, but he awarded no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">The Company challenges the order on two grounds. It contends that the court lacked jurisdiction to compel arbitration under a contract which, by its own terms, had terminated. The Company also maintains that regardless of the terms of the contract, the courts are precluded from commanding what has come to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>known as \u201cinterest\u201d or \u201cprospective\u201d or \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Arguing that a court cannot compel either party to arbitrate the terms of a new contract, the Company relies almost exclusively on Judge Wyzanski\u2019s opinion in Boston Printing Pressmen\u2019s Union v. Potter Press, 141 F.Supp. 553 (D.Mass.1956), aff\u2019d, 241 F.2d 787 (1 Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 817, 78 S.Ct. 21, 2 L.Ed.2d 34 (1957). Although the issue confronting this court is precisely the same as that raised in the <em>Potter Press </em>case, we are convinced that, in the light of what we believe to be the teachings of more recent Supreme Court opinions, <em>Potter Press </em>no longer represents an accurate interpretation of section 301 and, for reasons to be stated, we do not follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad_\">When writing that opinion, Judge Wyzanski was confronted with the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 348 U.S. 437, 447, 75 S.Ct. 488, 494, 99 L.Ed. 510 (1955) that \u201c[t]he aim [of section 301] was to open the federal courts to suits on agreements solely because they were between labor organizations and employers <em>without providing federal law for such suits.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) He therefore concluded that section 301 was merely jurisdictional in nature and declined to hold an arbitration clause enforceable under that section. Finding the necessary substantive law in the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14 (1955), the Judge said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM6D\">\u201c[A]ssuming the constitutionality of a statute which would authorize federal courts to enforce legislative awards of arbitrators, I nonetheless conclude that the present United States arbitration statute does not seek to reach that constitutional limit, but is concerned only with the enforcement of quasi-judicial awards directed at the ascertainment of facts in a past controversy and at the prescription of recoverable damages or other suitable awards for that which has been broken not for that which is to be built.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">141 F.Supp. 557-558. While the First Circuit wholeheartedly endorsed the District Court\u2019s conclusion that section 301 was merely jurisdictional and that the appropriate substantive law was to be found in the United States Arbitration Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a number of circuits, including our own, found substantive rights encompassed in section 301(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Still other circuits refused to find the necessary substantive rights in either section 301 or the United States Arbitration Act, thereby granting a forum but no remedy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>In an effort to resolve this divergence, the Supreme Court, in Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 450-451, 77 S.Ct. 912, 914-915, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957), sanctioned what it declared to be the majority view:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARa\">\u201c[Tjhat \u00a7 301(a) is more than jurisdictional \u2014 that it authorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of these collective bargaining agreements and includes within that federal law specific performance of promises to arbitrate grievances under collective bargaining agreements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Concluding that section 301(a) is more than procedural, the Court went on to instruct lower courts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\u201cthe substantive law to apply in suits under \u00a7 301(a) is <em>federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws. </em>* * * The Labor Management Relations Act expressly furnishes some substantive law. It points out what the parties may or may not do in certain situations. Other problems will lie in the penumbra of express statutory mandates. Some will lack express statutory sanction but will be solved by looking at the policy of the legislation and fashioning a remedy that will effectuate that policy. <em>The range of judicial inventiveness will be determined by the nature of the problem.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">353 U.S. at 456-457, 77 S.Ct. at 918 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">By directing the courts to look to the national labor policy as embodied in federal legislation and judicial decisions when constructing remedies under section 301(a) the Court in <em>Lincoln Mills </em>substantially eroded the foundation of <em>Potter Press. A </em>more direct attack on the First Circuit\u2019s position came in the companion case of General Electric Co. v. Local 205, United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), 353 U.S. 547, 548, 77 S.Ct. 921, 922, 1 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1957). There the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaG\">\u201c[The First Circuit] * * * held that while \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 gave the District Court jurisdiction of the cause, it supplied no body of substantive law to enforce an arbitration agreement governing grievances. But it found such a basis in the United States Arbitration Act, which it held applicable to these collective bargaining agreements. It accordingly reversed the District Court judgment and remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-14\">\u201cWe affirm that judgment and remand the cause to the District Court. <em>We follow in part a different path than the Court of Appeals, </em>though we reach the same result. As indicated in [Lincoln Mills, supra,] we think that \u00a7 301(a) furnishes a body of federal substantive law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">Following the direction of the Court in <em>Lincoln Mills, </em>we turn our attention to the congressional labor statutes and the relevant Supreme Court pronouncements in order to glean the national labor policy from which to fashion an appropriate remedy. By empowering the courts to enforce collective bargaining agreements under section 301, Congress sought to \u201cpromote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements, and * * * thereby promote industrial peace.\u201d S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 17. United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 578, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960). Thus, it is clearly the policy of our national labor legislation to encourage both labor and management to negotiate contracts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>will effectively regulate every aspect of their complex relationship. More than merely enumerating the specific terms of the existing relationship, the mature contract also provides an internal mechanism for the peaceful solution of all disputes. United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., supra at 580, 80 S.Ct. 1347. In such cases, the Act specifically provides that the desirable method for resolving disputes is the \u201cmethod agreed upon by the parties\u201d themselves. Section 203(d) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 173(d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This policy \u201ccan be- effectuated only if the means chosen by the parties for settlement of their differences under a collective bargaining agreement is given full play.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564, 566, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 1346, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Equally significant, in determining national policy, are the recent decisions of the Supreme Court in John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964), Drake Bakeries, Inc. v. Local 50, American Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers, 370 U.S. 254, 82 S.Ct. 1346, 8 L.Ed.2d 474 (1962), Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., 370 U.S. 238, 82 S.Ct. 1318, 8 L.Ed.2d 462 (1962) and the <em>Steelworkers </em>trilogy, supra, which we read as not only recognizing arbitration as an acceptable method of resolving labor disputes, but actively encouraging it. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As Mr. Justice Harlan stated, \u201c[t]his Court has in the past recognized the central role of arbitration in effectuating national labor policy. * * * The preference of national labor policy for arbitration as a substitute for tests of strength between contending forces could be overcome only if other considerations compellingly so demand.\u201d John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, supra at 376 U.S. 549-550, 84 S.Ct. at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">No compelling reason for disregarding the specific provision to arbitrate a new contract in the instant case has been brought to our attention. The Company argues that if courts enforce this type of arbitration, \u201cthere would never be and there could never be an end to this contract.\u201d The Company, professing solicitude for the employees vis-a-vis the Union, further insists that under the District Court\u2019s ruling, \u201cthe printing and pressmen employees of the Company are bound to this Union with hoops of steel which deprive them forever of the right to terminate this Union as their bargaining representative.\u201d Neither argument is persuasive nor do they together outweigh what we conceive to be the national labor policy of strictly enforcing collective bargaining agreements and thereby compelling the parties to resolve peacefully all labor disputes by their previously agreed method.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Contrary to the Company\u2019s assertions, the contract will surely end when both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>parties agree to terminate it and in some instances when either of the original signatories is removed from the scene. See John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, supra at 551-555, 84 S.Ct. 909; Cox and Bok, Cases and Materials on Labor Law, 314-317 (6th ed. 1965). Then too, as the material referred to in Cox and Bok indicates, the employees are not bound \u201cwith hoops of steel\u201d but can, upon the filing of a timely petition within the guidelines of the \u201ccontract bar rules,\u201d designate a new bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The second point is, we believe, the more significant of the two. As long as employees retain their full freedom to choose or dismiss their bargaining representative, it is immaterial that the contract might be of indeterminate duration \u2014if that is what the parties bargained for. We must assume that either the parties mutually agreed on this provision from the start or that one of the parties secured it during the give and take of the collective bargaining. In either case, as long as it is not against the national labor policy, which it certainly is not, it is entitled to enforcement along with any other provision agreed upon by the parties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nothing would be more out of step with our national labor policies than for courts to refuse to enforce a voluntary agreement to arbitrate differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\"> A provision to arbitrate when agreement upon a new contract proves impossible, as is the case here, is part of an existing agreement and refusal to comply therewith constitutes a breach. This court is not asked to determine the provisions of a new contract or to perform any non-judicial function. The drawing of the new contract will be in the hands of an arbitrator where the parties chose to place the authority and responsibility. The court is asked to do no more than enforce a provision of an existing contract, a traditional judicial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">While the Company refers the court to a number of recent decisions affirming the holding in <em>Potter Press,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>these cases are entitled only to the remaining force and validity underlying the rationale of Judge Wyzanski\u2019s opinion. More persuasive are the reasoning and conclusions of the opinions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> equal in number, challenging the statutory predicate of <em>Potter Press </em>in light of more recent Supreme Court decisions, supra. We cast our lot with the latter group.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The question still to be resolved, however, is whether the collective bargaining agreement provided a proper basis for compelling the employer to submit the terms of a <em>new </em>contract to arbitration. Since the duty to arbitrate is \u201cof contractual origin, a compulsory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>submission to arbitration cannot precede judicial determination that the collective bargaining agreement does in fact create such a duty.\u201d John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, supra at 376 U.S. 547, 84 S.Ct. 913. The role of the court in actions brought under section 301 is strictly limited to ascertaining \u201cwhether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., supra at 363 U.S. 568, 80 S.Ct. 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">A reading of the relevant provisions of the contract negotiated in the instant case, discloses that the parties clearly envisioned submitting to arbitration the terms of a new contract.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Company argues, however, that the contract expired on October 31, 1965, thereby relieving it of its duty to arbitrate. Rejecting this contention, the trial court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201c[t]he parties evidently envisaged a continuing contractual relationship with periodic negotiations to make desired changes in the basic contract. * * * Arbitration was established as the terminal step in implementing such changes after negotiated agreement proved impossible. Consequently a bargaining impasse was made a condition precedent to the invocation of the arbitral process. * * '* The contract did not state that notice to arbitrate must be given before [a] certain date. The contract simply stated that should agreement prove impossible then the differences shall be arbitrated. * * * When changes in the basic contract were requested and negotiations begun, the contract, by its own terms, remained in existence until all differences were settled and this settlement included arbitration, if necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">This court intimates neither agreement nor disagreement with the trial judge\u2019s construction of Section 15 of the original contract, for in our view this particular issue involves an interpretation of the contract which should be determined independently by the arbitrator. The contract specifically provides that \u201cthe construction to be placed upon any clause of this agreement\u201d is to be resolved through the grievance procedure incorporated therein,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and we can see no reason why that provision should not govern the construction to be given Section 15. In support of its position, the Union points out that this type of contract has been employed in the industry for over thirty years. If so, who is better qualified to determine the intent of the parties than an arbitrator chosen because of his knowledge of the customs and practices of the industry?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">In United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960), the Supreme Court observed that the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement does not preclude an arbitrator from determining whether the parties intended the arbitration clause to cover disputes arising before, but not submitted to arbitration until after, the termination date. Having concluded that the parties envisioned arbitration of the terms of a new contract, we hold, consistent with <em>Enterprise Wheel, </em>supra, that it is within the province of the arbitrator to determine whether Section 15, properly interpreted, requires that arbitration be requested before the renewal date, as the Company insists, or merely that negotiations be commenced by that date, as the Union argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">We therefore affirm the order of the District Court requiring submission of the dispute to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-16\">. \u201cSection 1</p>\n<p id=\"b270-17\">\u201cThe parties hereto will settle any and all differences affecting wages, hours, working conditions, and shop practices that may arise between them, by conciliation; and if conciliation fails, then . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>by arbitration, as provided below:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u201cA standing committee of * * * representatives selected by the Publisher * * * and * * * the Union * * * shall be appointed * * *.

Although the point is not raised by the Company, some skeptics have suggested that the arbitration of new contracts is unrealistic and unworkable. Our research indicates that quite the opposite is the case.
