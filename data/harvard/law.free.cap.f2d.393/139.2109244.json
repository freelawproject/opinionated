Thompson, Gainesville, Ga., Edgar L. Jenkins, Jasper, Ga., for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-8\">Charles B. Lewis, Jr., Asst. U. S. Atty., Atlanta, Ga., Charles L. Goodson, U. S. Atty., Northern Dist. of Georgia, Henry C. Stockell, Jr., Regional Counsel, John A. Macomber, Atty., Internal Revenue Service, Atlanta, Ga., on the brief, for appel-lee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b188-9\">Before WISDOM, BELL and DYER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b188-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">The appellants prosecute this appeal from their convictions on a jury verdict of violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5205, 5604, and 7206(4), by conspiring to transport, possess, and transfer nontax-paid whiskey with the intention of evading the collection of the tax imposed on whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The threshold issue is the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict. The Government asserts that \u201cA review of the facts shows circumstances which \u2018establish a chain of events which go far beyond the suspicion and conjecture stage.\u2019 Crokett v. United States, 234 F.2d 560 (5 Cir. 1956).\u201d Unfortunately the chain of events does not go far enough: it goes beyond the conjecture stage, but not beyond the reasonable-doubt stage. And there lies the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The Court\u2019s function, so it has been said, is to find whether or not, taking the view most favorable to the Government, there is substantial evidence to support a verdict of guilty. In applying that rule, however, it is vital to keep in mind its exact meaning. \u201cSubstantial evidence * * * means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d The \u201cconclusion\u201d of a jury returning a verdict of guilty is that of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Riggs v. United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 280 F.2d 949, 953-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">The Government sums up its case in one sentence: \u201cIt is not a case of associating with characters of low repute * * * but meetings with people known to be engaged in this liquor conspiracy.\u201d This position does not take cognizance of the basic principle that \u201cGuilt of conspiracy may not be inferred from mere association.\u201d Causey v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 203, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">A review of the complex facts in this case is unnecessary. We have studied the record carefully and conclude that the Government\u2019s case is built on \u201cmere association\u201d. The Government\u2019s evidence, taken in a light most favorable to the Government, simply does not rise to that level of substantiality necessary to support a verdict of guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. The appellants\u2019 convictions must be reversed. Their other arguments on appeal need not be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">Reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
