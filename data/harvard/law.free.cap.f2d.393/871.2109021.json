Respondent resists enforcement of only those portions of the order relating to the discharges of the three employees, Andrew Mezzi, Arthur Arnold, and Lawrence Tremaglio. We find substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s determinations, and we enforce the order in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">Respondent urges that the employees were properly discharged because of poor attendance records and the like. The issue before the Board, however, was \u201cnot whether there existed a valid ground for discharge, but whether the stated ground was the real one.\u201d J. P. Stevens &amp; Co. v. NLRB, 380 F.2d 292, 300 (2d Cir. 1967). And there was ample evidence from which the Board could conclude that the real reason that Mezzi, Arnold and Tremaglio were discharged was that they had engaged in union organizing activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">Respondent\u2019s supervisory personnel boasted of these discharges in conversations with other employees. Vice President Richard Ulbrich and Superintendent Frank Riccardi told employee William Butler that \u201cthey had already caught the head man behind the Union,\u201d they had \u201cgotten rid of * * * Andrew Mezzi.\u201d After questioning him about union activity, Ulbrich made a similar statement to employee Samuel McConnell. He also told McConnell that he had \u201cfired Arnold and Tremaglio\u201d and that they would \u201cnever step foot in the plant again.\u201d Perhaps, as respondent argues, these statements are capable of innocent interpretation. However, they must be read in the light of the findings of coercive interrogation and threats of reprisal and the other evidence in the record of management\u2019s animus toward the union. Under these circumstances it was certainly open to the Board to conclude that these statements constituted admissions that the employees in question had been discharged for union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">Petition for enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
