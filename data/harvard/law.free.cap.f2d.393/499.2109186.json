United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889, and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, so that we decided claimant\u2019s constitutional argument on the authority of United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754, and Lewis v. United States, 348 U.S. 419, 75 S.Ct. 415, 99 L.Ed. 475. See 379 F.2d 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-20\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions were announced in the <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>cases, certiorari was granted and our judgment was vacated. 390 U.S. 204, 88 S.Ct. 899, 19 L.Ed.2d 1035. Grosso does not involve Sections 4411 and 4412 of the Internal Revenue Code, the provisions involved here. In <em>Marchetti, </em>the Court concluded with this admonition (390 U.S. at p. 61, 88 S.Ct. at p. 709):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-21\">\u201cWe emphasize that we do not hold that these wagering tax provisions [26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4411 and 4412] are as such constitutionally impermissible; we hold only that those who properly assert the constitutional privilege as to these provisions may not be <em>criminally </em>punished for failure to comply with their requirements.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-22\">Because this is not a criminal case in which an individual\u2019s liberty is at stake, there is a question as to whether <em>Mar-chetti </em>is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-23\">The respondent monies were declared forfeit pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7302, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>which provides that \u201cno property rights shall exist in * * * property\u201d used \u201cin violating the provisions of the internal revenue laws.\u201d The only provisions of the internal revenue laws which can support forfeiture here are 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4411 and 4412.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><em>Marchetti </em>holds that compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 4411 and 4412 subjects the taxpayer to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201c \u2018real and appreciable,\u2019 and not merely \u2018imaginary and unsubstantial,\u2019 hazards of self-incrimination\u201d (390 U.S. at p. 48, 88 S.Ct. at p. 702).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Claimant Angelini would have subjected himself to exactly the same hazards by complying. In this respect, <em>Marchetti </em>and this case are the same. But the consequences of non-compliance are not the same in the two cases. The prospect of a felony conviction involved in <em>Mar-chetti </em>of course has a greater coercive effect than the possible loss of money involved herein. On the other hand, the prospect of losing in excess of $8,000 has a substantial coercive effect. In this respect, the landmark case of Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746, is controlling. <em>Boyd, </em>was a civil forfeiture action in which the claimant was given a choice between producing a possibly incriminating document and forfeiting the property. The Court held that such a choice was impermissible under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. See Garrity v. State of New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 496-497, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562, which reaffirms and follows <em>Boyd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The only apparent purpose of 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 7302, as applied here, is1 to punish violators of Sections 4411 and 4412 of the Internal Revenue Code by taking away money used in committing the violations. See One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Com. of Pennsylvania, 380 U.S. 693, 700, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. As a practical matter, <em>Marchetti </em>means that such violations are no longer punishable directly. It follows that they should not be punished indirectly through forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for the entry of an appropriate judgment for claimant-appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\"> The applicability of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4901, which was cited by the District Court, is dependent solely on the \u00a7\u00a7 4411 and 4412 violations. Therefore, it need not be considered separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
