From the resultant judgment in favor of defendant, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-24\">The suit was originally by James A. Heron against his brother William J. Heron and the latter\u2019s then wife, Lillian. Appellant is a carpenter. He is a resident of Pennsylvania and was \u2022 such during all times critical to this cause. Defendant William J. Heron, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>period of the claim herein, was a resident of California. Lillian Heron was not served with process and was dismissed without prejudice from the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Prior to the accident William Heron and his wife were living in Santa Ana, Southern California. He had a sixty foot yacht which was being repaired. He suggested to his brother James in Philadelphia that the latter come to Santa Ana and work on the yacht. James Heron testified that he spent his first California night at his brother\u2019s home. According to the deposition of the only other fact witness, Lillian Gramer (formerly Heron), James stayed at the William Heron house for the period prior to the accident except for one or two nights on the boat. He had a bedroom of his own and \u201cused the guest bathroom down the hall.\u201d James apparently arrived in Santa Ana May 26, 1963. On May 30th, Memorial Day, William Heron brought his yacht captain home to dinner. James Heron was with them. Mrs. Gramer said they had two or three drinks after they arrived at the house \u201cand by this time they were feeling pretty good.\u201d She stated, regarding Jim, \u201cWhere he ate it was so sloppy, he was so drunk he couldn\u2019t hardly eat.\u201d Later Mrs. Gramer took care of clearing the table. When she returned from the kitchen Jim had left. She asked the captain where he was and the captain replied \u201cI think he went to bed.\u201d More than an hour later when she was going to retire she noticed that the bathroom light was still on. She knocked on the door saying \u201cJim, are you in the bathroom and are you all right ?\u201d According to her, Jim replied \u201cYes, I am all right. I will go to bed pretty soon.\u201d The next morning about eleven o\u2019clock Jim came to the hallway at the dining room and said, \u201cLil, I hurt my eye last night.\u201d After that he \u201cfinally came out in his bathrobe and he says, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know how I hurt my eye.\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Gramer looked at the eye, it seemed in very bad condition. She called her husband down at the boat to come up to the house. She said that she asked Jim \u201cHow could you have done it and where did it happen?\u201d 'He said \u201cIt happened in the hallway last night when I was on my way from the bedroom to the bathroom.\u201d Mrs. Gramer examined the hall and the bathroom and found no blood or other indication of what had happened to him. She said Jim told her that it was when he first left the dining room table and was walking \u201cfrom my bedroom to the bathroom last night something hit me so hard and with so much force it almost, it knocked me almost to my knees.\u201d He also suggested to Mrs. Gramer \u201cIt could have been somebody coming in, especially if the door was left unlocked.\u201d Mrs. Gramer answered \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Plaintiff-appellant, testifying at the trial, said that on the particular evening he, his brother and the captain went straight from the boat to the brother\u2019s house, stopping only for Bill to obtain \u201ca six-pack of beer.\u201d His testimony was that he had a can of beer at his brother\u2019s and that they had dinner. After the latter, two other guests who had been present left and he, his brother and the captain said goodnight and went to bed. About one thirty in the morning he started for the bathroom, it was dark and he had to feel along the wall. At the bathroom he looked for the light, switch inside the bathroom and could not find it (there was actually a light switch outside the bathroom and one inside) and he hit his eye on the towel hook that was on the back of the door. Late that morning he was taken to the hospital. He was at the latter a week and spent two weeks more at his brother\u2019s and after that went back to light work on the boat for two weeks. He returned to Pennsylvania where he saw two doctors and was examined by another on behalf of appellee. He states he cannot see out of his right eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">On cross-examination appellant admitted that he had been in the particular bathroom at least twice prior to his accident, that he \u201cknew the light switches were on the side of the wall there\u201d, and there were two light switches, one inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the bathroom and the other outside. He stated he had had a second can of beer at dinner but could not finish it. The \u2022second day of the trial he was recalled to the stand for more direct examination. At that time he asserted that his brother said to him \u201cI meant to remove that damn hook * * * I bumped my head on that hook myself.\u201d Queried on cross-examination as to why he didn\u2019t testify like that the first time he was on the stand he answered \u201cNo special reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">There are three grounds of appeal urged, two of these concern the charge of the Court. As above stated there were only two fact witnesses, the plaintiff and Mrs. Gramer who had been the wife of William Heron, plaintiff\u2019s brother, at the time of plaintiff\u2019s accident. We have seen that their testimony gave directly contradictory versions of the occurrence. Mrs. Gramer\u2019s deposition had been taken on March 22, 1967. James Heron was a trial witness. He testified May 16 and 17, 1967. In his charge, the Judge meticulously outlined the jury\u2019s role as triers of the facts. He said inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">\u201cNow, what counsel have said to you in their arguments, or what I say, is not evidence. It is for you peculiarly to remember what the witnesses have said here, both the witness from the stand and deposition testimony. That is your function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\u201cAnd if anything I say in this charge is inconsistent with your memory of the evidence, you must follow your memory and disregard what I say. In order to make certain points clear to you, I have to summarize as I recollect what the evidence was, but you may recollect it quite differently, and if your recollection is different from mine, it is for you to follow your recollection, and not mine; in the same way that you follow your recollection and not counsel\u2019s because you are the ones who are to decide the facts. And part of deciding the facts is remembering what the evidence has been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">\u201cAs I say, you as the jury are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts. It is also your function to determine the weight of the evidence, the accuracy of the witnesses, and the believability of the witnesses. Sometimes we call that \u2018credibility\u2019 of the witnesses. That is the same as \u2018believability\u2019 of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201cYou as jurors are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight their testimony deserves. The fact that the witness is speaking under oath- \u2014 both this witness was speaking under oath that you heard here, and also his wife \u2014 there were two witnesses here; the plaintiff\u2019s wife \u2014 and the fact that Mrs. Heron, his former sister-in-law, was speaking under oath must be considered by you. But this fact may be outweighed by the manner in which the witness testified, by the character of the testimony given, or by contradictory evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Regarding Mrs. Gramer he stated that she \u201chas not been married to his (plaintiff\u2019s) brother for three years, and as far as I can recollect, she would have no interest in the litigaton. * * * She is married to somebody else now. She only was married to his brother for two or three years, according to the testimony, although she was married to other men, one for eighteen years, I think, and another for ten years. So that you must consider that.\u201d The Court also said that Mrs. Gramer had testified first by deposition in March 1967 and that her testimony had been written down. \u201cSo the plaintiff, when he came here this week to testify had had the opportunity to know just what she said. She did not have the opportunity to know what he was going to say. So you have the right to take that into consideration in evaluating their testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">After the conclusion of the charge, plaintff\u2019s attorney told the Court that the defendant had taken a deposition of plaintiff prior to the trial and that Mrs. Gramer and her attorney had a copy of that deposition at the time Mrs. Gramer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>gave her testimony. Such deposition was not in evidence at the trial. The judge noted that the deposition was not in the Court file. It developed, as explained by defendant\u2019s lawyer, that the examination of plaintiff had been a discovery proceeding. The lawyer said regarding the deposition \u201cit does not indicate what he (plaintiff) was going to testify at trial, because only I examined him. He was not examined for the purpose of trial by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. It was discovery.\u201d The Court, speaking to counsel as to what plaintiff had said in his deposition, inquired \u201cWell, did he mention, for example, this matter about his brother saying that he hit his head on the hook?\u201d The defense attorney said, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated \u201cHe wasn\u2019t asked that question, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On behalf of plaintiff there was also objection to the characterization of Mrs. Gramer as a disinterested witness. The theory on-this was that Mrs. Gramer in some fashion was jointly responsible. Defense counsel stated \u201cJust because we only sued one \u2014 if we get a verdict against William Heron, he could very well turn around and sue her for contribution.\u201d Counsel for plaintiff insisted that the Court recharge the jury on both points above noted. The court did so, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cNow, there is another matter that counsel tell me about that I had no way of knowing, and apparently Mr. Heron\u2019s deposition was taken in part \u2014that is, the plaintiff\u2019s deposition\u2014 back in 1964, and counsel tell me it was not a full deposition and he did not testify in here to some of the things that he testified on the stand. But for what it is worth, his testimony on the subject was taken, at least in part, prior to the time that Mrs. Gramer testified, and she presumably had this testimony, which accords in part, apparently, with what he said here, before she testified in April, 1967. So you should take that into consideration. We don\u2019t know to what extent what he said in 1964 was or was not consistent with what he said here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201cNow, about the possible interest of the witnesses in the outcome of the litigation which I talked to you about. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel has asked me to tell you that it is possible that if the defendant was held responsible here, that he could sue his wife on the ground that she was also negligent and responsible, and, hence, would have to contribute to any verdict which you rendered in plaintiff\u2019s part, because she was there the night of the accident, and according to plaintiff\u2019s counsel, she might be found to have been negligent in failing to put on more lights, and so on, you see, as well as he. So you must take that possibility into consideration, depending on how you find the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u201cIt is true, two people can be negligent, and if the factfinder finds that both of their negligence was a substantial factor in causing the accident, then they both can be liable for an accident. It isn\u2019t true that only one person may be liable for an accident when the suit is based on negligence, as it is here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney objected to that part of the recharge which said \u201c * * * apparently Mr. Heron\u2019s deposition was taken in part \u2014 that is, the plaintiff\u2019s deposition \u2014 back in 1964, and counsel tell me it was not a full deposition and he did not testify in here (in the deposition) to some of the things that he testified on the stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Immediately after the above objection the Judge said to plaintiff\u2019s attorney \u201cYou conceded that the deposition didn\u2019t cover all his testimony as it was given here.\u201d The attorney said \u201cWell, certainly, because I asked him no questions.\u201d The Court said \u201cI am certainly not going to tell the jury something that is inaccurate, and not to have pointed out to them that the deposition did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>cover everything he said here, would have been inaccurate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">With the two charge items in full focus it is evident that the trial Judge did conscientiously instruct the jury that Mrs. Gramer prior to her own testimony had had the opportunity to read whatever plaintiff had stated in his discovery examination by the defense. The Court in addition told the jury that on the theory of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, if defendant was held responsible in that suit he could sue his wife for contribution. Because of that situation the Court said to the jury \u201cSo you must take that possibility into consideration, depending on how you find the facts.\u201d There is no trial objection to the recharge on this second item.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">From all of the above we question whether there was any error whatsoever by the Judge with respect to the two portions of the charge regarding which appellant complains. If any, it was de minimis. As Judge Biggs stated for this Court in Cromling v. Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie R. R. Co., 327 F.2d 142, 151-152 (1963), rehearing denied 1964:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atqm\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that the function of a trial judge in a federal court is much more than that of a mere arbitrator to rule upon objections and to instuct the jury. \u2018It is his function to conduct the trial in an orderly way with a view to eliciting the truth and to attaining justice between the parties.\u2019 Knapp v. Kinsey, 232 F.2d 458, 466 (6 Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 892, 77 S.Ct. 131, 1 L.Ed.2d 86 (1956). To this end it has been stated that \u2018[i]t is his duty to see that the issues are not obscured and that the testimony is not misunderstood.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">To the same effect Faudree v. Iron City Sand and Gravel Company, 315 F.2d 647, 651 (3 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">In the light of our decision on the charge questions, there is no need or excuse for passing upon the third point presented by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
