The district court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and appellant brought the case here. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">The evidence before the hearing examiner showed that appellant, who never earned more than $2020.50 in wages in any one year but who styles herself an \u201cexecutive secretary,\u201d was injured, when 45 years of age, in an automobile accident on August 4, 1962. She claimed that as a result she sustained a sprain and a whiplash injury of her neck. X-rays taken on August 10, 1962 disclosed no cervical fracture but revealed a degenerative condition of two of the lower cervical vertebral interspaces. An orthopedic surgeon who examined her 16 months later concluded that she did indeed have a history of a neck sprain which was superimposed on mild disc-space thinning and secondary arthritic lipping in the lower neck spine. In summary, the full medical evidence was conflicting as to the true extent and severity of appellant\u2019s neck impairment, but the undisputed objective evidence only disclosed that subsequent to the accident and prior to the hearing before the trial examiner appellant had received several diathermy treatments, had resorted to the use of neck traction while sleeping, and had occasionally worn a cervical collar.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">While this objective evidence of the treatments she had received would ordinarily suggest that appellant, at worst, would occasionally suffer moderate discomfort from her condition, appellant testified emphatically before the hearing examiner that her pain grew quite intense whenever she was required to remain in a stationary position or to bend her neck for any prolonged period of time. It is significant, nevertheless, that, despite her claims of limited neck movement, stiffness, and pain, the only restriction that any of the various physicians whom she had consulted had placed upon her activity was one by one physician that she should be careful not to lift objects weighing over 25 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">It is fundamental that in order to qualify under Sections 223 and 216 of the Social Security Act for disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>insurance benefits and for the establishment of a period of disability, an applicant must show that the claimed disabling condition is one which renders the applicant unable \u201cto engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416 (i) (1), 423(c) (2); and of course the applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion, Kerner v. Flemming, 283 F.2d 916, 920-921 (2 Cir. 1960). Also, upon review, a court\u2019s function is limited to that of determining whether the Secretary\u2019s findings as to the relevant facts are supported by substantial evidence, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Celebrezze v. Bolas, 316 F.2d 498 (8 Cir. 1963). In the present case the hearing examiner\u2019s conclusion, as paraphrased by the district court, was that the medical evidence reflected \u201can undramatically mild underlying pathology, wholly disproportionate to the massive disability claimant imposes upon it.\u201d It is no doubt true, as appellant contends, that this court has rejected the view that a claimant will be said to be so disabled as to qualify for disability benefits only if an \u201caverage man,\u201d suffering from the same objective medical symptoms as the claimant, would be disabled under the statute, for we have earlier indicated that the subjective element of pain is an important factor to be considered in determining disability, Ber v. Celebrezze, 332 F.2d 293, 298, 300 (2 Cir. 1964). However, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that in the present case appellant demonstrated a \u201cmedically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected * * * to be of long duration,\u201d we \u2022nevertheless believe that there was substantial evidence that appellant\u2019s assumed impairment had not produced \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity.\u201d Conceding, also, that appellant might not be able to return to her former employment as an \u201cexecutive secretary\u201d because such a job would require her to keep her neck in a fixed position for prolonged periods of time (e. g., while typing) and hence cause her to have periods of intense pain, there was ample evidence to support a conclusion that 'appellant could engage in other related forms of employment in which she would not be required to keep her neck in a fixed position. Therefore the present case is distinguishable from <em>Ber, </em>supra, in that here there is nothing like the showing of intense continuous arthritic pain that was testified to there. We note also that in <em>Ber, </em>we relied heavily upon the fact that there was nothing in the record in that case to indicate that claimant was qualified for any alternative employment to that of a sewing machine operator, whereas here the hearing examiner noted that appellant was qualified for many kinds of sedentary work and clerking jobs that do not require that one\u2019s head and neck remain in fixed positions for substantial periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
