The facts are stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">Plaintiff, a manufacturer and seller of a variety of small cakes and pies, employs 1,500 people. On December 1, 1952, plaintiff adopted and instituted for its full-time employees a noncontributory pension plan. This plan met the applicable requirements of Section 165(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended. In 1960 a trust was established to enable investment diversification of plaintiff\u2019s contributions to the pension fund. The pension plan and trust concededly met the applicable requirements of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The terms of the pension plan did not impose on plaintiff a legal or formal obligation to make contributions to the pension trust nor was plaintiff subject to collective bargaining agreements relating to the continuation of pension benefits. The terms of the plan gave plaintiff the right to discontinue it at any time. However, in that event plaintiff would not be entitled to recover any contributions previously made and all benefits would fully vest in the participating employees. The controversy at hand grows out of a contribution of property made by the plaintiff to the pension trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s executive offices and manufacturing facilities were housed in a building located on approximately 3 acres of land in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On December 1, 1960, plaintiff made a contribution of this property to the pension trust. On that date the property had a fair market value of $2,000,000- and plaintiff\u2019s basis for it was $1,022,-690.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-16\">In its income tax return for the taxable year ending December 31,1960, plaintiff, under the conditions set forth in Section 404, as amended,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was able to take a deduction from ordinary income with respect to the property contributed in the amount of $450,485. For its taxable year ending December 30, 1961, plaintiff\u2019s deduction attributable to the contribution made in 1960 was $616,485; for the taxable year ending December 29, 1962, its deduction was $627,485; and for the taxable year ending December 28, 1963, its deduction was $305,545. Due to the provisions of Section 404, it took plaintiff 4 years to deduct the full $2,-000,000 contribution. The propriety of these deductions is not an issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-19\">Upon audit of the plaintiff\u2019s 1960 return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiff realized a capital gain upon the transfer of the property to the pension trust, the gain to be measured by the difference between the fair market value of the property and the plaintiff\u2019s basis therein. Plaintiff paid the resulting deficiency and, its timely refund claim not having been acted upon by the Commissioner at the time this suit was filed, plaintiff brought suit in this court for the refund claimed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-20\">In A. P. Smith Manufacturing Co. v. United States, 364 F.2d 831, 176 Ct.Cl. 1074 (1966), cert. denied 385 U.S. 1003, 87 S.Ct. 705, 17 L.Ed.2d 542 (1967), the taxpayer-employer had created a pension trust for its employees. The pension trust was so qualified under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>the Internal Revenue Code as to permit the employer to deduct the amount of its contributions to the trust for income tax purposes. We held that when a contribution was made to the pension trust of a capital asset, the employer realized a capital gain measured by the difference between the fair market value of the property (the same valuation given it by the employer for deduction purposes) and the employer\u2019s basis for that property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accord, United States v. General Shoe Corp., 282 F.2d 9 (6th Cir. 1960), cert. denied 365 U.S. 843, 81 S.Ct. 801, 5 L.Ed.2d 808 (1961); see International Freighting Corp., Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 135 F.2d 310 (2d Cir. 1943). The underlying rationale would appear to be that though no money or other tangible property was received by the taxpayer-employer, the property contributed was additional compensation for the employees\u2019 past and present services, with the <em>quid pro quo </em>being those services, plus the expectation of continued services in the future. The value of those services has been held to be presumably equal to the fair market value of the property contributed. International Freighting Corp., Inc., supra, at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">The property contributed in the case at bar was not a capital asset (see Section 1221(2)). However, its inclusion under Section 1231(b) (1) would, in this case, result in its taxable disposition at a gain being a capital gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">The plaintiff argued that in contributing its operating premises to the pension trust it did not realize taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of that property exceeded plaintiff\u2019s tax basis therein. Plaintiff also argued it did not receive any money or other property in return for that contribution. At most, plaintiff argued, the only way open to the court to find plaintiff had an \u201camount realized\u201d (see Section 1001 (b) in the appendix) was to equate the term \u201cother property\u201d to the value of the plaintiff\u2019s mere entitlement to take a deduction for the contribution. Under this theory, the fair market value of the property received would be the tax saving resulting from the deduction of the contribution. At a 52% tax rate in the year of the contribution the tax saving to plaintiff would have been $1,-040,000. Therefore, argued plaintiff, its gain would only be $17,309.59 (tax saving minus basis) and not $977,309.59 as it would be under the decision in <em>A. P. Smith Manufacturing. </em>To these arguments the Government countered by asking us to follow our decision in A. <em>P. Smith Manufacturing. </em>The Government argued that the property received by the plaintiff was not the deduction for the contribution, but, instead, the value of the employee\u2019s services, that being measured by the fair market value of the property contributed. Also, that the tax deduction is merely a result of the contribution; it is merely the plaintiff\u2019s own reaffirmation of the value of the services and of the reasonableness of the contribution as a <em>quid pro quo. </em>In making its arguments, plaintiff felt forced to ask us to \u201cre-examine\u201d A. <em>P. Smith Manufacturing </em>and not to follow United States v. General Shoe Corp., relied on by us in <em>Smith. </em>We do not think the arguments made by plaintiff persuasive and we reaffirm our holding in A. <em>P. Smith Manufacturing, </em>for the reasons stated therein. Our reconsideration convinces us that the matter is so far settled by higher authority that we would not be free to overrule <em>Smith </em>even if persuaded \u2014as we are not persuaded \u2014 that its reasoning is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">In United States v. Davis, 370 U.S. 65, 82 S.Ct. 1190, 8 L.Ed.2d 335 (1962), the Supreme Court held, reversing this court, that a husband realized a capital gain on the excess of market value over basis, of stock he transferred to his wife in fulfillment of a voluntary property settlement and separation agreement. It held that for purposes of measuring the gain, the rights surrendered by the wife, inchoate and unmarketable as they were, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>must be presumed to equal the stock in value. It cited, at p. 72, 82 S.Ct., at p. 1194, our holding in Philadelphia Park Amusement Co. v. United States, 126 F.Supp. 184, 189, 130 Ct.Cl. 166, 172 (1954), that the values \u201cof the two properties exchanged in an arms-length transaction are either equal in fact, or are presumed to be equal\u201d. And it cited as in accord, <em>General Shoe Corp., </em>supra, and <em>International Freighting Corp., Inc., </em>supra. <em>General Shoe </em>involved contributions to a pension trust like the one at bar, and <em>International Freighting Corp., Inc. </em>involved bonuses given directly to employees, consisting of stock in a related corporation. It is clear, therefore, that the technique of presuming an intangible and unappraisable contribution as an equal exchange for property transferred is to be applied to a variety of situations broad enough at least to include a taxpayer who desires the separation of a wife, and one who wishes the continued adhesion of an employee. Judge Frank reasoned in International Freighting Corp., Inc., 135 F.2d at p. 313, that the bonuses would have been invalid if they had exceeded the worth of the employee\u2019s services. That is applicable in the business situation such as we have here, if we add: \u201cservices past and future.\u201d In <em>International Freighting </em>the bonuses influenced future behavior only as a morale factor, but any pension plan gives an employee a pecuniary incentive to remain with the employer until retirement. The citation of these cases with approval in <em>Davis </em>would seem to establish the doctrine too firmly to be tampered with by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Some additional arguments made by the plaintiff require further discussion. It has cited to us Rev.Rul. 55-410, 1955-1 C.B. 297. In that ruling the Internal Revenue Service recognized that the mere fact that a taxpayer obtains a deduction in the amount of the fair market value of property contributed by it to a charitable organization in satisfaction of a pledge, does not subject the taxpayer to taxation on the excess of that fair market value over the taxpayer\u2019s basis for that property. From this the plaintiff argued \u201c[I]t is difficult to fashion an acceptable rationale for a difference in treatment between the charitable contribution and the contribution here merely because the parties in this situation are operating in the commercial field.\u201d The distinction to be drawn is not a difficult one. The cited ruling deals with a gift; the plaintiff\u2019s contribution was not a gift. See also United States v. Davis, supra, footnote 6 at 370 U.S. p. 69, 82 S.Ct. 1190. In the cited ruling the Internal Revenue Service said: \u201cIt would be inconsistent to treat such payment or transfer as a \u2018contribution or gift\u2019 and at the same time as a satisfaction of a debt with the tax consequences which would ordinarily follow from the use of appreciated property * * * to pay a debt.\u201d There is no inconsistency where the contribution is not a gift but is made for business, not eleemosynary, reasons. The charitable donor does not expect an economic <em>quid pro quo, </em>or at least is presumed not to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Thus we hold plaintiff recognized a capital gain upon its contribution of property to the pension trust, that gain being measured by the difference between the fair market value of that property and plaintiff\u2019s tax basis therein. Plaintiff argued it was entitled to the benefits of the installment sales provision (Section 453) of the Code in reporting that gain. It urged also that the amount received in each year was only the amount of its deduction in that year. These contentions suffer from the same defect as plaintiff\u2019s \u201camount realized\u201d argument. The amount of the deduction is not the measure of the amount received. As the <em>Davis </em>case, supra, makes clear, the <em>quid pro quo </em>in the exchange is not the deduction but the anticipated better behavior of the employees covered by the pension plan. Thus it makes no discoverable difference whether the deduction for the contribution to the trust is taken over one year, or several, or never taken at all. There was obviously no deduction in <em>Da/vis. </em>The gain here at issue was realized in 1960, the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>of the transfer, and not at any other time. Accordingly, the installment sales provision is not available to the plaintiff because it realized all of its gain in the year the contribution was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">In accordance with the foregoing, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted and the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied. The petition is dismissed except as to the claim for an allowance for depreciation. The case will be remanded under Rule 47(c) for a determination of the amount of refund due the taxpayer in accordance with the decision herein and the parties\u2019 stipulation regarding the additional depreciation deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954:</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">(26 U.S.C.
