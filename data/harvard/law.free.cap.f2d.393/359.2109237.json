We think appellants have no right to intervene as creditors opposing the petition in bankruptcy. See In re Carden, 118 F.2d 677, 679 (2d Cir.), cert. denied McClave &amp; Co. v. Carden, 314 U.S. 647, 62 S.Ct. 91, 86 L.Ed. 519 (1941). They might have a right to intervene as stockholders if there were substantial grounds .to believe that the J &amp; P Corporation would not adequately contest the bankrupcty proceedings. See Klein v. Nu-Way Shoe Co., 136 F.2d 986, 989 (2d Cir. 1943). But since appellants\u2019 motion to intervene made no such allegation against the corporation, we do not face that issue. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
