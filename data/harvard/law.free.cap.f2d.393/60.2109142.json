On November 26, 1962, it had transferred to Gibraltar Factors Corp. a term insurance policy in the face amount of $100,000 on the life of its vice president and general manager, Jack Wohl.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A referee in bankruptcy and the district court initially rejected a counterclaim by the trustee under \u00a7 60b to recover as a preference the proceeds of the policy, $101,000, collected by Gibraltar as a result of Wohl\u2019s sudden death on December 5, 1962, on the ground that Gibraltar did not have \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d Hygrade was insolvent on November 26. On a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>vious appeal we disagreed and remanded the cause \u201cso that the referee may make further findings and conclusions on the issues, reserved by him, whether the transfer was for or on account of an antecedent debt, \u00a7 60a (1), and whether, if the transfer was preferential, Gibraltar is entitled to a set off under \u00a7 60c,\u201d as well as the claim, first advanced on Gibraltar\u2019s petition for rehearing in this court, \u201cthat the trustee is not entitled to recover because the insurance policy was exempt property under New York Insurance Law \u00a7 166(1) * * 366 F.2d 584, 589-590 (2 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The case returns to us with reaffirmance of the dismissal of the trustee\u2019s counterclaim by the same referee and a different district judge but with sharp disagreement between them as to the reason. The referee sustained the argument that the proceeds of the policy were within the exemption conferred by \u00a7 6 of the Bankruptcy Act; he thought, however, that apart from this \u201cthe trustee has proved all of the elements required for a preference to be voided under the provision of Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act and that consequently the trustee would be entitled to judgment on his counterclaim,\u201d free of any set-off by Gibraltar for advances subsequent to November 26, 1962. The district judge concluded that the policy was not exempt but held that the transfer was not \u201cfor or on account of an antecedent debt,\u201d and that in any event the transfer was only in the amount of $393, the sum Hygrade would have realized on surrender of the policy, or at most $1000, the cost of a new one-year policy, and should be disregarded as <em>de minimis. </em>We hold the trustee is entitled to recover on his counterclaim reduced, however, by certain amounts as explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">Gibraltar\u2019s contention with respect to exemption rests on the third sentence of \u00a7 166, subd. 1 of the New York Insurance Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 28, which we quote in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Weinstein ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the phrase \u201ceffected by any person\u201d applies only to natural persons despite \u00a7 37 of New York\u2019s General Construction Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 22, defining \u201cperson\u201d to include a corporation, and that in any event Gibraltar could not take advantage of \u201cthe allowances to bankrupts of the exemptions which are prescribed by the laws of the United States or by the State laws in force at the time of the filing of the petition in the State wherein they have had their domicile * * authorized by \u00a7 6 of the Bankruptcy Act. Agreeing with the latter ruling we have no occasion to pass upon the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">If Hygrade had not assigned the policy, no exemption could have been asserted since the second sentence of \u00a7 166, subd. 1, which would then have been the only basis for one, exempts the policy from the claims of the creditors and personal representatives of the person insured (here Wohl) rather than of creditors of its owner. Gibraltar thus cannot take advantage of the principle that an assignee of exempt property may have the benefit of the exemption accorded by \u00a7 6 since the estate otherwise available to creditors will not be diminished by the assignment. See Rutledge v. Johansen, 270 F.2d 881, 883 (10 Cir. 1959); 1 Collier, Bankruptcy if 6 11 (1967). On the face of things, it would seem incongruous that a policy not exempt in the bankrupt\u2019s hands should become so when preferentially assigned to a creditor, as would be rather apparent if the policy here had possessed a substantial cash surrender value. If New York intended to accomplish any such result, as a literal reading of the third sentence of \u00a7 166, subd. 1 might suggest, it meant to do something Congress did not allow. Section 6 of the Bankruptcy Act is limited to allowances \u201cto bankrupts\u201d and while we have expanded this to include members of the bankrupt\u2019s immediate family who have been named as beneficiaries, see In re Messinger, 29 F.2d 158, 68 A.L.R. 1205 (2 Cir. 1928), cert. denied, Reilly v. Messinger, 279 U.S. 855, 49 S.Ct. 351, 73 L.Ed. 996 (1929); Schwartz v. Holzman, 69 F.2d 814 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 293 U.S. 565, 55 S.Ct. 76, 79 L.Ed. 655 (1934); In re Keil, 88 F.2d 7 (2 Cir. 1937); Schwartz v. Seldon, 153 F.2d 334, 169 A.L.R. 1375 (2 Cir. 1945), we know of no principle and have not been informed cf any precedent that would justify expanding the exemption Congress allowed \u201cto bankrupts\u201d so as to include a policy of life insurance, not exempted by state law for the bankrupt, when this is in the hands of an unrelated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The referee thought that because of the new security taken by Gibraltar for advances made to Hygrade after November 26, 1962, the assignment of the insurance policy was solely \u201cfor or on account of\u201d the then existing indebtedness of between $300,000 and $400,000 which was only partially secured. The district judge reached an opposite conclusion, \u201cthat the assignment of the policy was taken as consideration for future financing of a business all hoped would be saved.\u201d If the understanding was in fact that the policy should constitute security only for new advances, we fail to perceive how Gibraltar could be allowed to use the proceeds to secure old ones. What seems entirely plain is that the parties made no such sharp distinctions as have now been attributed to them; the insurance policy was meant to secure advances both old and new according as need might arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">While application of the proceeds of the policy to repayment of fresh advances made in reliance thereon would not constitute a voidable preference, their application to the payment of antecedent debts would, see 3 Collier, Bankruptcy j[ 60.19 at 855 (1967), subject only to the point concerning the amount of the transfer we will next consider. Save for that, the case is indistinguishable from the many holdings that where the fair value of security given by the debtor exceeds the new loan, there is a voidable preference \u2014 assuming the other elements exist \u2014 insofar as the security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>is applied in satisfaction of an antecedent debt. See, e. g., Aulick v. Largent, 295 F.2d 41, 45 (4 Cir. 1961); United Pacific Insurance Co. v. United States, 358 F.2d 966, 175 Ct.Cl. 118 (1966); In re Schindler, 223 F.Supp. 512 (E.D.Mo.1963); MacLachlan, Bankruptcy, 292-93 (1956); 4 Remington, Bankruptcy \u00a7 1661.3 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Gibraltar\u2019s next line of defense, sustained by the district judge, is that any transfer to it was so minuscule in amount as not to constitute a preference. It argues that there would have been no preference if it had bought the policy for $393, which indeed it could have included as a financing charge so that no money would have had to pass, and that the depletion effected by the assignment cannot have been greater than this or, at most, the $1000 required to buy a replacement policy. This concentration on the situation as of November 26 gives insufficient weight to the final portion of the definition of a preferential transfer in \u00a7 60a (1), to wit, \u201cthe effect of which transfer will be to enable such creditor to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than some other creditor of the same class.\u201d Palmer Clay Products Co. v. Brown, 297 U.S. 227, 229, 56 S.Ct. 450, 451, 80 L.Ed. 655 (1936), teaches that under this language \u201cWhether a creditor has received a preference is to be determined, not by what the situation would have been if the debtor\u2019s assets had been liquidated and distributed among his creditors at the time the alleged preferential payment was made, but by the actual effect of the payment as determined when bankruptcy results.\u201d See 3 Collier, Bankruptcy If 60.35 and If 60.36. Continental &amp; Commercial Trust &amp; Sav. Bank v. Chicago T. &amp; Savings Co., 229 U.S. 435, 33 S.Ct. 829, 57 L.Ed. 1268 (1913), relied upon by Gibraltar, stands only for the undoubted proposition that the challenged transfer must deplete the estate to be preferential; it nowhere indicates that depletion should be measured at the time of the transfer. Virginia National Bank v. Woodson, 329 F.2d 836 (4 Cir. 1964), also cited by Gibraltar, may be similarly distinguished.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the trustee\u2019s position accords with the equities as we view them. On November 26, 1962, Gibraltar knew the continuance of Hy-grade\u2019s business to be parlous at best. It knew also that everything depended on Wohl; according to Gibraltar\u2019s vice president, when Wohl sought continued advances, \"we told him we would want additional insurance on his life because he was the key man in the business and without him we felt the business would not continue,\u201d as proved all too true. Gibraltar must have realized that Wohl\u2019s life was equally important to other creditors, who would have shared in the proceeds of the $100,000 policy as matters stood. Yet Gibraltar took this valuable asset for itself, knowing that no replacement would be provided. Under such circumstances it cannot be heard in equity to say it was preferred only to the extent of $393 or $1000, representing actuarial averages, when the very event it feared and to protect against which it took an assignment of the policy, to the detriment of other creditors, occurred nine days later. The case is the unusual one where \u201cmarket value\u201d affords no real indication of an asset\u2019s worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">There is even less merit in Gibraltar\u2019s further argument that \u00a7 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>(b) limits the trustee\u2019s recovery to the policy\u2019s cash surrender value. The statute grants the trustee the right to recover \u201cthe property\u201d transferred preferentially, or, if it has been \u201cconverted,\u201d its value. A policy is not \u201cconverted\u201d within the meaning of the statute by the mere fact that it matures. See 3 Collier, Bankruptcy f\u00ed 60.59. The trustee emphasizes that if Wohl had died a bit later or the adjudication had occurred a bit earlier, he could have recovered the policy itself (\u201cthe property\u201d) prior to Gibraltar\u2019s collection of it. We do not understand why Wohl\u2019s early death and collection of the proceeds by the preferred creditor should bring about a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Gibraltar\u2019s claim that it is entitled under \u00a7 60c to set off against the trustee\u2019s counterclaim advances between November 26, 1962 and January 23, 1963, in the sum of $60,917, requires little discussion. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\u201cIf a creditor has been preferred, and afterwards in good faith gives the debtor further credit without security of any kind for property which becomes a part of the debtor\u2019s estate, the amount of such new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy may be set off against the amount which would otherwise be recoverable from him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">We see no reason to doubt that Gibraltar\u2019s actions, designed to keep Hygrade afloat, were \u201cin good faith,\u201d Kaufman v. Tredway, 195 U.S. 271, 25 S.Ct. 33, 49 L.Ed. 190 (1904); Grandison v. Nat. Bank of Commerce, 231 F. 800 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 242 U.S. 644, 37 S.Ct. 213, 61 L.Ed. 542 (1916); 2 Collier, Bankruptcy |[ 60.67 at 1138. But the advances were not made \u201cwithout security of any kind\u201d; to the contrary, the district judge\u2019s opinion lists security of $64,259.66 exclusive of the life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">However, there is mor.e to Gibraltar\u2019s argument than this. The assignment of the insurance policy was not a voidable preference insofar as Gibraltar made advances after November 26 in reliance thereon and needed to resort to the proceeds of the policy for their payment. We have already indicated that the policy was assigned to secure advances both old and new, and the record is clear that in making future advances, particularly after Wohl\u2019s death on December 5, Gibraltar relied on everything that it had. Hence, if for example the \u201cnew\u201d security taken for the $60,917 of new advances was worth only $30,000, there could be no question under the circumstances of Gibraltar\u2019s right to use $30,917 of the insurance proceeds to satisfy its post-November 26 claims. See \u00a7 60(a) (8). The results should be the same insofar as preexisting arrangements permitted security avowedly given for post-November 26 advances to be applied to antecedent debts without constituting a voidable preference despite Gibraltar\u2019s reasonable cause to believe in Hygrade\u2019s insolvency. There is reason to think some of the \u201cnew\u201d security fits that description.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">We start with the easiest case: Included in the list of new security furnished by Hygrade are two chattel mortgages executed on November 26 and 27 in the face amount of $23,500. Examination of the schedules attached to the mortgage of November 26 indicates that in fact almost all the chattels listed had been mortgaged to Gibraltar on December 18, 1960. To that extent Gibraltar is entitled to have the value of the mortgaged chattels applied to antecedent debts and look to the insurance proceeds, if need be, for payment of later advances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">The other \u201cnew\u201d security stated to have been obtained by Gibraltar consisted of $41,759.66 in accounts receivable. The factoring agreement of February 8, 1960, which was duly filed, gave Gibraltar a lien both upon existing and future in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ventory and upon \u201call the accounts receivable and other proceeds resulting from the sale or other disposition of such merchandise.\u201d So far as the accounts receivable are concerned, this agreement gave Gibraltar no more than an equitable lien upon the future accounts as they arose, which would have been inferior to the lien of an attaching judgment creditor. See Okin v. Isaac Goldman Co., 79 F.2d 317 (2 Cir. 1935); Rockmore v. Lehman, 128 F.2d 564 (2 Cir. 1942), rev\u2019d on rehearing, 129 F.2d 892, cert. denied 317 U.S. 700, 63 S.Ct. 525, 87 L.Ed. 559 (1943); Matter of City of New York v. Bedford Bar &amp; Grill, 2 N.Y.2d 429, 161 N.Y.S.2d 67, 141 N.E.2d 575 (1957). It was only when the factor satisfied the further requirement imposed by \u00a7 45 of the New York Personal Property Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 41, then in effect, and either notified the account debtor \u201cthat the account is payable to the lienor,\u201d or secured an additional assignment, that the lien became \u201cso far perfected that no subsequent lien upon such property obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee * * see \u00a7 60(a) (2). Since the transfer of the $41,759.66 in accounts was \u201cperfected\u201d within the four months period and after Gibraltar had reasonable cause to believe Hygrade was insolvent, it is preferential if applied to antecedent debts. To allow the factor\u2019s lien to attach to inventory coming into Hygrade\u2019s possession after November 26 as security for such debts would be similarly preferential. Zartman v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, 189 N.Y. 267, 82 N.E. 127, 12 L.R.A.,N.S., 1083 (1907); Irving Trust Co. v. Commercial Factors Corp., 68 F.2d 864, 868-869 (2 Cir. 1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The factor\u2019s lien would therefore assist Gibraltar only so far as a substitution of collateral theory might apply, see 3 Collier, Bankruptcy jf 60.21 and cases cited. If, for example, $10,000 in pre-November 26 inventory were sold on December 10, Gibraltar clearly would have right to substitute as security for an antecedent debt new accounts receivable or inventory to which its lien attached between November 26 and December 10. In re Pusey, Maynes, Breish Co., 122 F.2d 606, 608 (3 Cir. 1941) (Goodrich, J.). There would be more of a problem if Gibraltar should seek to \u201csubstitute\u201d for inventory that was thus sold the account receivable resulting from its sale. The problem would be that, on our reading of \u00a7 45, Gibraltar\u2019s lien on this account would be perfected only when it secured an additional assignment or notified the account debtor \u2014 and this could occur only after December 10. Under old cases the new security could not be properly \u201csubstituted\u201d for the old on the ground that replacement was not \u201ccontemporaneous.\u201d In re Lambert &amp; Braceland Co., 29 F.2d 758 (E.D.Pa.1928); In re Baumgartner, 55 F.2d 1041, (7 Cir. 1931). However, it has been persuasively argued by commentators on the \u201cfloating lien\u201d provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, Note, After Acquired Property Security Interests in Bankruptcy: A Substitution of Collateral Defense of the U.C.C., 77 Yale L.J. 139, 151-58 (1967); 1 Coogan, Hogan &amp; Vagts, Secured Transactions Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 1084-85 (1966); 2 Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property 1315-16 (1965), that this requirement was based upon the principle of Benedict v. Ratner, 268 U.S. 353, 45 S.Ct. 566, 69 L.Ed. 991 (1925), which, as the author of that opinion recognized, does not apply to liens authorized by New York\u2019s Factor\u2019s Act. Id. at 361 n. 11; In re Cut Rate Furniture Co., 163 F.Supp. 360 (N.D.N.Y.1958); Colbath v. Mechanics National Bank, 96 N.H. 110, 70 A.2d 608 (1950) (construing New Hampshire\u2019s Factor\u2019s Act derived from the New York statute) ; 1 Gilmore, supra, \u00a7 8.8 (1965); but see Zinman, Dominion and the Factor\u2019s Lien, 30 Ford.L.Rev. 50 (1961). Since Gibraltar, by policing its collateral strictly, could have perfected its lien on the accounts receivable as soon as the merchandise had been sold, it may substitute post-November 26 accounts receivable as security for antecedent debts to the extent that its inventory lien had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>been depleted by subsequent sales. The record, however, does not permit us to determine whether pre-November 26 inventory was in fact sold, and, if so, in what amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We hold that Gibraltar may retain so much, if any, of the proceeds of the policy on Wohl\u2019s life as is required to pay its post-November 26 loans to Hygrade after applying to them all post-November 26 security except (1) the value of property covered by the chattel mortgages of November 26 and 27 which in fact was already validly mortgaged to \u2022 it, and (2) post-November 26 accounts receivable and inventory, if any, which merely replaced similar security held on that date. The balance of the proceeds is payable to the trustee. The judgment disallowing the trustee\u2019s counterclaim is therefore reversed and the cause remanded to the district court with instructions to remand to the referee for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party shall pay its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-21\">.
