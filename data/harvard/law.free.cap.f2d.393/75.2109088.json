On trial, the district court found that defendant-appellee, the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders\u2019 and Exhibitors\u2019 Association of America, a corporation, had violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2), and had injured plaintiff-appellant, Courtesy Chevrolet, Inc., a corporation, in the sum of $3,400, trebled to $10,200. The trial court awarded $5,000 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs taxed at $4,603.92. Somewhat extensive injunctive relief was also ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">The corporate plaintiff-appellant entered into the business of breeding, raising and training Tennessee Walking Horses in 1962, investing some $711,-218.70 in facilities for such an operation prior to July 13,1963. The district court found that on that date the defendant Association arbitrarily and unreasonably suspended plaintiff\u2019s membership in the Association and published notice of this action in the defendant\u2019s Bulletin. The registration of horses, the transfer thereof, and the showing of plaintiff\u2019s horses before judges of the Association, all were denied plaintiff; and colts sired by one or more of plaintiff\u2019s stallions were denied registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">In the first year of plaintiff\u2019s operations, 1962, plaintiff lost some $10,000. In the second year of operations, the loss was $13,199 in the first six months, and in the last six months (after the suspension of membership) plaintiff\u2019s losses amounted to $9,406 (Ex. B). When applications for registration were made by plaintiff for three foals after July 13, 1963, they were denied, as were certain applications for registration forwarded by persons not associated from plaintiff but owning mares with colts sired by a stallion owned by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">Finding 41 was that plaintiff lost, by reason of defendant\u2019s suspension and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>fusal to register, seventeen stud fees for the year 1964, at $200 each. This was the basis of plaintiff\u2019s damages for 1964 of $3,400. The trial court then found (Finding 42), \u201cThe evidence of other damage to plaintiff is too indefinite and speculative to permit the court with any degree of certainty to estimate the amount thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">This last finding of fact is assigned as error; the award of damages is claimed to be inadequate and contrary to the evidence; and the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded are claimed to be inadequate as a matter of law, contrary to the evidence, and based on an incorrect theory of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">After careful review of the record in the case and due consideration of the briefs and oral arguments of the attorneys, we are unable to say that the findings of fact of the district court and its conclusions of law thereon are clearly erroneous in respect to the award of $10,-200, although the compensation allowed seems quite low in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> But we are of the opinion and so hold that, where the statute requires allowance of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee,\u201d the trial court abused its appropriate discretion in allowing the attorneys for the plaintiff-appellant an inadequate award of but $5,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees for their excellent professional services. The successful prosecution of plaintiff\u2019s suit required learning, skill and experience in the specialized field of litigation involved (Finding 46), and the expending of a tremendous amount of time and labor by the attorneys. At the hearing held upon the issue of appropriate attorneys\u2019 fees it was proved by uncontroverted testimony that plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, subsequent to the last appeal, had devoted a total of 2,289 hours exclusively to this litigation (Finding 45). Both plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s counsel were found to have outstanding reputations at the bar (Finding 44).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Findings 49 and 50 read: \u201cIt is obvious that counsel has done a prodigious amount of work in presenting this case,\u201d and \u201cPlaintiff has expended $78,496.40 in attorneys\u2019 fees, travel expense and other out of pocket expenses.\u201d A highly respected and competent member of the Los Angeles Bar estimated reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for plaintiff in this case at $140,000 to $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">It is true that the court considered, and properly considered, that a large portion of the relief granted was of an in-junctive nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">While the allowance of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees is always a matter of delicacy- \u2014 either when billed by the attorneys themselves or when fixed by the courts \u2014 the object always, of course, is to allow fair and just compensation for the services rendered, considering the time and skill employed, the experience brought to bear, and the results achieved. In the light of these considerations, we think a minimum fee, to the attorneys for the appellants in this case, should have been $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed in this aspect alone; and in all other aspects is affirmed. The cause is remanded with directions that the district court enter judgment in favor of appellant for attorneys\u2019 fees, and against defendant, in the sum of $10,000.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
