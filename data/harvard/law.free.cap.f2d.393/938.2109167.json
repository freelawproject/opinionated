State of North Carolina, 384 U.S. 737, 86 S.Ct. 1761; Fikes v. State of Alabama, 352 U.S. 191, 77 S.Ct. 281, 1 L.Ed.2d 246, 16 L.Ed.2d 895; and Clewis v. State of Texas, 386 U.S. 707, 87 S.Ct. 1338, 18 L.Ed.2d 423, in determining the voluntariness of the confessions here in question. We agree with, and approve of, the opinion and judgment of the trial court as published at 271 F.Supp. (W.D.La.) 176, sub. nom. Progue v. Middlebrook, and we affirm the judgment based on that opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
