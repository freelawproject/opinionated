The trouble is that on his own statement there was nothing material to the event that was actually the crime which the witnesses could have proved. There is no suggestion they were present at the pertinent time. They might have shown some prior noncriminal business negotiations between themselves and Bush which would be immaterial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
