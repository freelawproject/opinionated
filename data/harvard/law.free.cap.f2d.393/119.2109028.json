On October 9, 1964, Mrs. Patricia Smith Wood employed Mrs. Tilley to be a baby-sitter for her two and one-half year old daughter, Marcella Smith. Mrs. Wood left her child at the Tilley residence about 8:00 a. m. Two hours later, Mrs. Tilley decided to prepare breakfast for herself and a guest. Mrs. Tilley plugged an electric percolator into a wall outlet and placed it on a 4-foot high counter between the eating area and the kitchen of her home. Marcella Smith was sitting at a child\u2019s table on the kitchen side of the counter and, while Mrs. Tilley was making pancakes, pulled the percolator cord, causing the hot coffee to spill and burn the child severely. Subsequently Marcella Smith filed a $71,900 damage suit against Mr. and Mrs. Tilley in the Circuit Court of Grant County, Indiana, where it is apparently still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">The insurance policy excluded coverage for any business pursuits of the insured \u201cexcept * * * activities * * * which are ordinarily incident to non-business pursuits * * In a well-reasoned opinion, the District Court assumed that Mrs. Tilley\u2019s baby-sitting for compensation was a business pursuit within the policy exclusion. However, the Court held that the preparation of hot coffee was \u201cincident to non-business pursuits\u201d within the exception to the exclusion, observing that otherwise the excepting clause would be meaningless. On the basis of the District Court\u2019s opinion (280 F.Supp. 60), we agree that there was no exclusion from coverage under this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b168-16\">SCHNACKENBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">In the last full paragraph of the above opinion, it seems to me that the district court\u2019s reasoning would be more clearly set forth by noting that that court held that, giving meaning both to the exclusion and the exception, the preparation of hot coffee was incident to non-business pursuits and thus within the exception, viz., \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d, excluded by the policy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
