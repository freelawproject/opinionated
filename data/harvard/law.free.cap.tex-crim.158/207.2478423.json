Arts. 52-1 and 52-8, C.C.P., as amended, Acts 1951, 52nd Leg., p. 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Consequently, there was a variance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof. The variance between the alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>gations as to the district court in which the appellant was previously convicted and the proof is fatal to a conviction. See Morman v. State, 127 Tex. Cr. R. 264, 75 S.W. 2d 886; Childress v. State, 131 Tex. Cr. R. 487, 100 S.W. 2d 102; Childress v. State, 134 Tex. Cr. R. 504, 116 S.W. 2d 396; Goodale v. State, 146 Tex. Cr. R. 568, 177 S.W. 2d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">It follows that the allegation as to a conviction in the criminal district court of Dallas County is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is granted, the original opinion is withdrawn, the order of affirmance is set aside, and the judgment is now reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
