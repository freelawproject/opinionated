It appears by certificate of the county clerk that notice of request for the preparation of a transcript was filed on January 16, 1933; that no transcript has been filed pursuant to section 953a of the Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise; that any proceedings in the trial court for the preparation of a transcript were terminated by order of court on September 1, 1933; that no additional time within which to prepare or serve a draft of a bill of exceptions has been allowed by the superior court or any judge thereof; that no proceedings for the preparation of a bill of exceptions or a transcript are pending in the trial court; and that the time within which to institute any such proceedings has expired. The motion should therefore be granted <em>(Steffey </em>v. <em>Standard Stations, Inc., </em>131 Cal. App. 202 [20 Pac. (2d) 971]).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">Marks, J., and Jennings, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
