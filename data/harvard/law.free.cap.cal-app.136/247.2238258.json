It is evident from this statement that nothing is involved except abstract questions; that no order can be made either affirming or reversing the judgment of the trial court or the mandate issued in pursuance thereof that could in anywise affect the action of the parties to this proceeding relative to the nominating petitions,' and the sufficiency thereof determined by the trial court. Where abstract questions only are involved and the issues have become moot as to the acts commanded to be performed, an appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>will not retain jurisdiction. <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Cal. 611 [47 Pac. 591]; see, also, cases cited in vol. 2, McKinney\u2019s New Digest, under the title of \u201cAppeal and Error\u201d, sec. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">It does not appear in this case that any liability for costs is involved; that if such liability did exist, the court will not entertain an appeal which would become moot. <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>156 Cal. 68 [103 Pac. 319].)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The appeal in this cause is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
