There was no showing that the apparatus was constructed or intended for such use, nor that the same was in any way defective after. the repairs were made thereto. Upon this state of the case there could be nothing, more than conjecture that negligence of the defendant contributed to the injury for which damages were prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">We find no evidence in the record upon which a judgment for the plaintiff could have been founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">Stephens, P. J., and Archbald, J., <em>pro tem., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
