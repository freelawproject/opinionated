A Lowndes County grand jury indicted Shamor Billups for Count I, felony shoplifting, and Count II, unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-23-93\">\n    Miss.

Code Ann. \u00a7 97-37-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2014). A jury acquitted Billups of Count I but convicted him of Count II. On August 22, 2016, the Lowndes County Circuit Court sentenced Billups as a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-19-81 (Rev. 2014) to ten years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC). On August 29, 2016, Billups's attorney filed an unsuccessful motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On appeal, Billups's initial brief focused on the sufficiency and weight of the evidence, and the actual or constructive element of his crime-possession of a firearm by a felon. A supplemental pro se brief includes a list of other unsupported claims or procedurally barred claims. Finding no error, we affirm Billups's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On March 13, 2015, two men approached the gun counter of K and S Outdoors (K &amp; S) in Columbus, Mississippi. One asked to look at a pistol, and the other asked to look at a long gun. The K &amp; S clerk, Chad Fortner, handed one of the men a pistol and the other a Ruger-SR-762 rifle. Both men then attempted to run from the store with the firearms. The man with the rifle successfully fled. Fortner tackled and secured the other man before the man could exit K &amp; S. The stolen rifle was a .308 caliber Ruger-SR-762 rifle with a collapsible stock and a twenty-round magazine that retailed for $1,699. K &amp; S identified the gun by its serial number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. A video of the March 13, 2015 incident at K &amp; S shows a man wearing a maroon Mississippi State hoodie, camouflage pants, and a toboggan at the K &amp; S gun counter holding a rifle. The video shows that same man, in the same clothes, running out of K &amp; S with a rifle. Chris Berry, a K &amp; S customer, and its manager, Carey Chaffin, also witnessed the man run out the door of K &amp; S carrying a rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Shortly after the events at K &amp; S, Investigator Timothy Jenkins with the Columbus Police Department recovered a maroon Mississippi State hoodie, camouflage pants, and a blue toboggan about a block and a half east of K &amp; S. Investigator Jenkins also interviewed the man who was earlier restrained while attempting to flee K &amp; S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The investigation led the Columbus police to 20th Street North. Approximately an hour and a half to two hours after the shoplifting incident at K &amp; S, as Columbus police approached 1215 20th Street North, Billups came out of a shed at that address. Columbus police ordered Billups to the ground, and he complied. Investigator Jenkins learned the 1215 20th Street North property was owned by Billups's aunt, Connie Billups. Connie gave Jenkins consent to search her outbuildings. Officer Christopher Benton wore a body camera and participated in Investigator Jenkins's search of the shed Billups was seen leaving. A rifle was found upright in the front\n   corner of the shed covered in a shirt. The shed was otherwise empty except for a bicycle and the stolen rifle. Police later identified the rifle by its serial number as the Ruger-SR-762 rifle taken earlier from K &amp; S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6.

For a person to be convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, the State must prove: (1) the defendant was in possession of a firearm; and (2) the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony crime.\n   <em>\n    Gunn v.

Ct. App. 2014). Because Billups's attorney stipulated to Billups's status as a felon, we necessarily focus our review on the element of possession. The State must prove the defendant actually or constructively possessed a weapon.\n   <em>\n    Short v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420639\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/420/#p427\">\n    929 So.2d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427 (\u00b6 21) (Miss. Ct. App. 2006). Constructive possession allows the State to establish possession when evidence of actual possession is absent.\n   <em>\n    Christian v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12202911\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/1207/#p1218\">\n    207 So.3d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1218 (\u00b6 54) (Miss. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. Without evidence of actual or exclusive possession by Billups, and without evidence that Billups is the owner of the premises, the \"State must prove some competent evidence connecting [Billups] with the [firearm].\"\n   <em>\n    Gavin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11110344\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/785/1088/#p1093\">\n    785 So.2d 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1093 (\u00b6 17) (Miss. Ct. App. 2001) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Powell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9763795\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/355/1378/#p1379\">\n    355 So.2d 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1379 (Miss. 1978) ). Here, the State provided that competent evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. At trial, Investigator Jenkins testified that, based on his investigation, the police went to 20th Street North, which was thought to be the possible location of the man who stole the rifle from K &amp; S. As police approached, and within less than two hours from the time of the shoplifting, Billups exited the shed on the property at 1215 20th Street North. Investigator Jenkins testified that he and Officer Benton handcuffed Billups, and thereafter they found the K &amp; S rifle inside the shed Billups exited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. Thus, record evidence provided by Investigator Jenkins connects Billups to the firearm. Police saw Billups exit the shed in which, moments later, they found the K &amp; S rifle. Further confirmation of this evidence comes from a police video of the interior of the shed. Police found the rifle propped up in the front corner of the nearly empty shed and only steps from the front door. After deliberation, the jury acquitted Billups of the shoplifting charge\n   but found him guilty of the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. What constitutes a \"sufficient external relationship between [Billups] and the [rifle] to complete the concept of [constructive] possession is a question which is not susceptible of a specific rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Curry v.

Ct. App. 2014). In\n   <em>\n    Peden\n   </em>\n   , this Court found sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of constructive possession because, while he was found in a motel room rented by another, Peden was within arm's reach of a bag of crack cocaine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7328830\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/132/631/#p634\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further support is found in\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7015953\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/112/1092/#p1096\">\n    112 So.3d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1096 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013). Lewis was found to have constructive possession of a handgun found under the driver's seat of the car that Lewis was driving even though the gun was not in Lewis's actual physical possession.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7015953\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/112/1092/#p1096\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, our review of the evidence shows: Billups exited a shed; the shed was nearly empty; a rifle was just inside the shed's door; Billups was the only person in the shed; and Billups was within reach of the rifle. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to convict Billups of constructive possession of the rifle. We may reverse only if, with respect to one or more elements of the offense, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the State would not allow reasonable and fair-minded jurors to reach any decision other than to acquit. This evidence does not permit a reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. As to the weight of the evidence, we may only reverse and grant a new trial if the verdict is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence \"that to affirm would be to ignore an unconscionable injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Mosley v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8423866\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/930/459/#p462\">\n    930 So.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462 (\u00b6 11) (Miss. Ct. App. 2006). Addressing this assignment of error, the facts of the case reflect that the police observed Billups exiting a shed. Billups was the only person inside the shed in which little aside from an identifiable and recently-stolen long firearm was found. This firearm was found only steps from the door through which Billups exited in the plain view of police. A review of the evidence in this matter convinces us to affirm Billups's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. Beyond his arguments regarding sufficiency and weight of the evidence, in a supplemental pro se brief, Billups adds to his counsel's claims of trial court error. He argues additionally that: (1) his indictment as a habitual offender along with the imposed sentence enhancement together constitute double jeopardy; (2) the trial court's failure to give an advisory jury instruction on the separate theories of actual versus constructive possession violated his due process and equal protection rights; (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) the State failed to prove he constructively possessed a firearm; (5) improper identification testimony violated his Confrontation Clause rights; and (6) the \"[j]udge was in error on a matter presented to him on poss. of actual or constructive.\" These additional claims are procedurally barred or without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17. Two of Billups's additional claims concern the \"possession\" element of the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He argues generally\n   that the trial judge was in error on the issue of actual or constructive possession, and that the State failed to prove constructive possession. As to these claims, our opinion regarding the sufficiency and weight of the evidence thoroughly reflects no error in the trial court's handling of the proof presented to the jury on the element of possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18. Billups argues that his indictment as a habitual offender along with the imposed sentence enhancement together constitute double jeopardy. Time and time again this Court and the Supreme Court have addressed this issue. Sentencing under Mississippi Code Annotated sections 97-37-5 and 97-37-37(2) present no double-jeopardy concern.\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959591\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/137/283/#p288\">\n    137 So.3d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 288 (\u00b6 17) (Miss. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Ct. App. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19. Billups's claim that an advisory jury instruction on constructive possession was required is procedurally barred. The record shows that Billups failed to object to the instructions provided, and that Billups failed to offer to the trial court, for consideration, the jury instruction he now requests in his appeal. As such, this issue is procedurally barred.\n   <em>\n    Daniels v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7065408\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/9/1194/#p1198\">\n    9 So.3d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1198 (\u00b6 4) (Miss. Ct. App. 2009). Under Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-37-5, the State must prove that Billups was in possession of a firearm and that he had previously been convicted of a felony crime.\n   <em>\n    Hartzog v.

Ct. App. 2017). The pertinent jury instruction given in Billups's trial stated in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [I]f you find from the evidence in this case beyond a reasonable doubt that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. the Defendant, Shamar Billups;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2. did on or about March 13, 2015;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   3. unlawfully, willfully and feloniously;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   4. possess a firearm;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   5. and has been previously been convicted of a felony ... then you shall find the Defendant guilty of Convicted Felon in Possession of a Firearm as charged in Count 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This reflects, as required, that the trial court fairly announced the law defining the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n   <em>\n    Hartzog\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12665423\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/240/462/#p466\">\n    240 So.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20. Billups's ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised in this direct appeal is a claim typically reserved for consideration via the appropriate postconviction proceedings. We will address such a claim only when the record affirmatively shows ineffective assistance of constitutional proportions, or when the parties stipulate that the record is adequate to allow us to make an ineffective assistant of counsel finding.\n   <em>\n    Colenburg v.

Ct. App. 1999). Finding neither in the record, we decline to address this claim on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21. Billups lastly claims the Confrontation Clause was violated in two instances: (1) when an officer testified that he spoke to a co-defendant and therefrom effected an identification of Billups; and (2) when one of the officers assigned to investigate his case was unable to appear at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This issue is meritless and procedurally barred. Billups fails to point to any portion of the trial transcript where anyone testified to identifying Billups based upon the hearsay testimony of a co-defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   He also fails to point to any portion of the trial transcript where any testimonial statements of the absent officer were offered into evidence, documentarily, orally, or otherwise. Further, Billups fails to cite any legal authority to show a Confrontation Clause violation. When an appellant fails to cite any legal authority or to offer any record evidence in support of a claim of error, the issue is procedurally barred, and this Court will not consider that issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Haskins v.
