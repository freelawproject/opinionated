All ten charges were alleged to have occurred between December 1, 2015, and December 31, 2016, and involved the same juvenile victim, K.V.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , whose date of birth is July 8, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 22, 2018, Defendant pled guilty as charged to three counts of oral sexual battery and three counts of felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile. The remaining four counts of the indictment were dismissed. No sentencing recommendation was made, and a Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI) was ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 25, 2018, the trial court had a sentencing hearing for Defendant, wherein the only witness to testify was Cindy Abshire, who is K.V.'s mother and Defendant's former girlfriend. At that time, the State recommended a minimum sentence of twenty years, while defense counsel requested that the sentence be less than the maximum for any count, with all sentences to run concurrently, and that Defendant receive sex offender treatment while incarcerated. Furthermore, defense counsel had previously filed a sentencing memorandum, which asked for \"a sentence of two years at hard labor and that he be recommended for sex offender treatment while in Department of Corrections['] custody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court expressed that it was \"quite disturbed by the facts presented in th[e] pre-sentence investigation[,]\" noting Defendant groomed the victim and that K.V. would \"feel this effect for the rest of her life[.]\" The trial court noted the abuse was ongoing for about a year. The trial court then sentenced Defendant to seven years at hard labor without benefits on each count of oral sexual battery, with those sentences to run concurrently to each other. Defendant was also sentenced to five years at hard labor for each count of felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile, with those sentences to run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the oral sexual battery sentences. Thus, Defendant received a total sentence of twelve years at hard labor, the first seven of which are without benefits. Defendant is also required to register as a sex offender for twenty-five years after his release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 15, 2018, defense counsel filed a Motion to Reconsider Sentence, arguing Defendant's sentences were excessive in light of mitigating factors and again asking for a two-year sentence. On August 2, 2018, the trial court held a hearing on the Motion to Reconsider. The trial court denied the motion noting the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The mother of the child testified at the hearing. I said it then and I will say it again today. I think [Defendant] took advantage of the mother as well as the child that was in -- somewhat in his control and was a master of manipulation and used his skills to fulfill his own sexual deviancy and sexual desires, which is illegal, immoral, and disgusting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   And I think that his original sentence handed down on May 25th is appropriate. And the more I think about it, the\n   more I probably should have handed down a much harsher sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   However, twelve years is not excessive, considering that this was a repeated offense that happened on different days and this was an ongoing relationship where he took advantage of such a young child who will pay for this for the rest of her life. So motion denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant now appeals his sentences, arguing the lengths of the sentences are excessive and that the trial court erred in running his felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile sentences consecutively to his oral sexual battery sentences. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State gave the following factual basis for the oral sexual battery charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Your Honor, on Mr. Kenny Young, the State would show, under Docket No. 61768, that between the dates of December 1st of 2015 and December 31st of 2016, on three different counts, he intentionally touched the anus or genitals of K.B. [sic], whose date of birth is 7-8-2002, by using his mouth or tongue or touching the offender with -- and she was not the spouse of the offender, and she was under the age of 15 and was at least three years younger than me [sic]. And this occurred in Vermilion Parish, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With regard to the felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile charges, the State gave the following: \"And Your Honor, he also had three counts of having sexual intercourse, with consent, with the same victim, whose date of birth is July 8, 2002, a person who is 13 years of age or older but less than 17. And this also occurred here in Vermilion Parish.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, we find that there is one error patent involving the sentences imposed for felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court imposed illegally lenient sentences for Defendant's guilty pleas to three counts of felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile. The penalty provision for felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile requires the trial court to order the seizure and impoundment of any personal property used in the commission of the offense. La.R.S. 14:80(D)(2). The trial court failed to impose such an order in the present case. Thus, the sentences imposed for felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile are illegally lenient. However, because the issue was not raised as an error, we will take no action related to this issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additionally, felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile was defined as occurring under La.R.S. 14:80(A) when:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) A person who is seventeen years of age or older has sexual intercourse, with consent, with a person who is thirteen years of age or older but less than seventeen years of age, when the victim is not the spouse of the offender and when the difference between the age of the victim and the age of the offender is four years or greater[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The maximum sentence for felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile is a $ 5000 fine, or ten years imprisonment with or without hard labor, or both under La.R.S. 14:80(D)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Both offenses for which Defendant pled guilty involved the use of a juvenile victim, in this case the thirteen-to-fourteen-year-old daughter of Defendant's girlfriend, to satisfy Defendant's own sexual desires. Additionally, the trial court specifically found Defendant groomed the juvenile by slowly escalating the contact, which occurred when Defendant was left to babysit the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    NATURE AND BACKGROUND OF DEFENDANT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant's primary argument regarding his sentences is that the trial court failed to consider mitigating factors regarding his nature and background. As noted by Defendant, the supreme court listed the following as factors that should be considered by a trial court in particularizing a sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The factors the trial judge should consider include the defendant's personal history (e.g. age, marital status, dependents, family stability, employment, mental, emotional, and physical health); the defendant's prior criminal record; the seriousness of the crime; the circumstances of the offense; the likelihood that defendant will commit another crime; and his potential for rehabilitation through correctional services other than confinement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defense counsel's sentencing memorandum included letters from Defendant's mother, two sisters, and his brother, which were accepted by the trial court prior to sentencing. The memorandum includes the following regarding the mitigating factors indicative of his nature that Defendant would like considered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Defendant] respectfully requests that the court, in sentencing him, look beyond his offense. He is more than a convicted felon. He is the loving son who took his mother in after she was widowed, and intends to do so again after he is released from incarceration, so he can care for her as she ages. He is the sibling who was always there for his brother and sisters. He is a man who has struggled with addiction, but has resolved to become a better, healthier, sober person going forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The trial court's view of Defendant's nature, however, was rather different. It stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   While his mother and sister and brother claim that he was a good son and a good brother, I don't dispute that. However, he was also a good sexual deviant and he took a child's innocence, a child who will feel this effect for the rest of her life and who is already feeling it right now, as the mother testified, having to go back to counseling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In the pre-sentence investigation, the victim statement shows and corroborates the mother's testimony today, how the victim in this case has become socially withdrawn and is struggling as a result of Mr. Young's actions, a man that she called Poppa or Poppa Bear. He used a child that he treated like a daughter for his own sexual gratification. That is a heinous crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    SENTENCES IMPOSED FOR SIMILAR CRIMES\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although Defendant cites the factors provided in\n   <em>\n    Lisotta,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11515939,11516003,11515973\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/745/1183/\">\n    745 So.2d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which were adopted by this court in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8306765\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/956/83/\">\n    956 So.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , he provides no case law to support his assertion that he should receive lesser sentences than what he received.

As noted by the trial court, Defendant was thirty-five when he began inappropriate physical contact with the then thirteen-year-old victim, which contact got progressively worse and lasted for roughly a year. Although Defendant argues a lesser sentence would be better for everyone, the relevant question is \"whether the trial court abused its broad sentencing discretion, not whether another sentence might have been more appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7438903\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/674/957/\">\n    674 So.2d at 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He ultimately received a ten-year sentence on each count, with the first two counts to run consecutively, and the remainder to run concurrently, for a total of twenty years at hard labor. The defendant challenged the total length of his sentence, arguing the combined twenty years was excessive. Although this court recognized the convictions arose out of the same course of conduct, it nonetheless found the trial court's stated reasoning was sufficient to justify the consecutive sentences and twenty years total incarceration. Amongst the reasons considered were the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   After adopting by reference the factors considered at the original sentencing hearing, the trial court noted that Defendant was a first felony offender and stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   However, having noted that, I have also noted and will reiterate that the Defendant was the juvenile's stepfather at the time who used his position to prey on this young victim who was under his supervision and control when he committed the offenses. He, thus, violated his sacred obligation to protect and nurture her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The court also specifically finds that the Defendant deliberately and repeatedly sexually abused the child, which has caused lasting emotional problems. Undoubtedly the victim will carry the scars of what he did to her throughout her life .... And whether she will be able to have a relationship with an adult male because of this, I'm certainly not in a position to answer. But if you look at the statistics, problems can and do occur repeatedly because of these type situations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   This sexual abuse occurred from 1998 through 2004 and started when she was five years old. These repeated acts reflected a propensity to prey on one unable to protect herself when so young and vulnerable and the incapacity of resistance given her young age when this started.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The trial court then discussed La.R.S. 14:81.2(C)(1), molestation of a juvenile, noting that \"the reason I point this particular statute out is to point out that the legislature has recognized the seriousness, if you will, of the offense when it occurs over a period of time.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The trial court continued:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In this case, it was approximately a six-year period of time. And because of the psychological and emotional trauma, certainly repeated acts over this lengthy period of time causes that to endure and last, if you will. Plus, the egregiousness and gravity of the offenses, the vulnerability of the victim, the harm done to the victim in the manner of psychological and emotional trauma and the duration of time over which these events occurred are all factors which have been considered by this court in imposing consecutive sentences. Moreover, notably the Defendant's actions were not part of a single, isolated offense or occurrences nor can it be said that Defendant has accepted responsibility for his actions at least of the time the pre-sentence was composed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Urena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364853\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/215/813/#p817\">\n    215 So.3d at 818-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Urena\n   </em>\n   , the trial court in the instant case specifically found Defendant violated his position of trust over the victim, who was the teenage daughter of his then-girlfriend. Furthermore, the trial court noted the victim was undergoing counseling as a result of Defendant's action. Finally, the trial court specifically noted it found that Defendant \"groomed\" the victim over time, initially just fondling her when she was thirteen and eventually having sexual intercourse with her by the time she was fourteen. Therefore, we disagree with Defendant's argument that \"[t]he trial court failed to articulate sufficient reasons why it chose to order the oral sexual battery sentences to be served consecutively to the sentences imposed for felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile. Resentencing is necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As noted by the\n   <em>\n    Urena\n   </em>\n   court, the factors relevant to instituting consecutive sentences include the gravity or dangerousness of the offense, the viciousness of the crimes, the harm done to the victim, and the benefit to Defendant of a plea agreement. As previously discussed, Defendant's plea agreement lowered his total sentencing exposure in the event of consecutive sentences. Furthermore, the trial court clearly considered the gravity of the offense and the harm done to the victim, specifically calling Defendant's actions \"a heinous crime.\" Despite Defendant's status as a first offender, we cannot say that the trial court erred in running Defendant's sentences for oral sexual battery consecutively to his sentences for felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile where the trial court articulated its reasoning, particularly in light of this court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Urena\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Defendant's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In accordance with La.R.S. 46:1844(W), the victim will be referred to by her initials, given that she is both a juvenile and the victim of a sex offense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    We note that the State attempts to direct this court to lewd text messages between Defendant and the victim; however, since those text messages do not appear in the record, they are not properly before this court for consideration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    We note that oral sexual battery previously carried a maximum sentence of fifteen years, rather than its current ten-year maximum.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
