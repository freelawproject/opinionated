However, in this latter review, the panel remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing to address Defendant's contention that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to or to file a motion to reconsider sentence on the basis that a downward departure of the mandatory sentence was warranted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179985\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/436/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On remand, Judge David Ritchie conducted the ordered evidentiary hearing. The record establishes that Defendant appeared with appointed counsel, Edward Bauman, at that time. Mr. Bauman stated that he had intended to subpoena Defendant's original sentencing counsel, Robert Shelton, for the evidentiary hearing but determined the issue could be decided without Mr. Shelton. Mr. Bauman then urged the trial court to find the original sentencing counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to reconsider sentence. Mr. Bauman asked the trial court to, in turn, resentence Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before addressing Defendant's argument, however, the trial judge noted that Mr. Shelton would likely be considered unavailable for testimony due to hospitalization. The trial court then moved on to the issue before it, stating that the standard of\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) must be applied in determining whether counsel was ineffective. As stated in the opinion remanding the matter: \"In order to prove an attorney was ineffective, a defendant must show his attorney was deficient, and he was prejudiced by the deficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Farry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179985\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/436/\">\n    207 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   439 (citing\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since Mr. Shelton was not present to testify as to why he did not object to the mandatory life sentence or to file a motion to reconsider the life sentence, the trial court stated that it would assume for purposes of determining ineffective assistance of counsel that Mr. Shelton was deficient in failing to object to the sentence and in failing to file a motion to reconsider sentence. Thus, the trial court focused on whether Defendant was prejudiced by that alleged deficiency. Focusing on the nature of the underlying armed robbery,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court remarked on what it described as a \"calculated violent\" offense and one reflecting \"a criminal mindset that has no consideration for anybody\" but Defendant. The trial court further noted Defendant's \"failure to take responsibility for or show any remorse for his crime is just another\n   validation that I -- that I think that sentence under the habitual offender sentence was appropriate.\" Accordingly, the trial court concluded that \"it would not have made a difference\" if Mr. Shelton had objected to the life sentence or had filed a motion to reconsider sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subsequent to the hearing, Defendant's appointed counsel filed a motion to reconsider sentence. At the time the trial court convened an additional hearing for consideration of that motion, it explained that Defendant's original sentencing counsel, Mr. Shelton, had passed away since the prior hearing. Questioning whether the motion to reconsider sentence should be considered in light of the earlier determination that the prejudice prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard had not been met, the trial court noted that it had reviewed all of the letters submitted on Defendant's behalf. The trial court then asked Defendant if he would like to put anything additional on the record. Defense counsel noted that Defendant would have liked to have some of his family members present and that Defendant's mother was present. The trial court allowed Defendant's mother to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Afterwards, the trial court reiterated its finding that Defendant failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, in denying the motion to reconsider sentence, the trial court cited\n   <em>\n    State v. Lindsey\n   </em>\n   , 99-3302 (La. 10/17/00),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11163227,11163347\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/770/339/\">\n    770 So.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9363840,9364067,9364102,9363592,9363627,9363660,9363564,9364016,9363792,9364146,9363699,9363897,9363932,9363964,9363742\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/1010/\">\n    532 U.S. 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20S.%20Ct.%201739\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=149%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20663\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) for the proposition that Defendant had the burden of demonstrating unusual circumstances so as to render the legislatively-prescribed mandatory sentence unconstitutional. The trial court determined that Defendant failed to do so, explaining, in part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   At this point I would say that after considering -- you know, after -- after the evidentiary hearing, after considering everything that was said previously on Mr. Farry's behalf, I can't say -- especially looking at his criminal history and the facts of the current case, I can't say -- and I don't believe that the defense could have met at the time that Mr. Shelton was representing him, had he made the motion, I don't see how he could have made the argument by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Farry is an exceptional case and that these are unusual circumstances in light of his criminal history, the current charge, et cetera, to be able to prove that he -- you know, that the -- that the mandatory life sentence in this case is constitutionally excessive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court denied Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following that determination, Defendant filed the instant appeal. In briefing to this court, he assigns the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I. The trial court's determination that trial counsel was effective in this case was in error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   II. William Farry's appointed counsel to represent him at the evidentiary hearing on remand was ineffective and admittedly unprepared to fully represent William's interest. This matter should again be remanded for a new hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   III. William Farry's habitual sentence for life should be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because his case was (is) not final as of November 1, 2017; thus, under the 2017 amendment to La.R.S. \u00a7 15:529.1, Williams is no longer subject to a mandatory life sentence. Denial of relief because of the 2018 change in law would constitute\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   and Due Process Clause violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Errors Patent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, this court reviews all appeals for errors patent on the face of the record. That review reveals no such errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Proceedings on Remand\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By his first assignment, Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in finding he was not prejudiced by Mr. Shelton's failure to object to or request reconsideration of the mandatory life sentence. Defendant acknowledges the facts of the case are \"bad,\" but contends Defendant's counsel at the evidentiary hearing should have put on evidence as to the facts surrounding the two predicate convictions for simple burglary. Defendant argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Due to some of the reasons addressed in assignment of error 2 - namely the lack of preparedness on the part of William's counsel at the evidentiary hearings to provide effective representation on the issue of mitigation - and the trial court's own confusion about how to conduct the hearing, the trial court's failure to find prejudice was in error. The facts of this case are admittedly bad. But William was not being punished just for an armed robbery. He was also being punished for two prior simple burglary charges. The court made a point to say simple burglary is much worse than theft, but the record does not indicate the facts surrounding the two prior burglaries. Nowhere was it stated whether the burglaries where of a house versus a vehicle, whether anything was taken versus attempted to be taken, or whether there were occupants versus a vacancy. Because the court did not fully consider everything relevant to William Farry to determine if he was exceptional, it could not properly determine whether there was a mitigation argument trial counsel could have made that would have made a difference. Therefore, the basis of the court's decision was inadequate and its ruling erroneous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant asks this court to reverse the trial court's ruling and to remand the case for a hearing, at which he be given \"the opportunity to fully defend himself and show prejudice existed when his trial counsel failed to object to his sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response, the State contends the record does not support Defendant's claim that the trial court erred in finding no prejudice. As for Defendant's assertion that the trial court did not fully consider all relevant evidence to determine whether Defendant was an exceptional person to which a downward departure was warranted, the State counters that Defendant fails to specifically identify what that relevant information might be. In concluding its response to this assignment of error, the State argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   It is clear that, while the defendant's attorney did not object to the life sentence or file a Motion to Reconsider the sentence, his representation was not ineffective because the deficiency did not prejudice the defense to the extent that the defendant was deprived of a fair trial. The defendant failed to show that he was exceptional or that the legislature's sentence was not meaningfully tailored to the defendant's culpability. In fact, the statements of the trial judge illustrate just the opposite. This defendant is one for which the habitual offender statute was written.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following review, we conclude that the trial court provided adequate reasons for its determination that Mr. Shelton's failure to request a downward departure from the mandatory life sentence had no bearing on the sentence originally imposed. As the fourth circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[T]he trial judge who imposed the sentence initially is uniquely situated to determine whether any errors by counsel at sentencing would have resulted in a substantially less harsh sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Boyd\n   </em>\n   , 14-408, p. 7 (La.App. 4 Cir. 2/11/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869814\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/259/#p264\">\n    164 So.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In ruling, the trial court clearly articulated that, notwithstanding the mitigating evidence presented by Defendant's mother, letters written on Defendant's behalf, and the non-violent nature of the two predicate offenses, it would not have found Defendant to be a candidate for a sentence other than the mandatory life sentence. The trial court instead relied heavily on the facts of the armed robbery, Defendant's criminal record, and Defendant's lack of remorse. The trial court explained that, unlike the cases in which a mandatory life sentence was found to be unconstitutional, the crime being enhanced in Defendant's case is punishable by up to ninety-nine years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Additionally, and as pointed out by the trial court, in order to prove Defendant was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to request a downward departure, he was required to demonstrate that he would have been one of the exceptional defendants for which a downward departure is appropriate. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , 97-1906 (La. 3/4/98),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11853767\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/709/672/#p676\">\n    709 So.2d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676, the supreme court recognized the legislature's \"constitutional authority to determine the appropriate penalty for a crime,\" but the judiciary's respective \"authority, in the rare case, to declare a sentence within these statutory limits excessive under the facts of a particular case.\" Given the \"delicate balance\" between those respective roles, the supreme court considered \"under what rare circumstances a sentencing court should exercise its authority to declare excessive a minimum sentence mandated by the Habitual Offender Law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11853767\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/709/672/#p676\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It explained that the \"sentencing judge must always start with the presumption that a mandatory minimum sentence under the Habitual Offender Law is constitutional[,]\" and that a departure from that minimum sentence is only appropriate following a finding \"that there is clear and convincing evidence in the particular case before it which would rebut this presumption of constitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11853767\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/709/672/#p676\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In considering the evidence rebutting the presumption of constitutionality, the supreme court instructed that the \"trial judge may not rely solely upon the non-violent nature of the instant crime or of past crimes[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11853767\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/709/672/#p676\">\n    709 So.2d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In light of that legislative pronouncement, and \"while a defendant's record of non-violent offenses may play a role in a sentencing judge's determination that a minimum sentence is too long, it cannot be the only reason, or even the major reason, for declaring such a sentence excessive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11853767\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/709/672/#p676\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, to rebut the presumption of constitutional validity, a defendant must clearly and convincingly demonstrate that \"[he] 'is exceptional, which in this context means that because of unusual circumstances this defendant is a victim of the legislature's failure to assign sentences that are meaningfully tailored to the culpability of the offender, the gravity of the offense, and the circumstances of the case.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11853767\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/709/672/#p676\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Clearly, the major reasons the Legislature\n   passed the Habitual Offender Law were to deter and punish recidivism. Under this statute the defendant with multiple felony convictions is treated as a recidivist who is to be punished for the instant crime in light of his continuing disregard for the laws of our state. He is subjected to a longer sentence because he continues to break the law. Given the Legislature's constitutional authority to enact statutes such as the Habitual Offender Law, it is not the role of the sentencing court to question the wisdom of the Legislature in requiring enhanced punishments for multiple offenders. Instead, the sentencing court is only allowed to determine whether the particular defendant before it has proven that the mandatory minimum sentence is so excessive in his case that it violates our constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   We emphasize to sentencing judges that departures downward from the minimum sentence under the Habitual Offender Law should occur only in rare situations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 677.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Given that standard, we find no merit in Defendant's contention that the trial court's denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was erroneous. Although Defendant suggests that the trial court should have considered the specific facts surrounding the two predicate offenses, there is no indication that further information regarding those offenses would have altered the trial court's opinion. Instead, the trial court's emphasis of the facts of the armed robbery, coupled with its awareness that the two predicates were non-violent, supports its articulated determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel - Evidentiary Hearing on Remand\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Turning to his second assignment, Defendant argues that Mr. Bauman, the attorney appointed to represent him at the evidentiary hearing, was ineffective and \"unprepared to fully represent [his] interest.\" In particular, Defendant contends Mr. Bauman \"had not prepared with his client to argue for mitigation.\" Thus, Defendant requests this court to remand for an additional hearing to determine effectiveness of counsel and, in turn, for presentation of mitigation evidence in order to prove his original counsel, Mr. Shelton, was ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In support of his argument, Defendant notes that Mr. Bauman admitted that the evidentiary hearing held in the present case was his first ineffective assistance of counsel evidentiary hearing. Defendant additionally points out that Mr. Bauman did not talk with or subpoena Mr. Shelton. And third, appellate counsel notes that when the State referred to the facts of the armed robbery for which Defendant was convicted and Defendant attempted to challenge those facts, Mr. Bauman stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   MR.

These delays, Defendant claims, prevented him from being able to seek resentencing under the 2017 amendment prior to the August 1, 2018 effective date of the 2018 amendment. Defendant thus argues that his constitutional right to due process mandates that he be resentenced under the 2017 amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant's argument, however, assumes that he had a right to the application of the 2017 ameliorative changes. Our above determination regarding the retroactive application of the 2018 amendment negates Defendant's assumption. Further, it is well-settled that a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional or statutory right to an illegal sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, even if Defendant's case proceeded without any of the delays of which he complains, and Defendant was resentenced under the 2017 amendment as formerly required by\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the sentence would have been illegally lenient in light of the retroactive application of the 2018 amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Accordingly, we find that this argument lacks merit.
