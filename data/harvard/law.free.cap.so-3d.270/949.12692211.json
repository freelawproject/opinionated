This case involves the alleged sexual battery of an unconscious seventeen-year-old girl by three young men, one of whom recorded a portion of the sexual conduct on Snapchat. Martin Blake Pugh, Jayland Christipher Brittmon, and Matthew Anderson Craddock were indicted on the charges of conspiracy to commit sexual battery and sexual battery of an incapacitated person. Craddock was further indicted on the charge of depicting a child under the age of eighteen years engaging in sexual conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Brittmon subsequently pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge and to the reduced charge of simple assault. Craddock pleaded guilty to aggravated assault. Pugh proceeded to trial and was found guilty of both conspiracy to commit sexual battery and sexual battery of an incapacitated person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Pugh was sentenced to serve one year in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with six months suspended, followed by four years and six months of post-release supervision on the conspiracy charge, and one year in the custody of the MDOC, with one year suspended, on the sexual battery charge, to run concurrently with the sentence for conspiracy. He was ordered to pay $200 restitution to the District Attorney; $1,763 restitution to the DeSoto County Circuit Court Clerk; a $500 fine; $100 to the Crime Victim Compensation Fund; and all court costs. Pugh was further ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release from incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Pugh now appeals and argues: (1) the circuit court erroneously admitted into evidence the Snapchat video as well as various text-message conversations among the parties, (2) there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction of conspiracy to commit sexual battery, and (3) the numerous evidentiary errors amount to cumulative error and mandate reversal. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. On April 5, 2015, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Drew Kazemba received a Snapchat video from Craddock that showed \"two guys having sex with a girl [who] looked unconscious, and it was a black guy and then there was a white guy on the\n   other end having oral sex with her.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kazemba saved the video because the girl looked unconscious. He showed the video to his mother and ultimately turned the video in to Marshall County law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. At trial, Kazemba testified that Craddock admitted to being one of the guys in the video and identified the unconscious-looking girl as Gina Warren.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Snapchat video was offered and admitted into evidence as Exhibit 1, with no objection by Pugh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Following Kazemba's testimony, Brittmon testified regarding the events of the night. Brittmon explained that on the night of Saturday, April 4, 2015, he, along with Pugh, Craddock, Kate Hill, and Blake Conner, went to a party in Byhalia. Gina, Brittmon's close friend, was also at the party and, according to Brittmon, spent most of the time flirting with Conner. Brittmon stated he did not see Gina flirt with Pugh or Craddock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Later that night, Gina asked Brittmon for a ride to Hannah Ferguson's house. Brittmon, Pugh, Craddock, Hill, Conner, and Gina subsequently left the party around midnight. Brittmon testified that at the time they left the party, Gina was \"pretty drunk.\" They dropped Hill off at her house and decided to go to Waffle House to eat. However, Brittmon explained that once they arrived at Waffle House, they \"decided not [to eat] after [they] had to help [Gina] inside - [s]he couldn't make it alone to the restroom, so [they] decided just to leave.\" However, they did not take Gina to Hannah Ferguson's house \"[b]ecause at one point [Gina] stated she didn't want to go, and then [they] figured it would be easier for [them] to just go to [Brittmon's] house and not to worry about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. When they got to Brittmon's house, Conner got in his car and left. Brittmon stated that they \"[had] to pretty much help [Gina] inside\" as she was \"still in the same condition.\" Once inside Brittmon's house, Brittmon, Pugh, Craddock, and Gina went to Brittmon's bedroom. Although they were going to send Gina upstairs, Gina \"jumped in bed and got undressed.\" Brittmon and Pugh then got in the bed with Gina. Craddock was on the floor or in an adjoining bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. According to Brittmon, Gina unbuckled Pugh's pants and began performing oral sex on him. Brittmon was about to tell them to get out when Gina grabbed his hand and stuck it in her pants. Brittmon stated they all \"start[ed] messing around\" and \"pretty much all three had sex with [Gina] at some point throughout the night.\" Brittmon explained that Craddock got involved \"randomly throughout the escapade.\" Brittmon had sex with Gina first, then Pugh, then Craddock, and then Brittmon had sex with Gina again for a second time. The Snapchat video, previously admitted into evidence, was then published to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Following publication of the video, Brittmon testified that there was no break in the time period while the three men were having sex with Gina. Instead, \"[i]t happen[ed] all at the same time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Brittmon further testified that he recalled seeing a flashlight but did not realize that it was a Snapchat video. Brittmon learned of the Snapchat video \"[o]nce everything [w]as finished\" and he checked his phone. Brittmon agreed that the video\n   was received shortly after the incident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. Following the incident, Brittmon and Pugh took Craddock home. Brittmon testified that they discussed the video at one point but did not talk about it a lot. However, Brittmon stated that Pugh was aware of the video at that time. After Brittmon and Pugh dropped off Craddock, they returned to Brittmon's house and went to sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. The next morning, Gina woke up and asked why her clothes were off. Brittmon told her that she had gotten hot. Neither Brittmon nor Pugh advised Gina that they had had sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. Several hours later, Gina texted Brittmon and the following conversation occurred:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Gina: Hey! Thanks [f]or letting me crash at your house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Brittmon: [H]aha no problem. [B]ut I gotta tell you somethin[g].. we kinda had sex last night and I feel so bad about it. I wouldn't have done it but you kept grabbin at my wang lol[.] I wanted to tell you this morning but you didn't remember and that made me feel even worse. [B]ut you deserve to know the truth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Gina: You're not joking are you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Brittmon: [U]nfortunately I'm not[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Gina: Shit happens don't worry about it[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Brittmon: [C]ool beans[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Gina: [Brittmon,] are you sure you aren't just making this up because I swear to God I got there[,] threw up[,] and went to bed[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Brittmon: Why would I make this up haha[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Gina: Idk a joke[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Brittmon: [L]ol[,] no as much as I wish it was[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16. Gina again texted Brittmon on Monday, April 6, 2015, and asked about the Snapchat video. Their conversation was as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Gina: [Brittmon,] wtf is this[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Brittmon: [Craddock] probably made up a story cus that did not happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Gina: Was he even at your house? ? Hannah [F]erguson apparently said there is a video of me or something but I don't believe it[.] I know you wouldn't let something like this happen to me [Brittmon]. I'm already disappointed with me and you because obviously I was plastered[,] but if this shit is true I'm probably going to be pissed[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Brittmon: [Y]eah that dickhead walked in with his [message was cutoff.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Brittmon explained that he told Gina that Craddock walked in on them while they were having sex and took a video on his phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 17. Following his text-message conversation with Gina, Brittmon texted Craddock and Pugh and advised that people were aware of the Snapchat video. The following group discussion occurred:\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Brittmon: CRADDOCK[,] WHY DOES [GINA] KNOW ABOUT THE SNAPCHAT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   YOU FUCKIN IDIOT[?] YOU ARE GETTING YOUR ASS BEAT[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Craddock: How does she know? ?

Brittmon testified that following the group discussion, he thought they were in the clear. However, he was subsequently contacted by a police officer and interviewed. Brittmon stated he initially told the police officer \"a story about how [he] wasn't originally aware of Snapchat, and then how [Craddock] just came in at some point and filmed [him] having sex with [Gina].\" Brittmon admitted to the officer that he, Craddock, and Pugh all had sex with Gina, but he maintained that Gina initiated it. When asked by the officer why Gina looked unconscious in the video, Brittmon advised, \"because she was fucked up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 19. Importantly, Brittmon testified that he did not believe Gina was competent enough to give consent. Brittmon acknowledged that in the Snapchat video, Gina was not reaching for Craddock's penis or trying to put his penis in her mouth. Instead, Craddock was holding his own penis and trying to put his penis in Gina's mouth. Brittmon stated Gina was not pushing Craddock's penis away because \"[s]he was in a state of mind not able to properly respond.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 20. The State's last witness was Gina. Gina testified that she had never met Pugh before that night but that he was dating one of her friends, Hill. Gina further testified that although she and Brittmon were friends, she had never had a sexual relationship with him and did not desire to have one. Gina admitted that she drank at the party and stated she felt drunk and woozy in the car after the party. Gina testified that the last thing she remembers from that night was throwing up in a dark bathroom in an unknown location. She had no recollection of going to Waffle House.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 21. Gina first learned of the Snapchat video from a friend. Gina stated that Brittmon, Pugh, and Craddock subsequently contacted her. She explained that Brittmon did not tell her that she had had sex with Pugh or Craddock, Pugh told her that she was \"being flirty\" but did not advise that they had had sex, and Craddock did not advise her that they had had sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 22. Gina denied initiating sex with Brittmon, Pugh, or Craddock. She said that Brittmon, Pugh, and Craddock told her that \"it could go away if [she] said it was consensual.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 23. Hill testified on behalf of Pugh and stated that on the night in question, Gina was \"drinking excessively\" at the party, and referred to Gina as a \"lightweight.\" Hill explained that the group left the party no later than 2:30 a.m. because she had to be home around 3:00 a.m. According to Hill, Gina appeared to be okay at the party and seemed coherent during the car ride after the party. Hill stated she had no concerns for Gina's safety. However, Hill acknowledged that after the party, she was dropped off first and did not know what subsequently happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 24. Pugh testified in his own defense and admitted that he got drunk at the party. He further admitted that he and Gina had sex for \"a couple of minutes\" right after she performed oral sex on him. Specifically, Pugh explained that Brittmon had sex with Gina first while Gina performed oral sex on him, then he had sex with Gina. Afterwards, Pugh got on the floor and went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 25. Pugh recalled seeing Craddock in Brittmon's bedroom that night, but stated\n   he did not know about the Snapchat video until they turned the lights on and he checked his phone. Pugh acknowledged that Gina was \"drunk\" and \"acting wild\" but stated at no time while at Brittmon's house or before did Gina seem to be incoherent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 26. Following his convictions and sentence, Pugh filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, a new trial, which the circuit court denied. Pugh timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    I. Admission of Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 27. Pugh first argues the circuit court erred in its admission of the Snapchat video and the various text-message conversations among the parties. We separately address each evidentiary issue, but we note that the standard of review is the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 28. \"The admission or suppression of evidence is within the sound discretion of the [circuit court] and will not be reversed unless there is an abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Sturkey v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8344188\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/946/790/#p794\">\n    946 So.2d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 794 (\u00b6 11) (Miss. Ct. App. 2006). \"We will only reverse under that standard if the admission of the evidence results in prejudice or harm to the opposing party, or if it adversely affects a substantial right of the party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8344188\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/946/790/#p794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    a. Snapchat Video\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 29. Pugh asserts \"[t]he Snapchat video was inadmissible for multiple reasons.\" However, we find this issue is procedurally barred. Pugh did not object to the admission of the Snapchat video at trial. \"[F]ailure to make a contemporaneous objection waives an issue for purposes of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyd v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839010\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/1/#p4\">\n    175 So.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. 2015). Because Pugh did not object to the admission into evidence of the Snapchat video, he is procedurally barred from raising its admission as an issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 30. Notwithstanding the procedural bar, we find this issue is meritless. Pugh first argues the video was not authenticated. Mississippi Rule of Evidence 901(a) provides for the authentication of evidence as a condition precedent to admission. Pursuant to Rule 901(a), \"[t]o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 31. Here, the record shows Kazemba reviewed the Snapchat video prior to taking the witness stand and testified that the video fairly and accurately represented what he received from Craddock. Kazemba testified that Craddock was one of his Snapchat contacts and explained how he was able to save the video upon receipt. Kazemba further testified that Craddock and Gina were two of the individuals in the video and that Gina \"looked unconscious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 32. Additionally, both Brittmon and Pugh admitted to having sex with Gina and testified that they received the Snapchat video from Craddock shortly after the incident occurred when they checked their phones. Moreover, Brittmon testified that he remembered seeing a flashlight while he was having sex with Gina, but he did not realize it was a Snapchat video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 33. Overall, we find the State produced sufficient evidence to support a finding that the Snapchat video admitted into evidence at trial was what the State claimed it was-that is, a Snapchat video from Craddock depicting the alleged sexual battery of Gina. Accordingly, the Snapchat video was properly authenticated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 34. Pugh next argues the video was irrelevant because the State never established a timeline or when Craddock recorded the video. Under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 401, evidence is relevant if \"it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and the fact is of consequence in determining the case.\" \" Rule 401 is construed broadly in favor of admitting evidence with even slight probative value.\"\n   <em>\n    Ross v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337690\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/954/968/#p993\">\n    954 So.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 993 (\u00b6 44) (Miss. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 35. Here, the video is relevant because it shows Gina's condition during the incident and corroborates the State's testimony regarding the incident. Pugh asserts \"the State only narrowed the timeline ... to sometime between shortly after midnight and 3 a.m.\" and notes that \"in a case where the charge is sexual battery of an incapacitated person, even seconds make a huge difference when determining whether someone is incapacitated or not.\" However, such assertion does not affect the relevancy of the video. Pugh's argument regarding the three-hour time frame was addressed during trial and was for the jury to consider and resolve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 36. Pugh last argues \"any probative value the video had was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and/or misleading the jury.\" Mississippi Rule of Evidence 403 is considered the ultimate filter through which all evidence must pass.\n   <em>\n    Palmer v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8466140\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/939/792/#p795\">\n    939 So.2d 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795 (\u00b6 10) (Miss. 2006).

Although Craddock and Pugh are both white males, Kazemba testified that Craddock, not Pugh, was in the video. Thus, the testimony makes clear that Pugh was not in the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 38.

Both Brittmon and Gina testified at trial and advised the jury about what happened that night, the condition Gina was in at the time, and the discovery of the Snapchat video. Exhibits 2 and 3 do not provide new or additional information. Instead, the same information included in the exhibits was offered through Brittmon and Gina's testimony.

Prior to trial, Pugh objected to the admission of Exhibit 4 \"based on the fact that [Craddock] ha[d] previously pled guilty to aggravated assault and, therefore, ... is not a true coconspirator and [Exhibit 4] would be hearsay as [it] relates to [Craddock].\" The circuit court overruled the objection at that time but advised defense counsel that it would revisit the issue when the evidence was offered. When the State sought to admit Exhibit 4 at trial, defense counsel objected based \"on [the] previous objection.\" The circuit court allowed the State to develop the evidence outside the presence of the jury. Thereafter, the circuit court overruled the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 45. On appeal, Pugh does not reassert that Craddock was not a true coconspirator in light of his guilty plea.

Here, the statements included in Exhibit 4 were made after the alleged sexual battery occurred and pertained to a coverup of that act. At trial, Brittmon acknowledged that during the text-message conversation, he, Craddock, and Pugh discussed the fact that everyone knew about the Snapchat video. Importantly, Brittmon acknowledged that they discussed what they needed to do \"to prevent anyone else from finding out about what actually happened that night.\" Brittmon stated that following the group discussion, they thought they were \"in the clear.\" As noted in\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   , one of the objectives of any conspiracy is to avoid arrest and prosecution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11949357\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/592/114/#p134\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, contrary to Pugh's assertion, the statements included in Exhibit 4 are not inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    d.

Brittmon stated they were going to eat, but \"decided not to after [they] had to help [Gina] inside.\" Brittmon explained that \"[Gina] couldn't make it alone to the restroom, so [they] decided just to leave.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 50. During Pugh's direct testimony, he was questioned about Gina's condition at Waffle House. Pugh acknowledged that Gina went to the bathroom, but stated he did not see Gina stumbling or staggering, and that no one had to help her to the car. With regard to Brittmon's testimony, Pugh stated, \"until yesterday [when Brittmon testified], that was never - no one ever said that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 51. On cross-examination, Pugh again testified that no one ever said Gina had trouble at Waffle House or needed help to the restroom. The State then asked Pugh, \"[s]o is it not true that Blake Conner texted Gina and said [she] almost passed out when [they] were at Waffle House?\" Defense counsel objected based on hearsay. The circuit court overruled the objection because Pugh was \"on cross-examination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 52. The State continued its questioning until defense counsel again objected and a bench conference was held. Following the bench conference, the circuit court sustained the objection and allowed counsel the opportunity to lay a foundation for the line of questioning. The State then asked Pugh, \"What did you mean on direct when you said no one had ever said that before?\" Pugh explained that \"[n]o one's ever said [Gina] needed help getting out of Waffle House ... I've talked to Blake Conner ... [h]e never saw it ... I've never heard it until yesterday when you asked [Brittmon] about it.\" Defense counsel then objected as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Once again, the initial question was - his initial statement was that nobody had ever said anything about [Gina] having to be helped out of Waffle House to the car. Now we're trying to back door into some type of hearsay about the alleged text that this individual, that [Pugh] did not see.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The circuit judge responded, \"Well, if he doesn't know, he can certainly say he doesn't know.

Pugh argues the State's reference to Conner's text message to Gina was inadmissible hearsay. We disagree. A review of the record shows that the State was not offering the statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e. that Gina almost passed out at Waffle House). Instead, the State referenced Conner's statement to show that, despite Pugh's testimony, someone other than Brittmon had stated that Gina had trouble at Waffle House. \"[S]tatements can be offered solely for the purpose of demonstrating that they were said....\"\n   <em>\n    Fair v.

Although there was an empty bedroom upstairs, Brittmon and Pugh got in the bed with Gina. Craddock was nearby, either on the bedroom floor or in the adjoining bathroom. Brittmon testified that he, Pugh, and Craddock \"pretty much had sex with [Gina] at some point throughout the night.\" Brittmon further testified there was never a break where they left and came back later. Instead, \"[i]t happen[ed] all at the same time.\" The next morning, when Gina asked why her clothes were off, neither Brittmon nor Pugh advised Gina of the sexual intercourse. Instead, she was told that she had gotten hot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 59. Additionally, the various exhibits, including certain text messages, show Gina's surprise when learning of the incident, as well as Brittmon, Pugh, and Craddock's attempt to explain and coverup the incident.
