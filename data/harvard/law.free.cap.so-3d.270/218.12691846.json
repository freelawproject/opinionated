Rickey McCarley appeals the Prentiss County Chancery Court's judgment awarding his wife, Kellie McCarley, separate maintenance. Rickey asserts the following assignments of error: (1) the chancellor erred by failing to make the transcript of her telephonic hearing part of the record and (2) the chancellor erred in awarding Kellie separate maintenance. Finding no error, we affirm the chancellor's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Rickey and Kellie were married in November 1979 and separated in October 2015. At the time of their separation, Rickey and Kellie had two adult children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On February 5, 2016, Rickey filed a complaint for divorce from Kellie on the grounds of constructive desertion, habitual\n   cruel and inhuman treatment, and irreconcilable differences. Rickey also set forth his specific requests regarding the division of marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. On February 11, 2016, Kellie filed a complaint alleging that she and Rickey separated due to Rickey's adultery and habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. Kellie requested that the chancellor award her temporary alimony and permanent separate maintenance during the term of the separation, as well as continued coverage under Rickey's insurance policy and one-half of Rickey's retirement. On March 28, 2016, the chancellor entered an order consolidating the cases. The chancellor then entered a \"Temporary Agreed Order\" on June 15, 2016, requiring Rickey to maintain Kellie's health insurance and pay her $250 every two weeks; the chancellor also granted Kellie exclusive use and possession of the marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. At a trial held on October 24, 2016, the chancellor heard testimony from Kellie and Rickey, as well as Rickey's brother, Roger McCarley, and Penny Gravedoni, Rickey's girlfriend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the trial, the chancellor informed the parties that although she would like to make a ruling from the bench that same day, she needed time to review the exhibits presented by the parties. The chancellor then scheduled a telephone conference with the attorneys, explaining that she would give her opinion at that time and also ask one of the attorneys to prepare the order. The transcript of the telephone conference does not appear in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. On December 2, 2016, the chancellor entered an order denying Rickey's complaint for divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. However, the chancellor found that Kellie met her burden of proving that she was entitled to separate maintenance. The chancellor awarded Kellie the marital home and $500 per month for spousal support. The chancellor also divided the other marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. On December 19, 2016, the chancellor entered an amended order clarifying that because she found Kellie \"is without material fault in the separation and that [Rickey] abandoned [Kellie] and has refused to provide any support,\" Kellie met her \"burden of proof necessary to support her claim for separate maintenance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Rickey timely appealed the chancellor's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. \"This Court employs a limited standard of review when considering domestic-relations cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Rickey argues that the chancellor erred in failing to direct that the transcript from the telephone opinion be made part of the record. Rickey asserts that the amended order only states the chancellor's conclusions in very abbreviated form and contains none of the underlying facts nor applies the law to those facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11. In support of his argument, Rickey cites to\n   Uniform Chancery Court Rule 4.02, which provides that a chancellor's opinion may be given orally or in writing. If the chancellor pronounces her opinion orally, then \"it shall be taken down by the [c]ourt [r]eporter who shall, when directed by the [c]ourt, transcribe the same and submit it to the [c]hancellor for correction and approval.\" UCCR 4.02. Rule 4.02 mandates that whether the opinion rendered is made orally or in writing, it \"shall be filed among the papers and become a part of the record in the cause without any order or direction to that effect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036693\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/71/1208/#p1209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. We recognize that Rule 52(a) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure states that in cases tried without a jury, \"the court may, and\n   <strong>\n    shall upon the request of any party to the suit\n   </strong>\n   or when required by these rules,\n   <strong>\n    find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law\n   </strong>\n   thereon and judgment shall be entered accordingly.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. Similarly, Uniform Chancery Court Rule 4.01 provides \"In all actions\n   <strong>\n    where it is required or requested\n   </strong>\n   , pursuant to [ Rule] 52, the [c]hancellor\n   <strong>\n    shall find the facts specially and state separately his conclusions of law\n   </strong>\n   thereon. The\n   <strong>\n    request must be made either in writing\n   </strong>\n   , filed among the papers in the action, or dictated to the [c]ourt [r]eporter for record and\n   <strong>\n    called to the attention of the [c]hancellor\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14. At the conclusion of the hearing in the present case, the chancellor scheduled a telephone conference with the attorneys. The chancellor explained that she would give her opinion on the matter via telephone and would also request one of the attorneys to prepare the order at that time. The record contains no transcript from the telephone conference, but the record does contain the chancellor's written order and amended order setting forth her ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15. In the chancellor's amended order, she denied Rickey's complaint for divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment based on \"lack of proof.\" The chancellor also found \"that [Kellie] is without material fault in the separation and that [Rickey] abandoned [Kellie] and has refused to provide any support.\" The chancellor then determined that Kellie \"has met the burden of proof necessary to support her claim for separate maintenance.\" The record contains no request by Rickey or his attorney for the chancellor to find specially and state separately her conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16.

The\n   <em>\n    Baggett\n   </em>\n   court held that not only did the appellant fail to request that the chancellor make findings of fact and conclusions of law, but the facts of the case \"were neither hotly contested, greatly in dispute, nor complex so as to require the chancellor to [make findings of fact and conclusions of law] without a request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9754332\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/246/887/#p889\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 19) (citing\n   <em>\n    Tricon Metals &amp; Servs., Inc. v.

In the case before us, the record contains the transcript of the trial testimony from Rickey, Kellie, Penny, and Rickey's brother, Roger. Although the record does not contain a transcript of the telephone conference with the attorneys where the chancellor made her ruling orally, the record does contain the chancellor's amended written order reflecting her aforementioned ruling. Furthermore, Rule 4.02 mandates that if a party requests the chancellor to find the facts specially and state separately her conclusions of law, \"[t]he request must be made either in writing, filed among the papers in the action, or dictated to the [c]ourt [r]eporter for record and called to the attention of the [c]hancellor.\" No such request by either party appears in the record before us.

Rickey also argues that the chancellor erred in determining that Kellie did not materially contribute to the separation, and therefore this Court should reverse the chancellor's award of separate maintenance to Kellie.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rickey maintains that the evidence at trial showed that Kellie's lack of intimacy and hostility towards Rickey over the years served as a material and contributing cause to their separation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21.

Kellie testified that she and Rickey got married in November 1979 and separated in October 2015, after thirty-six years of marriage. Kellie stated that she would characterize the last five years of her marriage as \"okay,\" explaining that although they \"might not have had the happiest marriage,\" they were \"content.\" Kellie admitted that, although she and Rickey had a lot of problems in their marriage, she ultimately believed \"that marriage is for better and worse, until death do us part.\" Kellie testified that she and Rickey met in April 2016 to discuss whether they should reconcile or seek a divorce. Kellie stated that Rickey informed her that \"he would think about what we discussed,\" but she \"never heard from him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 26. Kellie testified that during the last year of their marriage, Rickey began drinking alcohol excessively. Kellie admitted that Rickey's drinking did not affect his performance at work, but she explained that most of his drinking occurred on the weekends or on his days off. Kellie also testified that she discovered bills for a credit card and a loan. Kellie explained that she was not previously aware that Rickey had taken out a loan or obtained a new credit card before her discovery of these documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 27. Regarding physical affection, Kellie testified that she was affectionate with Rickey and often hugged and patted him. However, Kellie testified that she and Rickey had not engaged in a sexual relationship since early 2015 and that they slept in separate bedrooms. Kellie stated that when she broached the subject with Rickey, he informed her that his medication prevented him from having an erection. Kellie testified that she attended one of Rickey's doctor's appointments where he explained the issue to the doctor, and the doctor responded that Rickey had to choose between \"either tak[ing] some medicine to keep him alive or hav[ing] sexual intercourse.\" Kellie admitted that she did not know if Rickey was still taking the medicine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 28. Roger characterized Rickey and Kellie's marriage as \"not happy.\" Roger testified that he never observed Kellie expressing affection towards Rickey. Roger also testified that Rickey was unfaithful to Kellie on a separate occasion earlier in their marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 29. Rickey opined that his and Kellie's marriage was not salvageable. Rickey testified that he and Kellie had not been physically affectionate over the last five years of their marriage, stating, \"Every time I went to kiss her, she would turn her cheek on me.\" Rickey testified that Kellie asked him to give up alcohol but he refused, explaining \"I didn't want to give up the beer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 30. Rickey testified that when he left the marital home, he \"wasn't interested in another woman,\" and he did not leave \"because of another woman.\" Rickey maintained\n   that he was not romantically involved with Penny prior to his and Kellie's separation in October 2015, and he testified that he did not begin dating Penny until after he had moved out of the marital home. He admitted that he and Penny worked together for years, and that they had talked on the phone for \"one or two years\" prior to his and Kellie's separation. Rickey stated that he did not have sexual relations with Penny until after he moved in with her. Penny also testified and confirmed that she and Rickey did not become romantic until December of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 31. After reviewing the testimony at trial, we find that the record contains substantial credible evidence supporting the chancellor's finding that Kellie did not materially contribute to the separation. We therefore affirm the chancellor's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Knighten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036693\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/71/1208/#p1209\">\n    71 So.3d at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 32.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   LEE, C.J., GRIFFIS, P.J., BARNES, FAIR, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.
