The complaint asserts a single count of negligence against the Board and other unidentified fictitiously named defendants. Specifically, Doe alleges that the Board breached its duty \"to not place him in harm or specifically harm him\" and that the Board failed to properly train and supervise the employee allegedly responsible for the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 27, 2018, the Board moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the Board is a State agency entitled to State immunity under the provisions of Art. I, \u00a7 4, Ala. Const. 1901. The trial court denied the motion, and the Board filed this petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \" ' \"It is well established that mandamus will lie to compel a dismissal of [a] claim that is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Blankenship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9178833\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/893/303/#p305\">\n    893 So.2d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (Ala. 2004).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \" ' \"A writ of mandamus is a\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \" ' \" 'drastic and extraordinary writ that will be issued only when there is: 1) a clear legal right in the petitioner to the order sought; 2) an imperative duty upon the respondent to perform, accompanied by a refusal to do so; 3) the lack of another adequate remedy; and 4) properly invoked jurisdiction of the court.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \" '\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9101669\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/705/#p708\">\n    852 So.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708 (Ala. 2002) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ex parte United Serv.
