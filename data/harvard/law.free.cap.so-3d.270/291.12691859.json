The facts of the crime are fully set out in our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Riley II\n   </em>\n   and need not be repeated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 13, 2015, Riley, acting pro se, timely filed the instant Rule 32 petition, raising numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He simultaneously filed a motion for the appointment of counsel. On November 19, 2015, the circuit court directed Riley to file an amended petition that complied with the requirements in Rule 32.6(a), Ala. R. Crim. P., specifically, to file an amended petition using the form found in the appendix to Rule 32. On November 20, 2015, the circuit court granted Riley's request for counsel and appointed counsel to represent him (hereinafter \"Rule 32 counsel\"). On November 23, 2015, Riley, again acting pro se, filed an amended petition; that petition included the form found in the appendix to Rule 32 and asserted the same claims as his original petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same day, Rule 32 counsel filed a notice of appearance. On December 22, 2015, the circuit court issued an order scheduling an evidentiary hearing on Riley's petition for June 28, 2016. On December 28, 2015, the State filed an answer and a motion to dismiss Riley's petition, arguing that all of Riley's claims were either insufficiently pleaded or meritless. On December 30, 2015, the circuit court issued an order setting the State's answer and motion to dismiss for a hearing at the same time as the previously scheduled evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 14, 2016, Rule 32 counsel filed a motion to continue the evidentiary hearing scheduled for June 28, 2016. The circuit court granted the motion, and the evidentiary hearing was conducted on July 19, 2016. At the hearing, Rule 32 counsel presented argument regarding some of the\n   claims in Riley's petition and the parties stipulated to the contents of the record from Riley's direct appeal, but Rule 32 counsel presented no other evidence in support of the claims in Riley's petition. At the request of the State, the circuit court permitted the parties to file post-hearing briefs and/or proposed orders, and on August 29, 2016, the State filed a proposed order. At some point not readily discernible from the record, Riley secured new counsel from out-of-state to represent him pro bono (hereinafter \"pro bono counsel\") and on September 19, 2016, pro bono counsel filed a notice of appearance and a verified application for admission to practice law in Alabama pro hac vice as pro bono counsel for the purpose of representing Riley in the Rule 32 proceedings. The record contains no ruling by the circuit court on pro bono counsel's request for admission pro hac vice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 20, 2016, Rule 32 counsel filed a motion to withdraw on the ground that Riley had secured other counsel to represent him; the circuit court denied the motion. On September 26, 2016, pro bono counsel filed a \"Motion for Adequate Opportunity to Litigate Claims in Rule 32 Petition,\" in which pro bono counsel requested that the circuit court allow Rule 32 counsel to withdraw; continue the Rule 32 proceedings to allow pro bono counsel time to investigate, to file a second amended petition, and to request discovery; and to then allow Riley an opportunity to present evidence at a second evidentiary hearing. (C. 203.) Pro bono counsel argued in the motion that Rule 32 counsel had been ineffective in representing Riley during the Rule 32 proceedings, that a Rule 32 petitioner in Alabama is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel in Rule 32 proceedings, and that, therefore, Riley was entitled to, essentially, restart the Rule 32 proceedings with pro bono counsel representing him. Also on September 26, 2016, Rule 32 counsel filed a second motion to withdraw from representing Riley and a motion for an extension of time to file a response to the State's proposed order. On September 27, 2016, the circuit court issued an order denying pro bono counsel's motion to restart the Rule 32 proceedings, denying Rule 32 counsel's motion to withdraw, and granting Rule 32 counsel's motion for an extension of time. On October 6, 2016, Rule 32 counsel filed a response to the State's proposed order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 13, 2016, the circuit court issued an order denying Riley's Rule 32 petition. The circuit court adopted by reference the findings in the State's proposed order, a copy of which the court attached to its order, and made additional findings regarding two of the claims raised in Riley's petition. The circuit court found that Riley had failed to prove his claims at the evidentiary hearing, had abandoned his claims at the evidentiary hearing by failing to present any evidence, and/or that Riley's claims were meritless. On November 14, 2016, Rule 32 counsel filed a motion to reconsider the circuit court's ruling, arguing that the circuit court had erred in denying Riley's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, and filed a third motion to withdraw.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same day, pro bono\n   counsel also filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that the circuit court had erred in adopting the State's proposed order and in not allowing Riley to amend his petition after the evidentiary hearing when, he said, Riley's Rule 32 counsel had been ineffective. The motions to reconsider were denied by operation of law the day they were filed. See\n   <em>\n    Loggins v.

(Issues I and IV.A. in Riley's brief.) This issue is also not properly before this Court for review because it was not properly raised in the circuit court. Pro bono counsel raised this issue in his \"Motion for Adequate Opportunity to Litigate Claims in Rule 32 Petition\" and his postjudgment motion to reconsider. However, because the record contains no ruling by the circuit court granting pro bono counsel pro hac vice status, those filings are a nullity. See\n   <em>\n    Black v. Baptist Medical Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7533435\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/575/1087/#p1089\">\n    575 So.2d 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1089 (Ala. 1991). Rule 32 counsel never raised this issue in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In any event, even if this issue had been properly raised in the circuit court, it is meritless. Riley makes two interrelated arguments regarding the circuit court's refusal to allow pro bono counsel an opportunity to investigate Riley's case and to file a second amended petition on his behalf and\n   to conduct an evidentiary hearing on that second amended petition. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, Riley argues that the circuit court summarily dismissed his petition without an evidentiary hearing and that because pro bono counsel filed a motion to restart the proceedings and to amend the petition before the circuit court summarily dismissed the petition, there would have been no undue prejudice or undue delay in permitting pro bono counsel time to investigate and to file a second amended petition on Riley's behalf. This argument is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   According to Riley, the circuit court's citations throughout its order to Rule 32.\n   <em>\n    7\n   </em>\n   (d) instead of Rule 32.\n   <em>\n    9\n   </em>\n   (d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   clearly establish that the court's order was a summary dismissal of his claims without an evidentiary hearing on the ground that his claims were not sufficiently pleaded. We have carefully examined the circuit court's order, and it is clear and unambiguous-the circuit court denied Riley's petition on the grounds that he had failed to satisfy his burden of proof, that he had abandoned his claims at the evidentiary hearing by failing to present any evidence to support them, and/or that his claims were meritless. Throughout the order, the circuit found that Riley had \"failed to present any evidence,\" had \"failed to demonstrate\" ineffectiveness, or had \"failed to present any witnesses.\" Although the circuit court did mention, when addressing one of Riley's numerous claims, that the claim was based on conclusory allegations, the court ultimately denied that claim on the ground that Riley had failed to present any evidence at the evidentiary hearing to support the claim, not on the ground that it was insufficiently pleaded. Other than this single reference to conclusory allegations, the circuit court did not otherwise mention in its order the burden of pleading or state that Riley had not pleaded sufficient facts. Contrary to Riley's apparent belief, citation errors do not alter the nature of a circuit court's findings. Despite the erroneous citations to Rule 32.\n   <em>\n    7\n   </em>\n   (d), the circuit court's order was clearly an order denying Riley's petition pursuant to Rule 32.9(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Riley also argues that the hearing conducted on July 19, 2016, was not an evidentiary hearing because neither the State nor Rule 32 counsel presented any evidence at the hearing. The State, however, has no burden of proof in Rule 32 proceedings; therefore, its failure to present evidence at the July 19, 2016, hearing does not mean that the hearing was not an evidentiary hearing. Moreover, the fact that Rule 32 counsel presented no evidence at the hearing also does not mean that the hearing was not an evidentiary hearing. Indeed, Rule 32 counsel's failure to present evidence at the hearing is one of the grounds for Riley's argument, addressed in Part II.B. of this opinion, infra, that his Rule 32 counsel was ineffective. Riley cannot simultaneously argue that no evidentiary hearing was conducted and that Rule 32 counsel was ineffective for not presenting evidence at that evidentiary hearing. The record clearly reflects that the circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Riley's petition on July 19, 2016, during which Riley was afforded the opportunity to present evidence to prove the claims in his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We note that Riley's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Stringfellow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7509011\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/565/147/\">\n    565 So.2d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 1990), is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Stringfellow\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner filed his Rule 32 petition pro se, and the circuit court subsequently appointed counsel to represent him. Before the evidentiary hearing, appointed counsel moved to amend the petition, and the circuit court denied the request. The Alabama Supreme Court held that \"an attorney who is appointed after a defendant has filed a pro se petition should be allowed to amend the petition prior to the hearing if a legitimate issue arises that differs in substance from the allegations made by the defendant in the original petition.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7509011\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/565/147/\">\n    565 So.2d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This case is markedly different from\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Stringfellow\n   </em>\n   . In this case, Riley filed his petition pro se and counsel was appointed to represent him. Rule 32 counsel had ample opportunity to move to amend the petition or to file an amended petition before the evidentiary hearing, but did not do so. Riley then found different counsel to represent him, and over two months after the evidentiary hearing was conducted, pro bono counsel requested, not just to amend the petition, but to effectively restart the Rule 32 proceedings so that pro bono counsel could have time to investigate, to file a second amended petition, and to request discovery.

[566] U.S. at [17], 132 S.Ct. at 1320. In other words, if Rule 32 counsel is ineffective in representing a petitioner in the petitioner's first Rule 32 proceeding, the petitioner may use that ineffectiveness to avoid procedural default when filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.

The fact that Riley's Rule 32 counsel may have been ineffective during the Rule 32 proceedings may allow him to avoid procedural default when he files a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, but it does not entitle him to restart the Rule 32 proceedings with pro bono counsel after the circuit court had conducted an evidentiary hearing on his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we find no error on the part of the circuit court in denying Riley's petition without first allowing pro bono counsel an opportunity to investigate the case and to file a second amended petition and without conducting a second evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Riley also contends that the circuit court erred in \"dispos[ing] of all claims summarily under Rule 32.7(d)\" on the ground \"that his pleadings did not warrant an evidentiary hearing,\" because, he says, he \"sufficiently pleaded his claims and is, therefore, entitled to an evidentiary hearing under Rule 32.9.\" (Issue II in Riley's brief, p. 14.) Riley then reasserts in his brief on appeal each of the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims raised in his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As already explained in Part II.A. of this opinion, contrary to Riley's belief, the circuit court did not summarily dismiss his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel without an evidentiary hearing on the ground that they were insufficiently pleaded. The circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Riley's petition during which Riley had the opportunity to present evidence to support his claims. The circuit court's action in conducting an evidentiary hearing, in and of itself, establishes that the circuit court found that Riley's claims were sufficiently pleaded and raised material issues of law or fact. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ex parte McCall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7043569\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/30/400/#p404\">\n    30 So.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (Ala. 2008) (\"By holding that hearing, the circuit court implicitly found that the issues presented were 'material issue[s] of law or fact.\"). Moreover, after the hearing, the circuit court issued an order denying each of Riley's claims on the grounds that they were meritless, that Riley had failed to prove the claims, and/or that Riley had abandoned the claims at the evidentiary hearing by failing to present evidence. Because the circuit court did not summarily dismiss Riley's petition without an evidentiary hearing on the ground that his claims were not sufficiently pleaded, Riley's argument that all of his claims were sufficiently pleaded and entitled him to an evidentiary hearing is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We point out that Riley does not argue in his brief on appeal that the circuit court erred in finding that his claims were meritless, that he had failed to prove his claims, and/or that he had abandoned his claims at the evidentiary hearing. Because Riley makes no argument on appeal regarding the circuit court's actual findings regarding his claims, it is unnecessary for this Court to address the propriety of those findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Riley contends that the circuit court erred in denying his claims that the cumulative effect of his trial counsel's errors prejudiced him during both the guilt phase and the penalty phase of his trial. (Issue III in Riley's brief.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In its order, the circuit court rejected Riley's claims of cumulative effect on two grounds: (1) that Alabama does not recognize cumulative error in the context of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, and (2) that because Riley had failed to prove any of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel \"there is no cumulative effect to consider.\" (C. 238; see also C. 245.) Riley argues that the circuit court's first finding is erroneous because, he says,\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Riley argues that the circuit court's second finding is erroneous because, he says, the circuit court \"cannot rule on the ultimate merits of [his] cumulative-prejudice claims\" without first affording him an evidentiary hearing at which he is permitted to present evidence proving cumulative prejudice. Riley's arguments are meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The circuit court was correct that \"Alabama does not recognize a 'cumulative effect' analysis for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Carruth v.

We again reiterate that the circuit court did not, as Riley argues, summarily dismiss his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that they were insufficiently pleaded. Rather, as already noted, the circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing, during which Riley was, in fact, afforded an opportunity to prove his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, including his claims of cumulative error, and the court then found that Riley had failed to prove his claims, had abandoned his claims, and/or that his claims were meritless. Because the circuit court found that Riley had failed to prove that counsel had committed any errors at all, much less multiple errors, the circuit court correctly found that there can be no cumulative error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Therefore, the circuit court properly denied Riley's claims that the cumulative effect of his trial counsel's errors prejudiced him during both the guilt phase and the penalty phase of his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the circuit court denying Riley's Rule 32 petition is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Windom, P.J., and Welch, Burke, and Joiner, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The jury's penalty-phase verdict is no longer a recommendation.
