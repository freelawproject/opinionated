The insurer's summary-judgment motion was supported by the claimant's responses to the insurer's request for admissions; an incident report prepared by a representative of the St. Clair County Sheriff's Department on September 18, 2009, referencing September 8, 2009, as the date of the incident made the basis of the claimant's action; and a copy of an insurance policy certified by the insurer's custodian of records. The insurer asserted in its motion that the claimant had not satisfied the provision in the policy that required reporting of accidents to police within 24 hours thereof and that, under this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Alabama Farm Bureau Mutual Casualty Insurance Co. v. Cain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9577500\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/421/1281/\">\n    421 So.2d 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Civ. App. 1982), she was not entitled to UM benefits as a matter of law. The claimant moved to strike the incident report and the certified copy of the policy and contended that\n   <em>\n    Cain\n   </em>\n   was not consistent with\n   <em>\n    Walker v. GuideOne Specialty Mutual Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9349889\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/834/769/\">\n    834 So.2d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2002). The circuit court, after a hearing, entered a summary judgment adopting the insurer's position and referring to portions of the exhibits adduced by the insurer (i.e., implicitly denying the motion to strike). On June 22, 2018, this court issued a no-opinion order affirming that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The claimant has filed an application for a rehearing, asserting, among other things, that this court erred in affirming the circuit court's implicit denial of her motion to strike, which challenged the insurer's filing of the incident report and the certified copy of the insurance policy. However, to the extent that the claimant has argued that the incident report supplied by the insurer was not \"certified or otherwise authenticated,\" we note that the claimant admitted the pertinent facts contained in that report: that the incident made the basis of her claim had occurred on September 8, 2009, between 2:00 and 2:30 p.m., at the intersection of St. Clair County Roads 26 and 22; that the claimant's automobile did not come into contact with another vehicle, nor any sign, tree, fence, or other stationary object on the side of the road; that police, ambulance services, or paramedic services were not called to the scene of the incident; and that the claimant made an incident report to Officer Joey Brown of the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office on September 18, 2009. Thus, any error on the part of the circuit court in failing to strike the incident report on the grounds stated by the claimant was necessarily harmless and did not prejudice\n   the claimant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 45, Ala.

In\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   , which involved a mortgagor's attack on the propriety of a mortgagee bank's foreclosure of the pertinent mortgage, we concluded that the provisions of Rule 56(c) had been satisfied by an affiant's statements that, in her occupational position, she had had \" 'direct access to the books and records of [the bank] regarding the account which form[ed] the basis of th[e] action,' \" had \" 'personal knowledge of the facts set forth in [her affidavit],' \" had \" 'reviewed [the] relevant business books and records,' \" which had been \" 'made in the ordinary course of the [bank's] business' \" and which related \" 'to [the mortgagor's loan] ... at the time of the transaction, occurrence or event referred to therein or ... within a reasonable time thereafter,' \" and that those books and records had been \" 'kept under [her] care, supervision, and/or control.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003322\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/104/195/\">\n    104 So.3d at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Evid., provides that \"record[s] ... of ... events ... made ... by ... a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity [pursuant to] the regular practice of that business activity,\" are not excluded by the hearsay rule if testified to by the custodian, whereas authentication may occur under Rule 901(a), Ala. R. Evid., if evidence is adduced \"sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\" The custodian in this case testified that she was \"custodian of the records pertaining to issuance of policies,\" indicating regular conduct of business on the part of the insurer to issue insurance policies, and\n   that the insurer issued the attached policy of insurance to the claimant and her husband applicable to occurrences between May 12, 2009, and November 1, 2009. Further, the exhibit to the certification contains a number of documents containing typical insurance-policy provisions and bearing the insurer's distinctive trademarks and expressly states that \"[t]his policy is issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.\" We thus agree that\n   <em>\n    Royal Insurance Co. of America v.

By statute, as the circuit court's judgment observed, drivers of automobiles involved in \"an accident resulting in injury to ... any person shall immediately by the quickest means of communication give notice of such accident to ... the office of the county sheriff or to the state highway patrol\" if the accident occurs outside municipal limits, Ala.

As Justice Houston correctly noted in his special writing in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , \"[n]othing in Alabama law [made the insured's] testimony incompetent; for an insurer to attempt to do so and to thereby deprive [the insured] of a claim under her uninsured-motorist coverage is in derogation of \u00a7 32-7-23[, Ala.

Although Rule 53 does not require an appellate court to set forth its basis for so ruling (apart from subsection (b), which mandates only that Rule 53(a)(1) and the applicable subsection of Rule 53(a)(2) be specified), this court, as has been appropriate and as a courtesy to litigants and the judiciary, has routinely included a short statement of additional authorities upon which this court has relied in affirming the pertinent judgment.

Counsel's insistence that the parties in this case were \"due more\" than an order of affirmance thus ignores both the text of Rule 53 and the additional authorities provided by this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rule 53 has been in effect for more than a quarter of a century, striking a balance between the parallel duties of appellate judges under the Alabama Canons of Judicial Ethics to be faithful to the law and to dispose promptly of the business of the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Canon 3A, Alabama Canons of Jud. Ethics;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Order of the Supreme Court Adopting Appellate Court Time Standards dated April 10, 1995 (espousing 290-day period for intermediate appellate courts to resolve majority of cases).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the United States Supreme Court, which grants plenary review in approximately 80 cases out of the approximately 7,000 to 8,000 cases brought before the Court each year,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   this court is not afforded discretion to decline to decide the great majority of cases brought before it; further, and contrary to the earnest beliefs of counsel, not every case presented to this court is\n   <em>\n    res integra\n   </em>\n   warranting a published opinion. Rule 53 recognizes both of those truths, and although I agree with the reasoning set forth in the opinion to overrule the application, I believe that Rule 53 was properly applied in this case upon its original submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thomas, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The court's June 22, 2018, order of affirmance in this case was issued within the 290-day time standard adopted by our supreme court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    On the date this court's opinion on rehearing was issued, this information could be found at\n    <em>\n     https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justicecaseload.aspx\n    </em>\n    .
