On August 26, 2016, Tim and Brenda Thornton obtained a divorce in the Pike County Chancery Court. The chancellor entered an order distributing the marital property and awarding alimony to Brenda. Brenda appeals the chancellor's judgment and raises seven assignments of error: (1) whether the chancellor analyzed the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v. Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328359\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/921/#p928\">\n    639 So.2d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 928 (Miss. 1994), when he distributed the marital property; (2) whether the chancellor erred in his distribution of Tim's Sanderson Farms retirement account; (3) whether the chancellor erred in not awarding Brenda lump sum alimony; (4) whether Brenda should be charged with paying the outstanding loan on a 2009 Dodge Ram; (5) whether the chancellor should have classified and equitably divided\n   the $90,000 insurance policy; (6) whether the chancellor erred in crediting Tim with $1,600 in child support payments; and (7) whether the nature of the entire award by the chancellor can be considered equitable. Finding error, we reverse and remand the chancellor's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Tim and Brenda Thornton were married on February 26, 2000. They separated on June 9, 2014. Their union resulted in two children. Tim works as a supervisor at Sanderson Farms, and did so at the time of the chancellor's decision. Brenda is disabled and unemployed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Brenda filed a motion for divorce on August 19, 2015, on the grounds of adultery or, in the alternative, habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, desertion, or irreconcilable differences. The trial court entered a temporary order on November 2, 2015, ordering Tim to pay child support in the amount of seven hundred dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. The matter was heard on August 3, 2016. While in chancery court, Tim's attorney disclosed to the court that Tim had committed adultery and was willing to admit those allegations to the court. A judgment was entered by the chancellor on August 26, 2016, granting Brenda a divorce on the ground of adultery. The chancellor also determined that Tim failed to pay the previously ordered child support on time and found him in contempt. Furthermore, the record reflects that the chancellor altered the child support payments to six hundred and seventy-eight dollars per month until the children reach the age of twenty-one or are emancipated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The record reflects a lack of appraisal of the marital property by either party. During the hearing on August 3, 2016, Tim agreed to Brenda's estimation of value for the marital home at $112,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The tax appraisal proposed by the new attorney of record for Brenda set the home's value at $56,699. The chancellor determined the value of the marital home to be $84,349.50, leaving the equity value of the home at $32,633.80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. The record indicates the chancellor listed and considered the marital property - both real and personal - in his determination of an equitable distribution. The chancellor ordered that $7,123.90 be transferred from Tim's retirement account to Brenda. Concerning the vehicles purchased during the marriage, the chancellor found that a 2000 Dodge Durango and a 2015 Chrysler 2000 would be the sole property of Tim, while Brenda would retain the 2009 Dodge Ram for her own personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Concerning the parties' personal property, the chancellor divided it as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-17\">(I) Timothy Thornton Sr. A. Samsung Refrigerator $ 1,000.00 B. Bedroom/Living Room Set (purchased post-separation) $ 1,200.00 C. Collectibles $ 6,500.00 D. Airbrush Equipment $ 1,500.00 E. Vizio Home System $ 400.00 F. Craftsman Cutter and Weed Eater $ 450.00 G. DVD Collection $ 2,000.00 H. Car Stereo and Amp $ 1,000.00 I. <em>2000 Dodge Durango</em> $ <em>950.00</em> TOTAL $15,000.00 (II) Brenda Harness Thornton A. Whirlpool Stove $ 200.00 B. 55\" Samsung TV $ 400.00 C. Stainless Steel Refrigerator $ 300.00 D. 5 Bedroom Sets $ 3,000.00 E. Home Entertainment $ 400.00 F. Living Room Suite $ 1,500.00 G. 4 TVs $ 1,200.00 H. <em>2009 Dodge Truck (net value)</em> $<em>14,800.00</em> TOTAL $21,800.00</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. While the record does reflect the chancellor's intention in distributing the marital property, the chancellor does not mention the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328359\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/921/#p928\">\n    639 So.2d at 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the record is silent on the chancellor's reasoning behind the distribution except for one line of the judgment entered on August 26, 2016: \"[T]he [c]ourt finds that based upon the testimony and the estimated values of personal and real property that the division is equitable. The [c]ourt also took into consideration the adulterous affair by [Tim].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. Regardless of the omission of the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors, the chancellor specifically outlined the\n   <em>\n    Hemsley\n   </em>\n   factors in the question of alimony.\n   <em>\n    Hemsley v. Hemsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328133\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/909/#p913\">\n    639 So.2d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913 (Miss. 1994). The record reflects a thorough analysis of the factors under\n   <em>\n    Hemsley\n   </em>\n   , supporting the chancellor's decision to find that Brenda was entitled to permanent alimony in the amount of $200 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. On September 6, 2016, Brenda filed a timely motion to reconsider the judgment or to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure 52(b) and 59(e), respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 31, 2016, Brenda filed a Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the judgment, claiming that Tim committed fraud on the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. On November 10, 2016, the chancellor held a hearing on Brenda's motion to reconsider or to alter or amend the judgment. During the hearing, the chancellor declined to address Brenda's Rule 60(b) motion at that time, explaining that \"you have to have a final judgment in place before you can set it aside.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. After the hearing, the chancellor entered an order on November 21, 2016, amending the final judgment in part. The chancellor deemed the child-support award to be inaccurate and amended the amount of child support to $737 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After noticing his error in not setting forth a start date for child-support payments, the chancellor ordered that the child-support payments be made on the first day of each month. The chancellor also increased the award of permanent alimony to $250 per month. Regarding Brenda's Rule 60(b) motion, the chancellor opined that it was not ripe for hearing in his opinion and therefore postponed ruling on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. Regarding the issues not specifically addressed in his order, the chancellor held that \"all remaining terms and provisions of the [j]udgment dated August 26, 2016 will remain in full force and effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. On December 1, 2016, Brenda filed a petition asking that the chancellor find Tim in contempt of court. Brenda claimed that Tim failed to provide her with the transportation she was ordered to receive in the temporary order and failed to pay her attorney's fees in the sum of $4,000. Furthermore, Brenda claimed that Tim failed to pay any child support or alimony for the months of September, October, November, or December of 2016, leaving him in arrears in the amount of $2,948 for child support and $1,000 for alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15. On December 19, 2016, Brenda filed a timely notice appealing the chancellor's August 26, 2016 final judgment and the November 21, 2016 order partially amending the judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16. On April 7, 2017, several months after Brenda filed her notice of appeal in this matter, the chancellor entered an order determining that Tim was not in contempt and declining to rule on Brenda's Rule 60(b) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17. The Mississippi Supreme Court has long held that a chancellor's findings of fact will not be disturbed unless they are manifestly wrong or clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Sanderson v. Sanderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437680\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/824/623/#p625\">\n    824 So.2d 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (\u00b6 8) (Miss. 2002). Specifically in cases concerning alimony, the chancellor's decision \"will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is found to be against the overwhelming weight of the evidence or manifestly in error.\"\n   <em>\n    Tilley v. Tilley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7482920\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/610/348/#p351\">\n    610 So.2d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351 (Miss. 1992). Likewise, when the equitable division of the marital estate is at issue, the Court has determined that \"the chancellor's ruling on the division and distribution will be upheld if it is supported by substantial creditable evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Mabus v. Mabus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046321\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/890/806/#p824\">\n    890 So.2d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824 (\u00b6 72) (Miss. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18. As stated, Brenda presents seven issues on appeal: (1) whether the chancellor analyzed the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   when he distributed the marital property; (2) whether the chancellor erred in his distribution of Tim's Sanderson Farms retirement account; (3) whether the chancellor erred in not awarding Brenda lump sum alimony; (4) whether Brenda should be charged with paying the outstanding loan on the 2009 Dodge Ram; (5) whether the chancellor should have classified and equitably divided the $90,000 insurance policy; (6) whether the chancellor erred in crediting Tim with $1,600 in child-support payments; (7) whether the nature of the entire award by the chancellor can be considered equitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 19. In her appellate brief, Brenda refers to issues set forth in an order entered by the chancellor nearly four months after she filed her notice of appeal. In this April 7, 2017 order, the chancellor declined to rule on Brenda's Rule 60(b) motion in which Brenda asserted that Tim committed fraud upon the court regarding the loan on the 2009 Dodge Ram and also denied her petition asking that the chancellor find Tim in contempt. The chancellor declined to rule on the Rule 60(b) motion and stated that he \"would hear the Rule 60(b) [motion] after it returns from the appellate court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20. Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c) requires the notice of appeal to designate as a whole or in part the judgment or order from which appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Brenda's notice of appeal only specifies that she is appealing the final judgment and order partially granting her motion for reconsideration, Brenda's appellate brief also discusses issues pertaining to her Rule 60(b) motion and petition for contempt. The chancellor disposed of Brenda's petition for contempt in an order entered after Brenda filed her notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21. \"Ordinarily, once a notice of appeal is filed, jurisdiction transfers from the trial court to the appellate court, thereby removing the trial court's authority to amend, modify, or reconsider its judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    McNeese v. McNeese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7256933\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/129/125/#p128\">\n    129 So.3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. 2013). However, Rule 60 \"confer[s] limited concurrent jurisdiction\n   on the trial court to grant relief from a judgment even though an appeal has been perfected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7256933\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/129/125/#p128\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 8) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

As long as a party complies with the requirements of Rule 60(b), the trial court retains authority to entertain a Rule 60(b) motion in the action, even after a notice of appeal has been filed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7445831\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/679/1049/#p1050\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Brenda timely filed her Rule 60(b) motion in the trial court \"not more than six months after the judgment.\" M.R.C.P. 60(b) ;\n   <em>\n    McNeese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7256933\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/129/125/#p128\">\n    129 So.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the chancellor herein maintained jurisdiction to rule on Brenda's Rule 60(b) motion. The supreme court has held that in cases \"where ... the Rule 60 motion is filed and disposed of within the time allowed for appeal from the underlying judgment and the notice of appeal speaks to the judgment and the order disposing of the motion, one notice of appeal is sufficient to bring to this court both the judgment and the Rule 60 order.\"\n   <em>\n    Brame v. Brame\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476290\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/796/970/#p973\">\n    796 So.2d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 973 (\u00b6 11) (Miss. 2001). However, because the chancellor declined to rule on the Rule 60(b) motion after Brenda filed her notice of appeal, Brenda's related assignments of error are not properly before us and should have been raised in a separate notice of appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476290\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/796/970/#p973\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 22. Additionally, regarding Brenda's assignment of error attacking the chancellor's ruling on her petition for contempt, we recognize that \"[a]lthough contempt proceedings in divorce cases often are filed in the same cause number and proceed with the underlying divorce case, they are held to be separate actions, requiring new and special summons under Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure 81.\"\n   <em>\n    Shavers v. Shavers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8241669\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/982/397/#p402\">\n    982 So.2d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402 (\u00b6 25) (Miss. 2008). We therefore find that Brenda's argument regarding the contempt proceedings is not properly before this Court because \"the contempt action [is] separate from the divorce judgment cited in the notice of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Williamson v. Williamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013737\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/81/262/#p277\">\n    81 So.3d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 (\u00b6 34) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012). We now turn to address Brenda's other issues before us on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 23. Brenda's remaining claims are extensive and overlapping. Because issues 1, 2, and 5 all hinge on the chancellor's distribution of property under\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , we will consider them together as one issue. Brenda first claims that the chancellor failed to consider her contributions as a homemaker and breadwinner in the property distribution because the chancellor failed to provide on-the-record findings as to the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors. She further claims that this led to the chancellor failing to properly categorize and divide the Sanderson Farms retirement account and insurance policy valued at $90,000. Additionally, Brenda claims that this omission of a proper\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   analysis leaves the chancellor's distribution in question on the grounds of equity. Finally, Brenda claims that she should not be charged with the $4,000 remaining loan on the 2009 Dodge Ram that she was awarded in the divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 24. The record reveals that although the chancellor articulated the factors in tests like\n   <em>\n    Albright v. Albright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7640199\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/437/1003/#p1005\">\n    437 So.2d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1005 (Miss. 1983), and\n   <em>\n    Hemsley\n   </em>\n   , 639 So.2d at 913, when determining child custody and alimony, the record does not indicate any specific analysis by the chancellor regarding the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   to support the chancellor's equitable\n   division of marital property or the findings set forth. As a result, the record fails to show how the chancellor applied the law and factors to the facts of this case when dividing the marital property. The judgment entered on August 26, 2016, simply states: \"The [c]ourt finds that based upon the testimony and the estimated values of personal and real property that the division is equitable. The [c]ourt also took into consideration the adulterous affair by [Tim],\" but there is no mention of the specific factors. While the chancellor distributed the property in the judgment, the chancellor failed to provide any on-the-record findings or analysis utilizing the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors to explain how he came to his distribution and for this Court to review on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 25.

Even though this Court has found that the specific analysis demanded in\n   <em>\n    Lowrey\n   </em>\n   is not always appropriate, the record is silent as to the chancellor's basis, relative to the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors, for the distribution of marital property in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 28.

The majority and I seem to agree that the \"relevant facts\" require a certain substance - those facts drawn from considering the relevant\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors when dividing the marital assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v.

The majority finds that the chancellor\n   <em>\n    extensively considered\n   </em>\n   the distribution of marital property, and I agree. But, the majority fails to determine that this satisfies \"consider[ing] the relevant facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Seghini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7044872\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/42/635/#p641\">\n    42 So.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 21). Essentially the majority determines to reverse the chancellor's judgment because the record lacks explicit and specific mention to any of the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , 639 So.2d at 928. With this reasoning, the majority finds that the chancellor's judgment cannot reflect a consideration of the relevant\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors without explicitly analyzing them on the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 34. This Court has the authority to review the record to determine if the chancellor's division recognizes a consideration of the substance intended by the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors, even absent an explicit\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   factor analysis.\n   <em>\n    Seghini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7044872\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/42/635/#p641\">\n    42 So.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 21). Thus, in reviewing, I find that the chancellor's extensive consideration reflects this, although he does not explicitly mention these factors on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 35. Similar to this Court's determination in\n   <em>\n    Seghini\n   </em>\n   , the record supports that\n   the chancellor extensively considered the estimated value of the marital assets based on the parties' 8.05 financial statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seghini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7044872\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/42/635/#p641\">\n    42 So.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 21) (finding that chancellor did consider relevant facts when he considered marital property provided on parties' 8.05 financial statements, property's estimated value, and whether parties disputed that property was marital). The record also indicates that the chancellor heard extensive testimony regarding the parties' economic and domestic contributions to the marriage, financial and health needs, disability, tax consequences, and contributions to the stability of the home and marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 36. The\n   <em>\n    Lowrey\n   </em>\n   requirement intends \"to assist in the accuracy of [the trial court's] rulings ... [and] reduce[ ] unintended errors that may affect the court's ultimate decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lowrey v.

In our case, the parties shared less than twenty marital assets, and they provided valuations to nearly all assets listed on the respective 8.05 financial statements. This together with the extensive trial testimony indicates that it was not necessary for the chancellor to conduct a full, on-the-record\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   analysis to convey his substantial consideration of those factors. Remanding this case for the chancellor to write out his analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   factors will be a wasteful and unnecessary exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 37. I respectfully find that reversal is not warranted, and thus remand is judicially inefficient. I would affirm the chancellor's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   FAIR AND GREENLEE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
