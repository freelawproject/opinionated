Looking only at the information in this case, we cannot conclude one way or the other whether the State based the two charged counts (one for solicitation and one for travel following solicitation) on the same solicitation. In this circumstance,\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   requires that we reverse the lesser conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Winokur and Winsor, JJ., concur; Makar, J., concurs in result only.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
