A little more than a year after their divorce, Dallas Pevey sued his ex-wife, Marie Black, to modify the custody of their two children. The chancellor initially denied relief, but he expressed reservations with the decision. When Dallas filed a motion to reconsider, the chancery court gave him a hearing and heard additional testimony. Ultimately, the chancery court found that Marie had testified falsely at the initial hearing, and custody of the children was awarded to Dallas. Marie appeals\n   and asserts numerous errors, both procedural and substantive. We find that the chancery court acted within its discretion, and so we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Dallas and Marie divorced in 2014. Physical custody of their two young sons, born in 2008 and 2011, was awarded to Marie by agreement. In 2015, Dallas filed a petition to modify custody. Dallas alleged, among other things, that Marie was using illegal drugs, acting erratically, moving around frequently, and was not adequately caring for the children. After a hearing, the chancery court called it a \"close case\" and expressed concerns about the children's circumstances, but it found Dallas had failed to show a material change of circumstances adversely affecting the children. Dallas then filed what he styled a \"Motion to Reconsider or, in the Alternative, to Amend Judgment pursuant to Rules 59 and 60\" of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. Dallas contended he had newly discovered evidence and Marie had made numerous false statements at the hearing relating to her employment, living situation, and drug use. The chancery court held a hearing on the motion where it heard additional testimony and then rendered a new decision, awarding custody to Dallas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Motion to Reconsider\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3. Marie contends that the chancery court erred in granting Dallas's \"motion to reconsider\" because the claimed newly discovered evidence was lacking and could have been presented at the original hearing. Marie argues, essentially, that the chancery court gave Dallas a \"do over\" rather than holding him to the stricter standard that Rule 59 requires. But she is wrong about that legal standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4. It is true that, under the \"new\" Rules of Civil Procedure, the motion for reconsideration technically no longer exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maness v.

But the motion at issue here was properly made, and considered, under Rule 59.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203791250\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5. The chancery court's authority to modify the final judgment is \"limited\" by Rule 59, and it is a \"higher\" standard than under Rule 54(b), which allows a trial court to set aside interlocutory decisions for any reason it sees just.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 419-20 (\u00b6\u00b6 69, 71),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203791250\">\n    2018 WL 3791250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 (\u00b6\u00b6 69, 71). Still, Rule 59 permits a chancery court substantial discretion to reconsider its decisions-either on the motion of a party, or sua sponte \"for any reason for which it might have granted a new trial on motion of a party.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.C.P. 59(d).

Although Rule 59(a) refers to a \"new trial,\" when a case was tried to the court, the formality of a full retrial is not required.

Sitting as an appellate court, we are in no position to second guess the chancellor on whether he made an error in his initial credibility determinations.

Guardian Ad Litem Recommendation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11. Next, Marie contends that the chancellor erred in not considering the\n   recommendation of the guardian ad litem. In fact, there was no recommendation to consider; the guardian ad litem in this case was appointed for the limited purpose of investigating Dallas's allegations of abuse and neglect. The guardian ad litem concluded that the children had been neither abused nor neglected while in Marie's care. But he specifically declined to make recommendations as to whether a material change in circumstances had occurred or who should receive custody if that became an issue, though he did answer some questions that touched on those issues. Marie's attorney asked the guardian ad litem whether he knew of \"anything that is currently happening\" that would justify a modification of custody. The guardian ad litem answered \"no,\" but he made it clear he was limiting his answer to the current circumstances. The chancellor also asked the guardian ad litem whether there were any \"per se\" adverse impacts to the children. The answer to this question was a qualified yes. The guardian ad litem was concerned that one of the children had been tardy to school twenty-six times during a single semester, though he conceded that others may not weigh it as heavily as he did. When the chancellor announced his initial decision in this matter, he briefly addressed the tardiness issue, but he did not fully summarize the guardian ad litem's testimony or address it as a custody recommendation. In announcing the judgment on reconsideration, the chancellor only briefly referenced the guardian ad litem's testimony, to the effect that, even if it was accepted, it did not foreclose the possibility of modifying custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12. The Mississippi Supreme Court has held that the chancellor is required to include a summary of the guardian ad litem's recommendations when the appointment is mandatory, as it is in cases where abuse or neglect has been alleged.\n   <em>\n    Borden v. Borden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6862218\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/167/238/#p243\">\n    167 So.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243 (\u00b6 11) (Miss. 2014). But the supreme court has also made it clear that a chancellor has discretion in determining the scope of the guardian ad litem's assignment, and the assignment need not include making a recommendation as to custody. In\n   <em>\n    S.G. v. D.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7055902\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/13/269/#p282\">\n    13 So.3d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282 (\u00b6 57) (Miss. 2009), the supreme court explained: \"[A] guardian ad litem appointed to investigate and report to the court is obligated to investigate the allegations before the court, process the information found, report all material information to the court, and (if requested) make a recommendation.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Where the guardian ad litem has not made direct recommendations concerning custody, there is no error in the chancellor's failure to discuss them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181489\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/206/502/#p510\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181489\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/206/502/#p510\">\n    at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13. The guardian ad litem here was assigned to investigate whether the children were abused or neglected in Marie's care; he found that they were not. The chancellor accepted that conclusion, and Marie does not contest it. We can find no error in the chancellor's failure to discuss the guardian ad litem's report at length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Admission of Annotated E-mail\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14. Marie contends that the chancellor erred in refusing to admit into evidence a copy of an e-mail with handwritten notes from Marie's mother. She concedes that the notes are hearsay, but she contends they were admissible under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(A) and (B), which allow the admission of prior statements as non-hearsay under certain circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15. It is apparent that the printout and annotations meet neither exclusion to the\n   hearsay rule. Rule 801(d)(1)(A) requires (among other things) that the prior statement \"be given under penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition.\" The handwritten annotations to the e-mail were not. 801(d)(1)(B) requires that the statement be \"consistent with the declarant's testimony\" and offered to rebut a contention of recent fabrication; Marie offered the annotated e-mail to\n   <em>\n    support\n   </em>\n   her claim that her mother's testimony was a recent fabrication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16. Marie has shown no error in the chancellor's refusal to admit the annotated e-mail into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Modification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17. Marie next challenges the chancellor's decision to modify custody. In this issue she does not directly contend that the evidence could not support the decision; rather, she attacks various aspects of the chancellor's decision, some based on fact and some based on law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18.

The chancellor cited\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   for the general standard regarding modification of custody-a material change of circumstances and an adverse effect on the child-and\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   for a specific exception to the general test permitting modification \"where a child living in a custodial environment clearly adverse to the child's best interest, somehow appears to remain unscarred by his or her surroundings.\"\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7432889\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/677/740/#p744\">\n    677 So.2d at 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The chancellor found that this case met the standard for modification under either test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20. The chancellor gave no indication that he misunderstood the legal standard or that he gave the cases he mentioned by name any undue weight as to their particular facts or holdings. Rather, he cited them for the principles of law they discussed. Marie seems to complain the chancellor failed to recognize that custody modification requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances, which she claims was a later development in the law; but, in fact, that was part of\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   's holding and a proposition for which it is often cited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7640925\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/453/1294/\">\n    453 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1297 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.M.L. v. J.W.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7032820\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/98/1001/#p1013\">\n    98 So.3d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1013 (\u00b6 24) (Miss. 2012) (citing\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ). We see no error in the chancellor's citation to these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21. Marie next argues the chancellor erred in finding the testimony of her mother credible because she had previously\n   executed an affidavit supportive of Marie's home conditions and parenting ability; her mother subsequently described herself as the children's primary caregiver (when she and Marie were getting along) and Marie as unstable and manipulative. Marie also faults the chancellor for accepting the testimony of Justin Atwood to the effect that they had been in a sexual relationship and had spent the night together in the children's presence; Marie denied this allegation, but one of her children confirmed to the chancellor\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   that he knew Atwood and Marie \"had a relationship\" because he had walked in on them in what the chancellor called a \"compromising position.\" On appeal, Marie takes issue with this description, arguing that the chancellor made an unsupported inference from the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22. Specifically, the child testified that Marie and Atwood were \"about to kiss\" while Atwood \"had his underwear on and all of that.\" When the child opened the door, Atwood \"did it real fast and hid something from me or something like that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23. It is axiomatic that \"the chancellor, as the trier of fact, is the judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of their testimony, as well as the interpretation of evidence where it is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Bowen v. Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8241556\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/982/385/#p395\">\n    982 So. 2d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395 (\u00b6 42) (Miss. 2008). We find that the chancellor's interpretation of the child's testimony, especially when paired with Atwood's testimony confirming a sexual relationship with Marie, was a reasonable interpretation of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24. As to the prior affidavits executed by Atwood and Marie's mother, inconsistent statements of a witness go to the weight of that witness's testimony, not its sufficiency.\n   <em>\n    Jamison v. Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401440\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/8/238/#p245\">\n    8 So.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245 (\u00b6 17) (Miss. Ct. App. 2008). Both witnesses explained why they had executed the affidavits and subsequently recanted them, and their testimony at trial was corroborated in many respects. We cannot second guess the chancellor's determination of credibility here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25. Finally, Marie contends that the chancellor erred in assigning undue weight to moral fitness in his\n   <em>\n    Albright\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   factor analysis to decide who should receive custody.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brekeen v. Brekeen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9201713\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/880/280/#p286\">\n    880 So.2d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 286-87 (\u00b6 19) (Miss. 2004). Here, the chancellor did discuss Marie's relationships at length, and he did find that they negatively impacted her moral fitness; but moral fitness was not the reason the chancellor spent so much time discussing them. In the case of Atwood, the chancellor found the relationship relevant because the children had been exposed to it. But the chancellor was especially interested in it because Marie had repeatedly lied about her relationship with Atwood while under oath, and the credibility of her denials of other misconduct was of paramount importance to the ultimate disposition of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26. The chancellor also discussed another of Marie's relationships, but in that case the man was a drug addict who saw Marie between his visits to rehab. He testified that he and Marie had used crystal methamphetamine while Marie's mother watched the children. The chancellor found the man's testimony credible, and he placed significant emphasis on Marie's association with the man and use of illegal drugs as both a material change of circumstances and an indictment of her fitness as a custodial parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27. We note also that the chancellor did not linger on these relationships when discussing the moral fitness\n   <em>\n    Albright\n   </em>\n   factor. The entirety of his moral fitness discussion follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Moral fitness is not even [a] close contest. [Marie] has exposed the children to immorality with her relationships with other men. She has consorted with a drug addict. She has in all probability been using illicit substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28. The credibility of Marie's denials of misconduct, instability, and poor parenting was one of the central issues in the trial, and her abuse of drugs was highly relevant to her fitness as a custodial parent. We cannot find that the chancellor placed an undue emphasis on moral fitness or that the chancellor awarded custody to Dallas to punish Marie for immoral behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29. In summary, Marie has not shown an abuse of discretion in the chancellor's decision to modify custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Denial of Marie's Post-Judgment Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30. After announcing his decision from the bench, the chancellor asked Dallas's attorney to prepare a written judgment, which the chancellor ultimately executed and entered with minor changes; the decision from the bench was incorporated by reference. Marie moved, unsuccessfully, to have the written judgment amended to more strictly comport with the chancellor's findings and decision as he had announced them from the bench. She also filed a motion seeking additional findings of fact and conclusions on fifty-five enumerated points, several of which contained numerous sub-requests. The motion was denied, and Marie filed a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment, which was also denied. On appeal, Marie contends that the chancellor erred in denying these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31. It is a well-established rule in equity that \"every decree is in the breast of the court until entered, and a decree has no validity until written out and signed by the chancellor.\"\n   <em>\n    Banks v. Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7567097,7567225,7567157\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/511/933/\">\n    511 So.2d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 934 (Miss. 1987) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Orr v. Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858417\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/223/856/#p862\">\n    223 Miss. 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 862,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858417\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/223/856/#p862\">\n    79 So.2d 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 278 (1955) ).\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   is directly on point in this respect; the Mississippi Supreme Court held that a chancellor could modify his oral pronouncements at will prior to the entry of a written final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858417\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/223/856/#p862\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858417\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/223/856/#p862\">\n    at 934-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, where the written judgment varies from the court's oral pronouncements, the written judgment controls and is presumptively the chancellor's true decision. This is true even if it was prepared by one of the parties rather than the chancellor himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bluewater Logistics LLC v. Williford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7031071\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/148/#p155\">\n    55 So.3d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155-57 (\u00b6\u00b6 24-33) (Miss. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 32. Marie also complains that the chancellor erred in not hearing her out as to these complaints; the chancellor summarily denied her \"Motion for Proposed Judgments.\" Marie provides no authority requiring the chancellor to hold a hearing on the motion, and we are aware of none; so we cannot find any error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 33. As to Marie's numerous requests for clarification or additional findings of fact, on appeal she only addresses two specific alleged deficiencies. First, she contends that the chancellor failed to specifically identify the material change in circumstances that warranted the change in custody. There is some merit to this contention, as the chancellor appears to have discussed both the material changes and their impacts on the children simultaneously, with the express findings being harmful impacts rather than material changes. But the chancellor's meaning is clear when the opinion is read as a whole, and the chancellor identified changed circumstances he found, in the aggregate, to\n   be material and adversely affecting the children-Marie's household was unstable, she was using illegal drugs, and she was not properly caring for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 34. Marie's other complaint is that the chancellor failed to \"completely make distinct findings related to the\n   <em>\n    Albright\n   </em>\n   factors\"; Marie contends the chancellor was required to address each of the\n   <em>\n    Albright\n   </em>\n   factors. But she does not explain which factors the chancellor failed to consider or how that alleged failure would have affected the outcome of the case. The only applicable factors we can see that the chancellor did not expressly address are continuity of care and the health and age of the parents. The former, though it favored Marie, was discussed at great length in the chancellor's analysis of whether there had been a material change of circumstances-the chancellor concluded that living in Marie's home had been detrimental to the children. As to the age and health of the parents, Dallas and Marie appear to have been similarly situated such that the factor favored neither parent, with the possible exception of Marie's drug use-something the chancellor considered elsewhere and found to favor Dallas. \"[T]he\n   <em>\n    Albright\n   </em>\n   factors exist to ensure the chancellor considers all the relevant facts before she reaches a decision\" regarding the children's best interest.\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Blakely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7022198\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/88/798/#p803\">\n    88 So.3d 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803 (\u00b6 17) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012). We are satisfied the chancellor did consider all the relevant facts here, and so we will not disturb the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 35. As to the remaining requests for findings of fact, we see no abuse of discretion in the chancellor's refusal to make further findings. A chancery court \"has technically complied with the mandates of Rule 52 where it makes general findings of fact and conclusions of law although requested by a party to make specific findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Lowery v. Lowery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7435802\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/657/817/#p819\">\n    657 So.2d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819 (Miss. 1995). The chancellor's opinion, as delivered from the bench, spans more than ten pages of the transcript, and, in our judgment, it adequately addresses the issues that were before the court. The chancellor resolved the major factual disputes explicitly and cited and employed the relevant standards for modification and custody. We can find no error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 36. Finally, as to Marie's Rule 59 motion, there was only one piece of what was arguably new evidence before the court. After announcing his decision from the bench, but before entering the final judgment, the chancellor ordered Marie to immediately submit to testing for illegal drug use. Both hair and urine were tested, and the results were consistently negative for methamphetamine. But Marie did test positive for the opioids hydrocodone and oxycodone, and she apparently did not have a current prescription for either. She filed a letter from a doctor saying she had a prescription the prior year for a drug that included oxycodone, but that was at least five months before the drug test. As we explained above, our review of the denial of a Rule 59 motion is extremely deferential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7610136\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/474/577/#p582\">\n    474 So.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (Miss. 1985). We can find no error with regard to newly discovered evidence. Otherwise, Marie's Rule 59 motion tracked the same issues she has raised on appeal, and as we find the contentions without merit here, we can find no abuse of discretion in the chancery court's denial of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Visitation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 37. Finally, Marie contends that the chancellor erred in \"altering visitation provisions ... without evidence being presented.\" Essentially, she contends that the chancellor was required to award her the same visitation schedule and terms as she had agreed to give Dallas in the original\n   divorce settlement. We are aware of no authority requiring this, and Marie provides us with none. Moreover, the visitation provisions are quite similar, and Marie was awarded more or less \"standard\" visitation with the children-visitation every other weekend, two two-week periods of extended summer visitation, and alternating holidays. No error has been shown on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 38.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LEE, C.J., IRVING AND GRIFFIS, P.JJ., BARNES, CARLTON, WILSON, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <em>\n     Albright v.
