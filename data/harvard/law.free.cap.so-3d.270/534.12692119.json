The Sammons' counsel filed a suggestion of death but did not serve a motion to substitute the personal representative of Mr. Sammons' estate within ninety days as required by Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.260(a)(1), nor did counsel seek an extension of time within which to do so. A week after the ninety-day period passed, the appellees moved to dismiss the Sammons' lawsuit with prejudice. At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, counsel for the Sammons presented the court with an affidavit detailing a health issue she had been experiencing and explaining how the condition was responsible for her failure to timely file the motion to substitute. After reviewing the affidavit and hearing argument, the trial court concluded counsel had not shown excusable neglect and granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice because the statute of limitations on the Sammons' claims had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The courts of this state have a long-standing tradition in favor of the disposition of an action on its merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Tucker v.

Simply put, the trial court considered all the information provided by the parties and determined that counsel for the Sammons' claim of excusable neglect was not credible. Because this finding is supported by the record, I cannot agree that the court abused its discretion in dismissing the action as to Mr. Sammons. As to Mrs. Sammons, however, her cause of action for loss of consortium survived the dismissal of Mr. Sammons' claims. Thus, I would affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thomas and Madeline Sammons seek review of a final defense judgment in this action alleging medical malpractice in the treatment of Mr. Sammons. The trial court dismissed the action based on the Sammons' failure to timely substitute a party plaintiff pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.260(a)(1) after the suggestion of Mr. Sammons' death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Sammons filed the underlying action against Adam Greenfield, D.O.; ASG Doctors, Inc.; and Family Medical Center of Port Richey, Inc., d/b/a Family Medical Centers (together \"Defendants\"), alleging Dr. Greenfield failed to timely diagnose and treat redness and irritation in one of Mr. Sammons' toes. Mr. Sammons sought damages against all three Defendants for negligence, and Mrs. Sammons sought damages for loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Sammons passed away from unrelated causes in March 2016, and the Sammons served a suggestion of death on April 20, 2016. On July 25, 2016, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to substitute a party within ninety days of filing the suggestion of death in accordance with rule 1.260(a)(1). According to the motion, the probate proceeding for Mr. Sammons' estate had been initiated and Mrs. Sammons had been appointed personal representative at least a month before the expiration of the ninety-day period. The motion requested dismissal with prejudice because the applicable statute of limitations had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Sammons did not file a response to Defendants' motion to dismiss. Instead they filed an untimely motion to substitute Mrs. Sammons as personal representative of the Estate as the party plaintiff. The Sammons did not schedule that motion for hearing. At the hearing on the motion to dismiss in December 2016, the Sammons' counsel (\"Counsel\") requested that the court allow a late substitution based on her excusable neglect. Counsel offered an affidavit in support of this request that had not been provided to defense counsel or filed with the court. In her affidavit, Counsel asserted that she failed to timely substitute parties due to cognitive problems she claimed to be experiencing as a result of undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Counsel did not provide an affidavit from her physician, but she produced a doctor's note dated November 2016 which stated, \"Due to this patient's medical illness which she had been unaware of she has been having cognitive changes. She is compliant with her treatment and will be under my care as well as possibly other specialist's care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court questioned Counsel for specific details regarding when and how she learned of her cognitive problems. Counsel asserted that she first learned of her cognitive problems in August 2016 when she consulted a physician about memory loss and word-finding difficulties she had been\n   experiencing in the previous months. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and began taking medication in September 2016. The court was skeptical of Counsel's assertion that her medical condition prevented her from filing a timely motion to substitute. The court pointed out that Counsel had filed a notice of unavailability on September 7, 2016, in which she did not mention any medical conditions. Counsel said that she filed the notice of unavailability prior to attending a legal seminar in Wyoming for most of September. The court then suggested that, if counsel could attend a legal seminar, she must have been capable of handling her cases as well. Counsel said that the problem with her condition was that the memory loss and brain fog she was experiencing were intermittent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defense counsel informed the court that he had communicated with Counsel about the motion to dismiss on August 9, 2016, via email. In the email, Counsel said that she was out of town and required more time to substitute parties. She claimed the delay was due to an error with the bond in the probate proceeding. She did not mention any health-related issues. In response to defense counsel's assertions, Counsel said she did not remember sending the email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court rejected Counsel's assertion that her medical condition prevented her from filing a timely motion to substitute. Based on the information before it, the court determined that Counsel was fully aware of the procedural posture of the case and that her failure to timely substitute was due to a bond issue. The court gave great weight to the fact that Counsel filed a notice of unavailability and communicated with defense counsel about the motion to dismiss without mentioning a medical problem. Thus, the court rejected Counsel's claim of excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Sammons raise two issues on appeal. First, they assert that the court erred by determining as a matter of law that Counsel's failure to comply with rule 1.260(a)(1) did not constitute excusable neglect. Second, they argue that the trial court erred in dismissing Mrs. Sammons' loss of consortium claim because it survives the dismissal of Mr. Sammons' action for failure to timely substitute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Excusable Neglect\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss based on the Sammons' failure to comply with rule 1.260(a)(1), which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper parties.... Unless the motion for substitution is made within 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of the death in the manner provided for the service of the motion, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"While the language of Rule 1.260 is mandatory, the statute has been interpreted liberally to allow substitution of a party after 90 days of the suggestion of death upon a showing of excusable neglect, inadvertence, mistake, fraud, etc.\" as provided for in Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.540(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    Pearl v.

However, at no point did Counsel suggest that an evidentiary hearing was necessary. Instead, Counsel freely responded to the court's inquiry into the specific details regarding when and how she learned of her cognitive problems. And Counsel argued that the facts before the court were sufficient to establish excusable neglect. Thus, the Sammons did not preserve and indeed waived any issue regarding their right to an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sciame v. Sciame\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12362349\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/215/190/#p192\">\n    215 So. 3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (Fla. 2d DCA 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Sammons alternatively argue that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss because Counsel's affidavit alone was sufficient to establish excusable neglect. I cannot agree that a trial court must take counsel's assertions of excusable neglect at face value, particularly where information casting doubt on the assertions is before the court. As the majority notes, Counsel offered an affidavit in which she asserted that she failed to timely substitute parties due to memory lapses and brain fog she was experiencing as a result of undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Counsel further asserted that she had started noticing the memory lapses and difficulty with name recall in the months preceding August 2016. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and began taking medication in September 2016. Counsel did not provide an affidavit from her physician, but she provided a doctor's note dated November 2016 vaguely stating, \"Due to this patient's medical illness which she had been unaware of she has been having cognitive changes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court questioned Counsel regarding her memory lapses and brain fog. The court noted that Counsel failed to request an extension of time or indicate on the record at any time prior to the hearing that she had a medical problem. The court added that Counsel failed to mention any medical issue in the August 2016 email despite the email reflecting that Counsel was \"fully aware of what's going on.\" Counsel also made no mention of a medical issue in her September 2016 notice of unavailability. Instead, Counsel indicated that she was going to Wyoming to attend a legal seminar. In determining that Counsel failed to meet her burden of establishing excusable neglect, it is evident that the court did not find Counsel to be credible. Because the record supports this determination, we must affirm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brivis Enters. v.

There were no allegations that Bowers' medical issues kept him hospitalized or incapable of communicating with the court at the time. In fact, per Appellants' motion, during this same time period, Bowers was prioritizing the cases of his clients and receiving continuances for their matters. Under the circumstances, Appellants' failure to timely file an answer or at least a request for another extension in a case where they were the defendants is not excusable, it is inexplicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6870301\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/165/710/#p711\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Bowers\n   </em>\n   , the party asserting excusable neglect (Counsel) was an attorney who claimed that medical issues kept her from filing a document in compliance with time limitations. As in\n   <em>\n    Bowers\n   </em>\n   , Counsel indicated knowledge of the deadline but failed to request an extension of time. Instead, as found by the trial court, Counsel was practicing law with no mention of any medical issues.

The court noted that the Third District's analysis \"implicitly concluded that because the surviving spouse can recover from the date of injury, the loss of consortium from the date of injury merges with the continuing injury suffered after death, and the surviving spouse therefore recovers\" under the Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6946746,6946724,6946775\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/140/1118/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the Third District did not consider situations in which the injured spouse dies from an injury that is not related to the personal injury action. In such a case, the surviving spouse could not bring an action under the Act and \"would lose a vested right to recover for a loss of consortium from the date of injury to the date of death.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6946746,6946724,6946775\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/140/1118/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Third District concluded this result is not what the legislature intended.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6946746,6946724,6946775\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/140/1118/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   I agree with the Fifth District's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Randall\n   </em>\n   . While a loss of consortium claim is a derivative right, it does not require a simultaneous personal injury action and may be sustained unless the underlying personal injury action has been ruled upon on the merits. Mrs. Sammons' claim for loss of consortium thus survives the dismissal of Mr. Sammons' personal injury claims for the failure to timely substitute under rule 1.260(a)(1). Therefore, I would reverse the final judgment as it pertains to Mrs. Sammons' claim for loss of consortium and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   One final observation, if we were to affirm the dismissal of Mr. Sammons' claims but reverse as to Mrs. Sammons' loss of consortium claim, we would not be in conflict with the Third District in\n   <em>\n    AC &amp; S\n   </em>\n   because there is an important distinction between the two cases. In this case, Mr. Sammons' personal injury action did not abate under section 768.20, Florida Statutes (2015). In fact, the Sammons concede that Mr. Sammons' death was not caused by the personal injuries that gave rise to this medical malpractice action. Thus, unlike the wife in\n   <em>\n    AC &amp; S\n   </em>\n   , Mrs. Sammons cannot recover damages for her loss of consortium under the Wrongful Death Act. Indeed, this case involves the exact situation the\n   <em>\n    Randall\n   </em>\n   court sought to avoid. If Mrs. Sammons' claim did not survive the dismissal of Mr. Sammons' personal injury action for failure to timely substitute, she would be deprived of her right to damages for her loss of consortium from the date of Mr. Sammons' injury to the date of his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because the trial court's finding that Counsel failed to establish excusable neglect is based on a credibility determination that is supported by the record, I would affirm the final judgment as it pertains to Mr. Sammons' claims. However, because Mrs. Sammons' loss of consortium claim survives the dismissal of Mr. Sammons' personal injury action under rule 1.260(a)(1), I would reverse the final judgment as it pertains to Mrs. Sammons.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Section 768.20 provides, in pertinent part, \"When a personal injury to the decedent results in death, no action for the personal injury shall survive, and any such action pending at the time of death shall abate.\" There is no suggestion that Mr. Sammons' claims abated upon his death in this case because the Sammons concede that Mr. Sammons death was not caused by his personal injuries.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
