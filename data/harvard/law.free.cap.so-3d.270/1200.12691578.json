The Florida Bar shall monitor the conditions set forth in the Consent Agreement pursuant to Rule 1-3.2(b) of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, and the costs thereof shall be paid by the Applicant to The Florida Bar or its designated monitoring agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   4. To monitor effectively the provisions in this agreement, the Applicant shall reside within the State of Florida during the entire period of probation. Any business or pleasure trips outside Florida that exceed ten days shall occur only with the advance approval of The Florida Bar. If the Applicant relocates outside the State of Florida during the probationary period for any reason, the Applicant shall surrender her license to practice law in Florida and if the Applicant fails to do so, the Supreme Court of Florida shall terminate her license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   5. The Applicant shall immediately inform The Florida Bar of any criminal arrest or prosecution and the filing of any\n   grievance or complaint related to the Applicant's practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   6. If the Applicant's license is surrendered or terminated during the probationary period, the Applicant shall resume the practice of law in the State of Florida only upon full compliance with the rules and regulations governing admission to The Florida Bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   7. A failure to observe the conditions of the probation or a finding of probable cause by the Florida Bar as to conduct of the Applicant committed during the period of probation may terminate the probation and subject the Applicant to all available grievance procedures and disciplinary sanctions including disbarment under the Rules of Discipline. Upon receiving notice of a violation of the Court's order of conditional admission, The Florida Bar may immediately petition the Court for an order of suspension. The Applicant shall have ten days to file a response. If no response is timely filed by the Applicant, then the Court shall issue an order suspending the Applicant. If a response is filed, the matter shall be disposed of as the Court directs. Unless terminated by the Court, an order of suspension shall remain in effect until final disposition of the grievance procedures commenced by The Florida Bar against the Applicant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   8. If circumstances so warrant it, the Applicant and The Florida Bar may stipulate to an extension of the period of probation or The Florida Bar may petition the Court for such an extension with a final decision to be made by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   9. The Applicant acknowledges that an uninterrupted period of documented sobriety for a minimum period of time must be established prior to admission to The Florida Bar on an unconditional basis. Should the period of probation be extended pursuant to either paragraph 7 or 8 above, the Applicant, therefore, further agrees that such extension shall be for a minimum of three up to five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   10. The Applicant specifically consents to and authorizes the release of any and all materials in the Applicant's file to The Florida Bar that the Bar may request from the Board to enable the Bar to fulfill its responsibilities under this Consent Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A True Copy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Test:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   John A. Tomasino\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Clerk, Supreme Court\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
