Debra Darlene Burns and her husband William Dale Burns filed a complaint against their landlords, Matthew and Jody Gray, and alleged injuries related to a fall they claim was \"as a result of the irregular pattern of the basement stairs.\" The circuit court found the Burnses' expert witness's testimony and opinions regarding causation were based on speculation and, therefore, struck his testimony and entered summary judgment in favor of the Grays. The Burnses timely appealed. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. From July 2008 to February 2015, the Burnses lived in a rental house owned by the Grays. Prior to renting the house, the Burnses inspected the house with the Grays' rental agent. Shortly after they moved in, the Burnses advised the Grays of their concerns about the basement stairs, including the steepness of the stairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On January 21, 2012, Mrs. Burns fell while walking down the stairs from the first floor of the residence to the basement. On January 15, 2015, the Burnses filed a complaint, alleging breach of contract, premises liability, and negligence per se. The Burnses claimed the Grays were negligent in \"fail[ing] to use reasonable care in the design, structure, and maintenance of the steps and railing leading to the basement of the residence on their premises, causing Mrs. Burns to fall and thereby sustain severe bodily injury.\" The Burnses contend that Mrs. Burns incurred physical injuries and that Mr. Burns incurred a loss of consortium and services as a result of the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Neither Mr. or Mrs. Burns have personal knowledge of how or why Mrs. Burns fell. Mrs. Burns has no memory of the day of the incident, and Mr. Burns was not at home when Mrs. Burns fell. The only person who was with Mrs. Burns at the time of her fall was her nephew, Michael Faulkner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Faulkner, who was thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of the fall, testified that he saw Mrs. Burns begin to walk down the basement stairs from the first floor. According to Faulkner, Mrs. Burns \"started down the stairs\" and \"made it to about the third step ... and ... pretty much face plant[ed] down the rest of the stairs.\" Faulkner was behind Mrs. Burns at the top of the stairs and did not see her feet when she fell. Faulkner explained that at the time of her fall, Mrs. Burns was carrying cigarettes and possibly a cup in one hand. Faulkner \"think[s] [Mrs. Burns] tried to\" grab the handrail, but he did not see her touch it. Faulkner testified that he did not know why Mrs. Burns fell but \"assume[d] she lost her footing or something.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. The Burnses' expert witness, Daniel Jason Ramsey, conducted a safety analysis related to the injuries sustained by Mrs. Burns. As part of his analysis, Ramsey inspected and took measurements of the stairway and reviewed applicable building codes. He further interviewed Faulkner and obtained information from the Burnses' attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. On August 31, 2016, Ramsey submitted an affidavit wherein he explained that as a result of his investigation, he \"determined that the pitch of the subject stairway was constructed at an angle of 47.11 degrees, classifying it as a 'steep stair type.' \" Ramsey found \"that the construction did not comply with the standards set out in the governing building code.\" Ramsey further found \"that the handrails installed as a component of the stairway failed to comply with applicable industry standards, in that they were constructed flush against the adjoining walls, offering no graspable surface and permitting the user no handhold.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Ramsey opined that \"[b]ased upon [his] interview of ... Faulkner, who observed Mrs. Burns start to descend the stairs, then stumble and fall, ... the steep pitch of the stairway and the narrow width of the steps were the proximate cause of or a substantial contributing factor causing the accident, making Mrs. Burns overbalance and fall forward.\" He further opined that \"the absence of a proper handrail\" was also a substantial contributing factor causing the accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Ramsey was subsequently deposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During his deposition, Ramsey testified that he \"d[id]n't really know why [Mrs. Burns] fell exactly and at what step, but she lost her balance and she fell.\" When asked what evidence he had that the stairs caused Mrs. Burns to fall, Ramsey explained that the stairs were \"out of compliance.\" Ramsey acknowledged he could not rule out other causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. The Grays filed a motion for summary judgment and a motion to strike Ramsey's testimony. Following a hearing, the circuit court granted both motions. Specifically, the circuit court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   the opinions of Mr. Ramsey are mere speculation as to the element of proximate cause and do not prove causation. Mr. Ramsey did not testify that any action or inaction of [the Grays] was the proximate cause of Mrs. Burns['s] fall; instead, Mr. Ramsey opined that the fact that the stairs were steep and narrow means they must have caused or contributed to Mrs. Burns['s] fall. However, Mr. Ramsey specifically stated that he did not know what caused Mrs. Burns to fall and acknowledged that he could not rule out all other variables. This testimony is insufficient to show causation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. The circuit court concluded that \"[t]here [wa]s simply not enough competent evidence that would allow a determination of the cause of Mrs. Burns'[s] fall. As a result, the circuit court found that \"summary judgment must be entered as a matter of law since [the Burnses] cannot establish the proximate cause of Mrs. Burns'[s] fall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. The Burnses now appeal and argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment and striking their expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    I. Whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13.

The Burnses claim they \"affirmatively established that the proximate cause of Mrs. Burns's injuries was the dangerous stairway and defective railing.\" In support of their claim, the Burnses rely on the testimony and opinions of Faulkner and Ramsey. However, the record shows neither Faulkner nor Ramsey know what caused Mrs. Burns to fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16. Although Faulkner \"assume[d] she lost her footing,\" he admitted he did not see Mrs. Burns's feet at the time of the fall and does not know why she fell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Burnses assert \"Faulkner's eyewitness testimony and sworn affidavit were presented to the [circuit] court in which he swore that Mrs. Burns lost her\n   footing and tumbled down the stairs because of the 'steep, narrow construction of the stairs.' \" However, the affidavit upon which the Burnses rely was executed by Faulkner five months after Faulkner testified that he did not know why Mrs. Burns fell. \"[T]he nonmovant cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment by submitting an affidavit which directly contradicts, without explanation, his previous testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Callicutt v.

Because Faulkner does not know why Mrs. Burns fell, he cannot establish the proximate cause of her fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17. Additionally, in his affidavit, Ramsey opined that \"the steep pitch of the stairway and the improperly constructed handrails ... caused Mrs. Burns to fall.\" However, during his subsequent deposition, he testified that he \"really d[id]n't know why she fell exactly and at what step, but she lost her balance and she fell.\" Ramsey's opinion that Mrs. Burns \"lost her balance\" was based on his conversation with Faulkner and Faulkner's assumption that Mrs. Burns \"lost her footing.\" Ramsey speculates that because she lost her balance and fell, it must have been due to the stairway configuration. He testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Defense Counsel] And looking at paragraph 7 [of your affidavit], your interview of Mr. Faulkner who observed M[r]s. Burns start to descend the stairs and then stumble and fall, how do you know she stumbled?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Ramsey] That's what he told me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [Defense Counsel] Again, how could he say she stumbled when he couldn't see her feet?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [Ramsey] I don't understand that. It's just what I was told. He told me that she stumbled and fell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Defense Counsel] But, I mean, you're taking it a step further, saying, well, she stumbled. It had to be because of the steepness of the stairs. There are a lot of reasons she could have stumbled other than the incline of those stairs, you would agree with me on that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Ramsey] I would agree with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Defense Counsel] And without someone seeing her feet, we're just guessing, aren't we?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Ramsey] I think you could tell if somebody stumbled without seeing the front of their feet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Defense Counsel] But what caused them to stumble, there are a lot of -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Ramsey] There's unknowns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 18. The record shows Ramsey took no action to rule out other factors that might have contributed to Mrs. Burns's fall. Although in his affidavit, Ramsey opines that shoes, clothing, loose objects, or tripping hazards did not contribute to the fall, he admitted during his deposition that such opinions were based solely on information provided to him by Faulkner or the Burnses' counsel. Indeed, Ramsey acknowledged that he never saw the shoes or clothing Mrs. Burns was wearing at the time of the fall and did not have pictures of the items. Moreover, Ramsey acknowledged that he did not see any pictures of the stairs taken immediately after the fall in order to determine for himself whether any tripping hazards were present. Thus, Ramsey's elimination of such factors was based, not on his independent investigation but, instead, on what Mrs. Burns's nephew and Mrs. Burns's attorney told him. In other words, Ramsey eliminated those factors simply because he was told they did not contribute to Mrs. Burns's fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 19. Ramsey further testified that he did not believe Mrs. Burns fainted. However, once again, he based this opinion on\n   what he was told by Faulkner. Ramsey testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Defense counsel] And if she fainted, she was gonna fall down the steps?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Ramsey] If she fainted, but she didn't faint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [Defense counsel] How do you know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Ramsey] They said she tripped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Defense counsel] How do you know? Nobody saw her feet. How do you know she tripped?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Ramsey] She fell forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Defense counsel] I mean, you're just speculating, you would agree with me on that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Ramsey] She was stepping. She was descending down. I don't know at what step, but she was going down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Defense counsel] But nobody saw her feet, so how do you know she was stepping down at the time she fell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [Ramsey] Mr. Faulkner was behind her, and he saw her going that way, going in that direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [Defense counsel] But whether she was actually stepping when this accident happened, you don't know? She could have been standing on the steps and passed out as far as we know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [Defense counsel] You would disagree with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [Ramsey] She could have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 20. Importantly, Ramsey did not investigate or have knowledge of the medications Mrs. Burns was taking at the time of her fall. The record indicates that on the day of her fall, Mrs. Burns was taking Lortab and may have consumed alcohol. The following discussion occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [Defense counsel] Based on your training, that raises a red flag, doesn't it, when somebody is taking pain medication ...?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [Ramsey] Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [Defense counsel] Because people - their gait is not as steady as other people, you would agree with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [Ramsey] Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [Defense counsel] And if someone's taking narcotic pain medication while they're descending some stairs, that would be something you would think would be important in regard to your accident investigation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [Ramsey] Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [Defense counsel] And you weren't told that she had been taking narcotic pain medication on the day of this accident, were you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [Ramsey] Not that I recall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [Defense counsel] And that's something that you would have wanted to know when you formulated your opinion, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [Ramsey] Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [Defense counsel] And so you did not factor that in as to maybe other reasons maybe she would have fallen, did you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [Ramsey] No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 21. When asked what evidence he had that the stairs caused Mrs. Burns to fall, Ramsey stated the stairs \"[were] out of compliance.\" He explained that \"when you step down at 47.11 degrees, it causes your leg to buckle, especially somebody that's shorter ... [w]hen you descend down, you are gonna have the opportunity at that degree to fall.\" However, Ramsey admitted that no one told him they saw Mrs. Burns's leg buckle. The following discussion then occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [Defense counsel] And under your theory for these stairs to have contributed to her fall, [Mrs. Burns] would have had to have taken a step and her leg would have had to have buckled for her to fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [Ramsey] Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [Defense counsel] But nobody saw that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [Ramsey] Could have, but he's not telling me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [Defense counsel] In ... Faulkner's deposition, and the statement you took from him, he never told anybody he saw her leg buckle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   [Ramsey] I never was told buckle. It was just stumble.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 22. When defense counsel suggested that Ramsey was \"speculating that by stepping down, somehow [Mrs. Burns's] leg buckled, and at the same time ... ignoring other possibilities,\" Ramsey did not disagree. Instead, Ramsey acknowledged that other factors such as \"the Lortab, she fainted, she just wasn't paying attention and she missed a step\" could have happened to cause Mrs. Burns to fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 23.

Here, like the eyewitness in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , Faulkner had a restricted view of the fall and did not know what caused the fall. Instead, Faulkner could only assume Mrs. Burns lost her footing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 31. Additionally, as in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , Ramsey found the stairs and handrail did not comply with the applicable building codes and opined that such noncompliance caused Mrs. Burns's fall. Yet, like the experts in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , Ramsey did not know why Mrs. Burns fell. Ramsey's finding that Mrs. Burns \"lost her balance\" was based on his conversation with Faulkner, who \"assumed\" his aunt lost her footing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 32. Moreover, like the experts in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , Ramsey could not rule out other causes of the fall. He did not know or ask about her use of medication, despite admitting that such information would be an important factor in his investigation. He did not consider Mrs. Burns's use of Lortab and never revised or supplemented his opinion. Additionally, his only source of information regarding potential tripping hazards came from his discussions with Mrs. Burns's counsel and her nephew, Faulkner, who was behind Mrs. Burns at the top of the stairs, and did not see her feet and therefore could not have seen the area where she fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 33. Importantly, like Dr. Hall in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , Ramsey could not say that had the stairs been in compliance, Mrs. Burns would not have fallen. Indeed, Ramsey admitted that if Mrs. Burns fainted, she would have fallen down the stairs even if the stairs were code-compliant. Additionally, Ramsey acknowledged that Mrs. Burns's use of pain medication would have affected her gait and steadiness, regardless of code-compliant stairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 34. When asked what evidence he had to support his theory of causation, Ramsey responded that the stairs were \"out of compliance.\" Although Ramsey explained that \"step[ping] down\" the noncompliant stairs would \"cause[ ] your leg to buckle,\" he acknowledged there was no evidence to suggest that Mrs. Burns's leg actually buckled. Moreover, there is no evidence that Mrs. Burns was even taking a step\n   down when she fell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , it appears Ramsey ultimately relied upon Mrs. Burns's presence on the \"out of compliance\" stairway to support his opinions on causation.

Indeed, Ramsey's opinion is \"based upon [his] interview of the sole eyewitness to the accident, Faulkner....\" Even assuming Ramsey's testimony regarding the building codes and the dimensions of the stairs is correct, \"there is no way to make the leap from the failure to meet [those building codes] to the proximate cause of [Mrs. Burns's] fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7035872\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/22/1219/#p1222\">\n    22 So.3d at 1225-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 41.
