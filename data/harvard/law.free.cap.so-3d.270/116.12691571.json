This appeal arises out of a breach of contract action for unpaid salaries. On June 22, 2016, Joseph R. Parker and Cheri C. Clancy filed a complaint against their former employer, Culpepper Enterprises Inc. alleging breach of oral contract for unpaid wages;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress; and their need for emergency, declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint named Culpepper Enterprises' chief executive officer, Kathy Culpepper, and chief operating officer, Brannon White, as individual defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. In their first amended complaint filed July 6, 2016, Parker and Clancy alleged that the Culpepper defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   failed to compensate them for numerous pay periods \"beginning in the middle of 2015.\" They also added a claim for damages under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The Culpepper defendants filed their answer on July 21, 2016, raising the one-year statute of limitations found in Mississippi Code Annotated section 15-1-29 (Rev. 2015)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. On August 30, 2016, Parker and Clancy filed a second amended complaint without the trial court's leave, seeking unpaid salaries for 2013, 2014, and 2015. They filed a third amended complaint without leave of court on September 1, 2016, alleging damages for quantum meruit, breach of implied contract, and unjust enrichment. On September 6, 2016, the Culpepper defendants filed a motion to strike the second and third amended complaints. The Culpepper defendants also filed a motion to dismiss any claim for unpaid damages that accrued before June 22, 2015, based on the one-year statute of limitations. The court struck the second and third amended complaints, and ruled that Parker and Clancy's proof would be limited to damages accruing after June 22, 2015. The court found that due to this ruling, the Culpepper defendants' motion to dismiss any claim before June 22, 2015 was moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Despite the Culpepper defendants' motion for a continuance, the trial was held September 6, 2016. Following trial, the jury awarded Parker and Clancy unpaid salaries in the respective amounts of $48,000 and $40,960, against Culpepper Enterprises, which were consistent with Parker and Clancy's exhibits showing the total unpaid salaries. The jury also awarded Parker and Clancy $25,000 each for emotional distress and mental anguish against all three defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. On appeal, the Culpepper defendants argue (1) the trial court erred in\n   denying its motion for a directed verdict because Parker's and Clancy's oral contracts for employment violate the statute of frauds, and the one-year statute of limitations precludes recovery for damages prior to June 22, 2015; (2) the trial court erred in denying its motion for a continuance; (3) the trial court erroneously allowed testimony concerning damages prior to June 22, 2015; (4) there is insufficient evidence to support an award of damages for emotional distress; and (5) the evidence failed to create a jury question as to Kathy and White's liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Culpepper Enterprises was formed in 1988 by William Culpepper (Kathy's husband and White's stepfather). Following William's death in 2007, Kathy became Culpepper Enterprises' chief executive officer. White became Culpepper Enterprises' chief operating officer in September 2015, after he stopped working as a private contractor for the federal government and moved to Collins, Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. From 1989 to 2012, Culpepper Enterprises maintained two lines of business. Its primary line involved fulfilling Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) contracts to mow grass along interstate right-of-ways. Its secondary line, discontinued in 2012, involved mowing along pipeline and power lines. The Culpepper defendants contend that when their sole focus became mowing grass for the MDOT, its business activities became strictly seasonal. The Culpepper defendants claim that as a result, they informed Parker and Clancy that during winter months, they would be paid only when additional work became available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Parker and Clancy quit working for Culpepper Enterprises on June 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Complaints\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. On June 22, 2016, Parker and Clancy filed a complaint in the Jones County Circuit Court, alleging that \"beginning in the middle of 2015,\" the Culpepper defendants failed to compensate them for numerous pay periods pursuant to their oral employment contracts. The complaint alleged that Parker and Clancy entered into oral contracts with Culpepper Enterprises, whereby Parker was to receive an annual salary of $52,000 with $200 per diem each week, and Clancy was to receive an annual salary of $66,560 with $200 per diem each week. Parker sought $42,000 in unpaid salary, and Clancy sought $53,160. They also sought damages for emotional distress, attorney's fees, and a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction requiring the MDOT to withhold all funds it owed Culpepper Enterprises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. On June 29, 2016, the Jones County Circuit Court issued a temporary restraining order requiring that the MDOT withhold $100,000 in funds owed to Culpepper. The court later vacated the temporary restraining order and transferred Parker and Clancy's case to the Covington County Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. On July 6, 2016, Parker and Clancy filed an amended complaint for damages and injunctive relief that additionally alleged FLSA violations. The amended complaint restated that the Culpepper defendants began failing to pay salaries \"in the middle of 2015.\" On July 21, 2016, the Culpepper defendants filed their answer, pleading the one-year statute of limitations and the statute of frauds, and denying that FLSA applied to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. On August 30, 2016, Parker and Clancy filed a second amended complaint without leave of court, seeking unpaid salaries for 2013, 2014, and 2015. Parker increased his demand for unpaid salary to $94,000, and Clancy increased hers to\n   $145,706. On September 6, 2016, Parker and Clancy filed a third amended complaint without leave of court, seeking damages based on quantum merit, breach of implied contract, and unjust enrichment. In response, the Culpepper defendants filed a motion to strike Parker and Clancy's second and third amended complaints, and a motion dismiss any evidence of unpaid salaries barred by the one-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. On September 6, 2016, at a motion hearing immediately before trial, the trial judge struck Parker and Clancy's second and third amended complaints, and ruled that pursuant to the one-year statute of limitations, Parker and Clancy's proof would be limited to damages that accrued after June 22, 2015, one year before they filed the original complaint. The court overruled as moot the Culpepper defendants' motion to dismiss based on the one-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion for Continuance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. Eight days before trial, on August 29, 2016, Kathy filed a motion for a continuance asserting that she was medically unable to participate in the trial due to a stroke. Her motion was accompanied by an unsworn certificate from a Merit Health medical director, stating that Kathy was admitted to Merit's Senior Care Unit on August 12, 2016, and was discharged on August 21, 2016, with recommended outpatient mental-health services. The medical director recommended that Kathy be given at least ninety days to \"more fully recuperate from her recent hospitalization.\" Kathy's motion also requested a continuance on the grounds that Parker and Clancy had not responded to outstanding discovery, and had yet to be deposed because they cancelled their depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. On the morning of trial, September 6, 2016, the trial judge heard arguments on the motion for a continuance. Although the Culpepper defendants' written motion contended that there was outstanding discovery, the Culpepper defendants did not address this issue during the hearing. The trial court denied the motion for continuance, noting that the medical director's recommendation did not explain why Kathy was hospitalized, provide a diagnosis or prognosis for Kathy's condition, or state whether Kathy's ability to testify had been affected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16. During trial, White testified that when Culpepper Enterprises discontinued its secondary line of business in 2012 and chose to focus on mowing grass for the MDOT, its business activities became strictly seasonal. White claimed that, as a result, Parker and Clancy were informed that during winter months they would be paid only when additional work became available. He stated that during cold-weather months, Parker and Clancy were accordingly paid when authorized to do additional work, such as servicing tractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17. Kathy testified as an adverse witness that she performed Culpepper Enterprises' payroll duties during 2014 and 2015, and that she timely paid all of their salaries. Kathy further stated that she properly submitted all of Parker and Clancy's withheld taxes, Social Security, and Medicare. She denied entering into oral employment contracts with Parker and Clancy for annual salaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18. Clancy testified that in 2008, she orally agreed with Culpepper Enterprises to receive an annual salary of $66,560, with either a one- or two-week pay period. She stated that she and Parker were never told that their pay would be altered in any way. Clancy testified that she worked year-round, including winter months. Clancy testified that sometime in 2015, Culpepper Enterprises failed to pay her and Parker\n   for salaries they were owed, and that Kathy responded she would \"take care of it.\" Clancy said at a later date during that year-sometime during late November or early December-she and Parker sat down with Kathy and asked for the salaries they had yet to receive. Clancy stated that she agreed to wait until January to be paid. She testified that for pay periods when she actually received checks, the checks did not list the correct pay-period dates. Instead, Kathy would hand her a check, and say, \"I'm going to give you two checks for the next three or four weeks.\" Clancy further testified that upon going to the Social Security Administration office, she learned that no funds had been paid into her social security account during 2014 and 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 19. Parker testified that he started working at Culpepper Enterprises in the spring of 1991. He stated that in 2009, he and Culpepper Enterprises orally agreed that he would receive an annual salary of $51,000 and would be paid every two weeks. Parker asserted that his 2009 agreement with Culpepper Enterprises had never changed. He said that despite several conversations with Kathy and White, Culpepper Enterprises failed to pay him his agreed upon salary during 2014 and 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20. Nell Hopkins testified that she worked as Culpepper Enterprises' bookkeeper and payroll clerk from September 2007 to December 2013. Hopkins said that she personally witnessed Parker and Clancy work year-round, even during winter months, and that she was never instructed to alter Parker's or Clancy's pay in any way. She testified that while working for Culpepper Enterprises, she observed Kathy ask Parker and Clancy not to cash their paychecks until Culpepper Enterprises had enough funds to cover the checks. Hopkins stated that on occasion, Kathy held Parker's and Clancy's paychecks until she chose to sign them. Hopkins further testified that although Culpepper Enterprises withheld taxes and Medicare from Parker's and Clancy's paychecks, Kathy instructed her not to submit the withholdings to the government. Additionally, Hopkins testified that Culpepper Enterprises continued to withhold life-insurance payments from Parker's and Clancy's checks after their insurance was cancelled in 2012. Hopkins said Kathy received life-insurance reimbursement checks but never gave them to Parker or Clancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21. Lisa Boykin, an accountant, testified as an expert for Parker and Clancy. She stated that prior to trial, she reviewed Parker's and Clancy's 2010-2015 W-2 statements, paycheck stubs, personal bank statements, 2015-2016 pay summaries, and July 2016 Social Security Administration Statements. She further stated that the documents she reviewed included: 2010-2016 banks statements relating to Parker's and Clancy's payrolls, 2010-2016 debit transactions of paychecks cleared for payment to Parker and Clancy, employee paycheck stubs, and operating expenses for transactions dated 2015-2016. In exhibits admitted into evidence as P15 and P16, Boykin opined that Parker's 2014-2016 gross missing payroll amounted to $48,000, and Clancy's equaled $40,960. Boykin's opinions as to Parker's gross-missing payroll, admitted as Parker and Clancy's exhibit P15, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-34\"><strong>2014</strong> 1/25/14 to 2/07/14 $ 2,000 2/08/14 to 2/14/14 $ 2,000 7/19/14 to 8/01/14 $ 2,000 <strong>2014 TOTAL OWED</strong> <strong>$ 6,000</strong> <strong>2015</strong> 1/10/15 to 1/23/15 $ 2,000 1/24/15 to 2/06/15 $ 2,000 2/07/15 to 2/20/15 $ 2,000 2/21/15 to 2/20/15 $ 2,000 3/07/15 to 3/20/15 $ 2,000 3/21/15 to 4/03/15 $ 2,000 4/04/15 to 4/17/15 $ 2,000 7/25/15 to 8/07/15 $ 2,000 8/08/15 to 8/21/15 $ 2,000 8/22/15 to 9/04/15 $ 2,000 9/05/15 to 9/18/15 $ 2,000 9/19/15 to 10/02/15 $ 2,000 10/03/15 to 10/16/15 $ 2,000 10/17/15 to 10/30/15 $ 2,000 <strong>2015 TOTAL OWED</strong> <strong>$28,000</strong> <strong>2016</strong> 2/06/16 to 2/19/16 $ 2,000 2/20/16 to 3/04/16 $ 2,000 3/05/16 to 3/18/16 $ 2,000 3/19/16 to 4/01/16 $ 2,000 4/02/16 to 4/08/16 $ 2,000 6/04/16 to 6/17/16 $ 2,000 6/18/16 to 6/24/16 $ 2,000 <strong>2016 TOTAL OWED</strong> <strong>$14,000</strong> <strong>PARKER PAYROLL</strong> 2014 TOTAL OWED $ 6,000 2015 TOTAL OWED $28,000 2016 TOTAL OWED $14,000 <strong>OWED TO PARKER</strong> <strong>$48,000</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Boykin's opinions for Clancy's unpaid salary were admitted as plaintiffs' exhibit P16 and showed the following:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-36\"><strong>2014</strong> 1/25/14 to 2/07/14 $ 2,560 2/08/14 to 2/14/14 $ 2,560 7/19/14 to 8/01/14 $ 2,560 <strong>2014 TOTAL OWED</strong> <strong>$ 7,680</strong> <strong>2015</strong> 12/27/15 to 1/09/15 $ 2,560 1/10/15 to 01/23/15 $ 2,560 1/24/15 to 02/06/15 $ 2,560 2/07/15 to 02/20/15 $ 2,560 2/21/15 to 03/06/15 $ 2,560 3/07/15 to 03/20/15 $ 2,560 <strong>2015 TOTAL OWED</strong> <strong>$15,360</strong> <strong>2016</strong> 3/19/16 to 4/01/16 $ 2,560 4/02/16 to 4/15/16 $ 2,560 4/16/16 to 4/29/16 $ 2,560 4/30/16 to 5/13/16 $ 2,560 5/14/16 to 5/27/16 $ 2,560 5/28/16 to 6/10/16 $ 2,560 6/11/16 to 6/24/16 $ 2,560 <strong>2016 TOTAL OWED</strong> <strong>$17,920</strong> <strong>Total Payroll Owed</strong> <strong>$40,960</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22. The Culpepper defendants objected to Boykin's testimony and exhibits as contrary to the court's pretrial ruling that Parker and Clancy's evidence would be limited to damages accruing after June 22, 2015. In addition, the Culpepper defendants objected on the ground that the one-year statute of limitations barred damages accruing before then. The court overruled the Culpepper defendants' objections and ruled that the jury would decide which damages to award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23. Following trial, the jury awarded Parker and Clancy $48,000 and $40,960, respectively, in unpaid salaries against Culpepper Enterprises, and $25,000 each for emotional distress against all three defendants. The Culpepper defendants timely appeal, arguing the trial court erred by: denying their motion for directed verdict; denying their motion for a continuance; admitting testimony concerning damages that occurred prior to June 22, 2016; awarding Parker and Clancy damages for emotional distress; and denying their motion for a directed verdict in favor of Kathy and White.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Denial of Culpepper's Motion for a Directed Verdict\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24. The Culpepper defendants argue the trial court erred by failing to grant their motion for a directed verdict because Parker's and Clancy's oral contracts do not survive the statute of frauds as verbal agreements intended to be carried out\n   over a period of time in excess of fifteen months. The Culpepper defendants also argue, as they asserted throughout the proceedings and trial, that the one-year statute of limitations found in section 15-1-29 bars recovery for any breach prior to June 22, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25. \"Motions for directed verdict and judgments notwithstanding the verdict challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Gibson ex.

In this case, Parker and Clancy contend that the Culpepper defendants failed to pay their salaries for pay periods in 2014, 2015, and 2016. However, because Parker's and Clancy's claims are based on\n   unwritten employment contracts, the one-year statute of limitations limits recovery to breaches occurring after one year before the filing of the lawsuit. Parker and Clancy filed their complaint on June 22, 2016; therefore, their recovery must be limited to breaches occurring after June 22, 2015. We concur with precedent that the statute of limitations applies to bar recovery for unpaid salaries before June 22, 2015.

Kathy's and White's promises were not in writing. Nor were they definite and unequivocal. Kathy and White never promised to pay a definite amount and did not specify the pay periods for which they were promising to pay. We therefore find that Kathy's and White's promises do not toll the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    C. Limitation on the Jury Verdict\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 41. The jury awarded Parker and Clancy unpaid gross salaries in the respective amounts of $48,000 and $40,960, virtually adopting Parker's and Clancy's total missing payroll amounts for 2014-2016, found in exhibits P15 and P16. The exhibits provided for gross salaries without a deduction for any withholdings such as for taxes or insurance. Because we find that the one-year statute of limitations applies to this case, we find the jury's award of damages accruing prior to June 22, 2015 to be error. In applying the one-year statute of limitations to the figures adopted by the jury from P15 and P16, it is apparent that Culpepper Enterprises owed Parker $28,000 and Clancy $17,920 for unpaid salaries\n   that accrued after June 22, 2015. Accordingly, we affirm the jury's verdict to the extent that it awarded Parker and Clancy unpaid gross salaries for breaches occurring after June 22, 2015, and reverse and render the remaining amount of the jury's award for unpaid salaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Denial of Culpepper's Motion for a Continuance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 42. Prior to trial, the Culpepper defendants requested a continuance, asserting that (1) Kathy was medically unable to participate in trial as scheduled because she was recuperating from a stroke, and (2) Parker and Clancy had yet to respond to outstanding discovery. The motion was supported by a sworn affidavit from the Culpepper defendants' attorney and an unsworn certificate from a Merit Health medical director, recommending that trial be extended at least ninety days to allow Kathy \"to more fully recuperate from her recent hospitalization.\" The medical director stated that Kathy was hospitalized from August 12 to 21, 2016. She was discharged with recommended outpatient mental-health services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 43. During a hearing on the motion, the trial court noted that the medical director's recommendation did not explain why Kathy was hospitalized and neither provided a diagnosis or prognosis for Kathy's condition. Additionally, the trial court noted that the medical director failed to state whether Kathy's ability to testify was affected. The trial court denied the continuance and proceeded immediately with trial. We note that the Culpepper defendants did not mention any outstanding discovery issues during the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 44. \"It is well settled that the decision to grant or deny a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed unless the decision results in manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    In re E.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804911\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/763/#p772\">\n    191 So.3d 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772 (\u00b6 37) (Miss.

The Culpepper defendants offered no proof that Kathy was unable to testify or that her ability to testify was impaired. We note that Kathy testified during trial as an adverse witness for Parker and Clancy, but that she did not testify in her own case-in-chief. The Culpepper defendants contend that after testifying as an adverse witness, Kathy was unable to testify again because she was too weak. Yet the Culpepper defendants did not move to continue the trial asserting that Kathy could not be called in their case-in-chief because she was too weak too testify, and did not offer any evidence of Kathy's inability to testify on its motion for a new trial. Under these circumstances, we find no manifest injustice occurred. We cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Admission of Testimony Concerning Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 46. In this assignment of error, the Culpepper defendants contend the trial court erroneously allowed Boykin to testify about damages that occurred before June 22, 2015. The Culpepper defendants point out that Parker and Clancy did not allege damages prior to mid-2015 in their complaint or amended complaint.

The Culpepper defendants timely objected to the testimony and therefore had a right to have Boykin's testimony on damages prior to mid-2015 excluded.

In this case, Parker and Clancy failed to present sufficient proof of injury to present a jury issue. The only evidence presented by Parker supporting his claim for emotional distress was the following on direct examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Q And, Mr. Parker, would you please tell the jury and the Court how you have been affected by Culpepper's failure to pay your wages and reimbursements?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   A Well, I'm getting buried by bills right now from the doctors.

Clancy's proof for her claim of emotional distress included her testimony that Culpepper's failure to pay was \"very confusing,\" and as a result, she experienced \"a roller coaster of emotions.\" Clancy stated that she went \"through bouts of depression,\" and had been \"emotional with her family.\" She also testified that her claim for emotional distress stemmed from the stress and emotional toll she experienced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 53.

Therefore, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Parker and Clancy, reasonable jurors could not have arrived at a verdict that resulted in individual liability on the part of Kathy or White. We note that the jury's verdict on breach of contract was against only Culpepper Enterprises, but the trial court's judgment awarded joint and several damages against Culpepper Enterprises, Kathy, and White.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court erred in denying the Culpepper defendants' motion for JNOV regarding Kathy and White's individual liability because they were only agents of Culpepper Enterprises. Further, the trial court should not have rendered a judgment against all three defendants when the jury's verdict on breach of contract was only against Culpepper Enterprises. Consequently, Kathy and White bear no responsibility for any portion of the judgment and should be dismissed with prejudice from this suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7014095\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/91/616/#p622\">\n    91 So.3d at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 58. In summary, we find the trial court erred when it denied the Culpepper defendants' motion for a directed verdict and JNOV because the jury verdict contained damages for unpaid salaries outside the one-year statute of limitations. We find no\n   manifest injustice resulted from the trial court's denial of the Culpepper defendants' motion for a continuance. We reverse and render any damages awarded for emotional distress, and reverse and render the judgment of the circuit court awarding any damages against Kathy and White individually. We reverse and remand for the circuit court to enter a judgment for Parker and Clancy against only Culpepper Enterprises, in the amount of $28,000 for Parker and $17,920 for Clancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 59.\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND RENDERED IN PART; REMANDED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   LEE, C.J., IRVING AND GRIFFIS, P.JJ., BARNES, CARLTON, FAIR AND WESTBROOKS, JJ., CONCUR.

While I concur in result with the majority's opinion, I feel compelled to write separately regarding the trial court's denial of Culpepper's motion for a continuance. Less than ninety days after Parker and Clancy filed their complaint, the trial court held a trial. During this time period, Parker and Clancy filed two additional amended complaints, the trial court transferred venue, and the parties apparently failed to complete discovery. Furthermore, less than a month before the trial, Kathy suffered a stroke and was hospitalized for nine days. Had this Court not been able to render what I believe to be the correct conclusion, it is my opinion this case would have been ripe for reversal based solely upon the denial of Culpepper's motion for a continuance. I seek not to discourage trial courts from managing their own dockets, particularly when it comes to pushing matters to trial. After all, justice delayed is all too often justice denied. However, unless an apparent reason exists for fast-tracking a case, I would caution trial courts to at least allow the discovery period set forth in Rule 4.03(A) of the Uniform Civil Rules of Circuit and County Court to be completed before proceeding to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   WESTBROOKS, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    In their complaint, Parker and Clancy use \"salary\" and \"unpaid wages\" interchangeably to describe their claims.
