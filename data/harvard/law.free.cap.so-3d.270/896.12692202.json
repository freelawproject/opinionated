The State filed a multiple bill of information charging Defendant as a recidivist as to count 5 and, on September 30, 2016, the trial court adjudicated him a third felony offender,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   vacated his previous sentences, and resentenced him to eight years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Our review for errors patent on the face of the record reveals one. In sentencing Defendant as a third offender, the district court failed to stipulate that the sentence be served without the benefit of probation or suspension of sentence in accordance with La. R.S. 15:529.1(G). However, La. R.S. 15:301.1(A) provides, in pertinent part: \"[t]he failure of a sentencing court to specifically state that all or a portion of the sentence is to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence shall not in any way affect the statutory requirement\" that those restrictions apply. Our jurisprudence recognizes that \"this paragraph self-activates the correction and eliminates the need to remand for a ministerial correction of an illegally lenient sentence which may result from the failure of the sentencing court to impose punishment in conformity with that provided in the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Det. Cockerham recognized Defendant from past encounters and noted that there was an active warrant for Defendant's arrest. The detective's attention was drawn to Defendant by the presence of an assault rifle sitting on the dashboard of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Det. Cockerham notified other officers to make an investigatory stop of Defendant's vehicle. NOPD Officers Willard Pearson and Brandon Kelly arrived in a marked unit and Det. Cockerham rode in the back seat. They observed Defendant's vehicle approach the intersection of Benefit and Louisa Streets at a high rate of speed and disregard the stop sign. Ofc. Pearson activated the unit's siren and lights in pursuit. Defendant disregarded the officers' attempt to stop his vehicle and led the officers on an erratic twenty-minute high-speed chase from the east bank of the river, across the Crescent City Connection\n   and onto the Westbank Expressway, where Defendant's vehicle stalled after colliding with two civilian vehicles. During the chase, Defendant drove against traffic at dangerously high speeds, narrowly averting a head-on collision with another police unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As Defendant's vehicle came to a stop, several officers approached Defendant and his passenger, Boudreaux, ordering them to exit the vehicle. Boudreaux complied with the officers' demands but Defendant refused. Ofc. Kelly tased Defendant to subdue and handcuff him. Officers searched Defendant's vehicle but did not recover a weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   They did, however, seize an unmarked pill bottle from the vehicle's front seat cup holder, which later proved to contain tramadol. Officers also seized oxycodone and hydrocodone, which were located in the vehicle's front console. Defendant was charged with possession of narcotics and cited for several traffic violations: reckless operation of a vehicle by disregarding multiple stop signs; failure to heed the officers' signal to stop; traveling in the wrong direction on a one-way street; hit and run; and operating the vehicle with a suspended driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ofc. Pearson testified and corroborated Det. Cockerham's testimony. Ofc. Pearson added that he saw a rifle thrown from the front seat passenger window of Defendant's vehicle into a heavily weeded area during the first three minutes of the chase. The weapon was never recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the day in question, NOPD Officer Lawrence Weathersby was coming on duty when he heard the dispatch of pursuit of a black SUV. Ofc. Weathersby was traveling on the Interstate high rise bridge and saw Defendant's vehicle make a U-turn into oncoming traffic and into the path of his police unit. Ofc. Weathersby took evasive action and avoided a head-on collision with the vehicle. Ofc. Weathersby joined the pursuit and witnessed Defendant's vehicle run a red light, disregard stop signs, and collide with two civilian vehicles, which ultimately disabled Defendant's vehicle on the Westbank Expressway. When Defendant ignored police commands to show his hands and exit his vehicle, he was tased to ensure his removal from the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The State and defense stipulated that if Dwayne Gilyot were called to testify, he would be qualified as an expert in the testing and analysis of controlled substances. They agreed that Gilyot would verify that the ten pills confiscated from Defendant's vehicle testified positive for tramadol, oxycodone and hydrocodone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   NOPD Officer Joseph Pollard, an expert in fingerprint analysis, testified he fingerprinted Defendant on June 28, 2016. He identified the card bearing those prints. Ofc. Pollard reviewed a \"cert pack\" from Defendant's earlier conviction for possession of cocaine, compared the fingerprints, and concluded that both sets belonged to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defense called co-defendant Boudreaux, who asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege to all of the defense counsel's questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the first of two assignments of error, Defendant argues the evidence is insufficient in that no rational juror could have found that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he exercised dominion or control over any of the drugs found in the vehicle as it was rented at all times. Moreover, Defendant argues that it was impossible for him to know what the\n   sealed pill bottle found in the vehicle's cup holder contained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The constitutional standard for testing the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier-of-fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

This reliance, however, is misplaced. The\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   court concluded that a rational fact finder could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant driver knowingly possessed the marijuana found in a knapsack on the front passenger seat of his car.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   01-1503, p. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9417560\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/819/424/\">\n    819 So.2d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that, although the defendant was the owner of the vehicle and the drugs were easily accessible from his location as driver, the evidence was insufficient to prove he exercised dominion and control over the knapsack and its contents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9417560\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/819/424/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, a passenger in the vehicle claimed, both at the scene and at trial, to be the owner of the knapsack as well as the drugs contained therein. None of these hypotheses of innocence are present in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational juror could have concluded that Defendant constructively possessed the narcotics recovered from the vehicle.
