We do not take issue with the legal points which the appellant has raised. On his behalf his counsel has filed a learned brief setting out the law pertaining to maintenance and cure. But the judgment of the district court is to be affirmed because of specific findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of fact made at the conclusion of the trial. The judge disbelieved the appellant and his brother who was a witness for him. The judge found as a fact that when appellant returned to work he was physically capable of doing so. Bearing in mind the rule of McAllister v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20, that the findings in an admiralty suit are not to be disregarded unless clearly erroneous, we can do nothing but affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AEH\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
