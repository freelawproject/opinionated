The creation of a bulge in the skin unavoidably results from using more than one shaving-head. Even if we make the dubious assumption that the use of two or more heads (as better than one) constitutes invention, the fact is that the prior art discloses electric razors which employed, or were capable of employing, multiple heads. Since a bulge was inevitable, it is immaterial that no prior art patents intended to create one. General Electric Co. v. Jewel Incandescent Lamp Co., 326 U.S. 242, 249, 66 S.Ct. 81, 90 L.Ed. 43. Perhaps plaintiff\u2019s device yielded a size and shape of bulge preferable to what the prior art yielded; but the production of such a result is not invention. So plaintiff, we think, must lose this battle of the bulge.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">This leaves, as the alleged invention, the lateral cutting. It appears in defendant\u2019s razor, and perhaps sufficiently in plaintiff\u2019s patent. But this element is also revealed in the prior art:</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Gaiztarro Patent No. 787,482 relates to a multi-headed electric shaver. The trial judge found that it \u201ccould only cut the hair at the top surfaces\u201d of the shaver-heads and not at the sides. True, as illustrated in the drawings of the patent, the shaver-heads are flat and perhaps could cut only on the top surface. However, the specifications point out that \u201cThe blade-holder is made up of two sets of rows of blades, the rows being placed on the same level or, <em>if preferred, the rows can be slanted a little from the center to the sides or vice versa.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Plaintiff asserted, and the trial judge found, that similarly inclined blades in defendant\u2019s razor result in side-cutting. We think therefore that the Gaiztarro French Patent anticipates the lateral cutting claims in plaintiff\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">In addition, the Aaron Patent No. 1,970,518 has a rounded cutting surface which we think approximates the defendant\u2019s inverted V-shaped shaver-heads. The trial judge distinguished the Aaron patent on the ground that it was only for a single-headed shaver. Though this may have been relevant to the issue of the bulge, it did not sufficiently distinguish this patent with reference to plaintiff\u2019s claimed invention of lateral cutting. For merely to use two Aaron shaver-heads on a razor would clearly not constitute invention. The Aaron razor was capable of side-cutting and anticipated plaintiff\u2019s patent. Plaintiff\u2019s approach to invention is not even a close shave.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">In the circumstances, we see no significance in the fact, found by the trial judge, that \u201cfour manufacturers, including Schick and Remington-Rand, Inc., two of the largest manufacturers, have procured licenses from the plaintiff.\u201d These are matters about which judges must not be too naive: To take a license, calling for small royalty payments, frequently involves less expense than prolonged litigation; besides, if the licenses are few, the licensees may deem it desirable to share a monopoly which will endure while the patent-owner frightens off other users.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">As plaintiff\u2019s patent is invalid, we need not consider the infringement issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
