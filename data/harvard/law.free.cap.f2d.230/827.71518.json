The complaint alleges that in making these agreements appellees failed to secure, as the law requires, certain conditions beneficial to the United States. The complaint asks for a declaratory judgment and \u201ca mandatory injunction restraining the defendants from taking any further steps of any kind whatever pursuant to and in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>* * * redevelopment plan designated as Washington Square Southeast submitted by the City of New York, and such restraint shall include, but not be limited to the furnishing of any financial assistance to the City of New York in accordance with the provisions of Title I of the National Housing Act of 1949, as amended [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451 et seq., 63 Stat. 414] * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The District Court dismissed the complaint on three grounds; the City is an indispensable party, there is no claim on which relief can be granted, and the plaintiffs lack standing to sue. We need not consider the first two. Appellants will be evicted, if at all, by condemnation proceedings lawfully maintained by New York City. One who will be injured by another\u2019s lawful use of money has no standing to assert that a third person\u2019s action in providing the money will be illegal. Alabama Power Co. v.
