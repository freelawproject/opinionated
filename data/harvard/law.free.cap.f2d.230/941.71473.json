The sole issue is whether the amount of income reported in 1944, as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>rived from Santayana\u2019s \u201cPersons and Places,\u201d constituted ordinary income or a long term capital gain. In answering, we must decide whether the transaction between Cory and Scribner\u2019s constituted a \u201csale\u201d or merely the granting of a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The Tax Court held that Cory gave Scribner\u2019s a license. That Court based its decision, in part, on the fact that a part only of the \u201cbundle of rights\u201d inhering in the copyright was transferred to Scribner\u2019s, since Cory assigned neither foreign publishing rights (other than Canadian) nor movie or dramatic rights. Furthermore, the Tax Court found that Cory had not transferred the first serial rights even for the United States and Canada. In addition, the Tax Court held there was no \u201csale\u201d because no definite price was fixed for the transfer: Payments to Cory were to be measured by future sa,les of the book. The evidence supports the Tax Court\u2019s findings which are, therefore, not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ato\">The Tax Court thought the previous pertinent decisions not too clear. This difficulty, and its bearing on Cory, would have interested Santayana, with his sense of irony, his detachment, his mockery of \u201cthe runner\u2019s heat with gentle wonder and laughter sweet,\u201d his emphasis on human limitations and on individual human perspectives, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his view that human knowledge \u201cis a torch of smoky pine that lights the pathway but one step ahead,\u201d his jibes at the common belief that opaque language must denote \u201cprofound knowledge,\u201d his smile at efforts to \u201cgrope for a deep truth in * * * obscurity.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-18\">To grope our way through obscurity, in this area, we must put to one side, as irrelevant here, cases dealing with the taxation of transfers of interests in copyrights (or patents) by nonresident aliens: <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The decisions in those cases interpreted Sections 211 and 212 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A., and similar provisions in the prior acts, which embodied the Congressional purpose to tax \u201cthose kinds of income\u201d of such aliens \u201cwhich had been found to be readily withholdable at their * * * sources\u201d, as the Supreme Court remarked in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wodehouse, 337 U.S. 369, 388-392, 69 S.Ct. 1120, 1130, 93 L.Ed. 1419. Quite different is the Congressional purpose embodied in Section 117 covering capital gains, since that section does not ordinarily apply to non-resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>aliens. Accordingly, as we have previously several times observed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> other considerations must guide our determination whether the profit resulting from a transfer by a citizen of interests in copyrights is a capital gain or ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wodehouse, supra, the Supreme Court apparently accepted the contention that it did \u201cnot properly reach the fine questions of title, or of sales or copyright law, * * * as to the divisibility of a copyright, or as to the sale of some interest in a copyright.\u201d But here we must consider such \u201cfine questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">In Goldsmith v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 143 F.2d 466, 467, a case involving a citizen taxpayer, Judge Learned Hand, speaking for the majority held that the transfer of part of the bundle of rights (making up the copyright) for a definite sum, yielded a sale. However, he concluded that the vendor, a professional author, held the interests in the copyright \u201c \u2018for sale to customers in the ordinary course\u2019 \u201d of his business, and were hence excluded from the definition of a capital asset in Section 117(a) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Mr. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting in Wodehouse, and speaking for two other Justices, approved Judge Hand\u2019s ruling in Goldsmith. He maintained that the crucial test of sale was not whether the transfer included the entire bundle of rights but whether there had been a transfer \u201cabsolutely\u201d of a \u201cdistinct right conferred by the Copyright Law\u201d under \u201cterms of payment which do not depend on future use by the transferee.\u201d See 337 U.S. at pages 423-424, 69 S.Ct. at page 1146. The majority of the court in Wodehouse rested its decision on the interpretation of the peculiar provisions of the Code relating to non-resident alien individuals. Accordingly, the majority did not express any lack of agreement with Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s rejection of the theory of the \u201cindivisibility of the copyright.\u201d See also Herwig v. United States, 105 F.Supp. 384, 122 Ct.Cl. 493; Fulda, Copyright Assignments and the Capital Gains Tax, 58 Yale L.J. 245 (1949); cf. Fields v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 189 F.2d 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">If we adopt the reasoning of Judge Hand and Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it follows that the mere fact that Cory transferred less than his entire bundle of rights does not automatically brand this transaction as but a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">However, it does not necessarily follow that, therefore, the transaction was a sale. For here the transaction lacked an element implicitly considered in Judge Hand\u2019s opinion in Goldsmith, supra, and explicitly stressed by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Wodehouse: At the time of the transfer, the amount of payments to the transferor remained indeterminate, dependent wholly on the sales of the book by the transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">We do not now decide that a transfer by a citizen of but a part of the bundle for a definite sum, or a transfer of the whole for an indeterminate sum, is a sale for purposes of Section 117.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We do hold that when, as here, the transfer is both (1) a transfer of a part of the cluster of rights and (2) for an amount wholly indeterminable at the time of the transfer, no such sale occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-6\">. lie wrote that, \u201csince the station, faculties, and passions of all men are not identical,\u201d their \u201cpictures\u201d of events \u201cwill not be identical * * * The same battle in the clouds will be known to the deaf only as lightning and to the blind only as thunder * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b995-9\">. These readers of his Autobiography who receive an impression of Santayana as self-absorbed to the point of excessive selfishness, will be surprised by Ms letter of August 22, 1941, to Wheeloek, Scribner\u2019s representative, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-10\">\u201cIn your kind letter of July 30 you say your firm is disposed to advance the payment of my royalties to Cory, if he should ever need such assistance. I am very glad to know this; because I feel partly responsible for having kept him out of steady employment during the best years of Ms life. * * * It happens to be difficult for me for family reasons to leave Cory any legacy or to help him o\\it of the money in charge of my nephew Ooorge Sturgis, which is largely Sturgis money in origin. But I feel free to dispose of my earnings, including my royalties; and for tliis reason (as I don\u2019t need them) I have asked you to let Mm have them during this war, when my private bank account in London is congealed. In case of my death, however, he might be in at least monetary difficulties; and I am not sure that my royalties could then legally go to him. For this reason I mean to give him my MSS including that of my autobiography, and am expressly leaving them to Mm in my Will. lie will then make the contract for publication with you, and have a right to the royalties.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b995-21\">.

Commissioner, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 753 which related to a non-resident alien. See also Herwig v. United States, 105 F.

Hopkinson, 2 Cir., 126 F.2d 406 and TeLinde, 18 T.C. 91 as authority for their contention that the transfer of a copyright interest for a price to be fixed by the future profits can constitute a sale. In Hopkinson, this court held that the transfer of a patent was a sale, despite the fact that payment turned on future sales. In Te-Linde, the Tax Court held similarly in dealing with the transfer of a copyright. However, in both cases the taxpayers transferred the entire bundle, so that they no longer retained any interest in them. They had only the right to receive periodic payments of money.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
