Hobby, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 130 F.Supp. 65, that plaintiff was not \u201cliving with\u201d her husband at the time of his death in 1949 so as to entitle her to a lump sum death payment under the Social Security Act, \u00a7\u00a7 202(g) and 209(n), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(g) and 409(n), as amended. Plaintiff and the deceased were married in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1922; he deserted her and his infant daughter in 1924 and never lived with her thereafter; and although he made small and infrequent contributions to her until 1933 or 1934, all support ceased at that time. She did not pay his funeral or burial expenses. Even though she was the wronged person, the legislative history, developed by Judge Edelstein in his opinion, demonstrates that the statutory phrase did not contemplate provision for a wronged wife as such or windfall to those suffering no economic loss from the wage earner\u2019s death, but rather that payment should go to those equitably entitled through assumption of the cost of last illness or burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">It is true that the definition of \u201cliving with\u201d in \u00a7 209(n), as amended, included also a widow whose husband had been ordered by a court to contribute to her support; and plaintiff relies on a 1924 order of a criminal court in Atlanta which had found the husband guilty of abandonment of his minor child and had put him on probation on condition that he support the child. This long expired order, for the child\u2019s, not the mother\u2019s, benefit, clearly cannot repair the defect in her claim of a quarter century of separate living. Judge Edelstein in his comprehensive opinion deals adequately with the supporting administrative regulations, as well as certain inconclusive dicta in earlier district court cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
