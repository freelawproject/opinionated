The Board, upon undisputed evidentiary facts, found that petitioner\u2019s prohibition of the wearing of union badges by its employees was not justified by exceptional circumstances. See Republic Aviation Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 1945, 324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372; Boeing Airplane Co. v. N. L.R.B., 9 Cir., 1954, 217 F.2d 369, especially 374-375. While this court might not have so found, there is, viewing the record as a whole, substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding. Cf. N.L.R. B. v. Hudson Motor Car Co., 6 Cir., 1942, 128 F.2d 528. The Board\u2019s order, in'the usual form, was a reasonable exercise of its powers. See N.L.R.B. v. Mackay Radio &amp; Tel. Co., 1938, 304 U.S. 333, 348, 58 S.Ct. 904, 82 L.Ed. 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">It Is Ordered that the Board\u2019s order be and it hereby is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
