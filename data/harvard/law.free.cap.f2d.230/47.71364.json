Section 8(b) (4) (C) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 141-142, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (C), makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to encourage employees to strike with the object of requiring an employer to recognize or bargain with a particular labor organization as the representative of employees, if \u201canother labor organization\u201d has been certified as the representative of such employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The Board ordered the Union (Bon-naz) and its officers to cease encouraging employees of Gemsco to strike with the object of requiring Gemsco to recognize or bargain with the Union. The Union asks us to set aside this order and the Board asks us to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Section 2(5) of the Act defines \u201clabor organization\u201d as \u201cany organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.\u201d 61 Stat. 138, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(5). Ann Sabino obviously is not, in any literal sense, such an organization, agency, committee, or plan. It does not appear that she is even acting for such an organization, agency, committee, or plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\"> Whether an individual in the position of Ann Sabino ought to be included in the protection given by \u00a7 8(b) (4) (C) is a question for Congress. The Board concedes that \u201cwhen in other portions of the Act, Congress desired to encompass an individual representative as well as a formal labor organization, it has either used both terms in the disjunctive or the word \u2018representative\u2019.\u201d Congress did neither in \u00a7 8(b) (4) (C). It used the words \u201clabor organization\u201d alone. We think these words cannot reasonably be interpreted to include Ann Sabino. Their plain meaning does not, in the present case, produce an absurd result or one plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">Since \u00a7 8(b) (4) (C) does not support the Board\u2019s order, and the order has no other support, it must be set aside. We need not consider petitioners' other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">Order set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
