Such action shall be brought in the district court of the United States * * *. As part of its answer the Administrator shall file a certified copy of the transcript of the record including the evidence upon which the findings and decision complained of are based. The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Administrator, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing. <em>The findings of the Administrator as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, </em>shall be conclusive * * *1\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">This appeal pivots solely on the problem of \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d with Teder insisting his claim for old-age insurance benefits was justified by that caliber demonstration, and the government, equally insistent, asserting that the Appeals Council's findings meets the statutory standard of \u00a7 205(g). Initially the Bureau of Old Age and Survivors\u2019 Insurance disallowed Teder\u2019s claim on the ground he was not fully insured; this disallowance was reaffirmed upon reconsideration. At Teder\u2019s request he was granted a hearing before a referee, who after receiving parol and documentary evidence decided that Teder \u201cshould be credited with six quarters of coverage\u201d and accordingly qualified for the benefits claimed. Subsequently the referee\u2019s decision was reversed by the Appeals Council upon a review commenced on its own motion. Teder was permitted to introduce evidence in support of his contentions, and he himself appeared at one of two supplemental hearings. There is absent any question whatever on pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>cedural phases of Teder\u2019s claim as it moved through the various administrative levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">When the district judge held that the Appeals Council decision complied with \u00a7 405(g), he had before him briefs of the parties and a certified copy of the transcript of record including the evidence upon which the findings and conclusions complained of were based. We agree with the district judge\u2019s ruling. Our basis for disposing of Teder\u2019s appeal rests squarely on the italicized language, already quoted from \u00a7 405(g). See Hobby v. Hodges, 10 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 754; United States v. LaLone, 9 Cir., 1945, 152 F.2d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">To qualify for the benefits he claimed, Teder sought to establish that he was self-employed, as a dealer of rare medical books, from January 1, 1951 through December 31, 1951, and that during the months of January through June 1952 he had been employed \u201cas a sort of store detective for * * * a gasoline service station * * * \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record we have carefully canvassed consists primarily of evidentiary materials underlying the Council\u2019s decision, which Teder would have us overturn by his attack leveled at the Council\u2019s view, evaluation and interpretation of such evidence. We decline to do so under the statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\">.

Folsom, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare was substituted, by order of the district judge, as party defendant for Oveta Culp Hobby, predecessor Secretary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-11\">. \u201cAll functions of the Federal Security Administrator were transferred to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and all agencies of the Federal Security Agency were transferred to' the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare by section 5 of 1953 Reorg.

Brief of plaintiff Teder at page 6. The texture of Teder\u2019s viewpoint in this appeal is suggested by the following passage from his brief and argument at page 12:</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b439-9\">SCHNACKENBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A5u\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The record before us shows that the district court affirmed the decision of the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The record further shows that the district court dismissed Teder\u2019s complaint. This latter action was improper under the statute quoted in the foregoing opinion, and is surplusage.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">\u201cIt is further submitted that the record clearly indicates an attempt on the part of the administration, acting through the Appeals Council, to deprive the plaintiff of the benefits he had earned. It is clearly implied throughout the hearing that the Social Security Administration does not like people who deliberately go out to qualify for social security benefits. We may fairly infer that the Appeals Council decided to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>view the decision of the Referee, principally because the claimant frankly admitted that he went to work in order to qualify for benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
