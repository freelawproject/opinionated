UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b921-6\">No. 15880.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b921-7\">United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b921-8\">March 16, 1956.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b921-14\">Danny Allen Davis, in pro. per.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b921-15\">William 0. Braecklein, Asst. U. S. Atty., Dallas, Tex., Heard L. Floore, U. S. Atty., Fort Worth, Tex., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b921-16\">Before HUTCHESON, Chief Judge, and RIVES and BROWN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b921-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b921-18\">Under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 appellant questioned the validity of his conviction for possessing a narcotic drug in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2553(a) and five year sentence as a second offender under 26 U.S.CiA. \u00a7 2557(b) (1). Upon arraignment, appellant refused the appointment of counsel and pleaded guilty. The following then occurred</p>\n<p id=\"b921-20\">\u201cThe Court: We will impose a sentence of two years, United States Prison, by the Attorney General, with hospitalization recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-21\">\u201cMr. Binion: Your Honor, there is an information that has been filed by Mr. West showing a prior conviction under the Boggs Act, and therefore \u2014 under the Boggs, it would be give (sic) years minimum, Your Honor. This is a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-22\">\u201cThe Court: Call his attention to it and see if he denies it.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-23\">\u201cMr. Binion: Do you deny this prior conviction as alleged in the information filed herein ?</p>\n<p id=\"b921-24\">\u201cMr. Davis: I didn\u2019t do narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-25\">\u201cMr. Binion: Read it to him, Bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-26\">\u201cMr. West: It says here in our information that on March 23, 1950, at Dallas that you were arrested for violation of the Marijuana Tax Act and on May 11, 1950 you were sentenced to two years and released on December 18, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-27\">\u201cMr. Binion: Do you admit that?</p>\n<p id=\"b921-28\">\u201cMr. Davis: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-29\">\u201cThe Court: Being arraigned a second time on the matter, I believe you say the minimum would be five ?</p>\n<p id=\"b921-30\">\u201cMr. Binion: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-31\">\u201cThe Court: I was thinking the minimum would be ten in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-32\">\u201cMr. Binion: No, that is a third.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-33\">\u201cThe Court: A third offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b921-34\">\u201cMr. Binion: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-35\">\u201cThe Court: All right, we will have to impose a sentence of five years in this matter but we will still recommend hospitalization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-36\">The burden of appellant\u2019s complaint is that after his prior conviction had been called to the attention of the Court, he was not again offered the aid of counsel, the appellant relying on Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 and Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461. We do not think that those decisions nor any other require that the offer of counsel be repeated because of the more severe punishment made necessary by the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Appellant does not even yet claim that he was innocent of either the first or second offense. He received the minimum sentence for the second offense. It is difficult to see how counsel could have helped him any more than did the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
