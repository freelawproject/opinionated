This error in citation of the statute alleged to have been violated did not mislead the accused to his prejudice, and so is not ground for reversal of the conviction. Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. Rule 7(c), 18 U.S.C.; United States v. Hutcheson, 1941, 312 U.S. 219, 229, 61 S.Ct. 463, 85 L.Ed. 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The alleged criminal act took place on appellant\u2019s ranch located within the exterior boundaries of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Appellant\u2019s title was acquired by tax deed from Glacier County, Montana, without express reservation of any Federal jurisdiction over the land. 43 Stat. 252 (1924); Goudy v. Meath, 1906, 203 U.S. 146, 27 S.Ct. 48, 51 L.Ed. 130; Glacier County, Montana v. United States, 9 Cir., 1938, 99 F.2d 733; cf. Williams v. United States, 9 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 1, certiorari denied 1955, 348 U.S. 938, 75 S.Ct. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">This circumstance, appellant urges, places the alleged offense beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2032 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-14\">\u201cWhoever, within the special * * * territorial jurisdiction of the United States, carnally knows any female * * * \u201d shall be guilty of an offense. The \u201cspecial * * * territorial jurisdiction of the United States\u201d is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(3) as including \u201cAny lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof * * * <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">The gist of appellant\u2019s contention is that Federal jurisdiction is lacking because the land on which the offense was found to have occurred is not within the \u201cspecial * * * jurisdiction of the United States\u201d as defined above in 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 7(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-19\">However, appellant admits that the land in question is located in \u201cIndian country\u201d within the meaning of 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 1151. Appellant\u2019s ranch must then be held to comprise a part of \u201clands reserved * * * for the use of the United States\u201d within the meaning of 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 7(3). Cf. United States v. Petersen, 9 Cir., 191 F.2d 154, certiorari denied sub nom. State of California v. U. S., 1951, 342 U.S. 885, 72 S.Ct. 174, 96 L.Ed. 664. And 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152 declares that \u201c * * * the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the * * * exclusive jurisdiction of the United States * * * shall extend to the Indian country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-21\"> Thus appellant\u2019s ranch, being located in \u201cIndian country\u201d, is on \u201clands reserved * * * for the use of the United States, and under exclusive * * jurisdiction thereof\u201d, within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(3). The offense must therefore be held to have been committed within the \u201cspecial * * * territorial jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>of the United States\u201d as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2032. Hence the District Court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Other claimed grounds for reversal are advanced by appellant, but are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
