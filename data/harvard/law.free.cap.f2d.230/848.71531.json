[See: Gold Reserve Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 337, 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 440; 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 95a, 213; Executive Order 6260, as amended 12 U.S.C.A. following \u00a7 95a; United States Treasury Department Gold Regulations, 31 CFR, Part 54, \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-55.2, 19 F.R. 4309-4316 (1954).]</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Stated in summary, the allegations of appellant\u2019s complaint are: that she is a substantial owner of certain patented lode mining claims in Grant County, Oregon; that \u201cin the past said mine has been greatly developed and large quantities of gold have been extracted therefrom\u201d; that \u201cat present approximately 243,000 tons of ore are blocked out therein, but said ore cannot be economically processed at the present arbitrary price set for gold\u201d; that the Government has fixed \u201can arbitrary and artificial price of 35 irredeemable and inconvertible paper dollars per troy ounce of fine gold as the authorized price for the purchase and sale of gold\u201d; that \u201cin the free markets of the world the price of fine gold has been and now is greatly in excess of $35.00 per troy ounce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Appellant further alleges that the statutes and regulations requiring that gold recovered from natural deposits in the United States be sold to a Government mint at $35.00 per ounce, less mint charges, deprive appellant of her property \u201cwithout due process of law and without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution in that they allow condemnation and acquisition of gold at a price other than the fair value\u201d; that \u201cduring the last two years\u201d these statutes and regulations have prevented appellant \u201cfrom charging a price for her gold sufficient to render the operation of her mine economically feasible\u201d, and have caused appellant\u2019s gold mine \u201cto depreciate in value and to remain closed\u201d, and have \u201cdirectly and proximately resulted in a loss of profits to her and a depreciation in value of her said property in excess of $10,000, all to her damage in said sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The Government moved to dismiss on three grounds: (1) that the complaint \u201cfails to allege facts sufficient to establish jurisdiction * * * over the * * * United States of America\u201d, Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. rule 12(b) (2), 28 U.S. C.A.; (2) that the action is barred by the six-year period of limitations specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a); and (3) that the complaint \u201cfails to state a claim or cause of action upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 12(b) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(a) (2), contending that Government action under the gold program amounts to a \u201ctaking\u201d of appellant\u2019s property for which \u201cjust compensation\u201d is due under the Fifth Amendment. Cf. Central Eureka Mining Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 1956, 138 F.Supp. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">The United States of America, as sovereign, has consented to be sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(a) (2), says appellant, in cases \u201cwhere private property is taken * * * in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, but without condemnation proceedings.\u201d Jacobs v. United States, 1933, 290 U.S. 13, 54 S.Ct. 26, 78 L.Ed. 142; United States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co., 1884, 112 U.S. 645, 5 S.Ct. 306, 28 L.Ed. 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>True, but such consent is limited to cases where the alleged taking is lawfully authorized and the claimed damages proximately result from an exercise of the power of eminent domain. United States v. North American Transportation &amp; Trading Co., 1920, 253 U.S. 330, 40 S.Ct. 518, 64 L.Ed. 935; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., 1919, 251 U.S. 146, 40 S.Ct. 106, 64 L.Ed. 194; Legal Tender Cases, 1870, 12 Wall. 457, 79 U.S. 457, 551, 20 L.Ed. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Upon dismissing appellant\u2019s action for want of jurisdiction, the District Court expressed the view that the complaint did not present a case of a taking of property within the purview of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">We do not reach that question, being of the opinion that consent previously given in the Tucker Act or otherwise to sue the Government on a claim such as asserted by appellant here was expressly withdrawn by the Act of August 27, 1935. 49 Stat. 938, 939, 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 773b. This Act provides that: \u201cAny consent which the United States may have given to the assertion against it of any right * * * in any proceeding of any nature whatsoever * * * upon any claim or demand arising out of any surrender, requisition, seizure, or acquisition of any * * * gold * * * and involving the eifect or validity of any * * * regulation of the value of money, is withdrawn -* * * \u00bb&gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">It appears to us beyond question that in the complaint at bar appellant asserts a claim or cause of action arising out of an alleged \u201csurrender, requisition,, seizure, or acquisition\u201d by the Government of appellant\u2019s gold, and \u201cinvolving the eifect or validity of * * * regulation [s] of the value of money\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">It is axiomatic that: \u201cConsent alone gives jurisdiction to adjudge against a sovereign.\u201d United States v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 1940, 309 U.S. 506, 514, 60 S.Ct. 653, 657, 84 L.Ed. 894. This is so, even in cases grounded upon alleged violations by the Government of Federal Constitutional rights. Schillinger v. United States, 1894, 155 U.S. 163, 168, 15 S.Ct. 85, 39 L.Ed. 108. And it is equally well settled that \u201cthe power to withdraw the privilege of suing the United States or its instrumentalities knows no limitations.\u201d Maricopa County v. Valley Nat. Bank, 1943, 318 U.S. 357, 362, 63 S.Ct. 587, 589, 87 L.Ed. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">The order of the District Court is modified to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rules 12(b) (2) and 41(b); and as so modified the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
