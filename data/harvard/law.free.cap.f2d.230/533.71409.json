As a claim seeking judgment for the money, the District Court was right in its order of dismissal. Acker v. United States, 5 Cir., 226 F.2d 575. The assertion, now made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>on the appeal, that it was likewise an effort to review the correctness of the Administrator\u2019s action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq., fares no better since Section 10, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009, specifically excepts administrative actions when the \u201c(1) statutes preclude judicial review * * While the Congressional intention to preclude judicial review of administrative action must be clearly and positively reflected, Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 73 S.Ct. 603, 97 L.Ed. 972, cf. Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591, 99 L.Ed. 868, and Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 75 S.Ct. 757, 99 L.Ed. 1107, that standard is met here both by the intrinsic nature of this as an act of pure gratuity from the sovereign\u2019s grace, Acker v. United States, supra, and the categorical declaration that, except for certain specified matters for which a judicial remedy is created, the Administrator\u2019s decision on all questions of law or fact concerning a claim for benefits or payments under any act administered by the Veterans Administration shall be final, conclusive and beyond the power of any court to review. 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11a-2, Brasier v. United States, 8 Cir., 223 F.2d 762, and see Federal Power Commission v. Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 348 U.S. 492, 499, 500, 75 S.Ct. 467, 99 L.Ed. 583, 592, 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
