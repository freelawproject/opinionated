S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq., of the notation \u201cRotomist\u201d for agricultural and horticultural spraying and dusting machines in class 23, cutlery, machinery, and tools, and parts thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-27\">Appellee alleged March 20, 1948, as. the date of first use of the involved mark in the commerce among the several states. The application was examined and passed for publication pursuant to Section 12(a) of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1062(a), and the mark was duly -published in the Official Gazette on October 16, 1951. On No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>vember 13, 1951, appellant filed its notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In the notice of opposition, appellant alleged that it is the owner of TradeMark Registration No. 195,745, dated March 3, 1925, for the mark \u201cMisty\u201d for sprayers for agricultural and horticultural spraying and dusting in class 23, <em>supra, </em>and registration No. 340,866, dated November 24, 1936 for the mark \u201cRoto-Power,\u201d the suffix \u201cPower\u201d being disclaimed apart from the mark, for machines for disseminating insecticidal dust for agricultural and horticultural spraying and dusting in class 23, <em>supra. </em>It was also alleged that appellant\u2019s goods bearing the involved marks have been extensively advertised and widely sold throughout the United States; and that its marks have great trade-mark value and have become generally known to the public as designating and identifying the goods of appellant. Appellant also alleges that the goods of the parties are of the same descriptive properties, are normally sold to the same class of customers, and that use by appellee of its mark \u201cRotomist\u201d on its goods will result in great and irreparable damage to op-poser.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Appellee took no testimony and offered no evidence. Both parties filed briefs and were represented at final arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Various issues have been raised, but in view of our opinion as hereinafter set forth, it is necessary to consider only the issue of confusing similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The law pertinent to the issue of confusing similarity in the instant case is set out in the case of L. J. Mueller Furnace Co. v. United Conditioning Corporation, 222 F.2d 755, 757, 42 C.C.P.A., Patents, 932, wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cThe test applied by this court in an opposition proceeding is the likelihood of confusion in the minds of the purchasing public as to the origin of the goods. Nestle\u2019s Milk Products, Inc., v. Baker Importing Co., Inc., 182 F.2d 193, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1066; Standard Laboratories, Inc., v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., 167 F.2d 1022, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1146. This is a subjective test. Therefore prior decisions are of little value since each case must be decided on its own particular set of facts. North Star Manufacturing Co. v. Wells Lamont Corp., 193 F.2d 204, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 764.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">\u201cHowever, various rules have been developed for the purpose of aiding in the determination of the question of confusing similarity. It is well settled that the marks must be considered in their entireties. Apollo Shirt Co. v. Enro Shirt Co., Inc., 165 F.2d 469, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 849. Valpo Co., v. Solis, Entrialgo y. Compania, 175 F.2d 457, 36 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1160. But different features may be analyzed to determine whether the marks are confusingly similar, Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc., v. Kawerk, 148 F.2d 557, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 954, and similarities and dissimilarities should both be considered, Younghusband v. Kurlash Co., Inc., 94 F. 2d 230, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 886.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">\u201cIt has also been held that common portions of the marks cannot be disregarded, Schering &amp; Glatz, Inc., v. Sharp &amp; Dohme, Inc., 146 F.2d 1019, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 827, * * * \"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">It is our opinion, applying the above-quoted criteria for determining similarity to the marks before us, when the individual marks, \u201cRotomist\u201d and \u201cRoto-Power,\u201d are viewed in their entireties, they do not look alike, or sound alike. We are of the same opinion relative to the marks \u201cRotomist\u201d and \u201cMisty.\u201d Although the common portion \u201cRoto\u201d of appellant\u2019s mark \u201cRoto-Power\u201d and appellee\u2019s mark \u201cRotomist\u201d is identical, the dissimilarities of the marks must be considered. The dissimilar portions of the marks, \u201cPower\u201d and \u201cMist,\u201d in our opinion, are sufficiently different to cause the marks in their entireties to be more dissimilar than similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Appellant contends that the term \u201cRotomist\u201d is confusingly similar to the combination of terms \u201cRoto-Power\u201d and \u201cMisty\u201d in that appellee has taken the word \"Roto,\u201d which appellant considers the dominant part of its mark \u201cRoto-Power,\u201d and has added as a suffix the word \u201cMist,\u201d which appellant considers the dominant part of its mark \u201cMisty,\u201d in order to form the mark \u201cRotomist,\u201d citing Parke, Davis <em>&amp; Co. </em>v. G. F. Harvey Co., 141 F.2d 132, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 879. In that case the applicant took the first syllable, \u201cDigi,\u201d of one of opposer\u2019s marks \u201cDigifortis\u201d and combined it with the second syllable, \u201cSeals,\u201d of opposer\u2019s other mark \u201cKapseals\u201d to form applicant\u2019s mark of \u201cDigiseals.\u201d The opposer had been using both marks combined, \u201cKapseals Digifortis,\u201d as one mark on goods identical to applicant\u2019s goods, and under those circumstances the court held the marks to be confusingly similar. Here appellant has not used its marks \u201cRoto-Power\u201d and \u201cMisty\u201d combined as one mark. We agree with appellee\u2019s contention that in Parke, Davis &amp; Co. v. G. F. Harvey Co., supra, the court\u2019s ruling represents \u201ca consideration of the trade-mark rights established in the compound mark and not a ruling upon the propriety of combining parts of two different marks in order to create a compound mark, not previously used by opposer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s brief and the cases cited therein. However, we are of the opinion that the f oregoing application of the law is determinative of the issues in the present case, and that the other points raised by appellant need not be considered. We do not think the concurrent use of the marks on the goods of the parties is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Therefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, recalled to participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
