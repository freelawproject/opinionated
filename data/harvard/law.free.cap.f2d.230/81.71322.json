It is engaged in an industry affecting commerce and hence subject to Federal legislation relating to labor. Textile Workers Union of America, CIO, the plaintiff below, is an unin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>corporated association and labor organization. We will refer to the parties, for brevity and clarity, as Employer and Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">In chronological sequence, the facts from which this controversy developed were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">A written collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Employer was executed June 27, 1953, to continue until July 3, 1954, and for one-year terms thereafter unless written notice of termination should be mailed by either party to the other sixty days prior to the end of the current term, in which event the agreement would terminate at the end of the current term. Article VIII of the agreement set up procedures to be followed in the adjustment of grievances, and provided that if a grievance had not been adjusted by the Article VIII procedures within the time specified, the party presenting the grievance should be governed by the provisions of Article IX(F) of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">By Article IX of the agreement the parties agreed that the contract grievance procedures were adequate to provide a fair and final determination of all grievances arising under the terms of the agreement. The desire of the parties to avoid strikes and work stoppages was recited. Paragraphs (A) to (E) inclusive of Article IX contained \u201cno-strike\u201d provisions. In Paragraph (F) of Article IX, of the agreement it was provided that any disagreement or dispute, arising from the operation or interpretation of the agreement, pertaining to wages, rates of pay, hours of work or other conditions of employment which had not been satisfactorily adjusted within the time limited, might be submitted to arbitration by the giving of written notice within ten days after the expiration of the applicable time limit. It was further provided that if the parties did not agree upon an arbitrator, the American Arbitration Association should be requested to furnish the names of five qualified arbitrators and the parties should alternately strike one name each from the list until a single name remained and the person so designated should serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The Union filed with the Employer seven grievances on June 23, 1954, and three grievances on June 24, 1954, all of which were of the type specified in Article IX (F). The Employer followed the procedures of the agreement up to the point of rejecting the claims, the rejections <em>being </em>made at various dates on and subsequent to July 14, 1954. Pursuant to timely notice given pursuant to its terms, the agreement terminated on July 3, 1954. The Union requested the Employer to submit the grievances to arbitration pursuant to Article IX (F) of the agreement. The Employer refused to do so. Thereafter the Union brought this suit against the Employer asking that the Employer be required to submit the grievances to arbitration and praying for damages. The District Court declined to award damages to the Union, saying that none were proven, hut decreed that the Employer submit the grievances to arbitration as provided in Article IX (F) of the agreement. Jurisdiction was found under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Presented for our consideration are questions which may be substantive as well as procedural. Since there is no diversity of ciizenship apparent we are, at the outset, required to ascertain whether there is a basis for Federal jurisdiction. The Congress has provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">\u201cSuits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce * * xnay be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties\u201d. Sec. 301 (a), Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aim\">This grant has given Federal courts jurisdiction for the consideration and determination of questions such as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>one presented in this case. It has given to Federal courts the power to adjudicate, where a violation of a contract is asserted, causes of action between employers and labor organizations and to determine whether or not a cause of action exists in a particular ease. It does not follow, though, from the existence of the judicial power to determine a cause of action or controversy that the right asserted has legal sanction. It does not follow from the grant of jurisdiction to hear a litigant in a Federal forum that rights have been created or remedies provided which are denied to others. That there is a right to seek relief in a Federal court does not mean that the relief sought is necessarily available. More specifically, our question is whether Section 301, taken in context, requires or permits the enforcement of an executory covenant for the submission to arbitration of grievances pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between a union and an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The provisions of the contract between the parties to this appeal from which spring the problems presented are not novel, yet we do not find that the precise point presented has heretofore been considered by an appellate court. In the absence of statute it is the general rule that executory contracts to submit disputes to arbitration will not be specifically enforced. Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 1924, 264 U.S. 109, 44 S.Ct. 274, 68 L.Ed. 582. Tejas Development Co. v. McGough Bros., 5 Cir., 1947, 165 F.2d 276. Such is the rule as found by the framers of the Restatement of the Law. Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 550 (1932). The Supreme Court of Alabama, announcing the rule, has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">\u201cThe courts are almost unanimous in declaring that equity will not decree specific performance of a contract to submit a cause to arbitration, while it will, in proper cases, entertain a bill to enforce an award.\u201d Ex parte Birmingham Fire Ins. Co., 1937, 233 Ala. 370, 172 So. 99, 101.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">If there be a right to specific performance of an arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement we must find it in an act of Congress. The Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101 et seq., does not preclude the granting of the relief sought. Graham v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, 1949, 338 U.S. 232, 70 S.Ct. 14, 94 L.Ed. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The United States Arbitration Act expressly provides that nothing therein \u201ccontained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In Section 2 it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\u201cA written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d July 30, 1947, c. 392, \u00a7 1, 61 Stat. 669, 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Section 3 of the Arbitration Act provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">\u201cIf any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ment, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d 9 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The Arbitration Act also provides that courts of the United States may direct arbitration in accordance with the terras of written agreements. 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit has had a number of occasions to consider the application of the Arbitration Act to collective bargaining agreements, and we cannot reconcile its views as expressed in its several opinions. It first held that the stay of proceedings provisions in Section 3 of the Act applied in a class suit for unpaid over-time compensation claimed under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq. Donahue v. Susquehanna Collieries Co., 3 Cir., 1943, 138 F.2d 3, 149 A.L.R. 271. Section 1 of the Arbitration Act, containing the exclusion clause was set forth in a footnote but was not mentioned in the opinion. The Donahue case, supra, was followed in Watkins v. Hudson Coal Co., 3 Cir., 1945, 151 F.2d 311, certiorari denied 327 U.S. 777, 66 S.Ct. 522, 90 L.Ed. 1005, where it was said that the exclusion clause of Section 1 was not an over-all limitation. On a second appeal of the Donahue case a stay of proceedings was directed pursuant to Section 3 until arbitration was had. Donahue v. Susquehanna Collieries Co., 3 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 661. The same result was reached in Evans v. Hudson Coal Co., 3 Cir., 1948, 165 F.2d 970. Before the next consideration of the question by the Third Circuit, Congress had reenacted the United States Arbitration Act and had included in the reenactment the following catch line of Section 1, \u201c \u2018Maritime Transactions\u2019 and \u2018Commerce\u2019 Defined; Exceptions to Operation of Title\u201d. Act of July 30, 1947, H.R. 2084, ch. 392, 61 Stat. 669. This, thought the court, in the next case before it, indicated a congressional intent that the exclusion in Section 1 applied to the entire Act, and it was held that collective bargaining agreements were \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Amalgamated Ass\u2019n, etc. v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, 3 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 310. This was followed in Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines v. Amalgamated Ass\u2019n, 3 Cir., 1951, 193 F.2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">In the most recent of the Third Circuit cases which we have noted, it was said by a divided court that a collective bargaining agreement between an employer producing goods for subsequent sale in interstate commerce, as is the employer in the case before us, and a union, is within the meaning of a contract in an \u201cindustry affecting commerce\u201d as used in Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, but that such a contract is not one of \u201c \u2018employment of * * * workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u2019 \u201d within the exclusion clause of Section 1 of the Arbitration Act. A majority of the court reconciled the decision with the prior holdings by saying that the two Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines cases involved employees engaged in interstate transportation, excluded by Section 1, and that the other earlier cases involved employees producing goods for subsequent resale in commerce, and not covered, said the court, by the exclusion clause. Two of the judges thought that collective bargaining agreements were not \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d within the purview of Section 1 of the Arbitration Act, and were of the belief that the Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines cases should be expressly overruled. Two judges dissented. The court directed the granting of a stay pending arbitration. Tenney Engineering, Inc., v. United Electrical R. &amp; M. Workers, 3 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 450, 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The Fourth Circuit departs from the Third Circuit and has held that the Arbitration Act does not authorize enforcement of arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements. Speaking for the Court and referring to Section 1 of the Arbitration Act, Chief Judge Parker has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">\u201cArt. I of that Act of February 12, 1925, c. 213, as reenacted by the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of July 30, 1947, c. 392, 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1, contains nothing but definitions of \u2018maritime transactions\u2019 and \u2018commerce\u2019 and an excepting clause; and we think it clear that the excepting clause was intended to apply to the entire act.\u201d International Union, etc., v. Colonial Hardwood Floor Co., 4 Cir., 1948, 168 F.2d 33, 35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The Colonial Hardwood case was followed in United Electrical R. &amp; M. Workers v. Miller Metal Products, 4 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">It seems to us that the Sixth Circuit originally reached the same conclusion as had been pronounced in the Fourth. In a well reasoned opinion by Judge Hamilton wherein the first Donahue case, supra, is criticized, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">\u201cThe scope of the exception or proviso in the statute must be gathered from the view of the whole law, and if the language of the exception is in perfect harmony with the general scope of the entire statute, the exclusion is applicable to the whole act. It is clear that the exception here in question was deliberately worded by the Congress to exclude from the National Arbitration Act all contracts of employment of workers engaged in interstate commerce. Section 2 of the Act makes valid and irrevocable all arbitration agreements in writing to submit to arbitration future controversies arising out of the contract of which the arbitration agreement was a part. It would be senseless to say that the exclusion from the Act covers the validity of the contract, but excludes the stay provision of Section 3. The reason for the exclusion is applicable to the entire Act. The language of the exclusion \u2018herein contained\u2019 is found in the first section of the Act. This section is made up entirely of definitions and exceptions to the operation of the title. \u2018Herein\u2019 as used in legal phraseology is a locative adverb and its meaning is to be determined by the context. It may refer to the section, the chapter or the entire enactment in which it is used. The fact that it was used in the present Act in a section where none of the substantive matter set up in the succeeding sections of the Act appeared must mean that it is to be applied to the whole Act and not to any given section. There can be no doubt that the contract in issue is a contract of employment. Appellant insists that the exception relates only to the subject specified in the title. If we give full weight to appellant\u2019s contention, its argument must fail because the title not only states that its purpose is to make valid arbitration contracts but also to make them enforceable. Section 3 sets up one of the methods of enforcement.\u201d Gatliff Coal Co. v. Cox, 6 Cir., 1944, 142 F.2d 876, 882.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">But in a later case from the Sixth Circuit the court notes the conflicts. It adhered to its earlier view that the exclusion proviso of Section 1 of the United States Arbitration Act applies to the entire act, but it held that the collective bargaining agreement before it was a trade agreement and not a \u201ccontract of employment\u201d within the exclusion clause. Hoover Motor Express Co. v. Teamsters, Chauffeurs, etc., 6 Cir., 1954, 217 F.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">As to the effect of the United States Arbitration Act in the case before us, we align ourselves with the Fourth Circuit and hold that the collective bargaining agreement before us is a \u201ccontract of employment\u201d within the meaning of the Arbitration Act and as such is excluded from the application of the act by its express terms. The earlier cases and their effect are commented upon in 17 Law and Contemporary Problems 580, and 65 Harv.L.Rev. 1238. Though the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not preclude, the United States Arbitration Act does not authorize the judicial enforcement of a contractual undertaking to submit to arbitration grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>This brings us to the question of whether Section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185(a), hereinbefore quoted, provides for the enforcement of a provision for arbitration contained in a collective bargaining contract between an employer and a labor organization of employees engaged in producing goods for subsequent sale in interstate commerce. The Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit has given us, as dictum perhaps, a succinct answer to the query. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\u201cThis statute [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185 (a)] is for the purpose only of giving jurisdiction to the federal courts in cases involving labor contracts. It does not give the federal courts any different or additional power than a state court would have if the action had been brought here\u201d. Mercury Oil Refining Co. v. Oil Workers Int. Union, CIO, 10 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 980, 983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In a decision from the Second Circuit it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">\u201cBut \u00a7 301 * * * created a remedy where none existed before and provided a forum in which to enforce it.\u201d Shirley-Herman Co. v. International Hod Carriers, etc., 2 Cir., 1950, 182 F.2d 806, 809, 17 A.L. R.2d 609.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">In the Shirley-Herman case the remedy to which reference was made as being created by the statute was the right to sue a labor union as such and the right of unions to bring and maintain judicial actions. We think it unnecessary to consider other decisions of the Courts of Appeal or enter upon a review of District Court cases, of which there are a number. The answer to this phase of our inquiry is to be found, we think, in the opinions of the Supreme Court in Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 1955, 348 U.S. 437, 75 S.Ct. 489, 494, 99 L.Ed. 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Perhaps it cannot fairly be said that the ratio decidendi of the Westinghouse case is more than that a Federal District Court does not have jurisdiction under Section 301 over an action brought by a union against an employer under a collective bargaining agreement on behalf of employees for wages which the employer refused to pay and which refusal the union asserted was in violation of the agreement. But in the several opinions we find a guide for our decision. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, with whose views Justices Burton and Minton concurred, found that if the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule of construction could be applied, then all Section 301 does is to give procedural directions to the Federal courts to treat labor unions as natural or corporate persons in actions involving collective bargaining agreements, and to do so regardless of the amount in controversy and not to require diversity of citizenship. In considering the intent of Congress, Mr. Justice Frankfurter found that its aim was to open the Federal Courts to such suits solely because they were between the union and employers, but without providing any Federal law other than procedural for such suits. \u201cIt was evident\u201d, said Mr. Justice Frankfurter, \u201cthat the specific desire was to remove procedural obstacles to suit by and against the union.\u201d He quoted Senator Taft, in proposing an amendment approximating \u00a7 301, as saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">\u201c \u2018 * * * All we provide in the amendment is that voluntary associations shall in effect be suable as if they were corporations, and sua-ble in the Federal courts if the contract involves interstate commerce and therefore involves a Federal question.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">A question was raised by Mr. Justice Frankfurter as to whether the construction dictated by the \u201c \u2018plain meaning rule\u2019 \u201d and by the intent of Congress could be placed within the constitutional restriction of Federal jurisdiction to cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, etc., U.S.Const. Art. III, \u00a7 2. It was necessary, thought Mr. Justice Frankfurter, to limit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>scope of the Act as \u201cdoubtful legislation\u201d. The Court of Appeals, in its consideration of the Westingh\u00f3use case, had proceeded upon the so-called \u201ceclectic theory\u201d that the collective bargaining agreement is not of itself a contract of hiring, that each employee makes with the employer a separate contract of hiring from which stems the obligation to pay wages, and that, while Section 301 creates \u201ca federal substantive right\u201d, there is jurisdiction only of causes of action between a union and an employer. Since the Court of Appeals did not regard a breach of the obligation to pay wages as creating a cause of action in the union, it rejected Federal jurisdiction. Association of Westinghouse Salaried Emp. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 3 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 623, 625. Mr. Justice Frankfurter disagreed with the Court of Appeals, and indicated his view to be that no new federal law concepts of contractual interpretation were intended by the enactment of Section 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, joined by Mr. Justice Clark, concurred and were of the opinion that it was enough to say that Section 301 was not sufficiently explicit nor its legislative history sufficiently clear to indicate that Congress intended to authorize a union to enforce in a federal court the right of an employee to receive wages; and being of such opinion, they saw no reason to make labor policy or raise constitutional issues. Mr. Justice Reed also concurred in the result. He took the position that it was the intent of Congress to give federal jurisdiction over actions arising from breaches of collective bargaining agreements whether the rules of substantive law are derived from federal or state sources. He concluded, as did the Court of Appeals, that a breach of the duty to pay wages was a violation of an individual employment contract and not of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In a dissenting opinion in the Westinghouse ease, Mr. Justice Douglas, with whom Mr. Justice Black concurred, there was disagreement with the majority refusal to permit the Union to bring the suit. The minority did, however, concur in the view of Mr. Justice Reed that Congress \u201ccreated federal sanctions for collective bargaining agreements, made cases and controversies concerning them justiciable questions for the federal courts, and permitted those courts to fashion from the federal statute, from state law, or from other germane sources, federal rules for the construction and interpretation of those collective bargaining agreements\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">We have, in the case before us, a complaint by the Union that the Employer has breached a provision of a collective bargaining agreement. Out of such complaint arise a case and controversy of which the Federal courts have jurisdiction under the Constitution as implemented by Section 301. And see 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1337. But it does not follow that because jurisdiction is given to Federal courts, there is a new federal law concept that authorizes the courts to enforce submission to arbitration. Before such a result is reached, we must find a rule of law derived from state or Federal sources. We do not think it matters whether a right to enforce submission to arbitration is or is not substantive, as was considered in Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Company of America, 2 Cir., 1954, 218 F.2d 948; or whether as said by Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is, there is \u201cthe substantive right created by an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration\u201d, which he said \u201cis recognized as a perfect obligation.\u201d Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 1924, 264 U.S. 109, 44 S.Ct. 274, 277, 68 L.Ed. 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Finding nothing of Federal origin or in the laws of Alabama, of either common law or statutory enactment, or from any other source, that requires or permits, or from which we might, in the language of Mr. Justice Douglas, fashion a rule requiring or permitting, the enforcement of the covenant for arbitration of grievances, and concluding that Section 301 does not of itself provide or furnish the source for such a rule, we hold that there is no legal right to the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In the determination of the case before us, it was held that, since the grievances arose while the collective bargaining agreement was in effect, the Employer was required to arbitrate such grievances subsequent to the termination date of the agreement. Although unwilling to adopt the most recent conclusions of the Third Circuit in construing the United States Arbitration Act, we are impressed by its views with respect to the effect of the termination of a collective bargaining agreement upon Section 301 procedure. After reciting the giving of notice of termination and the failure of negotiations toward a new contract between an employer and a union, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201cThe old contract thereupon terminated pursuant to the permitted election already made manifest by timely notice as provided in the document itself. The obligation not to strike, like the other obligations of the contract ceased to exist. For this reason the complaint was properly dismissed\u201d. Paterson Parchment Paper Co. v. International Brotherhood, 3 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 252, 254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Finding as we do that compliance with a covenant for arbitration in a collective bargaining agreement will not be compelled by a Federal court judgment where the courts of the state would deny such relief, it follows that there was no enforceable right which could have been either retained or lost upon the termination of the agreement. Hence we need not and do not decide whether such a covenant would survive where, under the applicable law, such a provision might have been enforced during the term of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">It is the view of this Court that the District Court erred in not sustaining the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action because the complaint fails to state a claim against defendant upon which relief can be granted. Therefore, with a direction to sustain the motion to dismiss, the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b141-10\">BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AGv\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The majority declares plainly that the District Court had jurisdiction. It does that on the basis of \u00a7 301. With this I am in complete agreement. But applying the rationale of Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s opinion as though it was all that was said by a court of eight, \u00a7 301 is confined rigorously to the procedural concept. Finding neither state nor federal statute (apart from \u00a7 301) authorizing injunctive enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate, the majority concludes that the court with power is yet powerless to proceed \u2014 it has power but no tools \u2014 in short, the door is opened but the hall is empty. I decline to believe that power is so sterile or that \u00a7 301, if needed to bridge any gaps, exhausts itself by opening the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">On jurisdiction I would spell out what seems implicit in the majority opinion: This is, on all tests, a <em>union </em>controversy in which the union is asserting in its collective capacity a demand relating to all of the employees as a group, on the one hand, and the employer, as such on the other. It is not the assertion, through name or guise of the union, of a single claim for one or the aggregation of many single claims for all arising under the individual contracts of employment, as such, between employee and employer. Arbitration, as the last step in the grievance machinery, is in explicit terms the undertaking<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of union and employer, and by its nature, its force and hence effectiveness, is derived from em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ployer and union pledging that each will be bound. It is, we all agree,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> therefore a case for \u00a7 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">What law was then to be applied? Side-stepping the engaging prospect of divining the mathematical probabilities of decision on this point amongst Justices splitting on a 3-2-1-2 combination, the court determines that under neither Alabama nor Federal law is there a right to enforce arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">I am willing here to accept this cautious approach and assume that Alabama <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> will not specifically enforce an agreement to arbitrate and that the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1, is not available<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or effective to supply the federal statutory mechanics for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">But the studied search for a federal statute, the painstaking analysis of the cases under it, demonstrates, I think, a misconception of the fundamentals. It is as though we were dealing with a court having statutory power only. But that is not the case. The United States District Court is a constitutional organ with the intrinsic capacity to grant traditional coercive relief as the cause over which it has jurisdiction may require. Williamson v. Berry, 8 How. 495, 536, 12 L.Ed. 1170, 1187, \u201cJurisdiction in chancery is inherent and original, comprehending now almost every exigency of human disagreement, for which there is not an adequate remedy at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">Judge Goodrich in the recent opinion in Johnston v. Marsh, 3 Cir., 227 F.2d 528, 530, finding ample inherent power to grant bail even though no statute can be found described both this full power to act once the court acquires jurisdiction [here by virtue of \u00a7 301] and the basic misconception that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>district court can do only that which some statute permits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">\u201cThe statement is often made that the inferior courts of the United States are courts of limited jurisdiction. This is a truism in one sense. These courts are competent to act in such cases, and only in such cases, as the Congress, pursuant to the Constitution, assigns to them. And unless constitutional provisions stand in the way, the assignment may be varied at the will of Congress. But within the area of activity assigned to them, Federal courts are courts of full stature, and we may rightly look to common law concepts and precedents to see the scope of the implied or \u2018inherent\u2019 authority which the judicial office carries with it. * * We believe that the basic misconception in those decisions denying this authority lies in their view that since Federal courts have limited, statutory jurisdiction, their powers in proceedings involving this jurisdiction are necessarily limited and must be statutory. See Principe v. Ault, D.C.N.D.Ohio 1945, 62 F.Supp. 279, 282. This, as already indicated, is not our view of the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-22\">The remedy sought here is common and traditional \u2014 the equity injunction to compel or restrain action because of the inadequacy of the usual money damage. Its availability need find no source, as such, in specific statute. Indeed, it has been the frequent instrument of effectual sanction for enforcement of the policy of statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since power is present and a traditional tool is available and effective, is there an obstacle to their full use ? There is clearly no statutory <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> proscription, and an accurate treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of historical precedent reveals no self-generated decisional policy against its use. Despite the flood of words that ordinarily executory contracts to arbitrate will not be specifically enforced, this reflects no federal policy of hostility to arbitration as such. On the contrary, arbitration is given enthusiastic federal sanction<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and where a general Congressional policy is plainly indicated that such a mechanism will be useful in effecting its legislative aim, equity has the power, and the right, in the public interest, to make arbitration effective.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Clearly, arbitration is a welcome device to Congress. Indeed, the Arbitration Act itself, 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1, reflects a determination that the needs of the business and industrial world would be aided by giving procedural certainty and greater vitality to the use of voluntary non-court means of settling disputes. The express exclusion of \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d is no left-handed, reverse reinstatement of the ancient attitude of hostility\u2014\u201ccontrary to public policy.\u201d Rather, the difficulties encountered by the Third, Fourth and Sixth Circuits in-attempting to adapt that statute to the field of labor problems covered so long by special legislation bespeaks, perhaps, a Congressional prescience.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">But Congress has been much more direct in its blessing. The Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., is a detailed framework of voluntary conciliation and mediation with arbitration awards being final, binding and legally' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>enforceable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This same scheme is duplicated for airline carriers, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 181 et seq. Moreover, the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 contains the positive declaration that it is the policy of the United States that \u201csound and stable industrial peace and the advancement of the general welfare, health and safety of the Nation * * * can most satisfactorily be secured * * \u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 171, by settlement of issues between employers and employees by conciliation, mediation, and voluntary arbitration. This is stated, not alone in categorical terms, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 171 through 178, but the public interest is so direct that the statute establishes the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, an independent agency, as an arm of the Government operating at public expense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In every modern piece of labor legislation, the Congress has either directed the establishment of arbitration systems or has recognized the essential desirability of their existence with the full force of the Government, its prestige, and its treasury behind them as an essential device for maintenance of industrial peace. In such an atmosphere it contradicts all that Congress has <em>done </em>to resurrect the bones of an ancient day to find some supervening notion that arbitration agreements, while tolerated to the point of acceptance once completed, are inherently evil and beneath the claim of right which the Chancellor will affirmatively protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">The power exists over parties and cause by \u00a7 301. Tho remedy sought is traditional, common and effective. There is no policy against its use and there is overwhelming evidence of a Congressional purpose to encourage, facilitate and make effectual all of the collective processes of bargaining, conciliation, mediation and arbitration. On this approach it is the use of the federal power, a federal remedy to effectuate a federal policy. There is no need to draw upon state jurisprudence with the constitutional uncertainties involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Moreover, this gives a cohesive consistency to the total federal labor pic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ture. Federal constitutional power is amply present under this very Labor Management Relations Act to require employer and employees to bargain in good faith on the inclusion<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of an agreement to arbitrate in the bargaining contract and to issue necessary coercive orders to effectuate it, to protect parties from charges of unfair labor practice<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and deny reinstatement<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to displace strikers where the strike is a breach of the agreement to arbitrate. Arbitration is now the usual, almost universal mechanism to assure industrial peace during the life of the contract. Unlike its frequent use in cornmercial fields as a substitute for the costly delays and uncertainties of court litigation, the device is adopted in labor relations as a substitute for the economic pressures each can marshal in the strike or lockout, or the threat of either.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It would be incongruous indeed to find difficulty or even doubt, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>sovereign which can constitutionally compel the parties seriously in good faith to negotiate for an agreement to arbitrate, and punish and coerce them into compliance with it by administrative orders, sanctions or the denial of them with the added prestige of court approval by appellate review, will lack the power when its constitutional court is asked to grant a traditional remedy which will have the same end.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">If I am mistaken that the network of federal labor legislation is tho culture in which the Congressional policy of encouraging effective enforcement of arbitration can grow into a basis for an equity court granting an injunction, I would nonetheless reach the same result by using, for the first time, \u00a7 301 in a modified substantive way. I do this since I believe that \u00a7 301 is much more than a mere photoelectric cell to open wide the door as union-employer, ws-et<em>vis, </em>approach. When a genuine <em>union </em>controversy, i. e., a 301 suit comes before it, the combinations of dissenting and concurring opinions in Westinghouse will, I believe, restore sufficient vitality to \u00a7 301 to enable it- to reflect federal policy itself and reach out comfortably, as the occasion may require, into state and federal concepts to fashion the controlling law. Whether this will be the creation of new federal rights or merely the release of is nascent powers, this reading of \u00a7 301 would say to the district court that if there has been a breach of the collective bargaining agreement it shall exert whatever of its traditional weapons \u2014 the money judgment, the declaratory pronouncement, or the equity injunction \u2014 which will best assure contractual compliance,</p>\n<p id=\"avn-dedup-0\">Difficulties in forging a responsive jurisprudence neither indicate nor foretell a constitutional void, and it seems surprising at this late date that our flexible judicial apparatus, because of the likelihood of conflict with local law, should shrink from the necessity. The federal system has so well demonstrated its fluid capacity<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that, applying its rule, doctrines frequently ignore, often reject, and frequently collide with local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>(state) principles<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and, where needed to effectuate Congressional will, the conflict and collision<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> may occur between two federal statutes or policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The agreement to arbitrate, for employer and employees alike, goes to the very heart of the collective contract. The native forces of competing economic pressures are held in leash by it. Repudiation by either is a challenge which \u00a7 301 sought to answer. If it is not available here, then nought<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> is left of \u00a7 301 but the right to sue for money damages. Had that been the narrow hope of Congress, just such simple words would have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The injunctive order to compel arbitration was right and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-13\">. Article VIII prescribes tbe steps.

Labor Law Reports (4th Edition), par. 53162, Labor Law Journal, October 1955, Vol. 6, No. 10, p. 721; 20 employees walked off job, established a picket line to enforce demands concerning definition of duties and working hours of a truck driver after employer requested arbitration pursuant to arbitration clause in bargaining agreement. General Counsel brought complaint for refusal to rehire; Board reversed Trial Examiner and held employer could lawfully discharge the strikers. The Board stated: \u201c * * * There can be no question but that in the case before us the grievance and arbitration clause * * * is a material provision of that agreement. * * *_ ^ye that [the contract] * * * excluded any other means but arbitration for the resolution of disputes, particularly unilateral action by any party * * *.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">\u201cEvery encouragement should be given to the making and enforcement of such clauses. * * * To hold that a strike in furtherance of such a material breach of a clear and binding contractual arbitration clause is to be protected by this Board would be contrary to the labor policy embodied in the National Labor Relations Act as interpreted by the Courts of Appeals and the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b146-13\">. As perhaps unique proof of its unparti-sanship arbitration has the rare distinction of being praised and feared by management and labor alike. Peter Seitz, a management representative, in The Enforcement of Collective Bargaining Contracts By Arbitration, New York University Sixth Annual Conference on Labor, 1953, p. 15, describes it: \u201cThe first fact to note is that arbitration is what I call a \u2018glandular\u2019 word. By that I mean that the mere articulation of the word causes thyroid and adrenal glands to secrete. Mention the term and calm men get bloodshot eyes; pulses throb and temperatures rise. This is specially interesting because the identical, violent, physical and emotional reactions will be observed in both management and labor representatives * * * [the] attitude toward arbitration is not unlike that of George Wither, the Restoration poet, who impatient with the conspicuous lack of affection demonstrated by his lady-love proclaimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-15\">\u201c \u2018If she be not so to me,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-16\">What care I how fair she be?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-17\">The widespread use commenced during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tho vrar days under the National War Labor Board and was stimulated later by the President\u2019s National Labor-Management Conference of 1945 attended by delegates representing AFL, CIO, Mine Workers, Railway Brotherhoods, United States Chamber of Commerce, National Assoeiation of Manufacturers which rec-ommonded final determination of griev-anees involving the interpretation or application of the collective bargaining agreement by an impartial chairman, arbitrator, or board, the decision of which should be final and binding on both, with specific machinery agreed to on the selection of the arbitrator (the agreement in this case tracks it closely). U. S. Department of Labor, Division of Labor Standards Bulletin No. 77, pp. 42, 43, 1946. A study made by tho Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., 1950, indicated that at least 80% of the collective bargaining agreements in the nation\u2019s important industries provided for arbitration as the terminal point of the grievance machinery. See, How Arbitration Works, Elkourie, 1952, Tho Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., pp. 6-10; Arbitration and Arbitration Provisions, J. Noble Braden, Tribunal Vice-President, American Arbitration Association, New York University, Sesond Annual Conference on Labor, 1949, 355, 365. There has been a steady growth in percentage of agreements to arbitrate, from 73% in 1944 to 83% in 1949, Arbitration Provisions in Union Agreements in 1949, James Nix, Monthly Labor Review, February 1950, pp. 160-165, to approximately 91% in 1942, Arbitration Provisions in Collective Agreements, 1952, Er-nesteno M. Moore and James Nix, Monthly Labor Review, U. S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 1953, pp. 261-266. The value of arbitration in the workaday handling of labor relations is attested by the prae-tice of making formal, written arbitration reports which are indexed, digested and reported.
