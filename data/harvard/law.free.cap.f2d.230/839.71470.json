The payment of income by the trustees to a charity which is carried on in whole or in part without the District of Columbia would be <em>pro tanto </em>a perversion of the trust.\u201d We think this construction is not erroneous. From this construction it follows that, as the Tax Court held, the property is \u201ctransferred * * * exclusively for charitable, educational, or religious purposes within the District of Columbia\u201d and is therefore exempt from inheritance tax under D.C. Code 1951, \u00a7 47-1601(e), 50 Stat. 684, as amended 60 Stat. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
