On July 15, 1954, plaintiff filed in the Court below his Motion for Rehearing and New Trial. Subsequently, and during the pen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>dency of said motion, two notices of appeal were filed from the judgment, one by plaintiff as attorney pro se on July 22, 1954, and the other by his then attorneys on July 27, 1954. On August 23rd plaintiff petitioned the Court for permission to prosecute his appeal in forma pauperis. The Court below on February 23, 1955, denied plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Rehearing and New Trial; and on October 5, 1955 granted nunc pro tunc, as of the previous February 23rd, defendants\u2019 motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s motions to bring in a third Party defendant, and to proceed in forma pauperis. At the same time the District Judge certified in writing that plaintiff\u2019s petition to appeal in forma pauperis was frivolous and not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">On November 8, 1955, plaintiff, having failed to further prosecute his appeals, defendant moved this Court to docket and dismiss them pursuant to Rule 75(j)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the grounds that plaintiff had not: (1) Filed a bond for costs on appeal as required by Rule 73(c); <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(2) filed the record on appeal pursuant to Rules 75 and 76; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) docketed the appeal within forty days from the date of the appeal in conformance with Rule 73 <em>(g);</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> nor </em>(4) designated the portions-of the record, proceedings, and evidence-to be contained in the record on appeal as provided in Rule 75(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">\u201cIf, prior, to the time the complete record on appeal is settled and certified as herein provided, a party desires to docket the appeal in order to make in the appellate court a motion for dismissal * * * the clerk of the district court at his request shall certify and transmit to the appellate court a copy of such portion of the record or proceeding below as is needed for that purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">Plaintiff answers defendants\u2019 motions,, by motions of November 18 and November 25, 1955, in which he admits his noncompliance with the above mentioned rules, but takes the position that his failure is excused by the action of the Court below in delaying until October 5, 1955 its nunc pro tunc order denying his application of August 23, 1954 to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. He further seeks to introduce an argument relying on the record, which is not before us at this time and cannot for that reason be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">It appears that the nunc pro tunc order of October 5, 1955 was made to correct a clerical inadvertence which resulted in the omission from the order of February 23, 1955 of that portion granting defendants\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis. The power of the Court to correct clerical error is derived from Rule 60 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and is beyond question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>to be noted in this connection that the correction was made by the Court prior to the docketing of the Appeal, as set out in Section (a) of the Rule, and within one year as specified in Section (b) thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\"> But even though denial of the petition to proceed in forma pauperis actually occurred some nine months after denial of plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Rehearing and New Trial, this petitioner was in no way prejudiced thereby. A person taking an appeal in forma pauperis is exempt from prepayment of fees, costs, or security incident thereto;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but generally, with this exception, the same rules are applicable to appeals in forma pauperis as to any ordinary appeal. Plaintiff was not, therefore, excused from compliance with the applicable rules on appeal. It was incumbent upon him to proceed, whether or not he received permission to proceed in forma pauperis. Plaintiff makes no showing which would toll the running of the time limits provided in the rules governing appeals, nor justify this Court in relieving him of the burden of strict compliance with the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">This view is strongly buttressed by plaintiff\u2019s actions subsequent to the time he learned of the order of October 5th. As much as a month afterward, he had made no effort to comply, even though belatedly, with the rules. It was only after defendants filed their motion of November 8th to docket and dismiss, that plaintiff bestirred himself in the cause of his appeal, and then only to oppose defendants\u2019 motion. His entire attitude is consonant with prevention, rather than prosecution, of the appeal. Indeed, this thought was undoubtedly paramount in his mind, judging from the statement<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in his motion of November 18th in opposition to defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">No more tenable is plaintiff\u2019s contention that this Court should grant his motion to proceed in forma pauperis, when the Court below in denying <em>a </em>similar motion, certified his appeal to be frivolous. While the right to appeal from a final order of the District Court is absolute, permission to appeal in forma pauperis is a privilege founded upon statute<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and subject to the provisions thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">In view of the provision of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a) that \u201can appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith\u201d, we have uniformly held that where such certification is made, this Court cannot allow the petitioner to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>In view of the premises, defendants\u2019 motions to docket and dismiss plaintiff\u2019s appeals are granted, and plaintiff\u2019s appeals herein are hereby ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">On Motion for Rehearing and Motion that Order of Jan. 13, 1956 \u2022 be Modified.</p>\n<author id=\"b784-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The motion for a rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The motion that the dismissal of the case on January 13, 1956, be modified by an order that the dismissal of that date be without prejudice, is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-5\">. 28 U.S.C.A., Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 75(j) provides in part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\">. 28 U.S.C.A., F.R.C.P. 73(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">. 28 \u00dc.S.C.A., F.R.C.P. 75, 76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">. 28 U.S.C.A., F.R.C.P. 73(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\">. 28 U.S.O.A., F.R.C.P. 75(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b782-11\">. 28 U.S.C.A., F.R.C.P. 60, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-12\">\u201c(a) Clerical Mistakes.
