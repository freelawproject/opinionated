This conclusion was based on a finding that the word \u201cPeking,\u201d as used by appellees, is \u201cnot descriptive of a style of [Chinese] cooking,\u201d but instead is an \u201carbitrary or fanciful\u201d designation which identifies ap-pellees\u2019 restaurant to its patrons. The court also concluded that appellants had improperly used a fanciful name and secret recipe for soup which appellees had developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-23\">Since we think these conclusions are supported by the evidence and the law applicable thereto, we affirm the District Court\u2019s injunction prohibiting appellants from unfairly competing in the respects enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
