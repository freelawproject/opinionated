All it involved was the peaceful refusal by an humble citizen <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to permit a federal officer to enter her home unless he had a search warrant and the uttering, several times, of a denial, known by her to be false, that the desired witness, Morris, was then in her home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>fleers, in\" fact,' were not deceiv\u00e9d, although they were delayed a few hours until a Warrant of Arrest for Morris as a material witness was issued and served on him in appellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Section 1501, footnote 2 supra, by specific reference in .its second paragraph to one who \u201cassaults, beats, or wounds any officer * * * \u201d reflects a purpose to forbid, under the broader terms of the first paragraph, those acts which constitute obstruction, resistance or opposition but which do not involve physical violence. While this is undoubtedly so, it does not by any means follow that the circumstances of this case match that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">.It-is.not necessary to lay out the ultimate limit of these terms, although we are emphatic in our view that certainty in the nature of criminal offenses forbids, as -the Government\u2019attempts to do here,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Use.of this section as a catchall to make crimes out of actions which law-enforcing agents may feel to be undesirable, but which Congress has not seen fit to proscribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">: And yet that is the very present danger in the interpretation-pressed on us by the' Government. If tlie physical act of allowing Morris to remain in her house for his studied purpose of avoiding discovery is turned into an illegal \u201charboring or concealing,\u201d questions arise as to <em>when </em>the ofi'ense began\u2014on ; Thursday, March 17, when he first sought sanctuary but before' any officers ever appeared\u2014on Friday, when process apparently was issued in Alabama but yet unserved\u2014or Saturday, March 19, and if so, at -what hour\u2014when the process was received or when the Marshal first knocked on the door? Moreover, under a statute not designed or effective to do so, it is to create a crime of harboring and concealing out of facts and situations quite different from those dealt with in the statute specifically enacted for that offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Similarly, it cannot be used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>cover misprisions which, as a specific field of crime, are now narrowly confined.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And, of course, the restricted application with the traditional rigid standards of proof of statutes forbidding false swearing or perjury<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> cannot be so easily circumvented by imposing a criminal penalty for the making of every false unsworn statement, as such, to a federal officer on some kind of theory of less majesty not congenial to the temper and spirit of our people or the nature and genius of our institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">It was not a federal crime for appellant to allow Morris to remain in the house from Thursday to Saturday noon, nor did that become so when the inquiry and request to enter was made. She had no obligation to deliver him up, if she had the capacity to do so. Cf. Haley v. United States, 9 Cir., 215 F.2d 778. Obviously she could not be resisting, obstructing, or opposing the officers in their efforts to serve the subpoena by giving them information which she and the officers each knew to be false. This might have been an irritation and an annoyance, but it did not deflect the officers from their conviction that Morris was-in the house and their determination to-wait him out or enter after him once the-Warrant of Arrest was received. This-process eliminates, therefore, every act which the appellant did as an obstruction, opposition or resistance <em>except </em>her refusal to permit the officer to enter her home. Was the assertion of this ingrained American right a crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Upon what ground did the officers have the right to enter her home? They admittedly had no search warrant and her claim of this sacred privilege was both natural and inherently profound. She was entitled to be secure in her home, free from unreasonable search, under \u25a0the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. There was neither search warrant nor any other lawful ground.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She asserted a right which was hers, and which none could take away. That it gave temporary respite to Morris, or subjected the officers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the inconvenience of getting a lawful writ, neither detracts from this right nor subjects her to a crime for having asserted it. McDonald v. United States of America, 335 U.S. 451, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153; District of Columbia v. Little, 339 U.S. 1, 70 S.Ct. 468, 94 L.Ed. 599, affirming 85 U.S.App.D.C. 242, 178 F.2d 13, 13 A.L.R.2d 954; cf. Haley v. United States, supra; Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2236.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">But it was this assertion of this precious- constitutional privilege which was the only act having obstructive or opposing characteristics. The officers knew that Morris was in the house. The only thing which kept them from reaching Morris to serve on him the original subpoena was this constitutional bulwark which this humble citizen had the right to raise. Until they found a lawful way to step over this protective wall, or obtain the voluntary consent of appellant, it, not the appellant, gave the wanted witness sanctuary. When the Warrant of Arrest was obtained, or when she recanted voluntarily to give them permission to enter, was the first time the officers could enter and perform their task. The appellant, of course, did not obstruct either of these.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Execution of process and the performance of duty by constituted officers must not be thwarted. But these agents, servants of a Government and a society whose existence and strength comes from these constitutional safeguards, are serving law when they respect, not override, these guarantees. The claim and exercise of a constitutional right cannot thus be converted into a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">This evidence does not warrant the conviction. The District Court, on it, should have acquitted<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the defendant. It is accordingly reversed with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Reversed with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. \u201cThat on March 19, 1955, * * * Evelyn Miller did unlawfully, knowingly and wilfully obstruct, resist and oppose * * * Lewis.

Any person who has lived in the South has, no doubt, time and time again, witnessed an unchanging pageant that occurs whenever an officer of the law, a bill collector, or an insurance debit man, goes into a neighborhood in an effort to locate any colored man. Invariably friends, relatives, neighbors and acquaintances never seem to have heard of the man in question, or if they know him, then they do not remember where he lives * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b539-29\">. The facts briefly were these: Richard Morris, cousin of appellant, desired as a Government and defense witness in a national bank robbery case set for trial in Alabama for Monday, March 21, came to appellant\u2019s home in Pensacola, Florida, Thursday, March 17, requesting permission to stay in her home in the hopes of evading imminent subpoenaes. On Saturday noon, March 19, acting on a lead that Morris\u2019 ear was in appellant\u2019s back yard, Lewis, Deputy Marshal, and an FBI Agent went to her home. Lewis, dressed in informal civilian clothes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>sport shirt, knocked on appellant\u2019s door -and asked if Morris was there, and she said he was not. Lewis then, for the first time, stated that he was a federal of-' fiper wanting to serve a subpoena. He : showed her his credentials, although ap- \u25a0 parently not the actual subpoena. \u2022 He again renewed his inquiry with' repeated denials by her and warnings by him of the consequences-of her giving untruthful information. Lewis then said: \u201c * * Would you mind letting me come, in and seeing, and she said, \u2018Do you have a search warrant\u2019, and I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t\u2019. She said, \u2018You can\u2019t come in unless you have a search warrant\u2019 <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">.Lewis and the Agents kept the house under-surveillance. About 5:00 p. m. appellant came out, arranged for Lewis- to meet her in, a nearby drugstore, and there told him that.Morris was in fact in the house and that they could come in and serve him. In. the. meantime,. arrangements were in progress for issuance of the Warrant of Arrest, as a material witness, and the officers waited \u00bf few minutes for the warrant and then, using it rather than the original subpoen\u00e1 and appellant\u2019s invitation, entered her home and \u25a0 arrested Morris \u00e1s a witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">. Except that the- Government always starts with the -fact that on Thursday, \u2022 March 17, appellant knew Morris- was' ! using her home as a hideout to avoid discovery, it is almost impossible to determine just what acts are deemed by the Government to be the-offense: e. g., see Government\u2019s brief, \u201cThe conviction of this Appellant was not based <em>only </em>on' her <em>statement </em>that Richard Morris was not in her house <em>and </em>the ' statement <em>denying entry </em>until a search warrant was obtained * * *. Coupled with her many <em>statements </em>that were boldfaced lies was the conclusive evidence of her <em>knowledge </em>that she was willfully obstructing, resisting and opposing the process server * * Again, later on the Government states: \u201c * <em>* * </em>Based upon the foregoing it is our contention that the knowledge and <em>actions </em>of the appellant in <em>harboring </em>the wanted witness under the circumstances in this case constituted obstruction, resistance and opposition under the meaning of the statute * * [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b540-15\">.
