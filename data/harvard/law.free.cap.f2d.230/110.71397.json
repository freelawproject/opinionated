The affidavit also stated that no inducements were made by the United States Attorney or anyone else to induce petitioner to plead guilty, and that petitioner signed a statement in which he admitted the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">The district judge did not bring the prisoner before him for a hearing, nor did he afford him an opportunity to be heard in person or otherwise, but, acting upon the transcript of the proceedings<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had and taken on December 18, 1952, supplemented by the affidavit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>United States Attorney, sentenced him to the maximum penalty provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">This court has uniformly held,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as has the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that where material and disputed issues of fact within movant\u2019s knowledge are presented, the motion should not be disposed of without an adequate hearing. Applying that rule to the facts of this case, we think it clear that it was error for the district judge to dispose of appellant\u2019s petition without a hearing on the issue tendered in his petition and supported in his traverse,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that he was induced upon the promise of leniency to enter his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">While it is true that in his affidavit the United States Attorney denied petitioner\u2019s allegation, it is also true that no opportunity was afforded petitioner to testify or present witnesses in his behalf. What was said in Commonwealth ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, supra, \u201cUnder the allegations here petitioner is entitled to relief if he can prove his charges. He cannot be denied a hearing merely because the allegations of his petition were contradicted by the prosecuting officers\u201d is apt and has peculiar force here.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to afford petitioner a hearing and for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">. These show: (1) that, advised of their right to have a lawyer, the Goodwins declined such assistance and, acting for themselves, entered a plea of guilty; (2) that Motley requested the assistance of counsel, and a Mr. Bowling was appointed to represent him and did confer with him; (3) that, asked by the court if he had anything to say, Sylvester Goodwin stated, \u201cWell, Sir, Your Honor, I hope the court will have mercy on my brother and K. T. Motley. So far as myself, I don\u2019t ask that. Both of them are hard working boys and they were led into that by me\u201d; (4) that Mr. Bowling, the court appointed counsel for Motley then being asked, \u201cAre you ready to proceed?\u201d, stated, \u201cI would like to have a short conference with Mr. Hauberg,\u201d whereupon Mr. Hauberg and Mr. Bowling went into conference, and, to the court\u2019s question, \u201cMr. Bowling, have you conferred with your client\u201d, Bowling answered, \u201cYes, sir\u201d; (5) that after the court had consulted with the petitioner and he had agreed to waive indictment as the others had done to the information, to the qnestion, \u201cHow do you plead\u201d, Motley answered, \u201cGuilty\u201d; (6) that upon being asked by the court whether he wished to make a statement before sentence was imposed, Mr. Bowling stated for him that he had never been in trouble before and had no record, whereas the other boys had. \u201cWe would like to plead lenieney because this boy was led into it. I talked to him for some time and while he came down here with them, I don\u2019t believe he had any intention of committing a crime when he started out that day.\u201d He asked the court to be more lenient with him than with the others because \u201cI sincerely believe he was led into it by one who had a long criminal record\u201d; (7) that the district attorney then advising the court that Motley\u2019s part in the occurrence was to drive the automobile, that he remained outside the bank while the others were inside it, and that he received a part of the money taken, the court, stating \u201cAll of you are equally guilty of this serious crime which could very easily have led to murder right there in the bank. All of you are equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>guilty, and I am going to impose the same sentence on all of you, the maximum penalty of twenty-five years for robbery with firearms.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">.

In it petitioner alleged: \u201cPetitioner\u2019s court appointed attorney retired from the court room to privately confer with petitioner, whereby petitioner told him all about the crime and petitioner\u2019s connection with it. Afterwards petitioner\u2019s court appointed attorney returned to the court room to privately confer with the United States Attorney. On his return to Petitioner, here are the correct words he said, \u2018If you enter a plea of guilty you will receive a lesser term than going before a grand jury. If you wait for a grand jury you will have to wait until the next term of court.\u2019 This court will readily agree that that is sufficient inducement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
