This picture, with an indistinguishable background, shows the young man standing near a portion of a fireplace decorated with Christmas cards; a partial pattern of a drapery is also discernible. Above this picture is this caption : \u201cEddie Rohzon, only eighteen: He died because, in the beginning, he wouldn\u2019t let friends call him a sissy.\u201d The article complained of is a double page spread and, in addition to Edwin\u2019s picture, there are other photographs, among which is a separate photograph running across both left and right hand pages at the top of this story. This particular photograph is side-captioned: \u201cPictured here is the deadly paraphernalia of dope \u2014 no longer unfamiliar to many teen-agers of the nation.\u201d None of the illustrations, including the one of paraphernalia, make any express mention of the plaintiff\u2019s living quarters; indeed, according to plaintiff, it is not a photograph of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">That picture of Edwin, published by defendant, was plaintiff\u2019s \u201cown personal picture,\u201d made in his home. Edwin\u2019s father testified that he \u201cdid not\u201d give defendant \u201cthe right to. publish\u201d his son\u2019s snap-shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">Plaintiff attempts to spell out a cause of action by this allegation in his complaint :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\">\u201cSuch photograph of narcotics and paraphernalia of narcotics in connection with the photograph and story of the home of the Plaintiffs to be published as aforementioned, so that persons seeing the said photographs and/or reading the story might reasonably believe such narcotics and paraphernalia were found in the home of the Plaintiffs, when in fact they were not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">Frank Rozhon, father of Edwin, mentioned in defendant\u2019s printed account, had testified at the coroner\u2019s inquest in Cook County, Illinois. Newspapers in Chicago reported the inquest and published a picture of Edwin. Certain of these newspaper clippings and defendant\u2019s magazines are a part of the record before us. Sometime in June, 1953, one Pecatagi pleaded guilty to an indictment, which, in substance, charged him with making unlawful sales of narcotic drugs to minors; this prosecution also received publicity in Chicago newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">Alleging invasion of his privacy, \u201cfeelings and sensibilities,\u201d plaintiff sought compensatory, punitive, and exemplary damages from this defendant publisher. Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, supported by affidavits, was denied without prejudice to its rights in asserting the same grounds as support for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. When defendant subsequently and accordingly moved, at that later stage, its motion was sustained and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"> Reviewing the propriety of a directed verdict at the close of a plaintiff\u2019s case, as here, it is necessary for us to examine the nature and quantum of the evidence offered and received below. For the right to a trial by jury is not a blanket guarantee that upon this plaintiff producing any potpourri of evidentiary fragments laced, with hints, he is automatically entitled to have his case sent to the triers of fact. See generally: 9 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2494 (3d ed.1940). \u201cWhen the evidence upon any issue\u201d, wrote Mr. Justice Butler in the majority opinion reported as Gunning v. Cooley, 1930, 281 U.S. 90, 94, 50 S.Ct. 231, 233, 74 L.Ed. 720, \u201cis all on one side or so overwhelmingly on one side as to leave no room to doubt what the fact is, the court should give a peremptory instruction to the jury.\u201d Far from weighing the evidence here we are reporting the futility of our search. Nothing found during our canvass of this record ties the photograph of narcotics, already described, with plaintiff\u2019s home, save the page layout and juxtaposition of illustrations. Indicative of plaintiff\u2019s own awareness of the newsworthy status unfortunately thrust upon him, by his son\u2019s untimely death, is the following portion of his testimony elicited under cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cQ. Is your home pictured? A. My picture of my home is right on that picture right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201cQ. Is that your son\u2019s picture? A. That is my son\u2019s picture. It is the picture of my living room right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201cQ. Your son\u2019s picture was in any of these newspapers? A. The top part of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\u201cQ. Your own picture was in the newspaper? A. The top part of them, not the whole picture of my living room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">Q. Your own picture was m it? A. That is right. I gave Buddie McHugh permission to use it. I gave him permission to use this picture only with the top part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-14\">\u201cQ. You gave permission? A. Yes, Buddie McHugh asked me if he-could use it. He would only print the top part of my boy\u2019s body. I said, \u2018All right, return it,\u2019 which he said he would and he did. How they got that picture, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-15\">\u201cQ. You gave that picture out? A. To Buddie McHugh, yes, not to the magazine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-17\">\u201cQ. Other newspapers ? A. For news, so that they would know what things are going on and not three months later and revive things to people. Their story is in there that happened practically seven or eight months ago.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">In our opinion Frank Rozhon had been catapulted into an area of legitimate public news interest. Warren and Brandeis, The Right To Privacy, 4 Harv.L. Rev. 193, 214-215 (1890); Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts, \u00a7 97, pp. 642-643 (1941) citing and discussing the Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 867, comment c. Illinois, where this plaintiff lived, and the death occurred, has no specific legislation concerning the right of privacy. Apparently Eick v. Perk Dog Food Co., 1952, 347 Ill.App. 293, 106 N.E.2d 742, cited to us by both parties, is the sole decision reported by any Illinois state court on the reviewing level. But even if we accord some weight to that Illinois Appellate Court case it would not bridge the hiatus in plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof. We approve the trial judge\u2019s ruling underlying the judgment appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-20\">Among various other points raised here by plaintiff is his contention that the jury should have been permitted to pass on the question whether defendant\u2019s publication \u201c * * * Was a news disseminating agency or a scandalous sheet designed for commercial exploitation.\u201d Leverton v. Curtis Publishing Co., 3 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 974 is one of several cases re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>lied upon by the plaintiff when urging that latter proposition. We now mention it for two reasons: (i) it contains a good selection of general legal materials on the law of privacy and, (ii) it is inapposite because the plaintiff in that case was herself the subject of the photographs she complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Against the factual background, shown by the record before us, we hold that the timeliness<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of defendant\u2019s revival of the story did not present an issue which' had to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The judgment appealed is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AhE\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-15\">.
