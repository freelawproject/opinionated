In 1950, appellant Sigfred, a pilot with more than twenty years\u2019 service with Pan American, suffered an ear injury which caused him occasional dizziness while in flight and resulted in the company grounding him for varying periods of time during that year. Medical examination later disclosed that he was unfit for further flight duty and on March 29, 1951, the company advised him that since there were no other available jobs for which he was qualified, he would be discharged from its service effective April 1, 1951. Under Section 25 of the collective bargaining agreement between the Air Line Pilots Association International and Pan American, the company paid Sigfred his full salary while he remained in its employ, but since his discharge it has refused to make any further payments. Sigfred claims here that, in accordance with Section 25,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he is entitled to his full salary for as long as his disability continues, for the balance of his life if it lasts that long.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On April 27, 1951, Sigfred brought suit against Pan American in a Florida court for a decree declaring his rights under the collective bargaining agreement. The company removed the case to federal district court, which dismissed the complaint without prejudice, holding that jurisdiction should be declined until the plaintiff should exhaust his administrative remedies under the Railway Labor Act or elect to pursue \u201chis statutory or Common Law remedy for breach of contract for wrongful discharge.\u201d Sigfred then filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation with the Florida Industrial Commission, and obtained an award to the effect that his disablement was a result of an occupational injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">This having been established, he reasserted his claim with the company that it pay him his full salary. The company denied liability beyond workmen\u2019s compensation, and an appeal was taken to the Pilots\u2019 System Board of Adjustment, which disallowed the claim. Sigfred then brought the present action in district court, challenging the board\u2019s construction of the collective bargaining agreement and seeking damages in the amount of his salary from April 1, 1951 until the filing of the complaint. The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the board\u2019s interpretation of the contract was correct, and Sigfred brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The company argues that the judgment must be affirmed because the plaintiff elected to pursue the administrative route through to an award by the system board, which is made \u201cfinal and binding,\u201d by the collective bargaining agreement; and because in any event both the board and the court properly interpreted the agreement as not allowing recovery. Sigfred contends that his election to pursue his remedy to the Pilots\u2019 System Board of Adjustment was not voluntary, but pursuant to Florida law; that Florida law governs the re-viewability of the board\u2019s award; that under the Florida rule of reviewability of arbitration awards all pure questions of law may be reexamined by the reviewing court, and that a consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>of the board\u2019s interpretation of the agreement will reveal it to be patently erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Without expressing any opinion on the first of these propositions, a matter not entirely free from doubt under Florida law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we may proceed to an examination of the second, viz., that Florida law governs the reviewability of the board\u2019s award. The establishment of boards of this type is authorized under the 1936 amendments to the Railway Labor Act, extending many of the provisions of that Act to air carriers in interstate and foreign commerce. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 181. The Act as originally passed stated among its general purposes the avoidance of any interruption to commerce and the providing for the prompt and orderly settlement of labor disputes, including those arising out of the interpretation or application of collective bargaining agreements. 45 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 151a. Pursuant to these aims, Congress provided that disputes concerning the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements in rail transportation are to be \u201chandled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier\u201d, but that if no adjustment is reached at this level, they can then be referred by petition of either party to a division of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, whose decision, except insofar as it contains a money award, is final and binding. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153, First (i, m). It also provided, however, that any carrier, system, or group of carriers and their employees may establish system, group or regional boards for the deciding of disputes of the same character, with the express provision in the statute that if either party to such an arrangement becomes dissatisfied therewith, it may elect upon ninety days\u2019 notice to come under the jurisdiction of the national Adjustment Board. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153 \u201cSecond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The 1936 amendments, in extending many provisions of the Act to air carriers, did not provide for the immediate establishment of a National Air Transport Adjustment Board. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185. Instead, Congress provided that such a board should be set up when \u201cit shall be necessary\u201d, \u201cin the judgment of the National Mediation Board.\u201d 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185. It expressly applied to air carriers that section declaring it to be the duty of carriers and employees \u201cto exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain\u201d collective bargaining agreements. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 181. It also made it the duty of every carrier and its employees to establish a board of adjustment with jurisdiction not exceeding that of the system, group and regional boards created in rail transportation under the original Act. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 184. Finally, Congress required that disputes be handled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes, with the added proviso that failing adjustment in this manner, the dispute may then be referred by petition of either party \u201cto an appropriate adjustment board.\u201d 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The question in this case is whether Florida law or federal law governs the reviewability of an award made by such a board in interpreting a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under the duty to bargain imposed on air carriers and their employees by the Act. Florida law makes unenforceable any agreement to arbitrate future disputes <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and thus would strike down the provision in the agreement that awards of the Pilots\u2019 System Board of Adjustment shall be final and binding. Appellant urges that it likewise allows the review of any pure question of law. However tenuous the distinction between. so-called \u201cunmixed\u201d questions of law and those requiring the deciding of a factual issue also, the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>contends that we have such a pure question of law before us here in the problem of interpreting the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Without passing on the issue of whether such a rule exists in Florida, it becomes plain upon a moment\u2019s reflection that such a system of review would completely sweep aside Congress\u2019s efforts to provide for a prompt and orderly settlement of labor disputes by system boards of adjustment. Moreover, such a result would obtain solely as a matter of compliance with Florida\u2019s contrary policy of allowing disputants a court review of their disputes, regardless of their agreements to arbitrate those questions with finality. It would rest the effectiveness of the statutory plan upon the variegated characteristics of state law, and eventually lead to the anomaly of a National Air Transport Adjustment Board whose decisions, except in awarding money, <em>must </em>be final,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> existing alongside coordinate system boards in Florida whose decisions cannot be final. Although the parties could achieve what they have here sought, a final decision by a board versed in the problems of the industry, by electing to come under the national board,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> they would lose thereby whatever advantages there are in operating under a board established by a single carrier and its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We see no reason to force such an election. Congress having required the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, and the establishment of boards of adjustment to interpret them, we deem it a reasonable corollary thereto that it intended that the scope of review in appeals from these boards should be determined by federal courts, applying federal law. In the light of the declared aims of the Act, we also find it to be the intent of Congress to allow the parties to make the awards of such boards final and binding. Therefore, giving normal effect to these words, we refuse to review a challenged ruling of law, there being no question raised regarding the jurisdiction of the board or the regularity of its proceeding. James Richardson &amp; Sons v. W. E. Hedger Transportation Corp., 2 Cir., 98 F.2d <em>55.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">However, it was urged upon the district court that the system board\u2019s construction of the agreement is arbitrary and capricious. If we regard this as an assertion that the board\u2019s arbitrariness rose to the level of a denial of due process, it is not amiss to add that we regard the board\u2019s interpretation of the agreement not only entirely reasonable, but we believe it to be the correct interpretation. The language in question reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">\u201cThe Company will provide or compensate the pilot for the cost of complete medical care for occupational sickness or injury. In the event of non-occupational injury or illness occurring while on assignment at a point other than the pilot\u2019s base station, or outside the Continental United States, the Company agrees to reimburse the pilot for such additional expenses occasioned by the pilot\u2019s location at the time of such injury or illness. During such period the pilot\u2019s salary will be continued and the pilot agrees that all workmen\u2019s compensation benefits due under applicable laws shall be paid by the pilot to the Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">The arguments of counsel debate whether the third sentence of the section refers to the second sentence or to the first sentence as well. The company argues that the words, \u201cDuring such period,\u201d at the beginning of the third sentence, by their natural sense refer to the period mentioned in the immediately preceding sentence. It is significant that it is only the second sentence that makes a reference to time (\u201cwhile on assignment at a point * * * \u201d etc.). Sigfred urges that such an interpretation is patently erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>because a pilot would then draw full salary during periods of non-occupational injury, but only workmen\u2019s compensation during periods of occupational injury. Therefore, he reasons, sentence 3 must refer also to sentence 1, granting full salary during the period of any occupational injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We perceive in this agreement, as construed by the arbitration board, a clearly understandable and helpful policy of the company. It provides that when a pilot is away from home, and it is of peculiar value when he is in a foreign country, he is protected in his salary if mishap befalls him, whether or not such mishap is occupational. Instead of providing for the cost of complete medical care, as is provided for in the case of occupational sickness or injury, this provision takes care of such \u201cadditional expenses\u201d beyond what he would be put to if he were at his home base, thus excluding reimbursement for medical treatment if such medical treatment is not more expensive on account of the pilot\u2019s being away from home. It then provides the further assurance, partially, no doubt, because of the failure to provide complete medical care, that during such period his salary will be continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">. The construction of this paragraph in the manner contended for by the appellant would amount to providing a guaranteed full salary payment for life in the event of any permanent occupational disability that disqualified the pilot from passing a rigid physical examination. Of course, such a provision could be included in a collective bargaining agreement. But if it were it is not too much to assume that it would be in such terms and with such clarity that there could be no doubt about its meaning. We think it also appropriate to remark that in those exceptions to the normal subjects covered by collective bargaining agreements in which provision is made for benefits after employment ceases, the provisions relating to such pensions are usually carefully spelled out in the agreement, as they should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Without, therefore, making a choice between the alternative constructions, since we find that the complaint failed to set out a cause of action for review of the action of the board, we nevertheless express the conviction that the arbitrators could not easily have yielded to a construction that would require the company to pay a pension of the full $13,440 annual salary to all pilots who no longer meet rigid flight medical requirements for as long as their disability exists. Certainly we cannot strike down as arbitrary an award which refused to make such an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">It is finally argued that not every employer-employee dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the system board. Thus, it was held in Moore v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 312 U.S. 630, 61 S.Ct. 754, 85 L.Ed. 1089, that a suit under state law for wrongful discharge could be brought by a former employee, despite the fact that he might also have a right to reinstatement and back pay under the collective bargaining agreement. However, in Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., 339 U.S. 239, 70 S.Ct. 577, 94 L.Ed. 795, the Supreme Court held that a state court has no power to declare rights under a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under the Act, since the statutory procedure in such cases is exclusive. The appellant here does not claim that he was wrongfully discharged (in fact, he concedes that he was not), and does not assert a cause of action arising out of any rights except those created by the collective bargaining agreement. The interpretation of such an agreement was held by the Slocum case to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the statutory board there involved. The construction of this agreement was therefore correctly referred to the Pilots\u2019 System Board of Adjustment, and since, as noted above, its award presents no reviewable question of law, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s complaint was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\">. This provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\u201cSickness or Injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">\u201cSection 25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201c(a) The Company will provide or compensate the pilot for the cost of complete medical care for occupational sickness or injury.

But there is much more to this case than that \u2014 much more than the able opinion of Judge Tuttle reflects.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">I would accept their interpretation of this contract, or for that matter the district judge\u2019s alone, had there ever been one. The trouble is that here, and below, all that Sigfred got was a \u201cbut if\u201d opinion \u2014 the award of the Adjustment Board construing the contract is not subject to review <em>but if </em>it were, we would agree. But Sigfred is entitled to more than a \u201cbut if\u201d adjudication. Had he gotten that I would again have submerged my own small differences and would have joined in an unanimous decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Had some effective right of judicial review been recognized, I would have accepted also the thesis that the claim must be tested by Federal, not Florida, law, although the approach of Judge Tuttle seems to me to place responsibility entirely on the appellant\u2019s contentions instead of the historical fact that the Supreme Court, not Sigfred, in Moore, and revived in Koppal, imported state principles into these problems arising under the Railway Labor Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">But the Court by-passes these important matters altogether. It does not even discuss the basic notion of the necessity for some character of judicial review even though that has been expressly left open by the Supreme Court. And, under the severe limitation of space imposed upon appellate opinions, it compresses the problem into a nice academic inquiry to the point that it loses nearly all of the essential flesh to give it life, especially in terms of agonizing, tactical-strategic problems facing diligent counsel as they attempt to chart the course for passage between Moore-Koppal versus Slocum, State versus Federal, Voluntary versus Involuntary administrative remedy \u2014 a task which, in contrast, makes the classic figure of Odysseus between Seylla and Charybdis quite unforeboding.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">In view of this, some elaboration of my views may be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">After 21 years of faithful service as Chief Pilot with a ranking of 19 out of 1200 on the seniority roster, Captain Sigfred became a casualty of his own air age when airotitis media \u2014 an occupational disturbance of the ears \u2014 made him, Pan American doctors declared, \u201cpermanently disqualified for flight status with this Company.\u201d Discharged on April 1, 1951, he has, with tenacious persistence, twice in State Courts of Florida, twice in Florida Federal Courts, once in a Florida administrative agency, and twice in the administrative forum of a Railway Board of Adjustment, sought a judicial determination of his contention that, having spent his life for the Company, it is obligated, under the Collective Bargaining Contract<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>with the Pilots\u2019 Union, ALPA, to pay medical expenses and, most important, ,. , . , \u2022. \u201e his salary during the continuance of such occupational disability.</p>\n<p id=\"AQf\">In this final action, filed in the Court below June 17, 1954, Sigfred sought a money judgment only for his back pay<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint detailed historiCally his Pilgrim\u2019s Progress <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the final decision of the Pilots\u2019 System Board of Adjustment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which he attacked as arbitrary, unsupported by, and contrary to law, especially in the light of an admitted service-connected, occupationally precipitated disability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>trial judge, treating it as both an appeal from the Adjustment Board and suit for breach of the contract, denied relief apparently on the dual ground that, if reviewable at all, the Adjustment Board\u2019s decision was correct since it conformed to his own independent interpretation of the contract that payment of salary (as distinguished from medical expense) was not required by 25(a) and was permissive under 25(b). Pan American urges both to sustain the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In our task, as I view it, we cannot reach the merits, to approve or disapprove the holding unless there were a justiciable case before the district court. We are forced, and ought therefore, to examine into the complex field of the availability, use, exhaustion and finality of any existing administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">This involves this further process: Was Sigfred\u2019s claim a Moore or Slocum case ?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If Moore: (a) Did Florida law require him to exhaust the administrative remedies under collective bargaining contract and System Board of Adjustment, if so, was adverse award by Board binding at all, and by what standards, State or Federal, is this to be determined? (b) If exhaustion of remedies was not required, was his pursuit of them voluntary; and, if so, is he bound; if not, what is the extent of the review and by what standards, State or Federal, is it to be determined? If Slocum: (a) Is the award reviewable by the terms of the statute Railway Labor Act? (b) If not, must a right of review be implied, and if so, what is the extent of the review?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">If form alone controls, this is not a Moore case for while the administrative contract grievance machinery was first invoked because of Sigfred\u2019s discharge April 1, 1951, the issue presented through the Adjustment Board and in both Civil Actions was the obligation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>if any, under Section 25 for salary during disability and not that of wrongful discharge <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">But Moore, in the light of Slocum, is not to be read so narrowly. Where the relationship of carrier and the concerned employee (either an individual or a group involved) exists, all disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the contract are exclusively within the province of the Adjustment Board for in such cases, \u201cits settlement would have prospective as well as retrospective importance to both the railroad and its employees, since the interpretation accepted would govern future relations of those parties * * Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra, 339 U.S. at page 242, 70 S.Ct. at page 579. But where that relationship has ceased to exist, whether from rightful or wrongful cause so long as accepted and final, the controversy becomes a very narrow one: What is owed to this former employee? That interpretation of the contract is inevitably required is not decisive for Slocum recognizes, \u201cIf a court in handling such a [Moore] case must consider some provision of a collective-bargaining agreement, its interpretation would of course have no binding effect on future interpretations by the Board\u201d, Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra, 339 U.S. at page 244, 70 S.Ct. at page 580. Slocum intends that where the controversy is one in which the consequence of a court action is, or may be, to substitute a judicial agency for the Statutory Adjustment Board in the continuing superintendence and nurture of labor relations in the industry, it is then clearly beyond the pale. But where the impact is confined to the requirement that, in the court judgment, a carrier pay or not pay to a <em>former </em>employee a specified sum, this will have, if at all, only remote influence on future industrial relations. It would in no way involve the displacement<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of one, or one group, for another, cf. Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra; Order of Ry. Conductors of America v. Pitney, 326 U.S. 561, 66 S.Ct. 322, 90 L.Ed. 318; Washington Terminal Co. v. Boswell, supra, the increase in rate or determination of pay for work performed by employees, cf. Order of Ry. Conductors of America v. Southern Ry. Co., 339 U.S. 255, 70 S.Ct. 585, 94 L.Ed. 811; and, as precedent it would not be binding on the Board, see Slocum, supra, in adjudication cases (so-called minor cases, cf. Elgin, J. &amp; E. Ry. Co. v. Burley, 325 U.S. 711, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 89 L.Ed. 1886) ; and, in negotiations for future contracts, it would be irrelevant in the function of the Mediation machinery, General Committee of Adjustment of Brotherhood, etc. v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., 320 U.S. 323, 64 S.Ct. 146, 88 L.Ed. 76; General Committee of Adjustment, etc. v. Southern Pac. Co., 320 U.S. 338, 64 S.Ct. 142, 88 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>85; Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America v. National Mediation Board, 320 U.S. 297, 64 S.Ct. 95, 88 L.Ed. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">As a Moore claim, the Railway Labor Act did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear it or require an administrative finding as a prerequisite to the filing of the suit. But such remedy was sought in fact. Of what significance is that?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">This depends, initially at least, on the policy of Florida. Transcontinental &amp; Western Air, Inc., v. Koppal, 345 U.S. 653, 73 S.Ct. 906, 97 L.Ed. 1325, conditions a Moore suit upon compliance with any existing state policy requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies. If the state law demands exhaustion of the administration remedy, the suit, even though Federally permitted, cannot be maintained.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Did Florida require exhaustion of the administrative remedy? We think that, under the circumstances of this case, Mountain v. National Airlines,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Fla. 1954, 75 So.2d 574, 577, answers this in the affirmative and in doing so thus applied the traditional Florida view, Ervin v. City of North Miami Beach, Fla., 66 So.2d 235; DeCarlo v. Town of West Miami, Fla., 49 So.2d 596, and the most recent ease Morrison v. Plotkin, Fla.1955, 77 So.2d 254. Moreover this is the view which the trial judge, familiar with Florida law, took in dismissing the original Civil Action 3774 in 1951.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Of course Pan American cannot assert here that the action of dismissal of 3774 was wrong, or that Sigfred should have sought to upset it by an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Since Sigfred was required, either by Florida law, or by reason of an authoritative decision which Pan American is not now free to question applying Florida law, to pursue his remedy through the System Adjustment Board, it is evident that, in assaying its impact upon his rights, the so-called \u201celection\u201d was not voluntary, that is, one resulting from his free choice. But as I view it, this coercive<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> characteristic need not alone be decisive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">If, as Koppal holds, the Railway Labor Act does not pull a Moore case out of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, to determine suability, I think it likewise follows that the state law will also determine the scope and force of the mandated administrative action. Florida law declares that, unless the proceeding is a Florida statutory arbitration, a party to an arbitration proceeding may have an unlimited right of court review on asserted errors of law. Glens Falls Ins. Co. v. Gulf Breeze Cottages, Inc., Fla., 38 So.2d 828. See Steinhardt v. Consolidated Grocery Co., 80 Fla. 531, 86 So. 431; Hanover Fire Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 28 Fla. 209, 10 So. 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">Indeed, so strong is this Florida policy against ousting the courts of jurisdiction, that even assuming the pursuit of the administrative remedy was, in a legal sense, voluntary, the Florida courts would still be open for review of errors of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">Of course, in a very real sense the System Board of Adjustment was actually a board of arbitration which, under the agreement and by statute, was conceived as a bipartisan agency with deadlocks or impasses to be resolved by the naming of a \u201cneutral referee.\u201d The provision in the supplemental agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>establishing the System Adjustment Board (see footnote 4, <em>swpra) </em>that decisions should be final is, of course, an implied characteristic of arbitration agreements and would not exempt this action from the Florida policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">If I am correct under I, II, III, the intrinsic merits are open to us and the court below for some character of review. I believe this same result follows if we assume it was a Slocum, not a Moore, case. Of course, in this approach the right of review must be found either expressly in the Railway Labor Act or by necessary, fundamental implication. I find no express right of review. The Board\u2019s award, denying, not granting, money relief, and in favor of, not against, the carrier is not reviewable under 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153 First (m) or (p).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">But I think that if a controversy is of a nature which requires administrative determination by the Board of Adjustment, there must be some character of judicial review to test whether such action afforded a proper respect for basic guaranties inherent in our system of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-20\">I am aware, of course, of numerous expressions attributing positive finality to the Adjustment Boards\u2019 actions, and which take this to be a closed matter. The fact is, however, that the Supreme Court has at least twice taken specific pains to leave the question open. Most pointedly was this done in footnote<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 7 in Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra [339 U.S. 239, 70 S.Ct. 580].</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-21\">\u201cWe hold that the jurisdiction of the Board to adjust grievances and disputes of the type here involved is exclusive.7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-22\">\u201c7. <em>* </em>* * Nor are we called upon to decide any question concerning judicial proceedings to review board action or inaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-23\">Elgin, J. &amp; E. Ry. Co. v. Burley, supra, 325 U.S. at pages 719, 720, 65 S.Ct. at pages 1287, 1288, was another, and its affirmance by an equally divided court of Washington Terminal Co. v. Boswell,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 75 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 124 F.2d 235. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>affirmed 319 U.S. 732, 63 S.Ct. 1430, 87 L.Ed. 1694, indicates that the issue is substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We would not have to mark out the full limits of the review. It is sufficient here to permit reappraisal of the construction of a written contract to determine whether, on the contract, there has been an error of law. I think this much is assuredly required. If not, substantial and vital rights are imperiled or may be lost altogether. And this must be determined in the light of actuality, reflecting no real, free, deliberate relinquishment of the right of recourse to all legal protection by the employee. Under the Act the employee must be represented by a union. If he desires to work in transportation (rail or air), he is compelled to work under the contract negotiated for him. The Act requires that the union and carrier establish compulsory grievance machinery, and that contract disputes, failing agreement, must be heard and determined by a Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">A person\u2019s contract of employment covering his compensation for work done and, nowadays, all of those so-called fringe benefits relating to sickness and health payments, accidents, hospitalization, retirement and pension rights as well, is a vital right. Applied literally, the Act forces a person to commit every question as to the very existence, scope or application of that right to an agency having no standing as an official arm of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of government.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">As we are not foreclosed by prior decisions or the contract,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> I adhere to the fundamental conviction that with rights so vital some suitable means must be available to determine whether the agency to which Congress has committed the parties to resolution of their differences has adequately adjudicated the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">But the court declines to permit any review. Indeed, it ignores the problem altogether. The result is that, out of the countless situations one can now think of, in which the heavy hand of Government determines the very economic existence or survival of an activity, the railway-airline employee <em>visa-vis </em>railroad-airline employer is the sole<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> one in which no judicial review whatever is afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The Adjustment Board mechanism is in no sense voluntary. It is forced on employer and employee alike. Government cannot compel people to resort to such a tribunal for the irrevocable determination of issues which go to the heart of life itself, unless some means is afforded to test the elemental correctness of it. Justice Brandeis, St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, 298 U.S. 38, 56 S.Ct. 720, 740, 80 L.Ed. 1033, phrased it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">\u201cThe supremacy of law demands that there shall be opportunity to have some court decide whether an erroneous rule of law was applied and whether the proceeding in which facts were adjudicated was conducted regularly. To that extent, the person asserting a right, whatever its source, should be entitled to the independent judgment of a court on the ultimate question of constitutionality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The need for this is as great for the railroad-airline as it is for the employee and, indeed, I would here be championing the same cause had the Adjustment Board held for, rather than against, Sig-fred\u2019s construction of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The review which I hold must exist may, at least, take the form of the suits brought here for declaratory relief or for the recovery of the money value of the benefits sought and denied. Procedural niceties can be wrought out as necessary within the broad framework of suitable actions brought in courts having requisite jurisdiction presenting, without unreasonable delay, the basic propriety of the Adjustment Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">The scope of that review can likewise be fashioned. Here it is sufficient if it has the minimum capacity to review an asserted plain error of law in the construction of a written contract.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The troublesome questions on the review-ability of controverted fact issues, the use or nonuse of a concept of substantial evidence, the problem of administrative expertise on inferences from un-contradicted evidence are points for determination at a later day.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">I come then finally to the question: Was the Adjustment Board\u2019s decision that Section 25(a) did not require payment of salary during continuance of this occupation disability correct? In brief,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Sigfred contends that the salary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>payable under sentence [3] relates to sentence [1]; Pan American, on the other hand, insists that sentence [3] relates only to sentence [2], non-occupational injury or illness away from the pilot\u2019s base station, and that the provision for the continuance of salary is permissive within the sole discretion of the Company under sentence [4], Section 25(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">On the basis of this analysis, construction of the contract is, to be sure, most difficult. However, I think that the fine, technical, intrinsic analysis of the Company cannot stand against the absurdities which would result, and that Sigfred\u2019s construction is, on the whole, the more reasonable one. The majority opinion oversimplifies the matter to suggest that arbitrators \u201ccould not easily have yielded to a construction that would require the Company to pay a pension of the full sum of $13,440.00 annual salary to all pilots who no longer meet rigid flight medical requirements for as long as their disability exists.\u201d This ignores the requirement of the contract of <em>\u201coccupational </em>sickness or injury\u201d and, here, the fact which <em>res judicata </em>charges to Pan American that its own actions may well have been the cause of his final permanent incapacity. I would think\u2014since the majority has undertaken to assay its business reasonableness\u2014such a result was hardly to be described as unexpected.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">This is not the case of a manual laborer. Here the contract dealt with persons having responsibilities and duties of those of near executive status. Airline pilots have exclusive care of equipment of millions of dollars in value and a serious responsibility for the safety and lives of forty to sixty people at one time. In terms of responsibilities committed to their judgment, I would doubt that management of independent business enterprises would, in many cases, exceed that of the Captain on a modern airliner. Yet these businesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>recognizing the inevitable deficiencies in workmen\u2019s compensation schemes, Social Security, or the like, frequently provide for service-connected-disability payments approximating former income. My view is that reasonableness is not for us to determine \u2014 but if it is, I cannot escape the feeling that if a business makes a person physically unfit to work, it is quite reasonable for it to <em>agree </em>to shoulder the responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The question would then be: did they so agree? With considerable uncertainty, I think they did. But the important thing is that that question ought to have been reviewed directly and affirmatively by a court and, on appeal by an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">That question has, at best, been only obliquely answered by judges to whom our system accords the right and duty to determine questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Rehearing denied; BROWN, C.

Sigfred insists that if his quest for legal satisfaction was disheartening, it was but the epilogue to earlier and discouraging efforts for medical relief. This summary is drawn entirely from the detailed Award of the Deputy Commissioner, Florida Industrial Commission, affirmed by Florida Courts which, on usual principles of res judicata, is binding since Pan American, a named party witli Sigfred and the insurance carrier, had a direct liability under the Compensation Act, Florida Statutes Annotated \u00a7\u00a7 440.01, 440.10, 440.20 (4), 440.25(2), 440.25(3) (b) (c), 440.-38, 440.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">During two flights December 1949 to Brazil, Sigfred had a bad cold, had received penicillin treatment between flights, and on the last day of return trip, had experienced severe pain as he descended from high altitude. Upon examination his ears were found blocked. He was in bed about two weeks undergoing penicillin and air pressure treatment to unblock the eustachian tubes. Company doctor Mansfield diagnosed it as moderately severe airotitis. When the tubes became unblocked, early February 1950, Doctor Mansfield ordered resumption of flying as the only way to determine whether the cure was satisfactory, likewise ordering the extraction of Sig-fred\u2019s teeth which was done between then and May 1950. Sigfred, attempting to fly as ordered, experienced excruciating pain on trip to Brazil, February 14, 1950, was relieved at San Juan, P.R., upon return was treated by Doctor Mansfield about two weeks, again released for flight duty, and ears became blocked again on flight to Columbia, S.A. About mid April, Doctor Mansfield, discontinuing radium treatments, again released Sig-fred for flight duty prescribing pressurized cabins with few landings (instructions never complied with), but on return from flights to Puerto Rico, Brazil, the Miami first aid station, finding liis ears blocked again, grounded him and returned him to Doctor Mansfield.</p>\n<p id=\"amk-dedup-0\">The Deputy Commissioner\u2019s Award describes this event: \u201cOn this visit, Doctor Mansfield told him that he defied any doctor to find anything wrong with [his] ears. The doctor accused [Sig-fred] of laying down on the job, and told him that if he didn\u2019t start flying like everyone else he should either resign or the company would take away his retirement benefits. Thereupon, Doctor Mansfield put him back on flight status * *</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">On his next flight, three days later, he again had severe pain, and upon returning the company nurse, finding a blood clot on the right eardrum, grounded him. Doctor Oliver, an ear specialist, was called in but found nothing, again released Sigfred for flight duty recommending short trips with few landings. The period between then and September 24, 1950, is characterized by the Award: \u201c * * suffice it to say that the routine of unsuccessful medical treatment, resumption of flight status, and continuing and increasing pain culminated in * * * [Sigfred\u2019s] discharge. The record * * is replete with instances of [Sigfred] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>being ordered to fly over his protest that he was physically unfit.\u201d On the latter date, returning from foreign flight during which he had suffered dizziness and lost equilibrium in leaving the cockpit, Sig-fred sought, with the Company\u2019s permission, private medical advice from Doctor McKenzie, ear specialist, who found severely retracted eardrums and blocked tubes. Treatments to unblock, apparently mechanically successful, continued until January 1951 when, on trial flight as passenger, severe ear pains were again experienced. Doctor McKenzie advised the Company that the eustachian tubes were no longer able to adapt to altitude changes and it was not safe for Sigfred to fly. The Company called in an additional specialist who, after examinations, found, as a result of McKenzie\u2019s treatments, the tubes open but recommended that, because of the history of dizziness, he should not be permitted to fly.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Medically, muscular control of the eu-stachian tube is essential to permit equalization of air pressure within the middle ear on both sides of the eardrum. If the tube does not open and the pressure remains unequalized for a long enough period, difficulties result including dizziness and pain. A cold markedly aggravates, disturbance of the tubes, and the recurrent attacks of airotitis media brought on by forced flying when medically unfit caused permanent damage to the eustachian tubes. Sigfred\u2019s \u201c * * * disability was caused by continued irritation of his eustachian tubes, through repeated flying, at times when they had not completely recovered from their first disorder in December 1949. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">This history has relevance as establishing, with judicial finality, a disability not only caused initially by employment but in fact made permanently severe because of the manner in which the employee\u2019s complaints and conditions were treated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b74-16\">.

Since that election was the first requirement and the pleadings there reflected that the pilots had made no such decision, the court said, \u201cUntil the necessary election is made by the plaintiff-appellants, and a claim for relief in accordance therewith attempts to be stated, we can see no useful purpose in further consideration of the problem.\u201d Of course the \u201cproblem\u201d referred to is whether, once a decision is made to go the Moore route, Florida, as did Missouri, would require allegation and proof of exhaustion of the contract-statutory grievance machinery method.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b76-12\">. See Court\u2019s findings this case: \u201c* * Suit No. 3774 was dismissed, the Court holding that the jurisdiction should be declined until the plaintiff has exhausted his remedies under the agreement (the same contract known in this present suit as Exhibit No. 1), and the Railway Labor Act, or elects his statutory or Common Law remedy for breach of contract for wrongful discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Of course this was not a Mountain v. National Airlines, Inc., situation, since C.A. 3774 sought determination that Pan American now owed salary under \u00a7 25 (a). The filing of that suit, seeking that relief, was itself the exercise of the \u201celection\u201d to pursue the Moore route. It would have been a vain thing to have dismissed C.A. 3774, so that the plaintiff could determine whether he wished'to file a suit seeking Moore (not Slocum) judicial relief. The trial judge, in his. memorandum rescinding an order in the present suit erroneously dismissing the Complaint on defendant\u2019s motion, referring to his prior dismissal of C.A. 3774 reflects this also: \u201cThe plaintiff has exhausted the administrative remedies <em>necessary </em>and here pursues his remedy for breach of contract.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\">. Koppal might indicate a paradox which, with Moore and Slocum, further complicates strategic and tactical problems confronting counsel: If the state law requires exhaustion of remedies, the election is not voluntary and hence not binding (or not <em>as </em>binding); if state law does not require exhaustion of remedies, pursuit is voluntary and hence binding. In the former, the \u201cnecessity\u201d might thus become an empty, time-consuming, useless act, and, as not binding, be in express conflict with the Act which states it to be final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b77-10\">. Our decision in Michel v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 5 Cir., 188 F.2d 224, was rendered in 1951 prior to Koppal (1953) which introduced, for the first time, the state law in Moore cases as the test for exhaustion and significance of administrative remedies. In neither Michel nor Bower v. Eastern Air Lines, 3 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 623, was state law (Louisiana and Pennsylvania) shown to permit, as does Florida, court review. This, as well as some additional factors, distinguishes other pre-Koppal cases: Charman v. Pan American Airways, 9 Cir., 188 F.2d 875; Reynolds v. Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western R. Co., 10 Cir., 174 F.2d 673; Hartley v. Pan American Airways, D.C.N.D.Cal., 98 F.Supp. 247; Hecox v. Pullman Co., D.C.W.D.Wash., 85 F.Supp. 34; Berryman v. Pullman Co., D.C.W.D.Mo., 48 F.Supp. 542, 543; Ramsey v. Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co., D.C.N.D.Ohio, 75 F.Supp. 740; Farris v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., D.C.W.D.Wash., 113 F.Supp. 907; Kelly v. Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. Ry., D.C.E.D.Tenn., 75 F. Supp. 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-19\">Moreover, Michel, unlike our present case, was the completely voluntary assertion before the Board of an obvious Slocum case seeking Slocum relief \u2014 reinstatement. His suit was thus an attempt to change from Slocum to Moore, and, being in no sense an appeal or quasi-appeal from the Board\u2019s Slocum decision, the prior determination of the fact of rightful discharge was binding on the usual rationale of res judicata or estop-pel.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-20\">See also the recent (October 19, 1955) opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida, Flaherty v.

(References are t.o sentences as numbered [ ] footnote 1, supra.) The Company maintains that upon intrinsic analysis Sigfred\u2019s construction cannot be sustained. It argues that [3] must refer only to [2] non-occupational sickness or injury away from home base, because the term \u201cduring such period\u201d in [3] being in the singular can refer to one event only, either that in [1] or [2J and of these, it must be [2] for only in [2] is there a statement in terms of a period of time, namely, \u201cWhile on assignment at a point other than the pilot\u2019s base station.\u201d The Company bolsters this by pointing out that for Sigfred\u2019s construction to be consistent, [4] must refer to non-occupational sickness or injury only, whereas in terms it makes no distinction between occupational and non-oceupational.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In reply to these contentions, Sigfred asserts that if [31 refers to [2] and is thus limited to non-occupational sickness or injury, then the provision in [3] that Workmen\u2019s Compensation must be paid back to the Company is superfluous. But this cannot be decisive since Sigfred faces the same difficulty in maintaining that [4] applies to non-occupational only, for then the similar provision of [5] would likewise be superfluous. Sigfred suggests an answer for each: The Company, as was the case here, may consider an injury to be non-occupational which the Commission later holds is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">As a telling and principal argument, Sig-fred points out that if, as the Company maintains, [3] refers to [2] and [4] applies both to occupational and non-occupational, then absurd results necessarily follow: pilots away from the base station will not be entitled to salary if their sickness or injury is occupational (for example, a severe crash through no personal fault) but are absolutely entitled to it if the sickness or injury is non-occupational (applying [3] to [2]); pilots with occupational sickness or injury away from the base may not get salary, yet if the occupational sickness or injury is at the home base where the need for salary is minimized, they may get it ([4] construed to cover occupational and non-occupational). As thus construed the salary benefits are available when the need is least and unavailable when needed most.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Section 28, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, offers little intrinsic help. By its reference to \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30 (prisoner, internment, missing, etc.) and sentences [3] and [5], \u00a7 25 it is clear that both recognized that obligations for illness/injury would frequently exceed the limited benefits under compensation Acts; but since state or federal law would require compliance (see Florida laws footnote 5 supra, Longshoremen\u2019s Act, 33 TJ.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901, 904, 914, 932, 938), provision should be made for credit to prevent double benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
