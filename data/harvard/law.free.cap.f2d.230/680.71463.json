Judgment was entered upon the jury verdict and the defendant has appealed assigning six points of error</p>\n<p id=\"b733-19\">Points 1 and 2 are that the court erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict of the jury for the reason that there was no evidence or insufficient evidence of probative force to show that the defendant was guilty of any negligence which was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. But no motion was made for a directed verdict and these assignments do not present matters reviewable here, raising only such questions as are cognizable in the District Court on motion for a new trial. Luke v. United States, 5 Cir., 84 F.2d 823; Western Produce Co. v. Folliard, 5 Cir., 93 F.2d 588, 589; Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Acc. Ass\u2019n v. Thomas, 8 Cir., 123 F.2d 353, 355; Edwards v. Craig, 7 Cir., 138 F.2d 608. Moreover, it appears that there was evidence to. sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>tain the verdict, and therefore, the court committed no error in entering the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"> Appellant\u2019s third point is that the court erred in failing to give the defendant sufficient time in the trial of the cause to properly present its defense and testimony and in making comments and remarks which prejudiced appellant\u2019s Case in the eyes of the jury. We cannot say that the court committed error, and this record strongly indicates that it did not. The court afforded the parties equal time in which to present their evidence to the jury and appellant has made no showing that harm or prejudice resulted from any of the remarks made by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Appellant\u2019s fourth point is that the court erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff on the jury verdict in the sum of $30,000 for the reason that such verdict and judgment were excessive. This assignment is clearly without merit and cannot be considered. \u201cThe question whether the verdict is excessive or not is one exclusively for the trial court to determine, and is not subject to be re-examined in a federal appellate court.\u201d See Swift &amp; Co. v. Ellinor, 5 Cir., 101 F. 2d 131, 132; Home Insurance Co. of New York v. Tydal Co., 5 Cir., 152 F.2d 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Points 5 and 6 are that the court erred in admitting evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Point 5 recites that the court erred in overruling and in not sustaining the objections of the defendant timely made to the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, Coffman and Jackson. Point 6 sets forth that the court erred in permitting these witnesses to testify over the objection of the defendants as reflected by the record. In its brief appellant says: \u201cThe defendant timely objected to such evidence for the reason that it was immaterial, not restricted to the areas in question, and was hearsay.\u201d This is a clear misstatement of the record, for no such objection to this testimony was ever made. Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. requiring a party to make known his objections and grounds therefor is not a mere technicality, but is of substance in the administration of business of the courts, Johnston v. Reily, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 6, 160 F.2d 249. The purpose of this rule is to inform the trial judge of possible errors so that he may have an opportunity to reconsider his ruling and make any changes deemed advisable. It is therefore the general rule that points not raised and preserved below will not be considered on appeal. Tucker v. Loew\u2019s Theatre &amp; Realty Corp., 2 Cir., 149 F.2d 677; Louisiana &amp; Ark. Ry. Co. v. Johnson, 5 Cir., 214 F.2d 290, certiorari denied, 348 U.S. 875, 75 S.Ct. 111, 99 L.Ed. 688; Knight v. Loveman, Joseph &amp; Loeb, Inc., 5 Cir., 217 F.2d 717. Though an appellate court, in a proper case, has power, on its own motion, to consider errors to which no objections were made, such power should be exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>cised only in exceptional cases and in the interest of justice. Curd v. Todd-Johnson Dry Docks, 5 Cir., 213 F.2d 864. This is not such an exceptional case.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">. Point 5 is as follows: \u201cThe Honorable Court erred in overruling and in not sustaining the objections of the defendant timely made to the testimony of the witness of the plaintiff, to-wit: H. W. Coffman and Dillard Jackson to certain proceedings, actions, and minutes of the . Railway Trainmen\u2019s Union at Wichita Palls, Texas, concerning the action of such Union and the discussion of its members in meetings in 1948 and 1950 with reference to the defendant using ballast on its railway bed at Quanah, Texas, and other places on said line and in permitting said witnesses to testify as to such matters over the objections of the - defendant on the grounds that such testimony was hearsay, prejudicial and proper notice of the same not being given to the defendant prior to the time of the injuries, if any, sustained by the plaintiff.\u201d And Point 6 reads as follows: \u201cThis Honorable District Court erred in permitting the witness H. W. Coffman and Dillard Jackson to testify as to conversations, discussions, proceedings and actions taking place at the meeting of Railway Trainmen\u2019s Union in 1948 and 1950 relative to the condition of the road bed and walkway in the town of Quanah, Texas, and particularly in the immediate area where the plaintiff claims to have been injured, over the objection of the defendant as reflected by the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
