It does not appear that any member of the company was either present when the slave passed to <em>Cincinnati, </em>or had any personal knowledge of his so passing. And it does appear that, the.company had instructed its managers never to permit any slave to pass on the boat to the Ohio shore, without the owner\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">The only question we shall now consider is whether, upon these facts, the company is liable to Moore, under the statute of 1831. And we think it is not so liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">An act of 1820 denounces a penalty of two hundred dollars against \u201cany <em>ferry man </em>or other person who shall carry or put over the Ohio river into another \u201c State,\u201d any slave of a citizen of Kentucky, without the owner\u2019s authority; and also provides that, \u201cwhere \u201c any <em>slave </em>shall be so taken over said river, by a <em>ferry- \u201c man </em>who shall be <em>a slave, </em>the <em>owner </em>or <em>keeper </em>of such \u201c ferry shall be liable for the penalty.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b167-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The city of Covington being the grantee, and the Covington Ferry Co. the lessees, of a ferry across theOhio \u2014 a slave passed over in a boat managed by a ferryman for the Co. andmade his escape: as no member of the Co. was present at the time, and the permitting of the slave to pass was contrary to their general orders, the Company is not liable for the value of the slave, nor for the penalty.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">The first section of the act of 1831 enacts that, \u201c no \u201c <em>owner </em>or <em>keeper </em>of a ferry across the Ohio river, within \u201c this Commonwealth, shall set over or convey any slave \u201cor slaves from this Commonwealth, or any of the \u201c islands in said river, to the opposite shore thereof,\u201d without the consent of the owner of the slave or slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The second section contains the same prohibition against any other person not the \u201c <em>owner or </em>keeper\u201d of a ferry.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The third section provides that, \u201cif any owner or \u201c owners of any ferry, as aforesaid, shall offend against \u201cand violate the provisions of this act, he, she or they \u201c shall forfeit his, her, or their said ferry, and his, her, or \u201c their right of ferry shall cease and be void &amp;c.\u201d \u2014 and also denounces, as a further penalty, liability for the value of the slave or slaves, and two hundred dollars, in addition thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">And the fifth section denounces the same penalty, except the forfeiture, against any other \u201c person or persons not being the owner or owners, keeper or keepers\u201d of a ferry.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The act of 1820 clearly implies a definition of the \u201ckeeper\u201d of a ferry, and shows that the Legislature meant, by that term, not the \u201cferryman,\u201d but a grantee, lessee, or other, person having a beneficial interest in and control over the ferry.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The act of 1820 shows, also, that the penalty was denounced for the <em>personal </em>act of the party subjected to it, unless a slave employed by the owner or keeper of a ferry, should be the actual wrongdoer; and then the employer is liable for the penalty; but the owner or keeper is not, in any other case, subjected to the penalty for the act of his ferryman, or other agent, done <em>without his sanction. The </em>person actually guilty is, with these exceptions, alone liable for the penalty denounced for doing the prohibited act.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">And this obvious interpretation of the act of 1820, harmonizes with all analogy; for it is the policy of <em>penal </em>enactments to punish the guilty only.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Now the only object of the act of 1831 was to increase the penalty denounced by the act of 1820, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>thereby afford to the owners of slaves in this Commonwealth greater security. And it is evident that \u201c the keeper of a ferry\u201d means, in the act of 1831, precisely what it meant in the act of 1820; and that, under each of the acts, precisely alike in this respect, the owner or keeper of a ferry is not subject to the penalty for the unsanctioned act of his responsible \u201c ferryman.\u201d If \u201cthe owner or keeper\u201d shall violate the act of 1831, he is liable for the value of the slave or slaves, and a penalty of two hundred dollars, and may forfeit also his ferry privileges. \" If <em>any other person </em>shall violate the act, he is liable for the value of the slave or slaves, and the same penalty of two hundred dollars. For the act of a ferryman or other person not the \u201ckeeper,\u201d the penalty is denounced only against the person doing the act; and the more severe penalty against the owner or keeper, is incurred only by his own voluntary act.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">This seems very plain to us. It would certainly be unusually and unnecessarily harsh, l\u00a1o subject to forfeiture a valuable ferry franchise, only because a ferryman, responsible for his own acts, had violated the statute without the owner\u2019s consent, and even against his command.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that, <em>without </em>any proof tending to implicate \u201c the Covington Ferry Company,\u201d as keeper of the ferry, in the act of its \u201c ferryman,\u201d Moore had no legal right to recover either of the judgments we are now revising.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">And therefore, as the instructions given by the Circuit Judge to the jury, on the trial, assumed that the company, as owner or keeper, is liable, under-the act of 1831, for the acts of its ferrymen, the judgments must both be reversed, and the causes remanded for new trials.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
