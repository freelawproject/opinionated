The property involved is an Acme distribution facility consisting of 585,000 square feet of warehouse space.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Plaintiff argues that the Tax Court erred in refusing to reduce the assessments to reflect a 5% \u201cenvironmental reserve.\u201d This reserve would be used for the expense of monitoring any possible environmental contamination of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In <em>Jablin v. Borough of Northvale, </em>13 <em>N.J.Tax </em>103, 109 (App. Div.1991), we upheld the Tax Court\u2019s refusal to recognize such a reserve in the absence of \u201cproof that the property is polluted\u201d and that \u201cECRA compliance [is] a realistic concern.\u201d Although plaintiffs appraisal expert asserted in his report that there was ongoing DEPE activity in the area relating to the remediation of soil contamination caused by leakage from underground fuel storage tanks, plaintiff failed to present the testimony of an environmental expert to support this assertion. Therefore, the Tax Court correctly concluded that \u201cthere was no proof of any environmental damage\u201d and that an \u201cenvironmental reserve\u201d reduction was not appropriate under <em>Jablin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Plaintiff also argues that the Tax Court failed to consider evidence that its property had been listed for sale at a price less than its assessed valuation and that an agreement was subsequently reached to sell the property for approximately one-half of this listing price. However, the court in fact allowed plaintiff to present evidence of the price at which the property was listed in 1990 ($14,900,000), even though that listing occurred subsequent to the last of the assessment dates in question (October 1, 1989). Moreover, the value which the court placed on the property ($15,150,000) was only slightly in excess of that listing price.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The court properly excluded plaintiffs proffer of evidence concerning a later agreement to sell the property for $7,500,000 because this evidence was not disclosed prior to trial. In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>event, plaintiff indicated that it had only received an oral offer to purchase this property, which had not been reduced to a binding written contract. Such an offer is not a reliable indication of property value. <em>See New Jersey Turnpike Auth. v. Bowley, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>549, 556, 143 A.2d 558 (1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 <em>U.S. </em>927, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>312, 3 L.Ed.2d 301 (1959). Moreover, this offer apparently was made shortly before the trial in June 1992, some two-and-a-half years after the last assessment date in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
