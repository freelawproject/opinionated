We now affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Crabtree in his letter opinion dated March 5, 1992. The trial judge\u2019s findings were supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. <em>Pascale v. Pascale, 113 N.J. 20, 33, 549 A.2d 782 </em>(1988); <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Badische Corp. v. Town of Kearny, </em>11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>385 (Tax 1990), regarding the element of entrepreneurial profit, is misplaced. In that ease the court noted \u201cthat none of the experts added entrepreneurial profit to their cost-based value estimates\u201d and concluded, therefore, that \u201cno proofs of entrepreneurial profit were offered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402. In the present case, however, defendant\u2019s appraiser included the element of entrepreneurial profit in his written appraisal and expressed his opinion regarding that element during his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
