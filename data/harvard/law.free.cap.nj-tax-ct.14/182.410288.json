Appellant presents these three points on his appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">POINT I \u2014 APPELLANT SHOULD BE GIVEN LESS THAN THE LEGAL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">PERMISSIBLE SANCTION BY THE APPELLANT DIVISION ON APPEAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-15\">POINT II \u2014 INABILITY TO TRY A CASE ON A DATE MARKED PEREMPTORILY WHICH WAS NOT KNOWN TO THE ATTORNEY IS NOT CONTEMPT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-16\">POINT III \u2014 PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL WAS DENIED PROCEDURAL DUE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-17\">PROCESS BECAUSE THE ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WAS NOT MADE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-18\">RETURNABLE BEFORE ANOTHER JUDGE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-19\">We conclude that this sanction was in no sense imposed for contempt of the court. This sanction was imposed because counsel was not prepared to proceed to trial on a peremptory trial date. As a result, the case was dismissed. The $500 sanction was imposed as a condition for reinstatement of the matter on the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>list. As an aside, we observe that appellant was then able to negotiate a quite favorable disposition of the tax appeal on behalf of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">We repeat, this was not a contempt proceeding but simply an imposition of a sanction under <em>R. </em>1:2-4. <em>See State v. Audette, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 414, 493 A.2d 540 (App.Div.1985); <em>see also R. </em>8:8\u2014 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
