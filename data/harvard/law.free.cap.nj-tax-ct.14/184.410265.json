Borough of Northvale, </em>13 <em>N. J.Tax </em>103, 109 (App. Div.1991), we upheld the Tax Court\u2019s refusal to recognize such a reserve in the absence of \u201cproof that the property is polluted\u201d and that \u201cECRA compliance [is] a realistic concern.\u201d Plaintiff failed to present any evidence indicating that the subject property was polluted or that there was any need for environmental monitoring. Therefore, the Tax Court correctly concluded that plaintiff was not entitled to an environmental reserve reduction in calculating the assessed valuation of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Plaintiff also argues that the Tax Court erred by (1) not precluding the appraisal report of defendant\u2019s expert or at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>disallowing the income approach testimony contained therein; (2) considering parts of the record from a prior tax year; (3) allegedly restricting his counsel\u2019s access to his appraiser during cross-examination of defendant\u2019s expert; (4) failing to make adequate findings of fact with regard to the comparable sales approach; (5) not excluding comparable leases which failed to identify the landlord and tenant; and (6) not disregarding defendant\u2019s comparable lease number two as a \u201cstand-alone\u201d transaction. These arguments are clearly without merit and do not require discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
