It has been held that a court may possess jurisdiction of a cause, of the subject matter, and of the parties, but that it is still limited in its mode of procedure and in the extent and character of its judgment which may not be rendered in violation of the prescribed modes of procedure, as against those who raise proper and timely objections to the decree when so made. Johnson v. McKinnon, 54 Fla. 221, 45 So. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">It is now ordered and adjudged that the opinion and judgment of this Court reversing the cause and remanding the same filed in this cause of March 5, 1931, be and the same is now affirmed.

I concur with Justice Davis that the defect in the verification was not jurisdictional. But I go farther. The Statute is remedial and should be liberally construed. Equity courts had jurisdiction of suits for partition before the statute was enacted. I do not think a defective verification of the bill should be held to be more than.a procedural irregularity which did not affect the power of the Court to proceed with the case. The court could have had this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u2022error corrected later, if objections bad been raised, and tbe failure to object amounted to a waiver-of the defect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
