Not only was his plea entered in full satisfaction of a 45-count indictment, but another indictment was dropped as well. Furthermore, the sentence was in accord with the plea bargain. Under these circumstances, along with the fact that the sentence was well within the statutory guidelines <em>(see, </em>Penal \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]), we find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed <em>(see, People v Mackey, </em>136 AD2d 780, <em>lv denied </em>71 NY2d 899).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Mikoll, J. P., Yesawich Jr., Crew III and Harvey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
