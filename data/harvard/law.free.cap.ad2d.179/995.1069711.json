Defendant was present throughout Vaccarella\u2019s negotiations with the store owner, in particular, when he negotiated price, resisted the offer of a check and receipt, insisted on cash, and falsely stated that he lived out of town. Vaccarella consulted with defendant before accepting the store owner\u2019s offer of $700, which was approximately one-half the value of the stolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>carpets. Defendant directly participated in negotiations, telling the store owner, in response to his offer of $700, \"I thought we could get $800 or $900\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Further, defendant was in joint possession of the carpets, drove the van by which they were transported, and carried them into the shop. Recent unexplained possession of the carpets supports the inference of guilty knowledge. Finally, the carpets were wrapped in a grey blanket despite the fact that it was a clear day. That supports the inference that the men were trying to conceal the carpets because they knew that they were stolen.
