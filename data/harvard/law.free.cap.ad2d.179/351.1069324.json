The officer observed defendant clearly, in profile and full face, when defendant was first approached by an unidentified woman and later by an unidentified man. After a brief conversation with each person, defendant crossed the street, only to return and again briefly converse with each of them. This limited testimony was properly admitted as it did not contain any reference to criminal activity, and was material and relevant to the disputed issue of identification <em>(see, e.g., People v Torres, </em>170 AD2d 316, <em>lv denied 78 </em>NY2d 958).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Defendant\u2019s subsequent testimony on direct examination that he did not engage in any sale of drugs permitted cross-examination, for impeachment purposes, as to whether he had sold drugs to the man and woman who had approached him on the street prior to the instant sale <em>(see, e.g., People v Crandall, </em>67 NY2d 111). Upon defendant\u2019s denial the matter was not further pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>prosecution and giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference <em>(People v Malizia, </em>62 NY2d 755, <em>cert denied </em>469 US 932), we find that the evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to support the verdict finding defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Moreover, upon an independent review of the facts, we find that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see, People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490). The issues raised by defendant concerning the credibility of prosecution witnesses, including those that arose from testimony concerning the color of defendant\u2019s coat and the prosecution\u2019s failure to preserve or photograph the coat, were properly placed before the jury, and, after considering the relative force of the conflicting testimony and the competing inferences which may be drawn therefrom, we find no reason on the record before us to disturb its determination.
