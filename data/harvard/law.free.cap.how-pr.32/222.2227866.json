The defendant appealed to the Otsego county court, stating in his notice of appeal errors in receiving and in rejecting evidence; that judgment was not warranted by evidence; that judgment is for $100 too much; that judgment is $75 too much, and for $50 too much at least, and that the damages were too large and excessive. No offer was made to reduce judgment. The action was again tried in the county court August 9, 1865, and resulted in a verdict for plaintiff of $152.46.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">The defendant (appellant) procured his costs to be adjusted by the county clerk, and judgment to be entered in favor of plaintiff for said $152.46, and in favor of defendants for their costs $100.47, adjusted as aforesaid, and offsetting such costs against plaintiff\u2019s damages, and adjudging that plaintiff recover of defendants only the balance of $57.99.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">The plaintiff appealed to the Otsego county court, by which such judgment was set aside, and the clerk was ordered to adjust plaintiff\u2019s costs on appeal, and insert them with his damages in judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">The defendants thereupon appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-11\">Dewitt 0.

Dewet, <em>for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b227-13\"><em>By the court, </em>Boardman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax9\">The eases of <em>Loomis </em>agt. <em>Higbee </em>(29 <em>How. </em>232), and <em>Reed </em>agt. <em>Moore </em>(31 <em>How. </em>264), decided in this district, settle the construction and effect of the notice of appeal in this action upon the question of costs. There has been a great conflict of opinions upon these ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tions, but it is <em>res adjudicata </em>in this district, and must so remain until some higher authority changes the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">But independent of that question, the plaintiff should recover costs of this appeal. The judgment was more favorable to him, being the respondent, than the judgment in the justice\u2019s court. The action was tort, and the damages are not increased or diminished by the allowance of interest as a matter of law. The jury may or may not allow interest. It is discretionary with them. When allowed, it is not because the law gives interest as a matter of right, but simply as a mode of reaching a correct conclusion. Any other mode would be equally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Interest then not being a necessary and legal incident to a claim of tort, the comparison of the two judgments should not be affected by its allowance.'</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">I think the order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b228-8\">Balcom, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">This action was originally brought before a justice of the peace, for defendants wrongfully taking from plaintiff \u2019s possession, and carrying away and converting to their own use, certain personal property that belonged to the plaintiff. \u25a0 The plaintiff recovered a judgment against the. defendants before the justice for $149.75 damages, besides costs. The defendants appealed from the judgment to the Otsego county court. The jury in the latter court rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $152.46 damages, for which the clerk of Otsego county entered a judgment against the defendants ; but he also entered a judgment in their favor for costs against the plaintiff. The county court made an order setting aside the judgment for costs in favor of the defendants, and directed the clerk of that court to adjust the plaintiff\u2019s costs, and enter judgment in his favor for such costs. The defendants have appealed from that order of the county court to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The appellants\u2019 counsel claims that the verdict of the county court was more favorable to the defendants than the judgment of the justice, because interest on that judgment from the time it w.as rendered, to the day the verdict in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>county court was received, if added to the judgment, would make it larger than the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The order of the county court, awarding costs to the plaintiffs, was made the 20th day of January, 1866, and the question in the case must be decided by this court by the Code as it then existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The judgment for damages in the county court was $2.71 more in favor of the plaintiff than the judgment in his favor before the justice. Hence the judgment of the county court was more favorable to the respondent and less favorable to the appellants than the judgment of the justice <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 371).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The language of the Code, at the time the county court made the order appealed from, was, if the judgment in the appellate court be more favorable to the appellant than \u201c the judgment \u201d in the court below, the appellant shall recover, costs ; otherwise the respondents shall be entitled to costs <em>(Code, \u00a7 </em>371).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">There is no provision in the Code that authorizes the county court to cast interest on the judgment of the justice and add it to such judgment, and then compare the amount with the verdict in the county court, for the puipose of determining whether the verdict be more favorable to the appellant than such judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The county court can only compare the judgment of the justice, as rendered, with the recovery in the county court, in determining which party to the action should recover costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">This court decided this very question at a general term in 1864, in <em>Whitney </em>agt. <em>Wells. </em>In that case the plaintiff recovered a judgment for the conversion of wood, for $50 damages, before a justice of the peace. The defendant appealed from the judgment to the Cortland county court, where the jury rendered a verdict against him \u2022 for $50 damages. The defendant contended in the county court that he was entitled to costs, because by adding interest to the judgment of the justice, it would make it greater than the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in the county court. But the county court awarded costs to the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>court from the order allowing the former to recover costs. And-this court affirmed the order of the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">I am unable to see any reason for overruling our decision in <em>Whitney </em>agt. <em>Wells.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">My conclusion is, that the order of the county court in this case, awarding costs to the plaintiff was correct, and that it should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Parker and Mason, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
