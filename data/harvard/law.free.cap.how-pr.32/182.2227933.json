(Sutherland, <em>J. dissenting.)</em></headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b186-10\"><em>New York General Term, June, </em>1866.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b186-11\"><em>Before </em>Barnard, <em>P. J., </em>Sutherland <em>and </em>Clerke, <em>Justices.</em></p>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-12\">This was an appeal from, an order denying a motion to strike out of the costs an expense or disbursement of twenty dollars paid for copy stenographer\u2019s notes of trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>cause, which was taxed by the clerk on adjustment of costs of general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">The action was tried at circuit\u2014verdict was for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed to the general term and served a proposed case. The affidavit of Mr. Brown shows, that in order to draw the proposed amendments it became necessary to have a copy of the stenographer\u2019s notes, which was produced, and twenty dollars (ten cents per folio) paid therefor to the stenographer, and which was the usual charge in such cases.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-6\">Bbown &amp; Estes, <em>for the plaintiff,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvB\">cited <em>Code </em>(\u00a7 <em>311); Finch </em>agt. <em>Culvert </em>(13 <em>How.

It may have been convenient and even prudent for him to procure such copy, but I am inclined to think it cannot properly be said to have been <em>necessary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">The special provision in section 256 of the Code, allowing\" the expense, or one-half of the expense of the copy for the judge, as a disbursement by the prevailing party, tends to show this, I think. (See <em>Hamilton </em>agt. <em>Butler, </em>30 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">Upon the whole, though considering the affidavit of Mr. Brown, the attorney for the plaintiff, I do not consider the question free from doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>I think the twenty dollars paid for the copy of the stenographer\u2019s minutes for the plaintiff or his attorney, should be deducted from the bill of costs as adjusted by the clerk, without costs to either party on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
