He did not, for aught that appears during his occupancy, in any manner advise the plaintiff or his agent, that his wife had acted without authority, and that he did not intend to ratify the contract she had made, nor did he do any act indicative of a similar intent. He said on the trial, that he refused to keep the premises, and moved out on the 23d or 24th of May.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">His removal was too late. He had, by his deify, ratified the contract made by his wife. The doctrine on that subject is clearly stated in <em>Story on Contract </em>(\u00a7 161), on the authority of adjudged cases, as follows: It is not necessary that the ratification should be express and formal, unless the agent act in the name of the principal, by an instrument under seal, in which case the ratification must also be under seal; but it. may arise by implication from collatteral circumstances,' from the acts of the principal, or from his silence and acquiescence, when it was incumbent on him to object, or when the presumption of a ratification is the only satisfactory explanation of such a silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">There is nothing growing out of the relation of husband and wife, which prohibits the latter from acting as agent of her husband; and if her act as such be approved, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>approval is equivalent to an original authority <em>(Hopkins </em>agt. <em>Mollineaux, 4 Wend. 465).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">It makes no difference where the act has been adopted, whether the person acting for another was authorized but exceeded his power, or assumed to be authorized, when in fact he was not clothed with power directly or indirectly. <em>(Story on Agency, </em>\u00a7 253 ; <em>Nixon </em>agt. <em>Palmer, </em>4 <em>Seld. </em>398 ; <em>Commercial Bank </em>agt. <em>Warren, 15 N. Y. R. </em>577; <em>Wilson </em>agt. <em>Furman, </em>6 <em>Man. &amp; Gran. </em>236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">And as we have seen that the principal may be held to have assumed the obligation made for him, by his silence or acquiescence, he is required to disavow the act done in his.name, within a reasonable time, <em>(Cairnes </em>agt. <em>Bleecker, </em>12 <em>Johns. </em>300; <em>Viainna </em>agt. <em>Barclay, </em>3 <em>Cow. </em>281; <em>Gage </em>agt. <em>Herman, </em>2 <em>Comst. </em>417 ; <em>Buckenbeeker </em>agt. <em>Lowell, </em>32 <em>Barb. </em>9; 2 <em>Kent\u2019s. Com. </em>616; <em>Benedict </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>10 <em>Paige, </em>127,) and particularly where, as in this case, he availed himself of the benefit of the contract made for him by occupying the premises. When the act done for another is apparently for his benefit, slight evidence should serve to establish a ratification <em>(Commercial Bank </em>agt. <em>Warren, supra, </em>\u00a7 579).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">There seems <em>to be </em>great propriety in applying such a rule strictly to a case like the present, in which it appears that the wife during the absence of her husband hired a dwelling, which may be classed as one of the necessaries of life. In this case, however, the ratification is abundant. The defendant followed his wife to the premises hired and occupied by her, and remained there, as already shown, for eighteen days. These were acts from which no other conclusion was to be drawn by the landlord than that he intended to remain for the term secured. As said by Strong, J., in <em>Gage </em>agt. <em>Sherman (supra), </em>\u201cif the defendant intended to object to the terms of sale he should fiave acted promptly. The plaintiff might then have taken his land back, and probably without loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The justice in this case held that the delay of the defendant in reference to the repudiation of the contract, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>taken possession of the premises as he had, was unreasonable, and we think it was. He should have acted promptly, and restored the possession to the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
