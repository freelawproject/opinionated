Proc., \u00a7 1085) in the trial court to compel their former employer, respondent Hartnell Community College District (the District), to reinstate them as executive assistants to the District\u2019s superintendent/president or alternatively, to conduct hearings on the propriety of their \u201cdemotions, involuntary transfers, and terminations.\u201d The court denied the petition, and appellants challenge that decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Appellants contend the court erred when it determined that their temporary reassignments were not \u201cdemotions\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 88001, subd. (d)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and their eventual separations from employment were not terminations \u201cfor cause\u201d (\u00a7 88001, subd. (h)). We reject their contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Appellants were nonunion permanent classified<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> employees of the District who worked as executive assistants to longtime superintendent/president Dr. Edward Valeau. Dr. Valeau resigned at the end of June 2007, and Dr. Phoebe Helm became interim superintendent/president.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">She faced a challenging situation: The college was in imminent danger of losing its accreditation. \u201cIt was basically on probation because it had failed almost every standard. And so there were seven recommendations and two concerns that had to be corrected\u201d in a relatively short time. \u201cThere were over 800 courses that needed to be reviewed <em>...\u201d a </em>task that would require \u201can extraordinary effort on the part of the faculty.\u201d Other issues required action by the board of trustees: \u201cmoving forward with an ethics statement and with a sanctions process . . . .\u201d Implementation of shared governance was another issue. The entire process was complicated by a history of \u201csignificant tension or animosity\u201d between the administration and the board and the fact that four of the seven board seats would be up for election that November.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Needing \u201cto align the personnel to be able to accomplish the job\u201d and wanting to begin \u201cwith a clean slate,\u201d Dr. Helm made various personnel changes. Those changes included reassigning appellants, effective July 25, 2007, to equivalent positions assisting the vice-presidents of academic affairs and student services. The assistants to those vice-presidents who \u201cworked in offices that mattered significantly in terms of the kind of content that the president\u2019s office would need in order to fully lead the accreditation process\u201d were moved into the office of the superintendent/president.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The reassignments did not affect appellants\u2019 job classifications, titles, wages, or benefits. It was made clear to all involved that the reassignments were not performance related. It was also made clear that the moves were temporary and that all four reassignments would be reassessed in February 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Appellants never reported to their new assignments. Instead, they obtained doctors\u2019 notes stating without qualification that they were unable to return to work. Notwithstanding the unqualified nature of their doctors\u2019 notes, however, appellants informed the District that they were at all times available to return to their <em>former </em>jobs in the office of the superintendent/president.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The District held appellants\u2019 new jobs open for more than five months. On December 21, 2007, the District informed appellants in writing that their entitlement to paid leave would be exhausted \u201cas of January 9, 2008,\u201d that their most recent doctors\u2019 notes extended their \u201cunable to work\u201d status beyond that date, and that they would be released from employment and placed on the 39-month reemployment list unless they obtained written releases from their doctors and returned to work before January 9, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Appellants never submitted medical releases and never returned to work. On January 8, 2008, the District\u2019s board of trustees approved appellants\u2019 separations from employment and placed them on the 39-month reemployment list (\u00a7 88195).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Appellants obtained a right-to-sue letter from the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and sued the District on January 23, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A year later, claiming they had been \u201cdemoted\u201d without notice and hearings and then terminated \u201cfor cause,\u201d appellants petitioned for a writ of administrative mandamus in the trial court to compel the District to reinstate them to their former positions or alternatively, to conduct hearings on the propriety of their \u201cdemotions, involuntary transfers, and terminations.\u201d The parties stipulated to consolidate the actions for a bifurcated trial, with the writ petition issues to be tried first.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">After a bench trial, the court denied the petition. The court concluded that since neither appellant had been reassigned to an \u201cinferior position or status,\u201d the reassignments were not \u201cdemotions\u201d (\u00a7 88001, subd. (d)) or \u201cdisciplinary actions\u201d (\u00a7 88001, subd. (e)) triggering notice and hearing rights under section 88013, subdivision (c). Nor did the reassignments offend due process, because appellants enjoyed no property rights in their specific former assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The court determined that appellants \u201cwere not terminated for cause, but because of their inability (per doctor notices) to return to work and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>accrued sick leave had been exhausted.\u201d \u201cWhile the motion before the Hartnell Board stated that the petitioners were terminated because of \u2018the inability, abandonment, and/or refusal to resume\u2019 their duties, actually, the Petitioners had \u2018abandoned and/or refused to resume\u2019 their newly assigned duties long before January 8, 200[8], and the Court so finds.\u201d The court concluded that because appellants\u2019 separations from employment were not \u201cfor cause,\u201d they were not \u201c[disciplinary action[s]\u201d (\u00a7 88001, subd. (e)) triggering notice and hearing rights under section 88013, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">After a posttrial hearing on the remaining causes of action,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court entered judgment for the District. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s judgment on a petition for writ of ordinary mandate, we apply the substantial evidence test to the trial court\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>(Kreeft </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 46, 53 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 137] <em>(Kreeft).) </em>Under the substantial evidence test, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[w]e must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and draw all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court\u2019s decision. [Citations.] Where the evidence supports more than one inference, we may not substitute our deductions for the trial court\u2019s. [Citation.] We may overturn the trial court\u2019s factual findings only if the evidence before the trial court is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain those findings. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Lake </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 448, 457 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 860, 940 P.2d 311] <em>(Lake).) </em>\u201c[W]e exercise our independent judgment on legal issues, such as the interpretation of statutory . . . provisions.\u201d <em>(Kreeft, </em>at p. 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In this case we are called upon to interpret certain definitions in the Education Code. \u201c \u2018The goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. [Citation.] Ordinarily, the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent. [Citation.] When the statutory language is ambiguous, the court may examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>context in which the language appears, adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cWhen the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation . . . , we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jefferson </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 86, 94 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 893, 980 P.2d 441] <em>(Jefferson).) </em>\u201cUsing these extrinsic aids, we \u2018select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Sinohui </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 211-212 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 783, 47 P.3d 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">B. The Temporary Reassignments Were Not \u201cDemotions\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u201cAt the heart of this case,\u201d appellants contend, is the trial court\u2019s too narrow construction of section 88001, which states, in subdivision (d), that \u201c \u2018Demotion\u2019 means assignment to an inferior position or status without the employee\u2019s written voluntary consent.\u201d (\u00a7 88001, subd. (d).) They claim the court erred in determining that their temporary reassignments \u201cdid not constitute \u2018demotions\u2019\u2014notwithstanding its simultaneous finding that the new positions conferred less \u2018prestige\u2019 than their original positions.\u201d Appellants claim that error engendered further error: the \u201cmistaken\u201d conclusion that since the temporary reassignments were not \u201cdemotions,\u201d appellants had not been subjected to \u201cdisciplinary action\u201d and were therefore not entitled to prereassignment notice and hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In urging their respective constructions of the statutory definition of \u201cdemotion\u201d (\u201cassignment to an inferior position or status without the employee\u2019s written voluntary consent\u201d), neither side directly addresses the meaning of \u201cposition\u201d or \u201cstatus.\u201d (\u00a7 88001, subd. (d).) Nor does either side explain the difference between the concepts each word connotes. In failing to squarely address the meaning of the particular words the Legislature chose, the parties run afoul of the principle that every word of a statute must be given \u201csome significance, leaving no part useless or devoid of meaning.\u201d <em>(City and County of San Francisco v. Farrell </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 47, 54 [184 Cal.Rptr. 713, 648 P.2d 935].) \u201cIn using two . . . different terms ... the Legislature presumably intended to refer to two distinct concepts.\u201d <em>(City of San Jose v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 47, 55 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 73, 850 P.2d 621].) We will address them separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>1. \u201cPosition\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The statute does not define \u201cposition,\u201d and its meaning has not been specifically addressed by the courts. Common dictionary definitions of \u201cposition\u201d reveal that the \u201cusual, ordinary meaning[]\u201d of the word <em>(In re Reeves </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 765, 770 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 4, 110 P.3d 1218]) is \u201ca post of employment; a job,\u201d or more specifically, \u201cthe group of tasks and responsibilities making up the duties of an employee . . . .\u201d (American Heritage College Diet. (3d ed. 1997) p. 1067; Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet. (1993) p. 1769.) Courts\u2019 general usage of the word in the case law are consistent with these definitions. (See <em>Barthuli </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 717, 719 [139 Cal.Rptr. 627, 566 P.2d 261] <em>(Barthuli) </em>[\u201cPetitioner held the position of associate superintendent of business . . . .\u201d]; <em>California School Employees Assn. v. Governing Board </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 333, 337, fn. 4 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 878 P.2d 1321] [\u201cTeachers, librarians, and counselors are examples of those in academic positions.\u201d]; <em>Kim v. Regents of University of California </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 160, 166, fn. 2 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 10] [\u201cThe wage order does not specifically include administrative assistants, the most recent position held by Kim . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Viewing the word in the context of the statute as a whole <em>(Cummins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 478, 487 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 823, 115 P.3d 98]) allows us to further refine what the Legislature intended by \u201cposition.\u201d The definition of \u201cclassification,\u201d for example, states that \u201c \u2018[classification\u2019 means that each position in the classified service shall have a designated title, a regular minimum number of assigned hours per day, days per week, and months per year, a specific statement of the duties required to be performed by the employees in each such position, and the regular monthly salary ranges for each such position.\u201d (\u00a7 88001, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">We think it follows that a position with a lower classification is an \u201cinferior position\u201d within the meaning of section 88001, subd. (d). (See, e.g., <em>Spanner v. Rancho Santiago Community College Dist. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 584, 587-588 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] [chief custodian demoted to custodian].) But \u201cassignment to an inferior position\u201d must connote more than a reduction in classification; otherwise, the Legislature would have used the word \u201cclassification\u201d instead of the word \u201cposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Appellants contend there can be a demotion in the <em>type </em>of position even where the salary remains the same. (See <em>Reed </em>v. <em>City Council of City of Roseville </em>(1943) 60 Cal.App.2d 628, 636 [141 P.2d 459] <em>(Reed).) </em>Relying on <em>Reed </em>and a variety of federal cases that do not address the meaning of \u201cinferior position\u201d or \u201cdemotion\u201d under California\u2019s Education Code, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>argue that an inferior position is one that has \u201ca less distinguished title\u201d or involves \u201csignificantly diminished material responsibilities.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In our search for what the Legislature meant by \u201cposition\u201d (and \u201cinferior position\u201d), we find <em>Reed </em>more helpful than the federal cases appellants cite.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Reed, </em>a housing and sanitation inspector challenged his reassignment to the position of special police officer, arguing that it violated the city personnel board\u2019s rule allowing transfers between civil service positions \u201c \u2018in the same or comparable class\u2019 \u201d but disallowing transfers used to effectuate promotions or demotions. <em>(Reed, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.2d at p. 630.) The trial court ordered the petitioner restored to his former position, and the Court of Appeal affirmed. The appellate court compared the qualifications and duties of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>two positions, found them \u201cmarkedly dissimilar,\u201d and concluded that the positions were \u201cneither of the same nor of a comparable class.\u201d <em>(Reed, </em>at p. 635.) It was \u201cobvious that the transfer complained of effected a demotion,\u201d because although both positions paid the same salary, and \u201cit may appear that one qualified to perform the duties of housing and sanitation inspector is qualified to perform the duties of special police officer, yet <em>if the situation be reversed, </em>the lack of qualification of the latter to perform the duties of the former instantly appears, and compels the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s transfer did effect a demotion.\u201d <em>(Reed, </em>at pp. 635-636, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In our view, <em>Reed </em>provides a useful metric for objectively assessing when reassignment to a position with the same classification, title,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> salary, and benefits is an assignment to an \u201cinferior position\u201d or, in other words, a demotion. We think such situations will rarely be demotions. But if, after a comparison of the qualifications and/or duties of the two positions (A and B), it \u201cinstantly appears\u201d that a person qualified to perform the duties of position A would not be qualified to perform the duties of position B, then position A is, in our view, the inferior one. (See <em>Reed, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.2d at pp. 635-636.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Here, the trial court in essence applied this analysis. After considering all of the evidence adduced at trial, including the written job descriptions, the court concluded that appellants had not been assigned to inferior positions. Our review of the record finds substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Given the allegation in their writ petition that their former positions had been \u201cfilled by considerably younger <em>and less qualified employees''\u2019 </em>and given their reliance on <em>Reed, </em>we would have expected appellants to adduce evidence at trial showing that the vice-presidents\u2019 assistants who assumed those positions had struggled to perform their duties in the office of the superintendent/president. (Italics added.) The record is devoid of any such evidence, which suggests that the positions were similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Dr. Helm testified that appellants would have done \u201cvery much the same kind of work\u201d in their new positions. \u201c[T]he work includes managing calendar[s], setting meetings, interaction with the public, handling anything as mundane as filing to making judgments about priorities for the person for whom you are working.\u201d The written job descriptions for the senior executive assistant and executive assistant positions, while not identical, bolster Dr. Helm\u2019s statement: both describe standard secretarial and administrative support duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Appellants testified that the responsibilities of their former positions were \u201cwell above\u201d the routine tasks they would have been relegated to in their new assignments working for District vice-presidents. When asked to identify specific \u201cconcrete differences\u201d between their former and new assignments, however, they were unable to do so. Although Culver complained that in her new assignment, she would no longer \u201cdeal with vice-presidents on the campus and then you go to local, national, state, international levels,\u201d she conceded on cross-examination that the vice-presidents\u2019 assistants also dealt with local, state, and national government entities. Lawrence similarly conceded that assistants to the vice-presidents, just like assistants to the superintendent/president, interacted with deans, faculty, directors, and managers, and also had contact with boards of hospitals, agricultural companies, and the like. Appellants also acknowledged that the vice-presidents\u2019 assistants had duties above and beyond those expressly spelled out in the written job descriptions. Those tasks were encompassed by a general statement at the end of the job descriptions: \u201cPerform related duties as assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Given this evidence, the trial court could reasonably have discredited appellants\u2019 assertions that they had been reassigned to \u201cinferior position[s]\u201d that \u201cinvolved significantly <em>less </em>responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">2. \u201cStatus\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Appellants equate \u201cstatus\u201d with prestige. \u201c \u2018Inferior status,\u2019 \u201d they assert, \u201cclearly encompasses changes such as ... a lower prestige position dealing with persons or groups lower in the College hierarchy.\u201d The District, on the other hand, suggests that \u201cstatus\u201d refers to classifications such as full-or part-time, permanent or at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">\u201cStatus\u201d is not defined in the Education Code,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we have found no case authority addressing its meaning. The American Heritage College Dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>defines \u201cstatus\u201d as \u201c1. Position relative to that of others; standing. 2. High standing; prestige.\u201d (American Heritage College Diet., <em>supra, </em>p. 1328.) Similarly, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cstatus\u201d as \u201c2 a : position or rank in relation to others (as in a social order, community, class, or profession) . . . b : relative rank in a hierarchy of prestige . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet., <em>supra, </em>p. 2230.) Thus, common usage suggests that the word is reasonably susceptible of both interpretations the parties offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Where the plain language of a statute is ambiguous, we look to the context in which it appears. <em>(Jefferson, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 94.) \u201cWords used in an ordinary sense in one part of an enactment are to be construed in the same sense in another in the absence of express definition.\u201d <em>(Short v. Barkley </em>(1952) 108 Cal.App.2d 873, 877 [240 P.2d 337].) Here, the sense in which the Legislature uses \u201cstatus\u201d in other parts of the statute lends support to the District\u2019s interpretation of the word. In the subdivision immediately preceding the definition of \u201cdemotion,\u201d for example, the statute provides that, \u201c \u2018Regular,\u2019 as used in the phrase \u2018regular classified employee,\u2019 or any similar phrase, refers to a classified employee who has <em>probationary or permanent </em>status.\u201d (\u00a7 88001, subd. (c), italics added.) Other provisions refer to \u201cpaid status\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 88002, subd. (a), 88165, 88197), \u201cpermanent status\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 88005.1, 88008, 88079, 88091), \u201cinvoluntary leave status\u201d (\u00a7 89536.1, subd. (b)), and \u201cregular status in a full-time position\u201d (\u00a7 88076). Additionally, section 88120 distinguishes regular from probationary status. (\u00a7 88120.) These usages lend support to the District\u2019s objective interpretation. We find nothing in the context of the statute to support appellants\u2019 subjective interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We have examined the legislative history of section 88001, but it contains no clues to what the Legislature meant by \u201cstatus.\u201d <em>(Jefferson, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 94.) Therefore, we consider public policy. <em>(Maclsaac v. Waste Management Collection &amp; Recycling, Inc. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1084 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 650].) \u201c[W]e apply \u2018reason, practicality, and common sense to the language at hand.\u2019 [Citation.] The words of the statute should be interpreted \u2018to make them workable and reasonable.\u2019 [Citation.] We will also consider the consequences that will flow from a particular statutory interpretation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ailanto Properties, Inc. v. City of Half Moon Bay </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 572, 583 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Overwhelming public policy as well as practical considerations make it highly unlikely, in our view, that the Legislature intended to give \u201cstatus\u201d the subjective interpretation appellants advance here. As becomes immediately apparent, such a nebulous standard is no standard at all. Were we to adopt appellants\u2019 standard, any classified employee could demand notice and a hearing upon being transferred to a position he or she in some subjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>sense deemed less prestigious, even if his or her classification, title, salary, and benefits remained the same. An assistant to the vice-president of business services could object to a lateral transfer to the office of the vice-president of student services, arguing, as Culver did, that working with students is far less prestigious than interacting with executives. How would a hearing officer or a court, faced with conflicting testimony from Dr. Helm that \u201c[f]rom my perspective, the only business we\u2019re in is teaching and learning, and that always makes the Office of Instruction the most important office in the college,\u201d decide such a claim? Whose subjective viewpoint should prevail? The standard appellants urge would be unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Appellants\u2019 standard would also deny school management the flexibility it needs to address staffing issues, replacing that flexibility with distracting and costly administrative procedures and litigation. It would have repercussions far beyond a school district\u2019s executive offices, because the classified service \u201c \u2018include[s] custodians, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, clerical staff, some instructional aides, and other nonteaching and nonadministrative positions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Seymour v. Christiansen </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1168, 1176-1177 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 257].) Since the identical definition of \u201cdemotion\u201d appears in the sections governing classified employees of elementary and secondary school districts, it would affect those districts as well. (\u00a7\u00a745101 et seq., 45101, subd. (d).) We do not believe the Legislature intended such an absurd interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">These considerations lead us to conclude that the Legislature intended \u201cstatus\u201d to refer to objectively ascertainable indicators that establish an employee\u2019s .standing relative to that of other employees. Examples include full-time versus part-time and confidential<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> versus nonconfidential. This is not an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to illustrate the stark difference between objectively ascertainable indicators of \u201cstatus\u201d and the highly subjective indicators that appellants urge its to adopt. We reject appellants\u2019 contention that \u201cstatus\u201d means prestige.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The cases on which appellants rely do not change our conclusion. In <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>McNamara </em>(D.Conn. 2004) 342 F.Supp.2d 59 <em>(Lynch), </em>the court held that a police sergeant did not have a protected property interest in remaining a member of Connecticut\u2019s Statewide Firearms Trafficking Task Force. Even assuming that he did, he was not deprived of that interest where he voluntarily left the task force before a disciplinary transfer and, after successfully grieving the discipline, obtained a settlement redesignating it as administrative. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>Lynch </em>is not, as appellants claim, a case in which \u201cthe court determined whether there had been a change in \u2018rank\u2019 by comparing \u2018prestigiousness\u2019 of the employee\u2019s new duties with the \u2018prestigiousness\u2019 of his former duties.\u201d The <em>Lynch </em>decision did not turn on prestige. As the court explained, \u201creassignments and transfers generally do not implicate a protected property interest for the purposes of due process, <em>unless accompanied by a loss in pay.\u201d (Lynch, supra, </em>342 F.Supp.2d at pp. 65-66, italics added.) Not only was there no loss of pay in <em>Lynch, </em>the court continued, but the plaintiff retained \u201chis rank of sergeant, his base pay, normal union steps in pay raises and obtained even more prestigious positions after the transfer.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 64, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Appellants also cite <em>Kocsis, </em>asserting that \u201c[r]eassignments have . . . been considered \u2018demotions\u2019 when they have involved a loss of <em>'prestige in [the </em>employee\u2019s] <em>position because of her working conditions or her title </em>change.\u2019 \u201d But the plaintiff in that ADA case did not claim a loss of prestige. <em>(Kocsis, supra, </em>97 F.3d at pp. 886-887.) <em>Kocsis </em>does not help appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on title VII cases is similarly misplaced. The fact that job prestige may be relevant in some circumstances does not mean it is relevant in entirely different circumstances. Even in the title VII context, moreover, \u201can employee alleging a loss of prestige on account of a change in work assignments, without any tangible harm, will be outside the protection afforded by Congress in Title VII\u2019s anti-discrimination clause . . . .\u201d <em>(Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla. </em>(11th Cir. 2001) 245 F.3d 1232, 1245; accord, <em>Maclin </em>v. <em>SBC Ameritech </em>(7th Cir. 2008) 520 F.3d 781, 789 [\u201ca change in title that deprives an employee of prestige is insufficient if it lacks more substantive effect\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The trial court correctly concluded that appellants\u2019 reassignments were not \u201cdemotions\u201d or \u201cdisciplinary actions\u201d triggering notice and hearing rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">3. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Appellants claim the District\u2019s failure to afford them prereassignment notice and hearings violated their rights to due process, since they had a property interest in their former positions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">California\u2019s statutory scheme governing civil service employment gives state employees who attain \u201cpermanent\u201d status a property interest in continued employment that cannot be denied without due process. <em>(Skelly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 206-207 [124 Cal.Rptr. 14, 539 P.2d 774] <em>(Skelly).) </em>But as the United States Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>explained, \u201cthe range of interests protected by procedural due process is not infinite.\u201d <em>(Board, of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 564, 570 [33 L.Ed.2d 548, 92 S.Ct. 2701] <em>(Roth).) </em>\u201cTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>(Roth, </em>at p. 577; see <em>Shelly, </em>at pp. 206-207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">\u201cProperty interests ... are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law\u2014rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d <em>(Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at p. 577; see <em>Shelly, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 207.) \u201cIt is the state . . . that defines the substantive nature of the property interest.\u201d <em>(Coleman v. Department of Personnel Administration </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1102, 1117 [278 Cal.Rptr. 346, 805 P.2d 300] <em>(Coleman).) </em>\u201cThe statutory terms that define a particular right to employment determine its dimensions and scope.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The Education Code gave appellants a property interest in continued employment. (\u00a7\u00a7 88121, 88001, subds. (d), (e), (h).) \u201cIn a practical sense a permanent employee\u2019s property interest in continued employment embraces his current classification as well as his current salary.\u201d <em>(Ng v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 600, 606 [137 Cal.Rptr. 387].) That property interest is damaged by demotion as well as by dismissal: \u201cThe latter deprives him of the entire interest, the former of part.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, there was no loss of a property interest created by statute because, as we have already concluded, appellants\u2019 reassignments did not constitute \u201cdemotions\u201d within the meaning of section 88001, subdivision (d). Nor have appellants identified any other basis affording them the right to prereassignment notice and hearings. As the trial court expressly found, \u201c[n]o Hartnell Board Policy provides a right to notice and a hearing for a transfer of a confidential classified employee.\u201d Appellants do not challenge that finding on appeal. Moreover, \u201c[i]t is well established that an employee enjoys no fundamental or vested right to continuation in a particular job assignment.\u201d <em>(Dobbins v. San Diego County Civil Service Com. </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 125, 131 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 39].) Appellants\u2019 due process challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">C.

But the case they cite does not support their argument. In <em>Finot </em>v. <em>Pasadena City Bd. of Education </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 189 [58 Cal.Rptr. 520] <em>(Finot), </em>the court held that a teacher\u2019s reassignment from classroom to home teaching, solely because he wore a beard, deprived him of a personal liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Finot, </em>at p. 202.) He suffered \u201ca legally remediable detriment\u201d because, although his rank and pay remained the same, his workload increased sevenfold, and he had only limited contact with other faculty members, whose \u201crather constant company\u201d he had enjoyed in his previous position. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 202-203.) <em>Finot </em>does not support the assertion that changes in the nature and types of interactions an employee is likely to have can, without more, signify an inferior position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> The federal cases appellants cite do not advance their position because those cases apply different statutes to different factual situations. In <em>Crady v. Liberty National Bank and Trust Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 993 F.2d 132 <em>(Crady), </em>the court rejected a former assistant vice-president\u2019s Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq.) claim, noting that where salary and benefits remain the same, a change in employment \u201cmust be more disruptive than ... an alteration of job responsibilities\u201d and a title change from assistant vice-president to loan manager. <em>(Crady, </em>at p. 136.) In <em>Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1996) 97 F.3d 876 <em>(Kocsis), </em>the court rejected an Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) claim by a former nursing supervisor reassigned to the position of unit RN (registered nurse) because of poor performance. She claimed she had been \u201cdemoted\u201d because of her health problems to a position that was \u201cmuch more physically demanding.\u201d <em>(Kocsis, </em>at pp. 879-880.) But her pay and benefits had remained the same, and her new position was \u201cvery similar, differing only in the number of patients and employees for whom [she] was responsible.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 879.) The court of appeals affirmed summary judgment for the employer, holding that the plaintiff had failed to establish a materially adverse employment action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 885 [\u201creassignments without salary or work hour changes do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment decisions in employment discrimination cases\u201d].) In analyzing the \u201cmaterially adverse change\u201d issue, the court reviewed a number of ADEA and title VH cases that had rejected similar claims. <em>(Kocsis, </em>at pp. 885-886; see, e.g., <em>Flaherty v.
