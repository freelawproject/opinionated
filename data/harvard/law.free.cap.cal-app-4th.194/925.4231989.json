Girardi and his law firm Girardi &amp; Keese (collectively G&amp;K) in a previous lawsuit by employees of Lockheed Corporation (Lockheed) against Lockheed and other defendants (Lockheed Action). Gutierrez appeals from a judgment following an order granting G&amp;K\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Over a period of about 10 years, G&amp;K negotiated settlements with most of the defendants in the Lockheed Action on behalf of Gutierrez and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>plaintiffs in that action. Gutierrez received a series of payments as his share of the settlement proceeds. Subsequently, three of the nonsettling defendants in the Lockheed Action filed a motion for summary judgment against Gutierrez on the ground that his action was barred by the statute of limitations. The motion was granted and judgment was entered in the Lockheed Action against Gutierrez with respect to the nonsettling defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The gravamen of Gutierrez\u2019s allegations in this action is that G&amp;K misappropriated part of the settlement funds paid by the settling defendants for the benefit of Gutierrez and other class members. Gutierrez asserts causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and money had and received against G&amp;K.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The trial court granted G&amp;K\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Gutierrez could not prove the elements of causation and damages in both of his causes of action because his claims against the settling defendants in the Lockheed Action would have been barred by the statute of limitations had the settling defendants asserted them. In other words, the trial court concluded that because the statute of limitations objectively barred Gutierrez\u2019s causes of action in the Lockheed Action, as a matter of law he could not prevail in his causes of action against G&amp;K. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In many cases when a client sues his or her attorney for wrongdoing in connection with litigation (e.g., for breach of fiduciary duty or professional negligence), the merits of the underlying case must be adjudicated. This is because in order to prove the element of causation the client must show that he or she objectively would have obtained a better result in the underlying case in the absence of the attorney\u2019s breach or negligence. The trial court thus must conduct a \u201ctrial within a trial\u201d of the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">In this case, by contrast, a trial within a trial is not necessary. This is because the merits of the Lockheed Action need not be decided in order to determine whether G&amp;K\u2019s alleged misappropriation of the settlement proceeds caused Gutierrez damages. G&amp;K allegedly misappropriated the settlement proceeds <em>after </em>the settlement agreements were executed. At that point, as to the settling defendants, the case was over. The settling defendants could no longer raise any defenses, including their statute of limitations defense. Therefore, if the misappropriation allegations against G&amp;K are true, G&amp;K\u2019s conduct caused Gutierrez to incur damages regardless of whether the settling defendants could have raised a statute of limitations defense prior to settling the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The trial court\u2019s judgment was based on the erroneous assumption that the settling defendants\u2019 statute of limitations defense barred Gutierrez\u2019s claim against G&amp;K. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">1. <em>Gutierrez\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Gutierrez worked for Lockheed for over 30 years beginning in 1973. On March 6, 1987, Gutierrez filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. It alleged that Gutierrez suffered injury to his \u201centire body including psyche\u201d from \u201cstress &amp; strain with toxic exposure\u201d while working as a flight line mechanic at Lockheed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">2. <em>Lockheed Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">On October 28, 1988, Gutierrez and numerous other Lockheed employees in Los Angeles County filed a complaint against Lockheed and other corporate defendants. The complaint alleged that the plaintiffs sustained personal injuries from their exposure to toxic chemicals while working at Lockheed\u2019s facilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It further alleged that the defendants manufactured, formulated, supplied, distributed or sold the toxic chemicals that caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. The complaint set forth fraudulent concealment, strict liability and negligence causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">When the complaint in the Lockheed Action was filed, the attorney for the plaintiffs was Timothy A. Larson. At some point during the Lockheed Action G&amp;K became counsel for Gutierrez and the other plaintiffs. According to Gutierrez, G&amp;K did not have a fee agreement with Gutierrez in connection with the Lockheed Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Between approximately 1991 and 2001, the plaintiffs reached \u201cgeneral settlements\u201d with various defendants (the settling defendants) in the Lockheed Action. The settlements totaled approximately $131 million. G&amp;K received the settlement funds and controlled all disbursements. From October 1991 to February 2001, Gutierrez received 13 settlement checks from G&amp;K totaling $81,310.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">On April 18, 2002, three defendants in the Lockheed Action (the nonsettling defendants) filed a motion for summary judgment against Gutierrez. That motion argued the one-year statute of limitations barred Gutierrez\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">On June 7, 2002, the trial court granted the nonsettling defendants\u2019 motion. The court found that Gutierrez had \u201cinquiry knowledge\u201d of his claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>the nonsettling defendants when he filed his workers\u2019 compensation claim against Lockheed more than a year before the commencement of the Lockheed Action. Accordingly, the court ruled that the one-year statute of limitations barred Gutierrez\u2019s personal injury claims against the nonsettling defendants and that said defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">3. <em>Gutierrez\u2019s Allegations in this Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">On October 23, 2008, Gutierrez commenced this action by filing a complaint against G&amp;K. Gutierrez filed a first amended complaint on February 20, 2009, which is the operative pleading in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The first amended complaint states that this is a class action brought by Gutierrez on behalf of himself and all other persons who were represented by G&amp;K in the Lockheed Action. It sets forth causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The first amended complaint does not allege that the <em>amount </em>of the settlement obtained by G&amp;K was inadequate. Rather, it alleges that G&amp;K breached its fiduciary duty and committed other wrongful acts \u201cwith respect to the handling and distribution of the settlement funds generated\u201d in the Lockheed Action \u201cthat were owing\u201d to Gutierrez and other class members by, inter alia, \u201c[disbursing and/or withholding from distribution\u201d to Gutierrez and class members \u201cas costs amounts and/or items not properly chargeable as costs\u201d; \u201c[disbursing and/or utilizing\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s and class members\u2019 funds for G&amp;K\u2019s \u201cown individual interests\u201d without plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cknowledge or consent\u201d; failing and refusing to \u201cpromptly disburse\u201d to Gutierrez and other class members their \u201cproportional share of the settlements\u201d; failing to maintain Gutierrez\u2019s and other class members\u2019 funds in interest-bearing trust accounts; and \u201c[m]anaging\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s and class members\u2019 funds \u201cin a way to maximize profits for [G&amp;K] at the expense of said plaintiffs.\u201d In total, the first amended complaint alleges, G&amp;K \u201creceived money believed to be in excess of $20 million that was intended to be used for the benefit of\u2019 Gutierrez and other class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">4. <em>G&amp;K\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">On September 30, 2009, G&amp;K filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. G&amp;K argued that Gutierrez could not prove that he sustained damages proximately caused by G&amp;K\u2019s conduct in the Lockheed Action because Gutierrez\u2019s underlying claims against the settling defendants were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">G&amp;K also argued that the doctrine of unclean hands barred Gutierrez\u2019s claims against G&amp;K. This argument was based on G&amp;K\u2019s contentions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>Gutierrez falsely asserted in his workers\u2019 compensation claim and in the Lockheed Action that he suffered injuries from exposure to toxic chemicals while working at Lockheed, and that Gutierrez failed to disclose his claims against G&amp;K to the bankruptcy court in his 2009 personal bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">On January 6, 2010, the trial court granted G&amp;K\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court found that Gutierrez could not establish the elements of causation or damages because the statute of limitations barred his claims against the settling defendants. In granting the motion, the court relied primarily on <em>Slovensky </em>v. <em>Friedman </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1518 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 60] <em>(Slovensky), </em>which we shall discuss in detail, <em>post. </em>The court also expressly stated that it did not address the substantive merits of Gutierrez\u2019s underlying claims in the Lockheed Action or G&amp;K\u2019s unclean hands defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On June 18, 2010, the trial court entered judgment in favor of G&amp;K and against Gutierrez. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">A motion for summary judgment \u201cshall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) A defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question cannot be established or that there is a complete defense thereto. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493] <em>(Aguilar); </em>Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subds. (o), (p)(2).) The moving defendant also bears the initial burden of producing evidence to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact. <em>(Aguilar, </em>at p. 850.) If the defendant meets his or her burden of production, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">This court reviews an order granting a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>(Hughes v. Pair </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1039 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 636, 209 P.3d 963].) \u201cWe apply the same three-step analysis required of the trial court. We begin by identifying the issues framed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond. We then determine whether the moving party\u2019s showing has established facts which justify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>judgment in movant\u2019s favor. When a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment, the final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material factual issue.\u201d <em>(Hernandez v. Modesto Portuguese Pentecost Assn. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1274, 1279 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 229]).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">1. <em>G&amp;K Did Not Meet Its Burden of Showing That Gutierrez Cannot Establish His Breach of Fiduciary Duty Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The first cause of action in Gutierrez\u2019s first amended complaint is breach of fiduciary duty. \u201cThe elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) existence of a fiduciary duty; (2) breach of the fiduciary duty; and (3) damage proximately caused by the breach.\u201d <em>(Stanley </em>v. <em>Richmond </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1086 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">a. <em>Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">G&amp;K concedes that it represented Gutierrez in the Lockheed Action. G&amp;K thus owed a fiduciary duty to Gutierrez, which included a duty of loyalty. <em>(Cal Pak Delivery, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1, H [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 207].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">b. <em>Breach</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">With respect to the element of breach, G&amp;K argues that Gutierrez cannot prove G&amp;K misappropriated settlement funds because at his deposition, Gutierrez testified that there was no written fee agreement between G&amp;K and Gutierrez. Thus, G&amp;K contends, Gutierrez \u201cwill never be able to prove that the amount [G&amp;K] allocated towards fees and costs varied with the terms of his fee agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">We reject this argument. If there was no written contract between Gutierrez and G&amp;K, then the agreement between the parties was voidable at Gutierrez\u2019s option, and G&amp;K was only entitled to collect a reasonable fee. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6147, subd. (b), 6148, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, as a fiduciary, G&amp;K was not allowed to deduct unwarranted costs from the settlement proceeds and was required to comply with its ethical obligations regarding client trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>accounts. G&amp;K thus did not have carte blanche with respect to attorney fees and costs it deducted from the settlement proceeds merely because there allegedly was no written fee agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Moreover, G&amp;K did not produce any evidence indicating it did not misappropriate settlement funds as Gutierrez alleges. For example, G&amp;K did not produce evidence regarding (1) the terms of the agreement(s), if any, between G&amp;K and its clients in the Lockheed Action, including Gutierrez, (2) the costs and attorney fees deducted by G&amp;K from the settlement proceeds, or (3) its calculation of the distribution of settlement funds to the plaintiffs, including Gutierrez. G&amp;K therefore did not meet its burden of showing that Gutierrez cannot establish the element of breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">G&amp;K contends that the trial court could not assume that the allegations in Gutierrez\u2019s first amended complaint regarding the element of breach were true because Gutierrez did not produce any evidence regarding this element. We agree with G&amp;K that a party cannot rely on the allegations of his or her own pleadings to make an evidentiary showing in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. <em>(College Hospital Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 720, fn. 7 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 898, 882 P.2d 894].) G&amp;K, however, did not meet its initial burden of production or its burden of persuasion with respect to the element of breach. Gutierrez thus was not required to produce any evidence regarding this element. Where, as here, \u201ca defendant moving for summary judgment has failed to controvert factual allegations in the complaint, the trial court must deem the allegations true for purposes of the motion.\u201d <em>(Slovensky, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 1534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Assuming the factual allegations in the first amended complaint are true, the element of breach is satisfied. Although the allegations regarding breach are somewhat vague, the first amended complaint essentially alleges that G&amp;K misappropriated the settlement funds paid by the settling defendants. If these allegations are true, G&amp;K breached its fiduciary duty to Gutierrez. (See <em>McKnight </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1025, 1035 [281 Cal.Rptr. 766, 810 P.2d 998] [\u201c \u2018Misappropriation of client funds . . . breaches the high duty of loyalty owed to the client....\u2019\u201d]</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">c. <em>Causation and Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">G&amp;K produced evidence that it contends shows Gutierrez cannot establish the elements of causation and damages, namely evidence indicating that the statute of limitations barred Gutierrez\u2019s causes of action in the Lockheed Action. To prevail on its motion for summary judgment, G&amp;K must show that even if it misappropriated the settlement proceeds in violation of its fiduciary duty, Gutierrez cannot establish the elements of causation or damages. This G&amp;K failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>The unstated assumption in G&amp;K\u2019s argument is that the trial court was required to adjudicate the likelihood that Gutierrez would prevail in the underlying case\u2014the Lockheed Action\u2014in order to determine whether Gutierrez satisfied the elements of causation and damages in his breach of fiduciary duty cause of action against G&amp;K. This assumption ostensibly arises out of extensive case law regarding suits by clients against their litigation attorneys, most notably professional malpractice cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">In a typical professional negligence case against a litigation attorney, a determination of the merits of the underlying lawsuit must be made in order to adjudicate the elements of causation and damages. <em>(Blanks </em>v. <em>Seyfarth Shaw LLP </em>(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 336, 357 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 710] <em>(Blanks).) </em>The plaintiff is required to prove that but for the defendant\u2019s misconduct, \u201c \u2018the plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable judgment or settlement in the action in which the malpractice allegedly occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Viner </em>v. <em>Sweet </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1232, 1241 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 70 P.3d 1046].) \u201cThis method of presenting a legal malpractice lawsuit is commonly called a trial within a trial. It may be complicated, but it avoids speculative and conjectural claims.\u201d <em>(Blanks, </em>at p. 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">\u201cThe trial-within-a-trial method does not \u2018recreate what a particular judge or fact finder would have done. Rather, the jury\u2019s task is to determine what a reasonable judge or fact finder would have done . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] Even though \u2018should\u2019 and \u2018would\u2019 are used interchangeably by the courts, the standard remains an <em>objective </em>one. The trier of facts determines what <em>should </em>have been, not what the result <em>would </em>have been, or could have been, or might have been, had the matter been before a <em>particular judge </em>or jury.\u201d <em>(Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 820, 840 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 780]; accord, <em>Blanks, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at p. 357).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The trial-within-a-trial method has been expanded to breach of fiduciary duty cases and was applicable in the two main cases relied on by <em>G&amp;K\u2014Slovensky </em>and <em>Loube v. Loube </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 421 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 906] <em>(Loube). </em>In <em>Slovensky, </em>after settling a toxic mold personal injury action against the owner of an apartment complex, the plaintiff sued her former attorneys for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. <em>(Slovensky, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 1521.) The plaintiff alleged that the defendants negligently failed to obtain an adequate recovery and that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by misrepresenting and concealing material facts in the course of the litigation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The statute of limitations on the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action in the underlying action, however, had run before she consulted the defendants. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1521-1522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claim, the <em>Slovensky </em>court held: \u201cBecause plaintiff\u2019s claim was time-barred on the day she filed it, she was entitled to no recovery and would inevitably have lost the case had it not settled. Thus, the settlement defendants obtained for her was a windfall. As defendants\u2019 alleged malpractice did not damage her, her malpractice claim fails.\u201d (Slovensky; <em>supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 1528, fa. omitted.) With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claim, the <em>Slovensky </em>court held: \u201cTo the extent plaintiff\u2019s fiduciary breach claim alleges the same damages as her malpractice claim, it fails for the same reason.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In <em>Loube, </em>the plaintiffs were limited partners in a real estate partnership. <em>(Loube, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 424.) The plaintiffs hired a law firm (Loube) to prosecute an action against the general partners. <em>(Ibid.) </em>After default was entered against the general partners and a prove-up hearing was held regarding damages, the plaintiffs were each awarded $248,102 in compensatory damages and $200,000 in punitive damages. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court, however, subsequently reduced the amount of damages to the jurisdictional minimum of $25,000 because the complaint did not state a specific amount of damages. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 424-425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The plaintiffs then sued Loube for professional negligence, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. By their action the plaintiffs sought to hold Loube liable for the reduction in the amount of damages awarded. <em>(Loube, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 425.) The trial court accordingly required the plaintiffs \u201cto conduct a \u2018trial within a trial,\u2019 to prove that had the matter gone to trial they would have received an award of damages exceeding their actual recovery. Concluding that, had the matter gone to trial each [plaintiff] would have been awarded no more than $12,850 compensatory damages and would have obtained no award of punitive damages, the court granted [Loube\u2019s] motion for judgment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Court of Appeal affirmed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In both <em>Slovensky </em>and <em>Loube, </em>a trial within a trial was necessary because the defendant attorneys\u2019 alleged malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty was in connection with a pending or potential lawsuit against third parties. The plaintiffs in <em>Slovensky </em>and <em>Loube </em>alleged that but for the defendants\u2019 malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty they objectively would have obtained a better result in the underlying lawsuit. In both cases, however, the court held that the plaintiffs objectively would not have obtained a better settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>agreement or judgment if the defendants had not committed malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty. Therefore the plaintiffs in <em>Slovensky </em>and <em>Loube </em>could not prove that the defendants\u2019 tortious conduct caused them to incur damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><em>Slovensky </em>and <em>Loube </em>are distinguishable from this case. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Slovensky </em>and <em>Loube, </em>Gutierrez is <em>not </em>alleging that but for G&amp;K\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty he objectively would have obtained a better litigation result (e.g., a higher settlement amount). This is because G&amp;K was not representing Gutierrez with respect to a potential or pending lawsuit against the settling defendants at the time it allegedly breached its fiduciary duty. Before G&amp;K committed any alleged wrongdoing, the settling defendants entered into \u201cgeneral settlements\u201d with the plaintiffs in the Lockheed Action, including Gutierrez. A settlement is \u201c[a]n agreement ending a dispute or lawsuit.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (8th ed. 2004) p. 1405, col. 1; see <em>Page </em>v. <em>MiraCosta Community College Dist. </em>(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 471, 489 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d 902].) After the settlement agreements were executed, Gutierrez could no longer pursue his causes of action against the settling defendants and the settling defendants could no longer raise defenses to Gutierrez\u2019s claims. Thus, once the settling defendants chose to pay the plaintiffs in the Lockheed Action, including Gutierrez, to settle the case, Gutierrez and the other plaintiffs were entitled to their rightful share of the settlement proceeds regardless of whether the settling defendants had a valid statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Because there was no pending or potential action against the settling defendants when G&amp;K allegedly misappropriated the settlement funds, a trial within a trial regarding Gutierrez\u2019s substantive claims in the Lockheed Action is unnecessary. Gutierrez\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty cause of action must stand or fall without regard to the merits of his underlying claims against the settling defendants. Accordingly, whether Gutierrez\u2019s claims against the settling defendants objectively would have been barred by the statute of limitations is irrelevant to Gutierrez\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty cause of action against G&amp;K.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">If we were to adopt G&amp;K\u2019s position\u2014that the merits of Gutierrez\u2019s underlying claims against the settling defendants must be adjudicated\u2014we would create a rule of law that would lead to absurd and inequitable results. For example, suppose a plaintiff retains an attorney to represent him in an employment discrimination action on a contingency basis. After the plaintiff\u2019s employer settles the case for $100,000, the attorney absconds with the settlement proceeds without paying the plaintiff anything. Under G&amp;K\u2019s position, if the plaintiff sued the attorney, the attorney could raise each of the employer\u2019s defenses to the plaintiff\u2019s settled claims and, if the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>prevailed in this trial within a trial, he could keep the $100,000 with impunity. That is not, should not be, and never has been the law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">For the reasons we have explained, G&amp;K did not meet its burden of showing that Gutierrez cannot establish one or more elements of his breach of fiduciary duty cause of action. The trial court\u2019s order granting G&amp;K summary judgment on this cause of action was therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">2. <em>G&amp;K Did Not Meet Its Burden of Showing That Gutierrez Cannot Establish His Money Had and Received Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The appellate courts have not used the terms \u201ccausation\u201d and \u201cdamages\u201d to describe the elements of a cause of action for money had and received. In <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Harney </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1623 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 276], we stated: \u201cA cause of action is stated for money had and received if the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum \u2018for money had and received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">This common count is available in a great variety of situations (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Pleading, \u00a7 561, pp. 688-690) and \u201clies wherever one person has received money which belongs to another, and which in equity and good conscience should be paid over to the latter.\u201d <em>(Weiss </em>v. <em>Marcus </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 590, 599 [124 Cal.Rptr. 297].) Where, as here, the defendant allegedly misappropriates the proceeds of a settlement that belong to the plaintiff, the plaintiff can maintain a money had and received cause of action. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">G&amp;K contends that Gutierrez\u2019s money had and received cause of action against G&amp;K is barred because Gutierrez\u2019s claims against the settling defendants in the Lockheed Action were barred by the statute of limitations. As we explained, <em>ante, </em>however, the merits of Gutierrez\u2019s claims in the Lockheed Action are irrelevant to whether G&amp;K is liable for misappropriating settling proceeds in this action. G&amp;K therefore did not meet its burden of showing that Gutierrez cannot establish one or more elements of his money had and received cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">3. <em>G&amp;K Did Not Meet Its Burden with Respect to the Defense of Unclean </em>Hands<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The judgment is reversed.
