In an issue to determine the validity of the transfer of a mortgage by a father to a son, at a time when the father was alleged to be insolvent, a note not shown to be connected with the creditor\u2019s judgment, and signed, not by the father but by a firm of which he was a member, is inadmissible as irrelevant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b188-9\">2. A contract between father and son, providing for an unreasonable and extravagant compensation for the services of the son, is not fraudulent, as matter of law; if made when the father is possessed of large means and believed himself solvent, it would not be a fraud in law, or in fact, unless made to defraud future creditors.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b188-10\">S.

Hand &amp; Co. entered judgments by confession against Daniel O. Hitner, for $4,000 and $5,500 respectively, and afterwards issued attachments in execution thereon, served upon Charles L. Hamilton, as garnishee. Afterwards Mr. Hamilton, the garnishee, filed a bill in equity against Daniel O. Hitner, the judgment defendant, Daniel O. Hitner, Jr., B. Adams and James C. Hand &amp; Co., averring in substance that on October 25, 1886, Daniel O. Hitner conveyed certain real estate to the said Hamilton, taking as part of the consideration a mortgage upon the land for $10,000, and that on March 7, 1887, said mortgage was assigned by Daniel O. Hitner to Daniel O. Hitner, Jr.; praying for a decree that the parties interplead. On March 7,1890, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>order was made directing issues, wherein the attaching creditors were plaintiffs, and Daniel O. Hitner, Jr., defendant, to determine the ownership of the bond and mortgage and the interest then due thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-4\">At the trial of the issues together, on March 10, 1890, the plaintiffs, introducing testimony tending to show that, at the time the mortgage was transferred to the defendant in the issues, his father, the said Daniel O. Hitner, was largely indebted and insolvent, offered in evidence a \u201cnote of D. O. &amp; H. S. Hitner, dated January 1, 1878, at one year, for $4,000, in favor of David Adams, and the indorsements of interest on that note up to March 30, 1887, as that debt for which the judgment of $4,000 to D [B ?] Adams was confessed by Daniel O. Hitner.\u201d Objection being made, the offer was refused; exception.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\">Various other offers of evidence on the part of the plaintiffs were refused; exceptions.2 to 6</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-6\">On the part of the defendant, testimony was introduced to the effect that in March, 1879, the defendant was in his father\u2019s marble yard at Ninth street and Columbia Avenue, Philadelphia; that his father desired him to go to superintend his father\u2019s three iron furnaces, and that a contract was made whereby the defendant was to go to the furnaces to attend them, and when they were running he was to receive fifty cents per ton on all the iron that was made, and a living; the living was to come out before anything else; that, when the furnaces were out of blast, he was to get nothing but the living ; that the defendant\u2019s pay was not to be drawn out, but was to remain at interest; and that the witness superintended the furnaces afterward under that contract. It was shown, further, that the mortgage was transferred to the defendant in part payment of indebtedness due to the defendant from his father for sevices under said contract, and that subsequently, to wit, on May 27,1887, when other property, real and personal, was transferred to him, in payment of the balance of his claim, a statement of the account was made up by the conveyancer and executed by his father, which was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-7\">\u201c Daniel O.

J., charged the jury, answering certain points presented by the plaintiffs as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-18\">1. The uncontradicted evidence, in this case, being that the alleged contract between Daniel O. Hitner, Sr., and Daniel O. Hitner, Jr., was kept hidden and concealed, and unexecuted until the eve of his bankruptcy, constitutes a fraud in law, and your verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Answer : This is refused.14</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\">2. If the jury believe that Daniel O. Hitner, Sr., was deeply indebted and on the eve of bankruptcy, when he transferred the mortgage in question to his son Daniel O. Hitner, Jr., and that Daniel O. Hitner, Jr., had then no visible means of paying for it, a presumption of fraud is created which the defendant must rebut, by clear evidence, or else stand convicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">Answer: This is true. The jury may infer fraud in the transaction, if the testimony shows that Daniel O. Hitner, Jr., was known not to have the means to pay for the mortgage. But the jury cannot consider but part of the evidence bearing upon this question. They must determine from all the facts in evidence whether Daniel O. Hitner, Jr., had a bona fide debt against his father, and took property from him at a fair price on account of the payment of such debt.15</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">5. If the jury find that the effect of the alleged contract, and its concealment, between Daniel O. Hitner, Jrv and Daniel O. Hitner, Sr., was to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, then your verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-8\">Answer: This is refused.16</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-9\">6. Under all the evidence in this case, the verdict of the jury must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-10\">Answer: That is refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-11\">7. The uncontradicted evidence being that the business of Daniel O. Hitner ceased in 1883, the jury have a right to infer, in the absence of express proof to the contrary, that the insolvency existed prior to the alleged contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-12\">Answer: This is refused; but, as I have already stated to you, it seems to the court immaterial whether there was, or was not, insolvency, or impending insolvency, at that time, unless the jury should find that there was an intent, when this contract was made, to hinder, delay, or defraud subsequent creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-13\">8. If the jury believe that the alleged contract was unreasonable, and more than a fair compensation for the services of the defendant, then, being unexecuted until after the insolvency, it would be a fraud in law, and your verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-14\">Answer: This is refused. It would be true, if the plaintiffs had been creditors of Daniel O. Hitner, Sr., at the time the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>contract was made, or if the contract had been made with intent to defraud subsequent creditors, such as the plaintiffs in this issue.17</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">9. The uncontroverted testimony showing that the defendant took transfers of property for $2,814.90 more than under his own alleged contract and settlement he was entitled to, the whole transaction is in law a fraud, and your verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">Answer: This is refused.18</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">10. The whole claim, as alleged by defendant, amounting to $20,935.10, and the transfers of property amounting to $23,750, the plaintiffs are entitled, under any view of the case, 'to a verdict in their favor for $2,814.90 of said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">Answer: This is refused. No such verdict can be rendered in this issue.19</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">\u2014The jury returned a verdict in each issue in favor of the defendant. Judgment having been entered, the plaintiffs took these appeals, assigning for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\">1-6.

Complaint is made, however, in the first assignment, of the rejection of the note of $4,000. It was offered as the basis of the judgment confessed to plaintiff Adams, and the obvious purpose was to show that Daniel O. Hitner was indebted to Adams in this amount at the time he, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Hitner, transferred the mortgage of $10,000 to his son. There was nothing, however, to connect the note with the judgment. It was not the individual note of Hitner, but was made by D. O. &amp; H. S. Hitner. In addition, there was no offer to follow it up by evidence that the judgment was confessed for this note. We think the offer was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The assignments from 2 to 6, inclusive, relate to the rejection and admission of testimony. After a careful consideration of them, we are unable to find error in either. A discussion of them in detail would not be profitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The remaining assignments allege error in the charge and the answers to points. While these assignments are numerous, they all point to the question of the alleged fraud in the transfer of the mortgage before referred to. The pivotal point in the case was the validity of the contract between Daniel O. Hitner and his son, who is the defendant, for the services of the latter. It was claimed by the plaintiffs that the compensation was extravagant, and an evidence of fraud. They asked the court to charge: \u201c If the jury believe that the alleged contract was unreasonable, and more than a fair compensation for these services of the defendant, then, being unexecuted until after the insolvency, it would be a fraud in law, and your verdict must be for the plaintiffs.\u201d To which the learned judge replied: \u201c This is refused. It would be true, if the plaintiffs had been creditors of Daniel O. Hitner, Sr., at the time the contract was made, or if the contract had been made with intent to defraud subsequent creditors, such as the plaintiffs in this issue.\u201d We are unable to see any error in this ruling. If, at the time Mr. Hitner made this arrangement with his son, he was possessed of large means, and believed himself solvent, it would not be a fraud in law, or in fact, if it was not done for the purpose of defrauding future creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Complaint was also made that the defendant took property in excess of his claim to the extent of $2,814.90, and the court was asked to charge that the transaction was fraudulent. This request was refused. See eighteenth and nineteenth assignments. We cannot say it was error to refuse this instruction. It is true that in the settlement of May 27, 1887, the defendant took transfers of property amounting nominally to $23,750 in settlement of a claim of $20,985.10, but the court could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>say, as a matter of law, that the transaction was fraudulent. A portion of the property consisted of real estate, tools, and ears, upon which a certain value was placed. Some of the property may not have been worth the valuation arbitrarily placed upon it, and whether there was any fraud in it was for the jury. In each case,</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The judgment is affirmed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
