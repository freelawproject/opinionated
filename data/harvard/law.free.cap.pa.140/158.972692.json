Sepp, an alderman, to recover from the defendant the penalty of \u00a750 incurred for peddling foreign and domestic goods within the county of Lehigh without a license, contrary to the act of April 10,.1869, P. L. 835; that, after a hearing had before the said alderman, on July 12, 1890, the alderman entered judgment publicly for the defendant and against the plaintiff, and on the same day the petitioner applied for an appeal; that the evidence upon which it was sought to recover judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the defendant for illegal peddling, was of the following character : The defendant, being in the employ of the Grand Union Tea Company, who had a place of business in the city of Allentown, Lehigh county, whore the company paid a mercantile license, came to the houses of various persons residing in the borough of Catasauqua, at divers times, and took orders for coffee, tea and spices; he came with a wagon, would subsequently deliver the goods ordered, and then take new orders for future delivery.

The alderman gave judgment in favor of the defendant, in which he was clearly right, as the evidence which he sets forth upon the face of his transcript shows very conclusively that the defendant was not a peddler, within the meaning of the act of 1869. On the contrary, he kept a store in the city of Allentown, and merely solicited orders through the county of Lehigh for his goods. When such orders were given he subsequently delivered the goods. We do not understand the act of 1869 to interfere with a merchant, having a fixed place of business, soliciting orders from persons either in the town where his store is located or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">After the alderman had entered the judgment in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff made application to the court below for leave to enter an appeal, which was refused. This refusal is assigned as error here. Neither the fourteenth section of article Y. of the constitution, nor the act of April 17, 1876, gives an appeal, as a matter of right, in eases of summary convictions. They can only be had \u201cupon allowance by the court,\u201d which means, upon cause shown: McGuire v. Shenandoah, 109 Pa. 613. The plaintiff, here, instead of showing any proper ground of appeal, shows very clearly that he had no cause. The alderman entered a proper judgment, and the court below was right in refusing to allow the appeal. We may add, further, that the act referred to gives no appeal to this court, and we might well quash it for that reason. As, however, the record has been brought here upon a writ of certiorari,- we have concluded to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
