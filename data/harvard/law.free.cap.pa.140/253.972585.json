The other half to be divided equally between Josephine Lukens and the children of John R. Ash in the event of the death of Josephine Lukens her portion to go to the children of John R. Ash.\u201d.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">On the evening of the day the will was written, the testator had a severe attack of angina pectoris. His physician, Dr. Swartzlander, wrote the will at his dictation. The will had been completed with the words John R. Ash, when Mrs. Green, the wife of the testator, came into the room, in an excited manner, and stated, in the hearing of all present, that Josephine Lukens was very ill with pneumonia and liable to die at any moment. After this announcement, the scrivener, by direction of the testator, added the last clause: \u201c In the event of the death of Josephine Lukens her portion to go to the children of John R. Ash.\u201d Both testator and Miss Lukens recovered. The testator died on April 6, 1888; Miss Lukens still survived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-9\">Josephine Lukens had lived in the family of Mr. Green ever since she was five years of age. Her sister Kate became a member of the family some years afterward, when she also was a little girl, and so remained when she was married to John R. Ash about 1879. She continued to live in the family several years after her marriage, and her eldest son was born there. Mrs. Ash died in July, 1887, leaving four children, William H., Samuel G., Henry D., and John St. Clair Ash. Mr. Green had no children of his own, and though not formally adopting Josephine and Kate, he had always treated them as though they were his own daughters. In the controversy before the auditor, wherein the Solicitors\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Company appeared as the guardian of three of said children, who were minors, the question was, whether Josephine Lukens was entitled to one half the funds, the children of John R. Ash taking among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>them the other half, or whether she was to take for life but one fifth of the funds, sharing equally with the said children in the division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">Upon the facts stated, the auditor\u2019s report upon this question was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">In determining the first vital question in controversy, in the case, we must decide whether the testator intended to put the Ash children into a class, and to give the class no more than he gave to Miss Lukens. In deciding it, we must follow the rule laid down by Justice Trunkey, in Porter\u2019s App., 94 Pa. 886, where he says: \u201c The intention of the testator is the prevailing consideration in applying all rules of construction. It is the intention of the testator, expressed in the will, that is to govern, and this is to be judged of exclusively by the words of the instrument as applied to the subject-matter and surrounding circumstances.\u201d Applying this rule to the case in hand, the auditor is of the opinion that Miss Lukens is entitled to one half of the fund for distribution, and each of the Ash minors to one eighth, and that the gift to her is an absolute one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-7\">It is fair to presume that the testator used the word \u201c between \u201d in its usual, proper, and ordinary signification.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Worcester gives as one of the definitions of the word, <em>\u201c </em>bearing relation to two; from one to another.\u201d In explaining the difference of meaning between the two words, \u201c between \u201d and \u201c among,\u201d he says \u201c between is used in reference to two things, parties, or persons; among in reference to a greater number.\u201d Webster says that \u201c between \u201d applies properly to only two parties. Applying this well-understood distinction to the direction of the will that the half should be \u201c divided equally between Josephine Lukens and the children of John R. Ash,\u201d it is obvious that, in drawing the line, he put on one side of it Miss Lukens, and on the other side he arranged the Ash children as a class. If he had intended each of them to have an equal share with her, he would have used other language, probably directing a division \u201c amongst Josephine Lukens and the children of John R. Ash, each to take an equal share.\u201d To adopt the language used in Risk\u2019s App., 52 Pa. 269, \u201c had he meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the children to take per capita, he doubtless would have named them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">If the gift had been to them as individuals and not to the class, and any one of the number had died during the lifetime of the testator, there would have been an intestacy as to the share of the one so dying. But the gift to the class guards against the lapsing of any individual share. The further provision, that in the event of the death of Josephine Lukens, her share should go to the children of John R. Ash, without naming or in any way individuating them, is additional evidence that he intended to treat them as a class, and that, whether at his death it might consist of one or of four members who should take. The danger of intestacy as to any part of his estate was then guarded against, except in the improbable contingency of the death of all the Ash children before his own decease. This construction is in harmony with the fact that Mrs.-Ash and Miss Lukens occupied the relation practically to him of daughters, and the Ash children of grandchildren. He gave to his wife the portion which the intestate laws would have given her, and the balance he divided as the intestate laws would have divided it, if the relationship above referred to had actually existed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">\u2014Citing and considering: 2 Jarman on Wills, 756; Dible\u2019s Est., 81* Pa. 281; Minter\u2019s App., 40 Pa. 111; Osburn\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 642; Risk\u2019s App., 52 Pa. 269; Young\u2019s App., 83 Pa. 63; Fissel\u2019s App., 27 Pa. 55; Lockwood\u2019s App., 55 Conn. 157; Alden v.

The auditor is not able to agree to this view. He does not find that the will was made when the testator was expecting to die, nor that he did not have in contemplation the possibility of Josephine Lukens dying in his life<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>time. While Mr. Ash states that in the early period of his attack testator complained that if he continued on in this way he could not live until morning, yet when the doctor came he was in an improved condition, and the doctor says that he was in \u201c comparatively pretty good shape \u201d when the will was written. It is fair to be inferred from the evidence that the testator contemplated the probability of Josephine Lukens dying in his lifetime, and that when the news of: her condition was communicated to him he deemed it best to add another clause to his will to guard against this contingency. The will speaks as of the time of his death nearly two months later. There is nothing in the facts and circumstances of this case to satisfy the auditor that there is such \u201c clear evidence \u201d as will warrant setting aside the rule of law in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">\u2014The auditor having filed distributions awarding to Josephine Lukens one half the funds and dividing the remainder in equal shares among the minor children of John R. Ash, Mrs. Green, the widow, having received her share, exceptions were filed by the Solicitors\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., guardian, alleging that the auditor erred in not awarding to each of the minors one fifth of the funds absolutely, and one fourth of one fifth thereof subject to the life-estate of Josephine Lukens therein. Said exceptions, after argument thereof before the court, were dismissed, without opinion filed, and decrees entered confirming the auditor\u2019s reports and directing distribution as recommended. Thereupon the exceptant took these appeals, assigning the dismissal of said exceptions and the confirmation of the auditor\u2019s reports, for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-6\"><em>Mr. Samuel Wagner </em>(with him <em>Mr. Samuel W. </em>Cooper), for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">Counsel cited, as to the true rule of interpretation: McCullough v.
