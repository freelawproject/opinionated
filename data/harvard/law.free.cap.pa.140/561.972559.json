The first count charged an assault and battery, and the second an assault and battery with intent to ravish, upon the person of Lizzie Kimmel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-4\">The third count charged that the defendant, \u201c then and there being of the age of sixteen years and upwards, in and upon the said Lizzie Kimmel, then and there being a woman child under the age of sixteen years, and then and there in the peace of God and of the said commonwealth being, feloniously did make another assault, and her, the said Lizzie Kimmel, then and there feloniously, unlawfully and carnally did know and abuse, and a male bastard child on the body of her, the said Lizzie Kimmel, did beget contrary to the form,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-5\">The indictment having been certified unto the Court of Oyer and Terminer, the case was called for trial on May 8, 1890, before Pekshing-, P.

The third count is drawn under the act of May 19,1887, P. L. 128, allowing a conviction of fornication when the defendant is acquitted of felonious rape, but stating in explicit language that the-verdict must then bo guilty \u201cof fornication only.\u201d The act never contemplated bastardy, and definitely and particularly excludes any right of the jury to convict of that of-fence. The indictment is for a felony, and there cannot be a conviction of a misdemeanor other than that specified in the act: Commonwealth v. Weiderhold, 112 Pa. 584. Again; the rules of criminal pleading do not permit a mixture of felonies and misdemeanors in one count, except when there is a statutory enactment authorizing a conviction of the misdemeanor, under an indictment charging the felony, and in this case the law permits a conviction of but one misdemeanor, \u201c fornication only.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-5\"><em>Mr. R.

In the first, he was charged with assault and battery; in the second, with an assault with intent to ravish; and in the third, with statutory rape and with bastardy, the material portion of said count being that the said defendant, \u201c then and there being of the age of sixteen years and upwards, in and upon the said Lizzie Kimmel, then and there being a woman child under the age of sixteen years, and then and there in the peace of God and of the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>commonwealth being, feloniously did make another assault, and her, the said Lizzie Kimmel, then and there feloniously, un lawfully, and carnally did know and abuse, and a male bastard child on the body of her, the said Lizzie Kimmel, did beget, contrary to the form of the act of the general assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Upon the trial below, a motion was made to quash the indictment for a misjoinder of counts, and also to quash the third count. Both motions were refused, and we think properly. Under our authorities there was no misjoinder: Henwood v. Commonwealth, 52 Pa. 424; Hunter v. Commonwealth, 79 Pa. 503. Nor is error perceived in charging bastardy in the same count with the rape. Fornication and bastardy are almost invariably charged in the same count, and adultery and bastardy may be: Gorman v. Commonwealth, 124 Pa. 536. In either case, the bastardy is but an aggravation of the offence charged. Why may not a count for rape include a charge of bastardy ? Both adultery and rape include the offence of fornication ; it is necessarily involved in them: bastardy is not necessarily involved, but it may be. Here the offence was rape; it involved fornication, and bastardy resulted as an incident. There was but the one act charged in the indictment, although it is called by different names, to meet the exigencies of the proofs on the part of the commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">It was urged, however, that the conviction was not warranted by the act of May 19,1887, P. L. 128, which provides that the jury may acquit of the charge of rape, in such cases as this, and convict \u201c of the fornication only.\u201d We do not understand that the legislature intended by the use of the word \u201c only,\u201d to prohibit, on an indictment for rape, a conviction of a constituent offence involved within it. All that it means is that there may be an acquittal of the rape and a conviction for the fornication. It is as if the legislature had said the defendant may be convicted of the fornication \u201c merely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
