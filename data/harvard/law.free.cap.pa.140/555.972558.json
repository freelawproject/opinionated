The commonwealth did not challenge, but stood aside one of the jurors in the box, and passed the list to the defendants, who struck off one, when another juror was called in his place. The list was then returned to the commonwealth\u2019s counsel, who, without challenging, stood aside a second juror, and passed the list to the defendants, who struck off another.

W. Ryon: No, we object; we have got a jury. This is a motion on the part of the commonwealth to stand aside a juror called in answer to a peremptory challenge. The defendants object to the standing aside of the juror on motion and application of the commonwealth, the fact being, as will be exhibited by the record, that as the jurors were called the commonwealth stood aside four that answered to their names as they were called. The process of selecting a jury was continued until there were twelve jurors placed in the box. The commonwealth was then called upon to exercise its right of challenging, in answer to which it waived its first challenge, its second challenge, its third challenge and its fourth challenge. The defendants exercised their right of challenging, and this juror, McGovern, was called in answer to the defendants\u2019 fourth challenge. It is objected, that the right to stand aside must be exercised as the jurors are called, and before any peremptory challenges are made. If the commonwealth allow the twelve jurors to be seated in the box, the only lawful challenge which can be made afterwards, is the four peremptory chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>lenges given by law and such further challenges for cause as they*may have the right to exercise. The right to stand aside jurors is a right which can be lawfully exercised only while the jurors are being called, and before the commonwealth allows twelve of them to take their seats in the box.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-4\">Mr. Schalck: The commonwealth claims the right to stand aside jurors at any time until the panel is exhausted, and that there is no law that limits the right of the commonwealth in the premises, or confines it to standing aside jurors before twelve men are called or before the defendant has made challenges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\">By the court: Objection overruled; exception.2</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">McGovern having been stood aside, William Hay was then called by the clerk.

The answers to the questions on the printed form were inserted by Foley, on the examination of Charles O\u2019Brien in the presence of James O\u2019Brien, a son of Charles O\u2019Brien. At this time, Charles O\u2019Brien was about seventy years of age, and was of infirm health, afflicted with \u201c miner\u2019s asthma; \u201d but his age was put down at fifty-seven, his condition of health good, the agent certifying that he had personally seen and questioned the applicant and recommending the company to accept the risk. Foley afterwards left the application with the company\u2019s medical examiner, at Mahanoy city, saying that Charles O\u2019Brien would call to be examined. Some one did call, at the time appointed, and personated Charles O\u2019Brien, with whom the examiner was unacquainted. It was claimed that the person personating Charles O\u2019Brien was Patrick Gallagher, but the medical examiner was unable to identify him with certainty. The latter made his report to the company, and on June 27, 1887, a policy was issued on the life of James O\u2019Brien for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>$1,000, for the benefit of James O\u2019Brien, and transmitted to the latter, who paid the weekly dues thereon until the death of the assured, on April 12, 1889, from acute bronchitis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">After evidence tending to show collusion between the defendants O\u2019Brien and Foley, the commonwealth proved and offered in evidence an application in printing and writing by Charles O\u2019Brien to the directors of the poor of the county for out-door relief. This application was dated February 7,1885, and was sworn to before James O\u2019Brien as a justice of the peace, with the written answers to the printed questions in his handwriting. In it, the applicant was stated to be sixty-eight years of age, unable to work, without property or money, and destitute because of \u201c old age, and sick with miner\u2019s asthma.\u201d Objected to, by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-7\">By the court: Objection overruled, offer admitted; exception.7</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-8\">At the close of the testimony, the court, Pershing, P. J., charged the jury in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-9\">[As bearing upon the alleged substitution of one party for another in the application, the issuing of this policy by the company, and the alleged fraud, in consequence of this substitution, of some person instead or in place of Charles O\u2019Brien, you have heard a large number of witnesses, giving in detail the apparent age so far as they knew it, of Charles O\u2019Brien, his height, his weight, and his condition of health, prior to and about the time of this application for an insurance policy upon him. It is claimed on the part of the commonwealth that he was much older than represented in the application. The answer to the question of age in the application was fifty-seven years. It is claimed that Charles O\u2019Brien could not have been the man that made that answer; that it must have been somebody else, for the reason that the commonwealth alleges that he was much older than fifty-seven years at the time this application was made in 1887. As a part of the evidence on that point, there is produced here a sworn application made by Charles O\u2019Brien in 1885, for relief from the county, in which it is set forth that he was then sixty-eight years of age. That was in 1885. This application for insurance was dated in 1887. If it is the fact that he was sixty-eight in 1885, it would neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>sarily follow that he was seventy in 1887; and, as he did not die till April, 1889, he would be two years older at that time, which would make him seventy-two. This application for county benefits was received as a declaration on the part of Charles O\u2019Brien as to his age in 1885. We are asked to say to you in a point, and we do so say to you that neither Gallagher nor Foley were parties to that application. There is not a single particle of evidence to connect them with that application. There is no evidence here that they knew anything at all about it. There is no evidence here that, at the time the application was taken by Foley, he knew that Charles O\u2019Brien was as old as he represented himself to be in this application to the county. But it may be the duty of the agent to ascertain the age of the applicant, and if Charles O\u2019Brien was really at the time of his application seventy years of age, and Mr. Foley had known him before, as I believe he testifies he had, it would be a proper inference that he should have taken notice of that fact, or that he was careless or negligent about the matter. That would not amount to conspiracy. But, if this were actually Charles O\u2019Brien, and he knew Charles O\u2019Brien, and could judge from his appearance about his age, it would be a circumstance in the case to be taken into consideration by the jury. The paper itself was not admitted as any evidence against the other two defendants, but it was admitted simply to show how old Charles O\u2019Brien claimed he was at the date of that application.] 8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">\u2014The jury returned a verdict of not guilty as to Patrick Gallagher, and as to James O\u2019Brien and Martin Foley, guilty, with a recommendation to the mercy of the court.

Commonwealth, 128 Pa. 500. Nor was the rule changed by the thirty-seventh section of the criminal procedure act of 1860, which allows peremptory challenges to the commonwealth: Warren v.
