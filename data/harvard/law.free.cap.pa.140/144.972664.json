Cain against her husband. John G. Cain, an issue was awarded, wherein the libellant was plaintiff and the respondent defendant, to determine whether or not the said defendant had by cruel and barbarous treatment endangered the life of the plaintiff, or had offered such indignities to her person as to render her condition intolerable and life burdensome, and had thereby forced her to withdraw from his house and family. Issue joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">At the trial on June 11, 1889, it was made to appear that the plaintiff and defendant were married on January 26, 1869, and that, with the exception of two short periods, they had lived together in Lancaster county until November 16, 1885, when the plaintiff left her husband and went to Montgomery county, where she afterwards resided. The plaintiff and defendant both testified as witnesses. In the plaintiff\u2019s case in chief, she identified a letter received by her from the defendant, dated April 12, 1886, reading literally as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">\u201c Bart will Susana A Cain 1 must in Form you that that money of Dr Martins must be Paid on site I seen Rober Mc-Cloor to Day he must have it on site I told hih I would Rite to you Consuming hit I must here By Return Mail or I will have to see Jacob Heyberger Conserning it J.

Being asked: \u201cWas anything said by her at that time, in regard to ill-treatment, her husband not being present ? \u201d \u201c When she came to your house in November, 1885, did she say anything in regard to ill-treatment of her by her husband, as being the cause which brought her down there ? \u201d \u201c When Susan Cain came to your house in 1885, did she complain of any ill-treatment on the part of her husband, John?\u201d These offers being objected to by the defendant, they were refused; exceptions.2 3 4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The plaintiff offered in evidence depositions of Lee D. Triol and Josephine C. Triol, wherein were given declarations made by the plaintiff to the witnesses, when at their house in November, 1884, not in the presence of the defendant, as to acts and conduct of her husband towards her. These portions of the depositions being objected to by the defendant, the objections were sustained; exceptions.5 678</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-4\">Other like offers on the part of the plaintiff were refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">At the close of the testimony, the case was submitted to the jurj^ by Wbakd, J., and a verdict returned in favor of the defendant. A rule for a new trial having been discharged and judgment entered, the plaintiff took this appeal, filing thirty-three specifications, and assigning as error, inter alia:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">1-8. The refusal of plaintiff\u2019s offers.1 to 8</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-7\">Mr. <em>Webster A. </em>Melcher, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-8\">As to the admissibility of the wife\u2019s declarations, counsel cited: Cattison v. Cattison, 22 Pa. 275; Ogden v. Railroad Co., 23 W. N. 191; Elkins v. McKean, 79 Pa. 493; Bealor v. Hahn, 117 Pa. 169; Hahn v. Bealor, 132 Pa. 242; Grim v. Bonnell, 78 Pa. 152; Albrecht v.

There was nothing upon its face to show its relevancy. Nor do we see any merit in the assignments relating to the exclusion of testimony. The declarations of the libellant, made in the absence of the respondent, were not evidence. They were not a part of the res gestee. The remaining assignments refer to the charge of the court., and are not sustained. The facts of the ease were submitted <em>to </em>the jury under an adequate charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
