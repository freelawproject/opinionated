Ct.; court below, number and term not given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">On January 27, 1890, Jemima Moses presented her petition, supported by the usual affidavits, averring that she was the daughter of Sarah Ann Reeves, who was, and for one year-past and upwards had been, so far deprived of her reason and understanding that she was rendered altogether unfit and unable to govern herself or to manage her affairs, praying for a commission in the nature of a writ de lun\u00e1tico inquirendo, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">A commissioner having been appointed, and an inquisition held, a return was made on March 24, 1890, the finding reported being in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">\u201c That, although they do not find the said Sarah Ann Reeves a lunatic, in the general acceptation of that term, they, by reason of her age, ignorance, and the feeble condition of her mind and body, deem her unfit to manage her estate judiciously, and to have been in that condition for a year last past, and would recommend that the Honorable Court of Chester county appoint a proper person, as committee, to take charge of and account for the same; and further, that the said Sarah Ann Reeves does not enjoy lucid intervals.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">On the same day, on motion of counsel for the alleged lunatic, a rule was granted to show cause why the return should not be set aside. After argument, the court, Hemphill, J., on April 21, 1890, filed an opinion citing Commonwealth v. Haskell, 2 Brewst. 492, and Commonwealth v. Schneider, 59 Pa. 328, and entered an order making the rule absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-9\">On April 26, 1890, on motion of the petitioner\u2019s counsel, a rule was granted to show cause why the alleged lunatic should not pay all the costs of the proceeding. After argument thereof, the court, Hemphill, J., on July 14, 1890, filed an opinion as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-10\">In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the presumption is, in a proceeding de lun\u00e1tico inquirendo, that those who commence and carry it on intend it for the benefit of the alleged lunatic, and have probable ground for their action. In addition to this presumption, we have the return of the commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>In the case in hand, which sets forth that by reason of age, ignorance, and feeble condition of mind and body, the alleged lunatic was deemed unfit to manage her estate judiciously, with a recommendation that the court appoint a committee. This return was set aside, because the commission failed to find the defendant a lunatic. It does, however, indicate there was some cause for believing her incapable of managing her estate. The petitioner, therefore, had some ground for her action, and we think it proper, under all the circumstances, to divide the costs between the petitioner and the alleged lunatic.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\">\u2014An order having been entered accordingly, the petitioner for the commission took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">1. In setting aside the return to the commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">2. In directing that the costs be divided between the petitioner and the alleged lunatic.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-7\"><em>Mr. W. S. </em>Harris, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-8\">Counsel cited: 2 T. &amp; H.

Schneider, 59 Pa. 330; In re Vanaken, 10 N. J. Eq. 195; In re Lindsey, 43 N. J. Eq. 9; Lindsley\u2019s Case, 44 N. J. Eq. 564; In re Gaul\u2019s Est., 7 W. N. 522; Hassenplug\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 527.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b282-11\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The court below set aside the return to the commission because the inquisition did not find the alleged lunatic to be of unsound mind. This is what they did find: \u201c That, although they do not find the said Sarah Ann Reeves a lunatic, in the general acceptation of that term, they, by reason of her age, ignorance, and the feeble condition of her mind and body, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>deem her unfit to manage her estate judiciously, and to have been in that condition for a year last past, and would recommend that the Honorable Court of Chester county appoint a proper person, as committee, to take charge of and account for the same; and further, that the said Sarah Ann Reeves does not enjoy lucid intervals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">This return cannot be sustained under the act of assembly, nor would it warrant the court in making the order therein recommended. The court does not possess the power to appoint a committee merely because a person cannot manage his or her estate judiciously. There are very many sane persons who cannot do that. The return itself is inconsistent, if not insensible. It finds, if it finds anything, that she is not a lunatic, yet that she \u201c does not enjoy lucid intervals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Nor do we think the court erred in the disposition of the costs. They were divided between the petitioner and the alleged lunatic. We regard this as a proper exercise of discretion. In re Weaver, 116 Pa. 225, is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
