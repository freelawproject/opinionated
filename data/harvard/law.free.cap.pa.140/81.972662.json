Payments to be made when the elevator is in running order satisfactory to Mr. Moore or Mr. Smedley.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">On the examination of the plaintiff, it was made to appear that, after the elevator was put in operation, complaint was made that it did not run smoothly, and caused so much noise that it disturbed the guests of the hotel; that plaintiff\u2019s men visited the hotel several times a week \u201c to correct it and prove that it would run without noise; \u201d that his men were sent for to start it whenever any trouble occurred; that the elevator was connected with a forty-horse power boiler, and afterwards changed to a fifteen-horse power boiler temporarily; that after it had been in use for four months, it was removed on notice from the defendant; the plaintiff testifying: \u201cMr. Moore made complaints. I corrected them. I understood my men to say that the complaints were made almost daily during the four months.\u201d The plaintiff, after so testifying, offered to prove \u201c that the faults complained of, in this machine, were due to a want of ordinary care and attention on the part of those having charge of the machine, which the nature of said machine required for its proper operation.\u201d Objection being made, the offer was overruled; exception.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\">The plaintiff then rested; whereupon, on motion of the defendant, the court directed a judgment of nonsuit to be entered, with leave, etc. A rule to take off the judgment having been discharged by the court in banc, the plaintiff took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-11\">1.

Thayer, 108 Pa. 291. The contract for the elevator contained this clause: \u201c I further agree that if my horizontal cylinder direct hydraulic elevator does not answer as per above agreement, then I will take it out at my own expense.\u201d The plaintiff further agreed that payment should be made \u201c when the elevator is in running order satisfactory to Mr. Moore or Mr. Smedley.\u201d The evidence showed that it was not in satisfactory running order to Mr. Smedley, although various efforts were made by plaintiff at various times, covering several months, to put it in such order. The fact that such efforts were required to be made is evidence that' it did not work satisfactorily, and that the defendant\u2019s objections were not founded upon \u201cmere caprice.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s contention, however, was that, if the defendant was not satisfied, he ought to have been; that it was connected with a fifteen-horse power boiler, instead of an eighty-horse power boiler; and that the faults complained of \u201c were due to a want of ordinary care and attention on the part of those having charge of the machine, which the nature of the said machine required for its proper operation.\u201d But, for anything that appears, the defendant may have wanted an elevator that could be operated by a fifteen-horse power engine, and by boys or green hands in its management. It is not customary in hotels and places of business to employ engineers to manage an elevator ; on the contrary, they are usually so constructed that a boy can do so with slight instruction. When the plaintiff agreed that it was not to be paid for until it was in \u201c running order satisfactory to Mr. Smedley,\u201d he submitted that question to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the defendant\u2019s judgment, and, as there is nothing to show caprice in its exercise, we think the plaintiff was bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
