Leach, was the secretary; that on January 5,1887, Leach, acting for himself and Perkins, called upon Sherry to inquire as to the wages of his lasters, and was told that such wages were to be fixed by the lasters ; that on January 8, 1887, certain lasters left the plaintiffs\u2019 employment, giving as a reason therefor that they did not dare to work for them further on account of the defendants ; that, in order to intimidate others from taking their places and to prevent such lasters from re-engaging in their employment, the defendants, on January 8, 1887, with the assent of the association and out of its moneys, caused to be carried in front of Sherry\u2019s factory, by a boy hired for that purpose, a banner bearing the following inscription: \u201c Lasters are requested to keep away from P. P. Sherry\u2019s. Per order L. P. U.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-11\">The bill further alleged, that, because of such banners, crowds of people gathered in front of the factory when the lasters left their work; that the lasters were injured and threatened with bodily harm if they continued in the plaintiffs\u2019 employment; that various lasters, whose names were given, were subsequently called upon by the defendants, and so intimidated and injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>that one of them was confined to his house and another left the plaintiffs\u2019 employment; that the banner and the acts of the defendants were part of a scheme to prevent persons from entering the plaintiffs\u2019 employment, and that the banner was carried in front of the factory until March 22,1887, when the defendants, with a like purpose and at a time when there was no strike in the factory or trouble with the operatives, caused another banner to be carried in like manner before the factory, with the following inscription: \u201c Lasters on a strike and lasters are requested to keep away from P. P. Sherry\u2019s until the present trouble is settled. Per order L. P. U.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">The bill also alleged that Sherry had remonstrated with the defendants without effect; that the business carried on by the plaintiffs was a large one, and that the good-will was of considerable value, both of which, if the defendants were permitted to continue, would be seriously injured and destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">The prayer of the bill was, that the defendants might be restrained from making such banners, and from causing them to be similarly carried, and for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">Hearing before <em>0.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMm\">The case finds that the defendants entered, . with others, into a scheme, by threats and intimidation, to prevent persons in the employment of the plaintiffs from continuing in such employment, and to prevent others from entering into such employment; that the banners with their inscriptions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>used by the defendants as part of the scheme; and that the plaintiffs were thereby injured in their business and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The act of displaying banners with devices, as a means of threats and intimidation to prevent persons from entering into or continuing in the employment of the plaintiffs, was injurious to the plaintiffs, and illegal at common law and by statute. Pub. Sts. c. 74, \u00a7 2. <em>Walker </em>v. Cronin, 107 Mass. 555. We think that the plaintiffs are not restricted to their remedy by an action at law, but are entitled to relief by injunction. The acts and the injury were continuous. The banners were used more than three months before the filing of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, and continued to be used at the time of the hearing. The injury was to the plaintiffs\u2019 business, and adequate remedy could not be given by damages in a suit at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The wrong is not, as argued by the defendants\u2019 counsel, a libel upon the plaintiffs\u2019 business. It is not found that the inscriptions upon the banners were false, nor do they appear to have been in disparagement of the plaintiffs\u2019 business. The scheme in pursuance of which the banners were displayed and maintained was to injure the plaintiffs\u2019 business, not by defaming it to the public, but by intimidating workmen, so as to deter them from keeping or making engagements with the plaintiffs. The banner was a standing menace to all who were or wished to be in the employment of the plaintiffs, to deter them from entering the plaintiffs\u2019 premises. Maintaining it was a continuous unlawful act, injurious to the plaintiffs\u2019 business and property, and was a nuisance such as a court of equity will grant relief against. <em>Gilbert </em>v. Mickle, 4 Sandf. Ch. 357. <em>Springhead Spinning Co. </em>v. Riley, L. R. 6 Eq. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\"><em>Boston Diatite Co. </em>v. <em>Florence Manuf. Co. 114 </em>Mass. 69, was a case of defamation only. Some of the language in <em>Springhead Spinning Co. </em>v. <em>Riley </em>has been criticised, but the decision has not been overruled.
