On cross-examination, he testified that bichromate of potash was very extensively used in dyeing cotton stockings black; that, so far as he knew, no cases of poisoning similar to that of the plaintiff had been published until he published four or five cases in 1886, but that since that time he had seen several more; that up to that time it had not been shown, so far as he could find out,.that cases of poisoning had occurred from chrome mordanted cloth; that he did not know how poisoning could be effected from the presence of chrome compounds in cloth; and to the question, \u201c Is there to-day anything further developed in relation to this kind of poisoning, other than that some people may be injured who have a disposition that way by the presence of this compound ? \u201d he replied, \u201c Nothing more than occasionally persons may be injured by it, but the great majority of people not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-7\">Upon this evidence, the judge ruled that the action could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>be maintained, and ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-5\"><em>F.

The plaintiff\u2019s action was brought on September 22, 1884. According to the testimony of the expert witness introduced by the plaintiff, it had never been shown, until 1886, that any cases of poisoning had occurred like the plaintiff\u2019s. For all that appears, the plaintiff\u2019s was.the first instance of injury that ever was known to arise from the cause alleged in the declaration. All that the plaintiff showed against the defendant was, that it used an article for dyeing its cloths which was the most common mordant used in wool dyeing, which was also used very extensively in dyeing cotton stockings black, which, so far as then known, had never caused injury to anybody who merely handled the cloths, and which the defendant did not know or suppose, and had no reason to know or suppose, to be injurious; and, under these circumstances, although there was evidence tending to show that, in point of fact, the plaintiff was injured by merely handling the cloths, this was not a result which the defendant was bound or ought to have contemplated as likely to happen. The facts of the present case do not call upon us to go any further than this.
