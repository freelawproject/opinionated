A witness was asked, against the objection of the defendant, as to what took place immediately after the defendant was arrested and taken away, and was permitted to reply that he saw one of the persons that had been drinking among the carriages give something to Murphy, who' took it, but that he did not know what it was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-11\">The judge instructed the jury not to consider the evidence of what occurred after the defendant was taken away, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>they found that the defendant and Murphy were acting together in regard to what was done between the carriages, and were confederates in a common enterprise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-7\"><em>J.

The court therefore properly admitted evidence of the acts of Murphy immediately after the arrest of the defendant. The rights of the defendant were carefully guarded by the instruction that the jury should disregard the evidence unless they were satisfied that the parties were acting together as confederates in a common enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"AU7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
