A witness, called by the defendant, testified that, after October 1, 1887, and during the time alleged, he was at the saloon a number of times and saw sales of hop beer there, but no intoxicating liquors, and no delivery or sale of any. On cross-examination he was asked, against the defendant\u2019s objection, whether or not he was drunk near the premises during the last fall, that of 1887, and he testified that he was so drunk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that there was not sufficient evidence of a control by the defendant of the saloon at any time when it was used for the illegal purpose alleged.

If he only acted as the proprietor\u2019s servant, under his direct personal supervision, he could not properly be convicted of this offence. But he might properly be convicted thereof, if, in the proprietor\u2019s absence, he made illegal sales, or otherwise assumed a temporary control of the premises. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>136 Mass. 148. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galligan, </em>144 Mass. 171. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>145 Mass. 250. In applying this rule to the present case, the jury might properly find, from the evidence stated in the bill of exceptions, that the defendant was keeping and maintaining the premises in October.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">2. A witness cannot be asked in cross-examination, in order to affect his credibility, about his part in transactions irrelevant to the issue on trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Schaffner, 146 Mass. 512. But the question whether the witness was not drunk near the saloon the last fall corresponded in time, and bore some relation to the subject, of his testimony. Ordinarily, such a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>would not be proper, merely for the purpose of throwing discredit upon a witness. But, in view of the witness\u2019s testimony on his direct examination, we cannot say, as matter of law, that the question was irrelevant. It was within the discretion of the presiding judge.</p>\n<p id=\"Abu\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
