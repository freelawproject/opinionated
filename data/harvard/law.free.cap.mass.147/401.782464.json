The defendant contended that the evidence was inadmissible, unless the government should first connect Comford with the defendant, by showing that there was between them some relationship, as of master and servant, or that the defendant approved, ratified, or authorized the act of Comford. The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-11\"><em>J.

It was also competent to show what became of it, as a part of the <em>res </em>gestee, and to account for not producing it in court. Besides, the fact that the defendant permitted a person present to throw it out of the window, without any objection, is a significant indication that he did not have the bottle of whiskey for any innocent purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"AeM\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
