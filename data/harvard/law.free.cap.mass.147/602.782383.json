The will contained the following provisions which alone are material:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-5\">\u201c 3. I constitute and appoint William Webster, attorney at law, now of 28 State Street, Boston, as executor and trustee under this will. ... 4. I give, bequeath, and devise all the remainder of my property, real, personal, or mixed, of which I shall die seised and possessed, or to which I shall be entitled, to my said trustee, to hold the same in trust for my said husband during his natural life. 5. I give and bequeath out of the remainder of my property remaining at my husband\u2019s death [Here followed two small bequests]. 7. I give, bequeath, and devise all the remainder of my property, after payment of the above bequests, . . . one sixteenth to Mrs. Elsworth, wife of Josiah Elsworth. ... If at the time of my said husband\u2019s decease, or at my decease, if he shall not survive me, any of the legatees named in this seventh clause shall have deceased, leaving issue surviving at that time, such issue shall have the parent\u2019s share by representation. The shares of such as shall at that time have deceased, leaving no issue, shall be distributed among the other legatees above named, and the issue then living of any deceased legatee by right of representation according to their several proportions above set forth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-7\">At the hearing, before <em>W. </em>Allen, J., it appeared that the testatrix died on June 4,1886; that Jane M. Ellsworth, the wife of Josiah A. Ellsworth, who was the person called \u201c Mrs. Elsworth, wife of Josiah Elsworth,\u201d in the seventh clause of the will, died on June 9,1886, leaving no issue surviving; that Philip C. Rowe, husband of the testatrix, died on July 13,1886; that Josiah A. Ellsworth and Jane M. Ellsworth, who were married in 1863, had but one child, which died before the testatrix; and that Josiah A. Ellsworth was appointed administrator of his wife\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-8\">The appellant contended, among other things, that he was entitled to curtesy in one sixteenth of the real estate of the testatrix, as well as to a portion of the balance of the account, either in his own right or as such administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-9\">The judge disallowed the appellant\u2019s claim, and ordered' the decree of the Probate Court to be affirmed, and the case to be remanded ; and the appellant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-10\"><em>0. </em>Lamson, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-11\"><em>W.

Rowe, who did not die until after Mrs. Ellsworth. For this reason, without going further, Mrs. Ellsworth\u2019s husband took no estate by the curtesy. <em>Shores </em>v. Carley, 8 Allen, 425, 426. Even if he had a right which would have passed to assignees in insolvency, (<em>Gardner </em>v. Hooper, 3 Gray, 398, 405,) it could not be greater than the right of his wife to which it was incident, and therefore was subject to the contingency of her remainder vesting in possession, which it never did. Assuming, in favor of the appellant, without deciding, that the remainder to Mrs. Ellsworth was a vested remainder in fee, still it was subject to be divested, and was divested by her death before Philip C. Rowe, the life tenant, leaving no issue living at that time. Therefore Mrs. Ellsworth\u2019s husband took nothing as her representative. <em>Blanchard </em>v. Blanchard, 1 Allen, 223, 230. <em>Dodd </em>v. Winship, 144 Mass. 461. Gray, Perpetuities, \u00a7 108. The principle of <em>Kelley </em>v. Meins, 135 Mass. 231, and of <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>144 Mass. 542, 545, has no application to a divesting clause of the kind before us, which is as familiar as any provision used by conveyancers.</p>\n<p id=\"AGB\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
