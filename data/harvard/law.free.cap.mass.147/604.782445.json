There was evidence that the plaintiff was in the employment of the Troy and Boston Railroad Company as a brakeman, and not in that of the defendant; that part of his duty for over a year before the accident had been to couple cars in the making up of trains in such yard at North Adams; and that while so engaged, on March 10, 1886, he caught his foot in a frog, which was not blocked, and was injured. The plaintiff testified, on cross-examination, that, so far as he knew, no frogs in the yard were blocked before the accident; that, if they had been blocked, they would have been in plain sight; that he knew that unblocked frogs were dangerous; and that he had known of accidents caused by such frogs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-6\">Upon these facts, the judge ruled that the action could not be maintained, and directed a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-7\"><em>A. W. Preston </em>\u00bff* <em>M. P. </em>Couch, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-8\"><em>G. A. Tor rey, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b625-9\">W. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEM\">The plaintiff knew the condition of the tracks and the danger attending their use, and voluntarily assumed the known risks of his employment upon them. <em>Pingree </em>v. <em>Leyland, </em>135 Mass. 398. <em>Moulton </em>v. Gage, 138 Mass. 390. <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany </em>Railroad, 139 Mass. 580. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Carew Manuf. Co. </em>140 Mass. 150. <em>Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway </em>v. McCormick, 74 Ind. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">It does not make in the plaintiff\u2019s favor that he was not in the employment of the defendant, but in that of the Troy and Boston Railroad Company, a corporation that was authorized to use the tracks. Whatever the obligations of the defendant may have been under the contract with that company, he was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>no greater obligation to its servants to furnish a suitable road for them to work upon, than he was under to his own servants. The plaintiff, in going to work upon the tracks at the invitation of the defendant contained in the contract with the Troy and Boston Railroad Company, assumed, as against the defendant, the obvious and known risks of the employment arising from the defective construction or condition of the road, as fully as if he had gone upon the tracks under a contract' with the defendant as his servant. A majority of the court are of opinion, for these reasons, that the entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
