M., by striking the plaintiff, and then offered to show that in his absence his wife had been indecently insulted by the plaintiff at four o\u2019clock P. <em>m. </em>on the same day, and that he had been informed of that, fact only ten minutes before the assault, which occurred when he met the plaintiff for the first time thereafter. The defendant contended that' this evidence was competent in mitigation of damages, to show his motive in committing the assault and as part of the <em>res gestee, </em>but the judge excluded the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-11\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b600-12\"><em>I).

Provocation cannot be shown, unless it is so recent and immediate as to form part of the transaction. In other words, to be admissible, it must be provocation happening at the time of the assault. <em>Mowry </em>v. Smith, 9 Allen, 67. <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>100 Mass. 258. <em>Bonino </em>v. <em>Caledonio, </em>144 Mass, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">In the case at bar the court therefore rightly rejected the evidence offered by the defendant to show provocation by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>previous act of the plaintiff in insulting the defendant\u2019s wife. It was not a provocation occurring at the time of the assault, and formed no part of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
