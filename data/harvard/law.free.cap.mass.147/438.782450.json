The declaration in the first case was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-11\">\u201c And the plaintiff says the defendant publicly, falsely, and maliciously accused the plaintiff of the crime of murder, by words spoken of the plaintiff substantially as follows, to wit: \u2018 He (meaning the plaintiff) killed her (meaning the plaintiff\u2019s wife, Mary J. Thomas) by his bad conduct (meaning the bad conduct of the plaintiff), and I (meaning the defendant) think he knows more about her being drowned than anybody else. He (meaning the plaintiff) is to blame for it.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-12\">The declaration in the second case was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-13\">\u201c And the plaintiff says the defendant publicly, falsely, and \u2019maliciously accused the plaintiff of the crime of murder, by words spoken of the plaintiff substantially as follows, to wit: \u2018 He (meaning the plaintiff) knows how she (meaning the plaintiff\u2019s wife) came to her death (meaning the death of the plaintiff\u2019s wife). He (meaning the plaintiff) killed her (meaning the plaintiff\u2019s wife). He (meaning the plaintiff) is to blame for her death (meaning the death of the plaintiff\u2019s wife). There was foul play there.\u2019 To the great damage of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-15\">The defendants demurred to the declaration in each case, on the ground \u201c that the declaration does not state a legal cause of action substantially in accordance with the rules of law, in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the alleged slanderous words do not, by their natural import, or in connection with any facts or explanations stated in the declaration, in any manner charge or impute the crime of murder, and are not in themselves actionable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">The Superior Court sustained the demurrers, and ordered judgments for the defendants ; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-6\"><em>E. W. </em>Ely, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-7\">6r. <em>B. </em>Robinson, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b459-8\">C. Alleh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYI\">The declarations in these eases set forth no extrinsic circumstances which might give significance to the wofds alleged to have been spoken by the respective defendants, and we have only to consider whether the words themselves, taken in their natural sense, and without a forced or strained construction, may fairly import a charge of criminal homicide. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>144 Mass. 38. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Shaw Stocking Co. </em>146 Mass. 219, 221. <em>Twombly </em>v. Munroe, 136 Mass. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">In the first case, the words are, \u201c He killed her by his bad conduct, and I think he knows more about her being drowned than anybody else. He is to blame for it.\u201d The explanation that the killing was by his bad conduct shows that no charge of killing in a criminal sense was intended, or fairly to be understood. In this case the demurrer was properly sustained, and the judgment for the defendant is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">In the second case the words are, \u201c He knows how she came to her death. He killed her. He is to blame for her death. There was foul play there.\u201d The charge of having killed her is general. The statement that there was foul play there, may naturally be found to signify something more than mere bad conduct. The words, \u201c He is to blame for her death,\u201d taken with the context, do not necessarily weaken the force of the more direct charges. Taken as a whole, the court cannot say that these words may not fairly be considered to impute a crime to the plaintiff. It has long and often been held that a general charge of killing, unexplained, is sufficient. <em>Cooper </em>v. Smith, Cro. Jac. 423. 1 Roll. Abr. 77. 1 Com. Dig., Action upon the Case for Defamation, D. 2. <em>Eckart </em>v. Wilson, 10 S. &amp; R. 44. <em>Taylor </em>v. Casey, Minor, (Ala.) 258. <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Hays, </em>1 Humph. 402. In this case, the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
