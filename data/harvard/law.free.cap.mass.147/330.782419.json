The creditor did not give the consignor any new credit, or change his position towards him during the time covered by the correspondence; and the consignee applied the net proceeds of the cargo to the payment of the consignor\u2019s draft, leaving a balance due him from the consignor. <em>Held, </em>that the consignee made no express promise to pay such proceeds to the creditor, and that there was no equitable assignment thereof by the consignor imposing upon him the duty of holding them for the creditor\u2019s benefit.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-9\">Contract, by the plaintiffs, doing business in New York under the style of A.

Weatherly, L. R, 3 Q. B. 753, by Blackburn, J., at p. 758, as follows: \u201cEver since the case of <em>Walker </em>v. Rostron, it has been considered as settled law that where a person transfers to a creditor, on account of a debt, whether due or not, a fund actually existing or accruing in the hands of a third person, and notifies the transfer to the holder of the fund, although there is no legal obligation on the holder to pay the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>debt to the transferee, yet the holder of the fund may, and if he does promise to pay to the transferee, then that which was merely an equitable right becomes a legal right in the transferee, founded on the promise.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\">The order to pay, or assignment of the debt, cannot be revoked after it has been accepted by the holder of the fund. <em>Hodgson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>3 B. &amp; C. 842. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Fauntleroy, </em>8 J. B. Moore, 10. There is a good consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise to pay the plaintiffs. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Rostron, </em>9 M. &amp; W. 411. <em>Fruhling </em>v. <em>Schroder, </em>2 Scott, 135. <em>Crowfoot </em>v. <em>Gurney, </em>9 Bing. 372. The defendant\u2019s promise makes an agreement to pay a debt of his own, and not of another, and is not within the statute of frauds. <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Sandf. 331. The fact that the amount covered by the assignment is not ascertained, does not affect the question. <em>Fruhling </em>v. <em>Schroder, ubi supra. Crowfoot </em>v. <em>Gurney, ubi supra. </em>The agreement cannot be altered without the consent of all parties. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Rostron, ubi supra. </em>From the above cases, it appears that a direct privity is established by the acceptance of the order and promise to pay, and the defendant thereupon becomes primarily liable to the plaintiff. See also 2 Chit. Con. (11th Am. ed.) 913, 1375 and note <em>i, </em>1379, 1380, and notes. The English doctrine has been universally followed in America in numerous cases. See <em>Christmas </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>14 Wall. 69, 84; <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Sandf. 331; <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Brownell, </em>12 Cush. 376, 380.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-6\"><em>R. jD.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amd\">Daubon and Company, on June 19, 1885, shipped from Porto Rico, by the brig Hyaline, a cargo of molasses consigned to the defendant, at Boston, for sale on commission on their account. On June 23, 1885, they wrote to the defendant a letter, enclosing a bill of lading of the shipment, and adding, \u201c On the safe arrival with you of the above-mentioned vessel, we would thank you to be very active in placing the cargo, if it is suited to the market, and the net proceeds resulting you will please hand to Messrs. A. S. Lazarus and Company of New York, to whom we have written by the same mail, informing them that you would remit them for our account the sum resulting from the sale of the molasses.\u201d On the same day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>they wrote a letter to the plaintiffs, enclosing a duplicate bill of lading, in which they state that the defendant \u201c has instructions to place in your hands the net proceeds of said cargo as soon as possible.\u201d This letter was received by the plaintiffs on July 6, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Daubon and Company, on July 5, 1885, wrote a letter to the defendant, stating that they had drawn on him two drafts on account of the molasses shipped to him, one of which, for $5,000, was expressed to be drawn against the cargo of the Hyaline, which letter contained the instruction: \u201c You will please suspend our order to remit to A. S. Lazarus and Company, of New York, the net proceeds of the cargo per Hyaline, and in due time we will telegraph you what to do to reimburse the above-named gentlemen.\u201d On the same day, July 5, they wrote to the plaintiffs that they had \u201c given orders to Mr. Swan, of Boston, not to send you any funds until he shall receive our advice by cable.\u201d It does not appear when these last letters were received, but by the ordinary course of the mails it would take a letter from ten to fourteen days to reach Boston from Porto Rico, and one day less to reach New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">On July 7, 1885, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendant, informing him that they had received the letter of June 23, 1885, from Daubon and Company, and adding: \u201c Doubtless by now you have received the invoice and bill of lading. We should like to hear for what amount and at what date you would accept a draft of ours against said shipment, Messrs. Daubon and Company having sent you the bill of lading, clear, and without having drawn against the same.\u201d To this the defendant replied on the next day, \u201c We have received from Messrs. Daubon and Company the shipping documents of cargo molasses per Hyaline, with instructions concerning disposal, and to remit net proceeds of sale to you, which we shall do in due course, possibly remitting you an account as' collections are made, should the entire cargo not be closed out promptly.\u201d On July 9, 1885, the plaintiffs again wrote the defendant, asking, \u201c If you are willing to accept a draft of ours at thirty or sixty days for an amount, say of $3,000 or $4,000, on account of proceeds.\u201d To this, on July 10, 1885, the defendant replied, \u201c Yours of yesterday received, and, in -reply, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>would say that we should not accept your drafts as suggested by you, but will give you proceeds of sale as soon as in hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">On July 15, 1885, the defendant, having received Daubon and Company\u2019s letter of July 5, 1885, wrote to the plaintiffs as follows: \u201cWe have later advices from Messrs. Daubon and Company, informing us of having made drafts upon us for proceeds Hyaline cargo molasses, and cancelling instructions to pay same to you.\u201d Some subsequent correspondence ensued between the parties, the plaintiffs claiming that the defendant was liable to them, and the defendant denying his liability, which it is not necessary to refer to more particularly. It is admitted that the plaintiffs did not give Daubon and Company any new credit, or change their position towards Daubon and Company, between June 19 and July 18,1885 ; and that the net proceeds of the cargo of the Hyaline and of other cargoes were applied by the defendant to the payment of Daubon and Company\u2019s drafts upon him, leaving a balance due from Daubon and Company to him of $789.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Upon this stat\u00e9 of facts, it is clear that there is no express promise by the defendant to pay the proceeds of the cargo of the Hyaline to the plaintiffs, upon which they can rely. The letters of the defendant do not contain words of promise or agreement, but merely notify the plaintiffs of the instructions\" he has received from Daubon and Company, and his intention to carry out his instructions. Besides, there is no consideration for such promise shown. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Union Stone Co. </em>130 Mass. 581. <em>Clement </em>v. Earle, 130 Mass. 585, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">But the plaintiffs rely upon the ground that the transaction amounted to an equitable assignment to them by Daubon and Company of the proceeds of the cargo of the Hyaline, and that, when the defendant received such proceeds, he, having been notified of the assignment, was bound to account to them. The doctrine of equitable assignments is well'settled. If a person transfers to a creditor, on account of a debt, a fund in the hands of a third person, and the holder of the fund is notified of the transfer, he is bound, if he has no prior claim upon the fund, to hold it in trust and for the benefit of the creditor, who may enforce his claim in equity, or at law if the holder promises to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>pay them. <em>Griffin </em>v. Weatherly, L. R. 3 Q. B. 753. <em>Tripp </em>v. Brownell, 12 Cush. 376. Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1041 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">But there must be an assignment by the owner of the fund, that is to say, a transfer or appropriation of the fund to the creditor\u2019s use. For instance, if in this case the consignors of the molasses had drawn and sent to the plaintiffs an order upon the defendant to pay the fund to the plaintiffs, and he had been notified of it, he would have been liable in some form of action to the'plaintiffs, as such an order is in its nature'a transfer of the fund, and as he has no prior claims which could prevent the consignors from assigning it. But the difficulty with the plaintiffs\u2019 case is, that the evidence does not show any assignment or transfer of the fund to them. The only evidence upon which they rely as showing an assignment is the statement in the letter of June 23, 1885, from Daubon and Company, that the defendant \u201c has instructions to place in your hands the net proceeds of said cargo as soon as possible.\u201d This is not an order on the defendant, nor an assignment of the fund. It cannot be held to have this effect without greatly enlarging the natural meaning of the language. It does not purport to convey the fund to them in payment of or as security for their debt. We cannot infer from the language' used, or from the circumstances that it was the intention of Daubon and Company to set apart and appropriate the fund to the use of the plaintiffs. The language does not import this, and we cannot, by any fair construction, give it this meaning. We are therefore of opinion, that the plaintiffs fail to show an equitable assignment to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In this view of the case, it is not necessary to consider the other questions argued by the counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
