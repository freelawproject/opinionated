The license revocation was based upon the Commission\u2019s finding that petitioner failed to require customers to produce identification cards in violation of ORS 471.130 when there was a reasonable doubt whether they were 21 years of age and that petitioner made liquor available to persons visibly intoxicated in violation of ORS 471.410(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission also found that petitioner violated several regulations promulgated under chapter 845 of the Oregon Administrative Rules which prohibit a licensee from permitting the use of profane or abusive language upon licensed premises or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>permitting minors to consume alcohol on licensed premises.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Petitioner contends that the OLCC\u2019s findings are not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence. We think that no useful purpose would be served by recounting the substantial evidence in support of the Commission\u2019s findings. Suffice it to say that the testimony of the OLCC inspectors who investigated the petitioner\u2019s premises and observed his improper conduct and the testimony of the minors who were served alcoholic beverages by petitioner substantially support the Commission\u2019s findings. ORS 183.480(7)(d). Indeed, the record is replete with evidence pointing to petitioner\u2019s violation of the aforementioned statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-5\"> ORS 471.130 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\"(1) All licensees and permittees of the commission, before selling or serving alcoholic liquor to any person about whom there is any reasonable doubt of his having reached 21 years of age, shall require such person to produce his identification card issued under ORS 471.140.
