The answer set up a general denial and counter-claiip. The reply denied the counterclaim. On plaintiff\u2019s motion, in which it appears that the trial would involve the examination of a long account, the plaintiff\u2019s bill of items, containing upwards of sixty items, and the defendant\u2019s eight items, the court at special term granted an order referring the issues to Hon. James M. Smith, to hear, try and determine, which order was entered October 25, 1879. On the same day defendant appealed to the general term from said order. On November 13, 1879, the defendant moved, at special term, for leave to serve an amended answer, and on such motion entered an order allowing defendant to serve an amended answer upon the condition, among others, \u201c that the order of reference entered in said action at a special term of this court, on October 25,1879, referring the same to James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>M.
