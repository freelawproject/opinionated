' On September 30, 1878, the plaintiff was discharged without cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-12\">About October 15, 1878, plaintiff brought action No. 1 for $50 in this court, and thereafter, by leave of \u2022court, served a supplemental complaint claiming \u00a7100 more, or \u00a7150 in all. The complaints are in form for wages, but it appears upon the face of each, that no services were performed after plaintiff\u2019s discharge. No answer was interposed, and on December 10, 1878, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>plaintiff assessed her damages before the clerk, and entered judgment, which was paid in full, and a satisfaction piece was given and filed the following day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">1 This action was commenced on January 11, 1879, and the complaint was identical with the complaint in action No. 1, except that it sought, in form, to recover wages for four subsequent bi-weekly periods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">Defendants pleaded the former recovery, judgment and satisfaction in their answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">Plaintiff served an amended complaint, which is in form for damages for breach of the contract, and defendants in answer again pleaded the former recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">The judge, at special term, found asa conclusion of ' law, \u201c that the recovery in the first action exhausted the plaintiff\u2019s remedy for damages for the breach of the contract, and is a good defense to this action.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-9\"><em>John </em>McCrone, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-10\"><em>Chittenden &amp; </em>Hubbard, attorneys, and <em>James M.

There is but one contract involved, and but one breach, viz., that of September 30, 1878. The recovery in the first action was a recovery of damages for the breach of this contract. It appears upon the face of the complaint and supplemental complaint in the first action, that no services were performed during the periods for which recovery was sought, and, as the doctrine of \u201c constructive service \u201d is done away with in this State, it could not have been a recovery of salary ; but in the words of his honor Chief Judge Daly, in Moody <em>v. </em>Levevich (4 <em>Daly, </em>411), \u201c A judgment in favor of the plaintiff could by the law have' given upon no other ground. It was a recovery of damages for the breach of the contract and was a bar to any further action upon the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>II. The first recovery was of damages for the breach of the contract on September 30. This second action is brought to recover damages for the same breach of the same contract. The former recovery is a bar (Colburn <em>v. </em>Woodworth, 31 <em>Barb. </em>381; Moody v. Leverich, 4 Daly, 401; approved in Howard v.
