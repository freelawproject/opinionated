If default should be made in the payment of any of such notes,- or if the trustee should not be in sufficient funds to pay the same, as and when they became due, then he was to pay T. J. F.

But if such notes should be paid at maturity out of the proceeds or profits of the business, or in any way otherwise than by a sale of the trust property as above directed, then the trust was to continue on the same terms and conditions as before stated for the benefit of the parties thereinafter mentioned, viz.: (1) To reimburse the R <em>&amp; </em>E.

That \u2018 Douglass Manufacturing Company \u2019 was the name by which a certain manufacturing business was carried on in the city of New York and elsewhere, at the time the said note was made; that these plaintiffs do not know the names of all the persons who participated in carrying on the said business, but that, as they are informed and believe, the defendant, Thompson J. S. Flint, and the defendant, the Russell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company, which then was and now is a duly organized corporate company, so participated, and that they were some or all the parties doing business under such name ; that by the arrangement under which such business was carried on by the defendants, the said Richard P. Bruff was authorized to make the said note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-11\">\u201c4.

Bruff, as such trustee, to, and he did transfer such assets to them. That the defendants gave no consideration for such transfer, and .that the value of the assets so transferred to them largely exceeded all the indebtedness of such business, whereby, as these plaintiffs are informed and believe, the defendants became liable to pay such indebtedness, including the amount so due the plaintiffs,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">\u201cThe plaintiffs, therefore, ask judgment against the defendants for the sum of $7,000, with interest thereon from July 26, 1874, and the costs of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">The defendants,.answering separately, denied that Bruff had any authority from them to make the note in question, ot that they were, as parties to the note, or as partners or joint stock owners, or in any way, bound to pay it. They disputed the construction put. by the plaintiffs in their complaint, on the deed of trust to Bruff, and disputed that the assets of the Douglass Manufacturing Company were to be held by him for the payment of general debts, and alleged that he was to hold them for the payment of certain specified debts, among them, the defendants\u2019. They alleged that Bruff\u2019s transfer to them was voluntary, after friendly negotiations, in accordance with the terms of the deed of trust to Bruff ; because of the happening of certain contingencies and defaults provided for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the deed; and that it was upon a consideration exceeding the value of the assets so transferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">The case was tried in June, 1880. On the trial the following facts were developed. The \u201cDouglass Manufacturing Company \u201d was not a corporation, a joint stock company, or a copartnership. It was a name adopted by Thomas Douglass under which to do business. For most practical purposes, so far as this case is concerned, Thomas Douglass and the Douglass Manufacturing Company were one and the same. Under this name\u2014\u201cThe Douglass Manufacturing Company \u201d \u2014was conducted the business of two manufactories, one at Seymour, in Connecticut, called the \u201cF. L. Ames Auger Works,\u201d and one at Arlington, Vermont, called the \u201cF. L. Ames Chisel Works,\u201d which manufactured and sold hardware of the nature of chisels, augers, &amp;c. At the time of these transactions, and for some years previous, the Russell and Erwin Manufacturing Company sold in New York, upon commission, as factors, the goods manufactured by these mills. The title to the property at Seymour, Connecticut, and Arlington, Vermont, seems to Save been in Fred. L. Ames, Oakes Ames and Oliver Ames. Thomas Douglass owned an equitable interest in the property, as did N. R. Douglass and Charles Douglass, the extent of which nowhere appears. The title to the personal property was in F. L. Ames. Just how the Ameses came to hold the title does not appear, nor is it important, but the surrounding circumstances seem to indicate that they held it as security for advances or debts. Thomas Douglass had charge of the business, apparently as the owner. He became embarrassed financially. The mills were running behind. He sought to borrow money. He was made acquainted with the defendant, Flint, through Mr. Stillman, a lawyer. They entered into negotiations, the result of which was a loan of \u00a7136,063.97 by Flint, and a loan of \u00a761,290.18, and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>agreement to advance and supply steel for manufacture, by Bruff, representing the Russell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company. A portion of the moneys loaned by the defendants was paid to the Ameses, to satisfy some claim they had upon the property. It would seem also that they still had a mortgage or mortgages after such payment. Thereupon, about January 18,1873, the Ameses executed to Bruff deeds conveying the property at Seymour, Connecticut, and Arlington, Vermont, and a bill of sale to Thomas Douglass, covering all the personal property, the product of such mills. This personal property Douglass at once turned over to Bruff. N. B. Douglass and Charles Douglass quit-claimed whatever interest they had. Bruff at the same time executed a declaration of trust, reciting the conveyances to him, and that the money with which to pay the Ameses was supplied by Flint and the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company, upon his agreement and undertaking to hold and manage the property and the business of the said Douglass Manufacturing Company, therewith connected, for the interests, security, benefits and payments as thereinafter declared. The recital of the objects of the trust is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">\u201c Now, therefore, know ye that I, the said Richard P; Bruff, do make known, admit, and declare that said premises and property and the business therewith connected, were so conveyed and transferred, sold, and delivered to me, and are held and to be held, managed and disposed of by me for the uses and benefits of the parties hereinafter named, and upon the trusts hereinafter specified, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-6\">\u201c First.

He received the conveyances, and executed the declaration of trust above referred to, and made the\"advances recited without the authority, consent, or knowledge of the company. The officers of the company did not learn of it until about April, 1874. On account of this and other matters, Bruff was discharged from their employment. The business of the Douglass Manufacturing Company under the trust was not prosperous. The $18,483.81 recited in the fourth subdivision of the declaration of trust, was paid, but chiefly, it would seem, with borrowed money, a part of which was the money obtained upon the $7,000 note upon which this suit is brought. The sums provided for in the third and fifth subdivisions of the declaration of trust as to Flint, were not paid in accordance with the terms of the declaration, nor did Bruff have on hand the moneys with which to pay when they became due, January, 1874, nor were the Bussell <em>&amp; </em>Erwin Company paid their advances, made from time to time for the purchase of steel and other supplies. On May 20, 1874, after much negotiation, Thomas Douglass executed to the Bussell <em>&amp; </em>Erwin Manufacturing Company a deed, reciting the conveyances to Bruff, and his declaration of trust, discharging Bruff from obligation to him, and directing him to convey the property to the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company. And the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company on their part agreed and covenanted to apply and appropriate all the interest which came to them by virtue of that conveyance, to the payment of the indebtedness of Douglass and of the Douglass Manufacturing Company then existing, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>which might thereafter arise, <em>to themselves </em>and towards their indemnification for liabilities on account of Douglass, or of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, and after such payment for all such matters, to pay over any surplus to Douglass. On July 23, 1874, the Russell &amp; Erwin' Manufacturing Company, by Erwin, the president, Thompson J. S. Flint, and Thomas Douglass, united in a letter to Bruff, in which, after reciting the conveyances and the declaration of trust, and asserting that they were all the parties having an interest in the property held in trust, they authorized and required him to convey and transfer all the property held by him to Thompson J. S. Flint, and to the Russell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company, \u201c for the consideration of the debts due to the said Flint and to the said Russell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company, to be held by them in proportion to their respective claims.\u201d At that time, the indebtedness to Flint amounted to about $113,000, and' the indebtedness to the Russell <em>&amp; </em>Erwin Manufacturing Company amounted to about $147,000. On July 24, Bruff conveyed the property to Flint and to the Russell and Erwin - Manufacturing Company. On the same day, articles of association of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, as a body corporate, under the laws of Connecticut, with a capital stock of $280,000, were filed. To this company, so formed, Flint and the Russell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company conveyed the property in question, the consideration named being $280,000, and being, in fact, the capital stock of the new company, which was distributed <em>pro rata </em>according to their interest. The Douglass Manufacturing Company, so incorporated, did business but a short time, unsuccessfully, when the mills at Seymour and at Arlington were sold, the former bringing $16,000 and the latter $5,000. A copy of the note on which this suit was brought, appears in the complaint, <em>supra.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>According to the testimony of Thomas Douglass, called by the plaintiff, at least \u00a74,918 of the \u00a77,000 note was applied to the payment of the note of \u00a713,483.81 to Flint, recited in the declaration of trust, which fell due January 16,1874. As the \u00a77,000 note was given in renewal of other notes, the precise application of the proceeds of which does not appear, it is not clear whether, of the moneys borrowed upon the \u00a77,000 note and the notes in renewal of which it was in part given, any greater sum than that stated above went towards the payment of the \u00a713,483.81 note to Flint. Douglass testified generally that the money went \u201cinto the business\u201d of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, but whether to pay the antecedent debts or to carry on the ordinary business of the company under the Bruff trust, does not appear, except as to the \u00a74,916. Douglass testified that when the project of the formation of the new company was first mentioned, it was said that all of the property of the Douglass Manufacturing Company\u2019s business was to be turned over to the new company, and that then Erwin said the business was to be prosecuted without any change or interruption, a complete inventory taken, and an entire account of the indebtedness, which was to be paid without discredit to the Douglass Manufacturing Company. He also testified that Stillman, who was the attorney who procured the loan and made out the trust papers and conveyances, confirmed Erwin in what he said. It nowhere appears in the evidence that Flint himself said anything like this. Erwin positively denies that <em>he </em>did. On the trial there was read the testimony of Mr. Erwin in the suit of Gautier against these defendants, in which he had testified, it seems, that he did say \u201c that he would consider and undertake to adjust anything that was a legal lien upon the property of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, incorporated ; in other words, that which appeared they were legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>bound to pay.\u201d At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the defendants moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that the facts proved did not impose upon them a liability to pay the note in question. The learned judge who presided on the trial, denied the motion, not only overruling the objections stated, but adding that the testimony of Douglass showed an express promise on the part of the defendants to pay, which the plaintiffs could avail themselves of under the decision in Lawrence <em>v. </em>Fox, and that the plaintiffs might amend their complaint, if so advised, alleging this express promise. There was a general exception to this decision. The judge finally submitted the case to the jury solely upon the question whether the defendants, upon a sufficient consideration, agreed to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the Douglass Manufacturing Company as an inducement for the final transfer to them of the assets in Bruff\u2019s hands.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-5\"><em>W.

They did not participate. They had no share in the profits. They were simply <em>cestuis que </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>trust, </em>with no actual participation in the conduct of the business, and with no right, or claim of right, except to have their loans, with interest, paid out of the proceeds of the business. (2) The declaration of trust by Bruff did not agree to pay the debts of the Douglass Manufacturing Company as alleged, but only the expenses of the trust business and the specific debts of the defendants. (3) Bruff wasno.t \u201ccompelled\u201d (as alleged) certainly not by any duress to transfer to the defendants the assets of the Douglass Manufacturing Company in his hands as trustee, but made such transfer in consequence of negotiations, when it became apparent that he could not pay from the funds in his hands the note to the defendant Flint then due, or pay to the Russell and Erwin Manufacturing Company the moneys which, without their authority, he had advanced to the Douglass Manufacturing Company. (4) The complaint alleges that the defendants gave no consideration for the transfer to them. The indebtedness of the trust to them was the expressed, and a sufficient consideration. (5) The assets did not exceed the just claims of the defendants (as alleged), but were less. It must be remembered that there were prior mortgages upon the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">I. The theory of the plaintiffs, as indicated by their complaint, and the argument of counsel on the appeal, was that they could sustain their cause of action on either of two grounds ; the first being that the defendants were so far partners and Bruff so far their agent in. the making of the-note sued upon, that they could be held upon it directly. The judge at the trial refused to permit that theory to go to the jury. They were not partners. In no aspect of the law of partnership could they be regarded as partners. Their only relation to the business of the Douglass Manufacturing Company was as <em>cestuis que trust </em>for loans and advances.(Cox <em>v. </em>Hickman, 8 <em>H. of L. Cases, </em>301).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The second theory, and that on which counsel seem chiefly to rely, was that inasmuch as the defendants had received from Bruff, the trustee, the assets in his hands as trustee, they were bound to pay the debts of the Douglass Manufacturing Company. In support of this theory was quoted the proposition : \u201c It is a universal rule that if a man purchases property of a trustee with notice of the trust, he shall be charged with the same trust in respect to the property as \u2022 the trustee from whom he purchased \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Perry on Trusts, </em>\u00a7 217). \u201cAnd even if he pays a valuable consideration with notice of the equitable rights of a third person, he shall hold the property subject to the equitable interests of such person <em>(Id. </em>828). \u201cIf the trustees convey the estate by a breach of trust, the <em>cestui que trusts </em>may follow the estate into the hands of a volunteer, whether he had notice of the trust or not, and into the hands of a purchaser for value if he have notice of the trust. The purchaser under such circumstances becomes a trustee and liable in the same manner as the person from whom he purchased, for knowing another\u2019s right to the property, he throws away his money.\u201d Many cases were cited in support of these propositions, which must be regarded as fundamental in the law of equity. Undoubtedly any person who purchased from the trustee in this case the property of the trust, with a knowledge of the trust, would have taken it subject to the trusts. But what application can these doctrines have to a case where the trustee with the consent of the creator of the trust and owner whatever equitable interest there was after the trust, .conveys to the <em>cestui que trust </em>themselves <em>% </em>All the parties to the trust instrument are parties to this transaction and bound by it. It cannot, therefore, be regarded as a wrongful disposition of the trust property by the trustee. There is nothing in the doctrines above quoted which would hold the purchaser of a trust es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tate from a trustee, responsible for the general debts of the creator of the trust, unless the holders of such debts were included among the <em>cestuis que trust. </em>The general creditors of the Douglass Manufacturing Company were not included in Brufl\u2019s declaration of trust, so that we may go to the full length of the proposition of law quoted, without their having any claim either in law or in equity against even a general grantee of the trustee. These defendants stand in a much better position, as I have indicated, than an ordinary grantee, by reason of their having been the only <em>cestuis que trust </em>named in the deed of trust. The persons who might pursue the trust property in the hands of grantees are themselves the grantees. The transactions proved, therefore, aside from the alleged express promise, imposed upon the defendants no legal obligation to pay the note in question or any other of the outside indebtedness of Thomas Douglass. They had advanced money and property to Douglass for which they were secured by the trust deed. The conditions on which the trust was to terminate had happened. Bruff had not the money to make the stipulated payments to them. The property must either be sacrificed at an auction or enforced private sale, or conveyed in the way it was. There can be little doubt that it was inadequate to pay the prior liens and the debts due these defendants. The defendants, therefore, had a right, Thomas Douglass consenting, to receive from Brufi! a conveyance of the property in consideration of their loans and advances. It would be a strange theory of law which could make the defendants, by reason of taking such a conveyance in payment of their own prior liens, responsible for all the floating debts of Thomas Douglass, however incurred, or even those incurred by him in connection with this particular business. The only trust with which, according to the strictest of the authorities, the defendants took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>that property, was the obligation to pay the expenses incurred by Bruff as trustee. It was Bruff\u2019s first duty to pay the expenses out of the property coming into his hands. Whether or not he did so, we have no proof in this case. There is, however, proof .that the money received from the plaintiffs was not devoted to the payment of expenses, but, so far as it is traced, was devoted to the payment of a prior indebtedness\u2014 to wit: one of the notes held by Flint. Therefore, in no sense, can it be claimed that the debt due the plaintiffs constituted them <em>cestuis que trust </em>of the trust estate, so that they have a right to claim that the defendants held the property constructively as trustees for their benefit. And if they had such a right, they could not assert it in a common law action like this, but must go into a court of equity in an action for an accounting under the trust. It may be that as general creditors they would have a right to set aside a transfer to the defendants by proving it fraudulent as against creditors, but even proof that the transfer was fraudulent against creditors, would not give them a common law action on the case to recover the amount of their debt from the grantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">It was urged on the argument that the note sued upon, being signed in the form ordinarily used in issuing commercial paper for the purpose of the business of the Douglass \u2022 Manufacturing Company, constituted a claim against the business done by that company under the trust. The commercial character of the paper can be relied on only as against the parties to it. Bruff signed the note'as treasurer of the Douglass Manufacturing Company. He was not in fact the treasurer of any such company, and it cannot be pretended that either of the defendants gave him authority to sign, this paper as such treasurer, or in any other way. He was not their agent in making that paper. Thomas Douglass, who participated in the transaction, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>called \u2018\u2018Thomas Douglass\u201d or the \u201cDouglass Manufacturing Company,\u201d would undoubtedly be bound by Bruff\u2019s signature, not because Bruff, by reason of the trust, had any power to make such paper, but because Thomas Douglass, from his relation to the transaction, would be estopped from denying that Bruff was his agent in making the paper. That estoppel does not extend to the defendants. Bruff\u2019s position as trustee certainly gave him no express authority to make paper or borrow money. If he had such authority, it must be implied from the nature of the business. His duty was confined to the application of moneys which came into his hands from the sale of goods, to the payment, first, of the expenses of the business, and then to the payment to the indebtedness to Flint, and then to the payment of the indebtedness to the Russell <em>&amp; </em>Erwin Manufacturing Company. The making of notes at all by Bruff, and clearly the making of notes on which to borrow money to pay Douglass\u2019s debts, was entirely outside of any authority conferred upon him by the trust. It cannot justly be claimed that by reason of anything which these defendants did, the plaintiffs took the note in question, and thereby these defendants became bound to pay it; and so that class of cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the argument (The Exchange Bank <em>v. </em>Monteith, 17 <em>Barb. </em>171; North River Bank v. Aymar, 3 <em>Hill, </em>262 ; Engh <em>v. </em>Greenebaum, 2 <em>Hun, </em>136 ; Bank of New York <em>v. </em>Bank of Ohio, 29 <em>N. Y. </em>619 ; Case v. Mechanics\u2019 Banking Association, 4 <em>N. Y. </em>166), in all of which a principal sought to escape liability upon his notes in the hands of innocent holders, because an agent, either authorized to make notes for the principal, or supplied with notes made by the principal himself,-had either made more notes than he, the agent, was authorized to make, or had misapplied funds to his own use\u2014do not apply to a case like this under consideration. They all pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ceedecl upon, the theory that where one of two innocent persons must suffer, it should be that one who placed it in the power of some third person to do the wrong which caused the injury. Neither Flint nor the Russell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company put it in the power of Bruff to issue notes of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, as treasurer or as trustee, or in any other way, and therefore the principle which runs through all the cases \"cited above, has no application to them. It might be applicable as against Thomas Douglass. The right of the plaintiffs to recover as against these defendants, depends, then, not on the commercial character of the paper on which they made their loan, but on the application of the moneys received by Douglass and by Bruff. So far as those moneys are traced at all, they went, not to pay the expenses of the business of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, under the trust, but to pay a part of an antecedent debt, to wit: the note to Flint. The debts of the Douglass Manufacturing Company are by no means necessarily the debts of the trust estate. The trust did not authorize Bruff to make debts. And when Bruff issued notes as an agent, the plaintiffs were bound to make inquiry as to the extent of his authority (North River Bank <em>v. </em>Aymar, <em>supra). </em>It will be observed that the note here sued on, is not signed by Richard P.\u2019 Bruff, trustee, but by Richard P. Bruff as treasurer. So far, then, as appears from the face of the paper, it would seem that in making it Bruff was not acting as trustee, but in some other capacity, with some other authority, and under a title either assumed by himself or conferred upon him by Thomas Douglass. This case differs very essentially from that of Gautier against these same defendants, to which we are cited i\u00f1 the 13 <em>Hun, </em>514. Gautier had furnished to the trustee steel which was manufactured into augers, &amp;c., and sold for the benefit of the trust estate. Without expressing concurrence with what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>seems to have been assumed by the learned judge who wrote the opinion in that case\u2014that the debt of the plaintiffs was one which could be included under the head of \u201cexpenses of the business,\u201d and therefore one subject to which the defendants received the conveyance of the trust property\u2014the distinction between that transaction and this\u2014where the plaintiffs made a loan of money which went, according to the evidence, to Thomas Douglass, was deposited in his own bank, and a portion of which (at least) he used, not in the expenses of the trust business but to pay his debt\u2014is quite obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">2. Now comes the question whether this judgment can be sustained on the ground that the defendants expressly promised to pay the debt of the plaintiffs or the debts of the class <em>to </em>which it belonged. The objections to that are:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">First. The plaintiffs in their complaint do not count on any express promise. The old doctrine that the judgment recovered must be <em>secundum allegata et </em>probata, has not been done away with by the Code, but still remains, and a judgment will not be sustained upon an issue which is not pleaded and litigated (Wright <em>v. </em>Delatield, 25 <em>N. Y. </em>266 ; Kniffen <em>v. </em>McConnell, 30 <em>Id. </em>285).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The plaintiffs made no motion to amend their complaint, but the judge at the trial, in denying a motion for a nonsuit made at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, in part because of such proof as there then was of an express promise, said : \u201cThis promise, under the doctrine of Lawrence <em>v. </em>Fox, inured to the benefit of the plaintiffs so as to enable them to maintain an action upon it, and, if necessary, their complaint can be amended so as to embrace the express promise.\u201d Nothing more occurred on this subject. The plaintiff's counsel said nothing indicating an acceptance of the permission of the court. The complaint was not in fact amended.. It stands now precisely as it originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>stood. The quotation above recites everything which-the appeal book contains on that subject, except that the only question submitted to the jury was whether or not there was an express promise. All the testimony with reference to an express promise, the ruling of the judge above quoted, and his submission of the question to the jury, were against the defendant\u2019s objection and exception. If the amendment was one which the judge at the trial had authority to make, it may be made by this court <em>nunc pro tunc </em>(Reeder <em>v. </em>Sayre, <em>70 N. Y. </em>190); but, as it seems to me, it was not such an amendment as he was authorized to make. The power of a judge on a trial to amend is confined to matters which do not substantially change a claim or a defense <em>[Code, \u00a7 </em>723). His power is very different from that of a judge sitting at special term. The latter may permit almost any amendment, upon terms ; but it is error for a judge at a trial to permit an amendment which substantially changes a' claim or a defense. If he thinks the interest of justice demands such a change, he should stop the trial and give the p\u00e1rty an opportunity to apply at special term for leave to amend upon terms. Here was an action on the case\u2014that is, arising out of special circumstances. The amendment would have changed it to an action on express contract\u2014certainly a substantial change, and one which comes within the inhibition of section 723 (Van Sycles <em>v. </em>Perry, 3 <em>Robt. </em>621 ; Ford <em>v. </em>Ford, 53 <em>Barb. </em>525 ; Smith <em>v. </em>Rathburn, 13 <em>Hun, </em>47, 53 ; Union Bank <em>v. </em>Mott, 19 <em>How. Pr. </em>267; Phillips <em>v. </em>Melville, 17 <em>Hun, </em>211: Joslyn <em>v. </em>Joslyn, 9 <em>Id. </em>388; Sinclair <em>v. </em>Neil, 1 <em>Id. </em>80).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As the amendment was one which the judge at the trial had no authority to make, it cannot be made now, and we must consider the case on the complaint as originally drawn. Under that, the evidence as to an express promise was not <em>secundum allegata, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>should not have been received, nor should a recovery have been permitted on such a ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Second. Aside from the question of pleading, can this judgment be sustained on the ground that the defendants promised to pay the debt upon which the judgment was recovered <em>% </em>I think not. The doctrine of Lawrence <em>v. </em>Fox (20 <em>N. Y. </em>268), that where A loans money to B upon B\u2019s promise to pay A\u2019s debt to C, G may maintain an action on the promise against B, will not be questioned. It need not be. But it may be said that that decision was by a divided court\u2014Com-stock and Grover, JJ., dissenting\u2014and that the court of appeals have ever since indicated a disposition not to extend the rule there adopted (Simson <em>v. </em>Brown, 68 <em>N. Y. </em>355 ; Vrooman v. Turner, 69 <em>Id. </em>280, Opin. by Allen, J.). It introduced an anomaly, contrary to all previous notions of privity of contract, and in England the doctrine, which once got a foothold on certain <em>dieta, </em>has since been entirely overthrown. It is, however, the settled law of this State. The question here is about its application to the facts of this case. The first objection to its application is that the defendants made no promise whatever to Bruff, the person who made the transfer (from whom, if any one, the consideration moved). And it is not proved that what they are alleged to have said to Douglass, was ever communicated to Bruff as the consideration or inducement of the transfer by him. To say that Erwin\u2019s and Flint\u2019s promise to Douglass to pay Douglass\u2019s debts, not made to Bruff or communicated to Bruff, was the inducement for Bruff to convey, which will support an action by Douglass\u2019 creditors against Erwin and Flint, is obviously an extension of the doctrine laid down in Lawrence <em>v. </em>Fox which it will not bear (Vrooman <em>v. </em>Turner, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">A most liberal construction of the doctrines of that case could not establish a privity of contract between the plaintiffs and defendants here. The consideration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>even admitting there was any, was too remote. The next objection is that the agreement between Douglass hnd the Russell &amp; Erwin. Manufacturing Company as to what each should do, was in writing. I refer to the deed of indenture, dated and executed May 20, 1874, and exhibited to Bruff on that day. (Exhibit K.) That deed, after reciting the conveyance to Bruff of the property at Seymour and Arlington, Bruff\u2019s declaration of trust, the indebtedness of Douglass in his own name, and in the name of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, to the Russell &amp; Erwin Company, in consideration of the premises conveys to the Russell &amp; Erwin company all Douglass\u2019 right, title and interest to the premises, property and proceeds, and in any trust fund in the hands of Bruff\u2014in short, everything in the hands of Bruff as trustee in any way connected with the Douglass Manufacturing Company, and calls upon Bruff to execute conveyances of the property in his hands and to transfer it to the Russell <em>&amp; </em>Erwin Company. The Russell &amp; Erwin Company on their part agreed that they would apply and appropriate the property to them- so conveyed, toward the accrued indebtedness of Douglass and the Douglass Manufacturing Company to them, and to the payment and indemnification of themselves for any liabilities under which they were, on account of Douglass or the Douglass Manufacturing Company, and for costs, damages, &amp;c., and that, after so paying and idemnifying themselves, they would pay to Douglass any surplus or balance of said property that should remain, &amp;c. This deed is signed by all these parties, was executed and was recorded. Certainly all prior negotiations were merged in it. It is a general rule of evidence and of contracts, as well settled as it is salutary, that a written contract executed between parties, supersedes all their prior negotiations and agreements on the same subject. This is especially true where the final contract is an executed one, and those -which pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ceded it were merely executory, and <em>more </em>especially where what preceded were merely oral discussions and negotiations. This deed says' nothing about the payment by the Russell <em>&amp; </em>Erwin Manufacturing Company of the debts of the Douglass Manufacturing Company. Any subsequent negotiations, unless moving upon some new consideration, were void. After this deed was executed, Douglass had nothing to convey, as the consideration for any new agreement. At any rate, there is no proof that he did convey or give anything. What consideration was there, then, to support any promise by the Russell &amp; Erwin Company to Douglass, made in July, to pay the debts of the Douglass Manufacturing Company <em>% </em>Without consideration, any promise they made to pay the debt of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, was void under the statute of frauds (Belknap <em>v. </em>Bender, 75 <em>N. Y. </em>446; Simson <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">It comes to this: We are asked to hold the defendants liable for a debt of Douglass to the plaintiffs, because of an alleged promise by the defendants to Douglass without consideration, or because Bruff conveyed to the defendants, without any promise being made to him, the property to which, as <em>cestuis que trust </em>and owners of the equity, they were already entitled. On May 20, 1874, the defendants became the legal owners of whatever equity Douglass had in the property. They were already the <em>cestuis que trust. </em>Briefly stated, then, whatever negotiations occurred between the Russell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company and Douglass, were merged in the deed of May 20, 1874. At any rate, parol proof must not be permitted to vary the obligations taken upon themselves by the parties to that instrument. Whatever negotiations occurred after that deed was executed, between Erwin and Douglass, were without1 consideration; and the performance of an .obvious duty by Bruff without any knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>alleged promise from the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company to Douglass, cannot be regarded as a consideration and inducement to support a promise from the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company to Douglass, to pay Douglass\u2019 debts (See Belknap v. Bender, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Third. What was said in this case, viewed in the aspect most favorable to the plaintiffs, did not amount to a promise that <em>the </em>defendants, <em>out of their own </em>moneys, would pay the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The testimony of the promise relied on is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cQ. In any of these talks was anything .said, and if so, what, as to what should be done with this indebt- \u2022 edness if all the property were transferred <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cA. Erwin said the business was to be prosecuted without change or interruption, a complete inventory taken, an entire account of the indebtedness which was to be paid without discredit to the Douglass Manufacturing Company. Mr. Stillman had a list of the liabilities, and confirmed what Erwin said to me\u2014that all this indebtedness should be paid. This was before the property was completely turned over to the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company and Mr. Flint. The indebtedness, outside of the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company and Mr. Flint, amounted, I think, to \u00a7114,000. There was due the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company \u00a7109,000, to Flint $91,000, to Ames \u00a761,290.08. The entire amount was $391,000, viz. : due Flint $91,835.12, Mr. Ames \u00a761.290.08. The Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company $124,053.50. All others \u00a7114,000. The consideration of the deed from Flint and the Bussell <em>&amp; </em>Erwin Manufacturing Company to the Douglass Manufacturing Company, was the stock of the company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">According to other testimony of Douglass, it occurred. \u201cwithin forty-eight hours \u2019\u2019 of the time when the Douglass Manufacturing Company, incorporated, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>formed. That company was formed July 24, 1874. The conversation occurred at Seymour at the time when Mr. Stillman went there to make some examination as to how he could secure Mr. Flint, and. Mr. Erwin was there for the purpose of securing the payment of the money due the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company. It must constantly be borne in mind that the Bussell &amp; Erwin Manufacturing Company at that time had a conveyance of all Douglass\u2019 interest, executed the 20th of May previous. Stillman suggested the formation of a new company, and the testimony, fairly construed, indicates that they were discussing what should be done in the event of the formation of such a company. Is it, then, a fair construction of the testimony of Douglass, above quoted, to say that Mr. Erwin meant to engage that <em>the Russell &amp; JCrwin Manufacturing Company </em>would, <em>out of their own </em>moneys, pay the entire floating indebtedness of the Douglass Manufacturing Company, viz., $114,000 ? Or that Mr. Stillman, who was there for no such purpose, by confirming what Mr. Erwin said,\u201d meant to engage that Thompson J. S. Flint would, out of his own money, pay the debts of the Douglass Manufacturing Company? I think not. The testimony in the case all clearly shows that Thompson J. S. Flint was not present at any of these interviews, and that he personally made no promise whatever of this character. The claim against him in this action, rests upon what was said by Stillman, above quoted. There is no testimony in the case from which the inference can be fairly drawn that Mr. Stillman was so far his attorney in fact, as that his suggestion confirming Erwin,\u201d could bind Mr. Flint <em>to pay out of his own pocket </em>the antecedent debt of another to the extent of $114,000. Without reciting the other testimony in relation to this subject, it seems to me a perversion of language to' claim that these defendants engaged to pay with their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>own money the debts of the Douglass Manufacturing Company. At the very best, it was not an absolute and positive promise to pay to the plaintiffs, but a promise to Thomas Douglass to protect the Douglass Manufacturing Company. That was not enough to bring the promise within the rule laid down in Lawrence <em>v. </em>Fox (Garnsey <em>v. </em>Rogers, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>233 ; Simson <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>supra; </em>Johnson v. Morgan, 68 <em>N. Y. </em>494).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Fourth. The defendants, Woodruff, Erwin, the Flints, all deny that they made the promise testified to by Douglass ; so that the weight of evidence is, in my judgment, against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Certainly so when the fair interpretation of Douglass\u2019 testimony standing alone does not clearly show that they meant to contract to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Speir, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
