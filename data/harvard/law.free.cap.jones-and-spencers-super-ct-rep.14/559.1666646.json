There was more than a mere dissolution and division of assets. There was an actual continuance of the old business and firm name by the plaintiffs at all the established places of business, a transfer to them of the retiring, partner\u2019s interest in whatever was characteristic of the old business, <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>and on the part of the retiring partner for several years a clear recognition of, and acquiescence in, the mode in which the plaintiffs did continue the said business and firm name. In four receipts signed by the retiring partner, the plaintiffs are expressly styled \u2018 successors to the old firm.\u2019 These features distinguish the case at bar from Morgan <em>v. </em>Schuyler (21 <em>Alb.
