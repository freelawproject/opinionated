An entry appears in the clerk\u2019s minutes noting the fact of the denial of the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">The court at General Term said : \u201c Defendants\u2019 exception to the denial of the motion for a new trial upon the minutes presents no question of fact for review. The only mode for reviewing that decision upon the facts is by an appeal from the order denying the motion (Gregg <em>v. </em>Howe, 37 N. <em>Y. Super. Ct. </em>420 ; Matthews <em>v. </em>Meyberg, 63 N. <em>Y. </em>656). For the purpose of such an appeal it was said in Gregg <em>n. </em>Howe, that an order must be entered. If the entry upon the. clerk\u2019s minutes be treated as an order, as was done in. Alfaro <em>v. </em>Davidson (39 N. <em>Y Super. Ct. </em>463), it should! not be disturbed upon a question of fact, because no. such ground was assigned for the motion, and no mo-, tion for the direction of a verdict had been previously, mad\u00e9, and also because, at the close of the trial, the. case, considered as a whole, was one which had; to.be. submitted to the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-7\"><em>James M. </em>Fisk, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-8\">\u2022 <em>Wingate &amp; </em>Oullen, attorneys, and <em>Henry O.
