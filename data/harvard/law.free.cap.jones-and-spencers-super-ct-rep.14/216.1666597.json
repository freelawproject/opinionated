E. </em>Deyo, for appellant, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahb\">In the case of Blake v. Doolan, decided in the supreme court by Judge Daniels, in December last, the following opinion was delivered: \u201cThe circumstances that the guardian for an infant plaintiff is required to be a competent and responsible person, who shall be responsible for costs <em>(Code, \u00a7 </em>469), is not sufficient to deprive the defendant of the right to security. The same qualifications were required for the person selected as the next friend of an infant plaintiff before the enactment of the Code, and the person appointed was in like manner rendered liable for costs (2 <em>R. S. </em>Edm. ed. 465, \u00a7 2). The only change made by the Code in the section is in the name given to the' person appointed, and that was not sufficient to supersede the provision entitling the defendant to require security to be refiled. As both requirements existed together under the Revised Statutes, they must be both equally consistent with each other under the Code. The statute entitles the defend-, ant to the security (5 <em>R. S. </em>5 ed. 910, \u00a7 1). And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>neither the section of the Code referred to, nor either of those following, <em>i. e., </em>providing for a bond to the infant, is, in the least degree, in conflict with the continued existence and authority of that provision. The order must require a bond as security for the defendants\u2019 costs. There are decisions to the contrary, viz.: Leinner <em>v. </em>Crouse, 61 <em>Barb. </em>289; Grantman <em>v. </em>Thrall, 29 <em>How. Pr. </em>344. But it is respectfully submitted that the opinion of Judge Daniels, and the dissenting opinion in Grrantman <em>r. </em>Thrall, are the only ones which reconcile the Code with the Revised Statutes, and that such reconciliation must be made, if possible.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-5\"><em>Frank </em>Etheridge, for respondent, urged :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5g\">I. No security can be required. The provisions of the Revised Statutes as to security being filed by the \u201c next friend\u201d of an infant plaintiff, do not apply to a guardian <em>ad litem </em>appointed under the Code (Linner <em>v. </em>Crouse, 61 <em>Barb. </em>289; Grantman <em>v. </em>Theall, 19 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>308).</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-6\">II. The Code of Civil Procedure makes the guardian <em>ad litem </em>liable for costs (\u00a7 469).</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-7\">III. The order was discretionary, and is not appealable (Bolles <em>v. </em>Duff, 17 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>448; Fearn <em>v. </em>Grelpcke, 13 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>473).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b239-8\">By the Court.\u2014Curtis, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvM\">The defendant appeals from an order, denying Ms application that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the plaintiff file security for costs. The Code of Civil Procedure makes the guardian <em>ad litem </em>responsible for costs (\u00a7 469), but it does not require him to file security therefor. If the legislature had intended that an infant plaintiff should be restrained from prosecuting an action until his guardian <em>ad litem </em>filed security for costs, which, in the present application it is claimed should be for $750, it is but reasonable to suppose they would have made some enactment to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The order appealed from should be affirmed, with hosts.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u2022 Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
