He also controverted the allegation in the complaint, of due service upon him of the notice of protest, and alleged a parol agreement with one Higgins, releasing him from his indorsement. The court, at general term, said : \u201c The evidence shows due presentation and protest of the draft, and service upon the defendant of notice thereof. The proofs fail to show any irregularity on the part of the notary, or the plaintiff. The plaintiff, as indorser, had one day after the receipt of the notice of protest within which to serve notice on the . prior indorser (Farmers\u2019 Bank of Bridgeport <em>v. </em>Vail, <em>21 </em>N. <em>Y. </em>488 ; West River Bank <em>v. </em>Taylor, 34 <em>Id. </em>128 ; Howard <em>v. </em>Ives, 1 <em>Hill, </em>263).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">\u201c The defense also set up in the answer, that, by a parol agreement with one Elias S. Higgins, the defendant was not to be held liable on his indorsement, is not available, as Elias S. Higgins was not the owner of the draft, and could make no such agreement; and even if the defense had been properly pleaded, parol evidence is inadmissible to vary the implied contract of an unrestricted indorsement (Cottrell <em>v. </em>Conklin, 4 <em>Duer, </em>50, and cases there cited; Bank of Albion <em>v. </em>Smith, 27 <em>Barb. </em>489).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-7\"><em>Thomas &amp; Wilder, </em>attorneys, and <em>Edward P.
