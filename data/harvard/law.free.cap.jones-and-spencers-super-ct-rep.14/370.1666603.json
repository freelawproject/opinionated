The answer denied any fraud, and alleged that the plaintiffs acted with full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances in reference to the matters complained of. Issue having been joined, the case was on the calendar of this court at the May term in 1879, and went over at the request of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. On the first day of June, the attorney-general, with the leave of the supreme court, began a suit to have the defendant judicially declared insolvent, and a receiver of its effects appointed. On On the 17th of June, James D. Fish was appointed receiver <em>pendente </em>lite, and duly qualified as such. This case was on the calendar in June, but was not tried on account of the illness of the judge. Being again on the calendar in October, the attorneys for the defendant notified the attorneys for the plaintiff that a receiver of the defendant had been appointed, and claimed that thereby proceedings were stayed until the receiver should be substituted as a defendant. The receiver was not substituted; but on the 17th day of October the plaintiffs took judgment by default for the sum of $1,054.07. The receiver, asserting that he had only recently heard of this judgment by default, petitioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>this court in December to open the default and allow him to come in and defend. The receiver\u2019s counsel, upon his appointment, were not the counsel of the company, but since he learned of the default in this case, he retained the counsel of the company to continue to act.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-4\"><em>Sewell &amp; </em>Pierce, attorneys, and <em>Robert Sewell, </em>of counsel, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-5\"><em>Bushnell &amp; Albright, </em>attorneys, and <em>Samuel Jones, </em>of counsel, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b394-6\">By the Court.\u2014Horace Russell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">This default seems to have been permitted in part because the defendant\u2019s attorneys believed that the appointment of a receiver of their client\u2019s property made it necessary, before plaintiffs could proceed with their action, that the receiver should first be substituted as a defendant; but more because their client\u2019s property having been taken away by the court, so that it was somewhat uncertain whether or not they would be compensated for their services, they did not choose to continue the defense until some satisfactory understanding on that point was arrived at.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">1. It was not necessary that the receiver should be substituted as a defendant before the plaintiff\u2019s action could proceed to judgment. A receiver, <em>pendente lite, </em>does not absolutely, and in all respects, supersede the corporation. The corporation was <em>in extremis, </em>but it was not dead. Until it was dissolved the suit against it could proceed even to judgment (In the Matter of Waterbury, 8 <em>Paige, </em>380; Kincaid <em>v. </em>Dwinelle, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>552 ; <em>Potter on Corporations, </em>845-847 ; Meckles <em>v. </em>Rochester B\u2019k, 11 <em>Paige, </em>118 ; N. Y. Marbled Iron Works <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 <em>Duer, </em>362; People <em>v. </em>Manhattan Co., 9 <em>Wend. </em>351; Attorney-General <em>v. </em>At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>lantic Life, 74 <em>N. Y. </em>183). The plaintiffs\u2019 proceedings were therefore regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">2. I am of opinion that the default ought to have been opened as a matter of favor. The defendant\u2019s attorneys were not the attorneys of the real party in interest, <em>i. e., </em>the receiver, at the time the default was taken; and a receiver\u2014an officer of the court\u2014ought not to be prevented from protecting his trust on account of their mistake of or a misunderstanding with them. The answer discloses a good defense to the action. The case is peculiar in its nature and ought to be openly litigated; and whether or not the attorneys of the corporation were guilty of laches, the receiver has been guilty of none, such as to justify the court in refusing to aid his efforts to protect the property committed to his care.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the motion granted, upon the payment of the costs for the trial of an issue of fact, and the disbursements of the trial term, and also disbursements up to and including entry of judgment and the costs of opposing this motion below\u2014the judgment to stand as security \u2014without costs of appeal to either party. And as this court has power to make the order which the special term should have made (Griffen <em>v. </em>Helmbold, 72 <em>N. Y. </em>437), let such an order be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
