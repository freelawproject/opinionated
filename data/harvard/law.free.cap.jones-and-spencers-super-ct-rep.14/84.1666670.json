The defendant demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.. The demurrer was overruled, and an order to that effect, giving leave to the defendant to answer, was entered September 10, 1878. Defendant did not answer, but appealed from this order overruling the demurrer. This appeal was, however, not immediately brought up. Subsequently the plaintiff moved for judgment, and thereupon, on March 14,1879, a judgment for damages was entered, directing that the damages should be assessed by a sheriff\u2019s jury. The inquisition was taken, and upon it and the other proceedings, final judgment was entered by the clerk on March 31, 1879, for $5,625.96. From this final judgment the defendant appealed to the general term, and this appeal from the final judgment, and also the appeal from the order overruling the demurrer, were brought on for hearing at the general term \u00f3f May, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-12\">The general term rendered a decision at the November term of 1879, dismissing the appeal from the order overruling the demurrer, and deciding that the appeal from the final judgment brought up nothing for review, as the notice of appeal contained no notice that any intermediate order or interlocutory judgment would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>reviewed, and affirming the final judgment. Opinion by Speir, J. <em>(45 N. Y. Super. Ct. 628).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">Subsequently, on December 4, 1879, the defendant served a notice of appeal from the interlocutory judgment of March 14, 1879 ; and also made a motion at special term to set aside the final judgment and allow the defendant to answer, on the ground that by the mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect of the defendant\u2019s counsel, the defendant had lost his right of appeal. The judge, at special term, referred the parties to the general term. At the general term of this court, held in January, 1880, the appeal from the interlocutory judgment was heard, and also the motion of the defendant to set aside the final judgment on ground of mistake of counsel. The plaintiff, at the same general term, moved to dismiss the appeal from the interlocutory judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">Decision was rendered in March, 1880, denying the motion of the defendant, and dismissing the appeal from the interlocutory judgment. .</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">No opinion written.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
