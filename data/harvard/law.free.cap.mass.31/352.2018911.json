His will was proved and allowed on July 6, 1830, and on the same day the defendant, as executor, gave bond to the judge of probate for the payment of the debts of the deceased and of the legacies given by the will. Sally married the plaintiff before the death of the testator. On March 14, 1833, she died, leaving one child. No administrator was appointed on her estate, nor had a guardian been appointed to the child. The plaintiff, after the expiration of three years from the death of the testator, and before the commencement of this suit, demanded of the defendant the legacy bequeathed to Sally, and this suit was brought to recover it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A0n\"><em>J.
