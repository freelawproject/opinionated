It was <em>held, </em>that the assignee had thus waived his right to object that the grantor was es topped to deny his seisin at the time when the deed was executed, and that the jury were at liberty to find the truth.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-12\">tf the grantor in a deed containing covenants of seisin and warranty was disseised at the time of the execution of the deed, no action will lie against him on such covelants in the name of an assignee of the grantee 3 for, the covenant of seisin being broken at the time of the execution of the deed, a mere right of action accrued to the grantee, which was not assignable.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-13\">Covenant broken; in which the plaintiff declares upon a deed of a tract of land in Sheffield, dated April 1, 1815, with covenants of seisin and warranty, given by the defendant to Abel Thorp, and a deed of the same land, containirg the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>like covenants, dated September 18, 1815, from Thorp to the plaintiff. The declaration sets forth a breach of the covenants of seisin and warranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AhZ\">The defendant pleaded first, <em>non est factum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2l\">The second plea averred, that on April 10, 1809, Daniel Sparks entered upon the premises, under a deed of warranty from the defendant, and on April 16, 1809, died seised thereof, and intestate, leaving a widow, Electa, and five children, to wit, Abigail, Maria, Levina, Angelina and Luanna ; that the premises vested in the children as an estate of inheritance, subject to the widow\u2019s right of dower, and that at the date of the deed from the defendant to Thorp, they were still seised thereof; and that the defendant was not seised thereof, and so his covenant of seisin was broken at the time of the execution of the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AL6\">The third plea alleged, that Sparks, before April 10, 1809, entered upon the premises, and became seised thereof by disseisin, and that a freehold estate in the premises descended to his children,' who continued seised thereof at the time of the execution of the deed to Thorp, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ayv\">The fourth plea, after stating the conveyance to Sparks, his death and the descent of the estate to his heirs, alleges that, on April 1, 1815, after Electa, the widow of Sparks, had intermarried with Noah Sellick, and at the joint request of Electa, Sellick and Thorp, the defendant was induced to destroy the deed to Sparks, and to execute the deed to Thorp, without any other consideration whatever than $ 24 named in the deed to Sparks ; that at the same time, Sellick executed a bond to Thorp, in the penal sum ol $ 300, conditioned, that whereas Thorp had purchased the premises, and bad executed and delivered his promissory notes to Sel lick for $ 150, and whereas the fee of the premises was in the heirs of Sparks, who were all minors, now if such heirs should convey to Thorp their respective shares in the estate, within six months after they should respectively become of age, and if Electa should, within two months from the date of the bond, release to Thorp her right, of dower in the premises, then such bond should be void ; that at the same time when Thorp executed his deed of the premises to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>plaintiff, be also assigned to the plaintiff this bond, and authorized him to collect the penalty thereof in the name of Thorp, but for the sole use of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-4\">Upon each of these pleas, issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">At the trial, before <em>Shaw </em>C. J., the plaintiff produced the deed from the defendant to Thorp, and it appeared that the covenant of warranty was as follows: \u2014 \u201cAnd furthermore I, the said Candee, do by these presents, bind myself &amp;c. to warrant and defend the above granted and bargained premises to him the said <em>Candee </em>\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">For the purposes of the trial, the jury were instructed, that this being probably a mistake apparent upon the face of the deed, they would be warranted in finding a verdict for the plaintiff upon such covenant. It was also objected, that this was a variance from the declaration, but the objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">On the issue on the first plea, the jury found for the plaintiff ; on the issues on the second, third and fourth pleas, the jury found a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\">It was agreed between the parties, that if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the damages were to be assessed under the direction of the Court. For this purpose, it was further agreed or proved, that the premises were conveyed by the plaintiff, with covenants of seisin and warranty, after he had received the deed from Thorp, and that the grantees were evicted from a portion thereof by the widow and two of the heirs of Sparks ; and that judgment had been recovered by such grantees against the plaintiff, upon his covenant of seisin, for $39*75, damages, and <em>$ </em>14*20, costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-9\"><em>Hall </em>and <em>Byington </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9k\">The defendant is estopped by his own deed to deny his seisin, at the time whisi the deed was executed. It may be said, that the plaintiff cannot avail himself of such estoppel unless he pleads it; but we contend, that it is not incumbent on the plaintiff to plead it in this case, as all the material facts are set forth in the pleas of the defendant, and appear on the record. <em>Howard </em>v.

The pleadings in this case are voluminous, but <em>the </em>merits are embraced in a very narrow compass. The plaintiff declares as the assignee of one Abel Thorp, in an action of covenant broken, upon a deed of conveyance from the defendant to said Thorp, with the usual covenants of seisin and warranty. The defendant pleads, that at the time of executing the deed declared on, he was not seised-of the granted premises, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>that Abigail, Maria, Levina, Angelina and Luanna Sparks were seised of the same, and so that his covenant of seisin was broken at the time of the execution of his deed. This plea was traversed, and the jury have found, that the defendant was not seised ; and this, we think, is decisive against the plaintiff\u2019s right of action ; and the supposed mistake in the deed becomes unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">It has been argued, that the defendant is estopped to deny his seisin ; whether he would have been estopped to show his liability to the grantee, in order to defend himself in this action, if the plaintiff had pleaded the estoppel, is a question as to which there may be some doubt, but which we do not stop to consider ; for however that may be, it is quite clear that the plaintiff, by taking issue on the fact as to the defendant\u2019s seisin, has waived the estoppel, and is now concluded by the finding of the jury. The estoppel appearing on the record makes' no difference, although the plaintiff might have availed himself of the advantage on demurrer ; <em>Kemp </em>v. Goodal, Salk. 277 ; but the fact being established by the jury, we are bound to give judgment according to the truth, as it appears of record. The principle is laid down in <em>Trevivian </em>v. Lawrence, Salk. 276, and is a familiar principle of the common law. If the defendant pleads the special matter on which he relies, and the plaintiff will not rely on the estoppel when he may, but takes issue on the fact, the jury shall not be bound by the estoppel, but shall find the truth, and the Court shall give judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">This point being established, it is perfectly well settled that no action will lie on this contract in the name of an assignee. By the breach of the covenant of seisin an action accrued to the grantee, which, being a mere chose in action, was not assignable, <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Page, </em>2 Mass. R. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
