The account commenced in December 1823, and ended in November 1825. There were charges nearly every month, and in 1824 and down to May 1825 there were various <em>credits. </em>The defendants kept no account with the plaintiff. The action was brought on October 7, 1831, and two small items under the date of November 1825, were the only charges made within six years before the commencement of this action. It was proved, that upon the account now sued being presented to Forristall in 1830, he said he had paid enough of Whitcomb\u2019s debts. Whitcomb was defaulted. It was resolved by the Court, that this was not to be considered as an account current or a mutual account, so as that the two last items should draw the others out of the operation of the statute of limitations ; and that the declaration of Forristall did not amount to a new promise.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
