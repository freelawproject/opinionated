It was objected to the verdict in this case, that one of the jurors had served within three years before his return on the venire to serve at the court at which this case was tried, and it was contended that by force of the <em>St. </em>1824, c. 119, such juror was not <em>eligible. </em>It appeared m point of fact, that the juror had served on a sheriff\u2019s jury, under the act respecting highways, but had not been returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>on a <em>venire </em>facias, to serve as a grand or traverse juror, at any court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\">It was insisted, by way of answer, that if the objection would have been originally well founded, (which was denied,) it was waived, and the counsel relied on <em>Amherst </em>v.
