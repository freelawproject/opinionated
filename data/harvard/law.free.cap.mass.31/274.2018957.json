It further appeared, that the estate was actually insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-13\">The question submitted to the Court of Common Pleas was, whether judgment should be rendered against the defendant for costs, <em>de bonis propriis, </em>or not ; and that Court adjudged, that the plaintiff was not entitled to such judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-14\">To this decision the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-15\"><em>Arms </em>and <em>Grennell. </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxU\">cited <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>2 Pick. 68 ; <em>Healy v.

Upon the facts agreed the Court is of opinion, that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for costs against the defendant, <em>de bonis propriis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The <em>St. </em>1784, c. 2, provides, that \u201c when a claim is disputed in the course of the common law, execution shall not issue as in common cases, but the judgment of the court respecting the same shall be the amount of the claim, and added to or deducted from the commissioners\u2019 report, as the case may require.\u201d It is intended, we think, that the debt or claim only is to be added to or deducted from the commissioners\u2019 report. And this construction of the statute we think can do no injustice to the administrator ; for in all cases the judge of probate would undoubtedly allow an executor or administrator to charge the costs paid, in his account of administration, unless he had unreasonably objected to a creditor\u2019s claim, thereby compelling him to commence a suit or abandon his just claim. And if the executor or administrator does without cause object to a creditor\u2019s claim, there is no good reason to be given, why he should not be liable for costs. The construction, therefore, which we give to the statute will work no injustice, and may operate as a beneficial restraint upon executors and administrators, who may be disposed to abuse their trust.
