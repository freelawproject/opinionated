In the original writ the sheriff was commanded to attach Wilson, to answer to \u201c Melvin Lord and John C. Holbrook <em>and one Eleazer J. F. Richardson </em>deceased, booksellers and copartners, doing business under the name and firm of Richardson, Lord and Holbrook,\u201d in a plea of the case, for that Wilson being indebted to the plaintiffs upon an account, in consideration thereof \u201c promised the said Lord and Holbrook, <em>the surviving partners of the said firm of Richardson, Lord and </em>Holbrook, to pay them the same,\u201d but have refused, &amp;c., to the damage \u201cof the said Lord and Holbrook.\u201d Upon this writ Wilson was arrested, and he gave bond, with the defendants as sureties, to answer to the plaintiffs as described in the writ. The action was duly entered, and Wilson appeared ; and upon leave to amend, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney struck out the words printed above in italics. In this amended state of the record judgment was rendered against Wilson upon a default. The cause of action in the original writ was a debt due to Lord and Holbrook, who after the decease of Richardson in 1829, continued to transact business under the name of Richardson, Lord and Holbrook.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-6\"><em>Wells </em>and <em>Doolittle </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzV\">that the amendments were essential, and that in consequence of them the bail were discharged. 1 Chit.
