Upon a motion on the part of the prisoner, that he should be furnished with a list of the witnesses examined as to his case before the grand jury, <em>Austin, </em>attorney-general, objected to the claim as a matter of right, and said that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>9 Pick. 498, a list was ordered to be furnished, because it had been promised by the solicitor-general. But it was resolved by the <em>Court, </em>that, on the general principles of justice and sound policy, the prisoner was entitled to know what persons had been examined as witnesses. The motion was accordingly granted.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
