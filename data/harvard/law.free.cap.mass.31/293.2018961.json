One Whitney was in possession of a tract of land, situate in Worcester, claiming to own it. About the date of the note, West, being the attorney of Whitney, sold the land to one Pond. A deed was made and executed by Whitney and his wife, and it was agreed that Whitney and West should come to Worcester at a particular time and deliver it. In the mean time Pond bargained with the defendant for the land, and when West and Whitney came to deliver the deed, Goddard and Pond were present, and it was delivered to Pond, and a part of the purchase money was paid by Goddard, and for the balance Goddard gave the note now in suit. This note, dated October 10, 1828, and payable in one year, was made to West as agent of Whitney, and it was agreed between West and Whitney, that West should hold it for the benefit of Whitney, and pay over to him the money which might be paid upon it. The fact that Pond had bargained with Goddard for the land, was known to West and Whitney, and some conversation was had about the deed from Whitney being made directly to Goddard, but as the deed to Pond had already been signed by Whitney\u2019s wife, it was thought best tnat it should be delivered to Pond, and that Pond should make his deed to Goddard. This was accordingly done. Both deeds contained the usual covenants of seisin and warranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-8\">On November 7, 1829, the note was assigned, for a valuable consideration, to one Coolidge, to whom Goddard made one or more payments upon it, and promised to pay the'balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">The balance of the note was not pail, because it was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>covered that the title to the estate was not in Whitney, when he conveyed it; and Goddard was ousted from the possession of the land, and he has ever since refused to pay the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">An action has been commenced by Goddard against Whitney, upon the covenants in his deed, and Whitney was defaulted at the first term, and the action has been continued from term to term to save the attachment made in the sane suit, and no judgment has been rendered thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-9\"><em>Merrick </em>and <em>Kinnicutt </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AST\">Tie covenants in Whitney\u2019s deed constitute a valid and sufficient consideration for the note. <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Lee, 3 </em>Pick. 452 ; <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Shearer, </em>7 Mass.

The covenants were independent of the promise in the note, and one independent covenant or promise is a good consideration for another. 1 Wms\u2019s Saund. 320, note 4. The covenants were certainly a part of the consideration for the note, and where there are two considerations and one fails or is void, and the other is good, and the proportions of them cannot be liquidated, the promise will be intended to have been given wholly for the good consideration.

The note was the promise of Goddard to pay the debt of another, the debt being due from Pond to Whitney, and the want or failure of consideration between Pond and Goddard is no defence to the action. 4 Petersdorff\u2019s Abr. 229 ; Bayley on Bills, (Phil. and Sewal\u2019s 1st edit.) 350, and notes ; <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>19 Johns.

It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>will be said that Coolidge took the note subject to all claims of set-off by Goddard against Whitney.; but by a payment to Coolidge of part of the note, and an express promise to pay him the balance, Goddard has waived this defence ; <em>Fenner v.

He has thus led Coolidge to neglect taking measures which might once have been effectual, to obtain a repayment of the consideration which passed from Coolidge to Whitney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-4\">The difference in the amount of damages on the covenant and on the note, and the inconvenience of trying a title to land in an action of assumpsit, are considered in <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>1 Greenl. 352.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-6\"><em>J.

The note was given in consideration of the conveyance of land by deed with the usual covenants of seisin and warranty. The title to the land failed entirely ; and the question is, whether that want of title is an entire want of consideration for the note, so as to render it <em>nudum pactum, </em>or whether the covenants were of themselves a sufficient consideration to support the promise. It was decided by the court in Maine, in <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>1 Greenl. 360, that the covenants were a sufficient consideration. The decisions of that court are entitled to great respect; the opinion however in the case cited was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>grounded on what was considered to be the settled law of Massachusetts ; but though there have been dictums, <em>(Fowler </em>v. <em>Shearer, 7 </em>Mass. R. 19; <em>Phelps </em>v. Decker, 10 Mass. R. 279;) there has been no decision in this State, to that effect, and so the foundation of the opinion fails. The same subject has been before the courts of other States, and the decisions have uniformly been, that a total failure of title is a tota failure of the consideration. <em>Frisbee </em>v. Hoffnagle, 11 Johns. R. 50; <em>M'Allister </em>v. <em>Reab, </em>4 Wendell, 483 ; <em>Steinhauer </em>v. <em>Witman, </em>1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 447 ; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Handkinson, </em>1 Bay, 278 ; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Huggins, </em>1 Bay, 327 ; <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>3 Vermont R. 162; <em>Tillotson </em>v. <em>Grapes, 4 </em>N. Hamp. R. 448. The promise is not made for a promise, but for the land ; the moving cause is the estate ; and if that fails to pass, the promise is a mere <em>nudum pactum. </em>It was objected that the rule of damages in an action on the covenant would be different from the consideration of the promise ; but in the case of a total failure of title, the amount of damages would be the same ; and it is just that a party should be allowed to show a total failure, in an action on the promise, instead ol being compelled to seek his remedy on the covenants.
