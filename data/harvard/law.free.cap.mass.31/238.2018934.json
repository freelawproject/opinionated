It was agreed that the value of the rye was $ 180, and that the expense of cradling it, amounted to $20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>If the defendants were liable, the damages were to be assessed by the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-4\"><em>Mills </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-5\"><em>Boies </em>and <em>W.

This proceeds upon a mistake. It is true there was a judgment for the defendant\u2019s grantor in a writ of entry, an action of inferior degree ; but upon the higher action, it was determined that the defendant was in without right, in effect reversing and annulling the former judgment. The general rule is, that if a man enter by title paramount, he shall have the emblements, as if a disseisor sow and the disseisee enter before severance. Co. Litt. 55 <em>b.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Court are of opinion, that the claim for emblements cannot be sustained, and that the defendants are liable. But we think here was no ground to claim exemplary damages ; but the value of the growing crop is the proper measure of damages. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover the agreed value of the grain, deducting the expense of harvesting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
