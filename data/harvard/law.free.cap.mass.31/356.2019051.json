The defendant pleaded the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-10\">At the trial, before <em>Wilde </em>J., it was proved by the plaintiff, that he demanded the sleigh of the defendant, on July 26, 1831, which was subsequent to the date of the writ, and while it was in the officer\u2019s hands for service; but that the defendant refused to deliver the sleigh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-11\">The defendant proved, that in 1830, the plaintiff was an inhabitant of Montague ; that he was assessed by the .assessors of that town, for. town, county and state taxes, in the sum of $7\u201852; that the defendant was a collector of taxes in that town ; that about June 4, 1830, the tax lists, with warrants, were committed to the defendant; that about the 1st of November, 1830, the. plaintiff removed from Montague to Sutton, without having paid the tax assessed upon him ; that the defendant thereupon seized the sleigh, advertised it a week or longer, as for sale by auction, and purchased it at the auc tion for the sum of $ 5-00, he being the highest bidder ; that the auction was held at a private house, on a town road, about one hundred rods distant from any public, travelled way, and three persons only were present; that the defendant, after deducting from the proceeds the expenses of the sale, amounting to 74 cents, applied the balance, amounting to the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>$4-26, in part-payment of the tax ; that in June. 1831, the plaintiff came to Montague, paid the residue of the tax, and required the defendant to give him a receipt for the whole amount of the tax, in order that the plaintiff might settle with his landlord ; and that the defendant accordingly gave such a receipt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">Upon this evidence it was objected by the plaintiff, that the sale was illegal; and it was so ruled by the judge. The defendant contended, that the payment of the residue of the tax and taking a receipt for the whole amount of the tax, was a waiver of all objections to the legality of the defendant\u2019s proceedings in the sale ; but the judge ruled otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">It was then insisted, on the part of the defendant, that the application of the sum of $ 4-26, in part-payment of the tax, by the defendant, ought to be taken into consideration by the jury in the assessment of damages ; but that question was reserved for the consideration of the whole Court, and the cause was committed to the jury, for the purpose of determining the value of the sleigh. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed damages in the sum of $22-04.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">The verdict was to be amended, or set aside and a new trial granted, as the whole Court should determine upon these facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">The case was argued in writing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-8\"><em>Newton </em>and <em>Smith </em>for the</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au3\">defendant. This action is not maintainable, because there was no proof of a conversion before the commencement of the action, the demand and refusal being subsequent to the date of the writ. <em>Storm </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>6 Johns. R. 44; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>1 Pick. 202; <em>Badger </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>15 Mass. R. 359; <em>Cheetham </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>3 Johns. R. 42. The sale was not a conversion; it was, at the most, voidable, not void. <em>Jennison </em>v. <em>Hapgood, </em>7 Pick. 8; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>14 Johns. R. 407. It could not have relation back, and render the original taking tortious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-9\">2. The plaintiff has misconceived his action ; he should have brought a special action on the case. <em>Livermore </em>v. <em>Bag ley, </em>3 Mass. R. 487. It is a well established- principle of law, that no one can maintain trover, unless at the time when the action was commenced, he had either the general or a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>cial property in the chattels for the conversion of which the action is brought. <em>Waterman v. Robinson, </em>5 Mass. R. 303; <em>Ludden </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>9 Mass. R. 104; <em>Warren </em>v. Leland, 9 Mass. R. 265; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>14 Mass. R. 217 The plaintiff had neither. The defendant took the sleigh by virtue of legal process ; and until the sale, the special property was in the defendant, and the general property in the plaintiff. But when the sale took place, the general property of the plaintiff was divested. <em>Jennison </em>v. <em>Hapgood, </em>7 P ck. 8 <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>14 Johns. R. 407. It might be, supposing the rule in equity, forbidding a trustee to purchase the trust estate, to be applicable, that, after the sale, the plaintiff, as cestui que trust, had some equitable interest in the property ; but he had no legal interest till a court of equity should have decreed the sale to be void. The bringing of this action is an affirmance of the sale. <em>Sheldon </em>v. Sheldon, 13 Johns. R. 220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-7\">But the sale was not even voidable. The rule in equity is not applicable to cases like the present. <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>13 Johns. R. 220. The defendant substantially pursued the course pointed out by <em>St. </em>1785, c. 70, \u00a7 2, and <em>St. </em>1791, c. 22, \u00a7 2. If he kept the sleigh longer than the time prescribed by those statutes, the plaintiff would have no cause to complain, even if the creditors of the plaintiff might impeach the sale on that ground ; for the plaintiff had a better opportunity to pay the tax, and prevent the sale. <em>Haynes </em>v. Wallis, 6 Pick. 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-8\">The plaintiff, by paying the residue of the tax in June, 1831, and taking a receipt in full from the defendant, has waived his right to bring an action in order to avoid the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-9\">If the plaintiff is entitled to recover, it is clear that the sum of $ 4*26, the proceeds of the sale, should be deducted from the amount of the verdict. <em>Sheldon v. Sheldon, </em>13 Johns. R. 220; <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>6 Mass. R. 20; <em>Sandford </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>13 Mass. R. 286; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>5 Mass. R. 404.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-10\"><em>Merrick </em>and <em>Sibley, </em>for the plaintiff. The gross delay of the defendant in making the sale, and his proceedings at the sale, rendered him a trespasser <em>ab initio. Purrington </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>7 Mass. R. 388; <em>Nelson </em>v. Merriam, 4 Pick. 249. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>original taking of the goods, being therefore tortious, was a conversion of them. Where trespass will lie for a wrongful taking, trover will lie also. 1 Chitty on Pl. 153; <em>Farrington </em>v. Payne, 15 Johns. R. 431; <em>Prescott v. Wright, </em>6 Mass. R. 20; <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Truesdell, </em>6 Pick. 455; 2 Selwyn\u2019s N P. 1071.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-4\">The jury found, as damages, the value of the property at the time of the conversion. We contend, that this is the legal measure of damages, and that nothing like a set-off is to be allowed in this action. <em>Kennedy </em>v. Whitwell, 4 Pick. 466.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b365-5\">Morton J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnR\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The defendant, who was collector of taxes in the town of Montague, justifies the taking of the goods in question under a warrant from the assessors of that town and a seizure and sale of the same for the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">It appears, from the reported facts in the case, that the defendant was the highest bidder and purchaser at his own auction. This conduct of the defendant was clearly a violation of his official duty. Such a practice must, if it did not in the present instance, lead to fraud in the publication of notices, and the selection of places of sale. The respective duties of buyer and seller are incompatible with each other, and no person, in whatever capacity he may undertake to act, can rightfully sustain both characters. But a sale by an officer or other trustee to himself, is not absolutely void. The cestui que trust has an option to affirm or avoid it, as he may judge most advantageous to himself. As the plaintiff had made no election to annul the sale by a demand of the property, or otherwise, before the commencement of the action, it may well be doubted whether, upon this ground, he could recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">But it further appears, that more than six days elapsed after the seizure of the distress, and before the sale. This, in our opinion, is fatal to the defendant\u2019s justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The <em>St. </em>1785, c. 70, \u00a7 2, regulates the proceedings \u00f3f collectors and constables on warrants for the collection of taxes. These proceedings are modified, in a way not affecting the present case, by the <em>St. </em>1791, c. 22, \u00a7 2. The former statute requires the collector or constable distraining for non-payment of taxes, to keep the distress four days, and if the taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>be not then paid, to advertise forty-eight hours, and then, viz at the end of six days, to sell at public auction. The latter statute authorizes the <em>forty-eight </em>/tours\u2019 notice to be given <em>within, </em>and the sale to be made at the expiration of the <em>four days. </em>It is immaterial to the present inquiry, whether the lat ter statute is imperative or only gives the officer a discretion to advertise within or at the end of the four days, as he may judge expedient. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>5 Mass. R. 157; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>5 Mass. R. 399. The officer did not offer the distress for sale within six days and therefore cannot protect himself under either of these statutes. Having no legajustification for the forcible seizure of the plaintiff\u2019s property, he stands in the same relation to him as if he had originally taken it without any authority ; and must be deemed a trespasser <em>ah initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">It is important to the rights of property, that positive regulations authorizing the seizure and sale of chattels without the consent of their owner, should be lawfully and strictly complied with. The defendant has failed to do this. Although the original purpose of the taking was proper and the taking itself <em>rightful,' </em>yet when there was a failure to make a lawful application, the whole became unjustifiable from the beginning. Having used the goods unlawfully, or applied them to an improper purpose, the officer cannot be permitted to show that they were taken for a purpose to which they were not applied, or upon authority on which they were not subsequently holden. The defendant not being allowed to show that the original seizure was made by any lawful authority, and it being without the consent of the owner, it must of course be <em>wrongful. Purrington </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>7 Mass. R. 388; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>4 Pick. 249. The <em>tortious </em>taking of personal property is a <em>conversion </em>of it; and therefore trover will lie, without demand and refusal. And it may be laid down as a general proposition, that where trespass <em>de honis asportatis </em>lies, <em>trover </em>will also lie. See the authorities cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">It cannot be pretended, that the payment of the balance of the taxes and the taking a receipt for the whole, by the plaintiff, was any acquiescence in the illegal proceedings of tha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>defendant or any waiver of the right of action. The taxes he was bound to pay in full, and on failure was liable to another distress, or to a personal arrest and imprisonment. The purpose for which the receipt was required, is a sufficient explanation of that act, if indeed any were necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The general rule of damages in actions of trover is, unquestionably, the value of the property taken, at the time of its conversion. But there are exceptions and qualifications of this tule, as plain and well established as the rule itself. Where-ever the property is returned, and received by the plaintiff\", the rule does not apply. And when the property itself has been sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s debt, or otherwise to his use, the reason of the rule ceases and justice forbids its application. In all such cases the facts may be shown in mitigation of damages. These principles are supported by many adjudications, and are founded in equity and practical convenience. <em>Wheelock </em>v. <em>Wheel</em>wright, 5 Mass. R. 104; <em>Caldwell </em>v. Eaton, 5 Mass. R. 399; <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>6 Mass. R. 20; <em>Squire </em>v. Hollenbeck, 9 Pick. 551; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>13 Johns. R. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The rule which for convenience was adopted on the trial of this case is not the correct one. The verdict, according to the arrangement entered into by the parties, must h\u00bb3 amended by deducting the amount applied towards the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s taxes* and judgment must be rendered on it for the balance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
