Now before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 16) filed by SCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The allegations in the Complaint are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   L.D. is a student in need of specialized instruction and is eligible to receive special education services under the IDEA. On March 30, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a due process complaint with the Tennessee Department of Education that challenged SCS's proposal to move L.D. into a therapeutic behavioral comprehensive development classroom (\"TBCDC\") at R. T. Fisher School. At the time, L.D. was in a Comprehensive Development Classroom (\"CDC\") at Watt Hardison Elementary School. As a result of the filing of the complaint, SCS was required to maintain L.D.'s \"stay-put\" placement at his present school throughout the duration of the due process hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 23, 2017, SCS filed its own due process complaint seeking to eliminate the \"stay-put\" requirement. It also sought permission to place L.D. at the TBCDC school (which by then had been relocated to Guild Elementary School) for forty-five days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 31, 2017, a due process hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). After the hearing, but prior to the hearing officer's decision, L.D. was accepted as a student at Illuminate Academy, a private, non-SCS school. Accordingly, on August 11, 2017, his parents withdrew L.D. from the SCS district. That same day, Plaintiffs filed a motion asking the ALJ to dismiss the pending due process complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 18, 2017, the ALJ denied the Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss and issued a Final Order permitting SCS to alter L.D.'s placement to the TBCDC at Guild Elementary School for forty-five days. In doing so, the ALJ found that SCS had \"proven by more than a preponderance of the evidence that maintaining L.D.'s current 'stay-put' placement is substantially likely to result in serious injury to L.D. or others.\" (Doc. No. 17-1 at 10). The ALJ then concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [I]t is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that SCS is relieved of its obligation to maintain L.D.'s current 'stay-put placement' at Watt Hardison Elementary School during the pendency of the companion due process hearing,...and that L.D.'s SCS placement be changed to the therapeutic behavioral CDC program at Guild Elementary School for forty-five school days. Under the circumstances, it is also\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that L.D. shall not be required to enroll in school with SCS if he has secured a suitable private placement. The remaining issues will be resolved at the full hearing, which is currently set to begin November 3, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By way of background for the ALJ's Final Order, Plaintiffs admit that, at some point while at Watt Hardison, \"L.D. exhibited aggressive behaviors which resulted in injury to himself, his classmates, and teachers.\" (Doc. No. 1, Complaint \u00b6 15). Nevertheless, they insist that L.D.'s placement in the CDC at Watt Hardison Elementary was appropriate. While there, he was under a behavior intervention plan that allowed him to have an individualized area in the classroom where he could receive one-on-one intervention, and \"L.D. was able to be successful when he was given appropriate direct instruction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). Even though \"[t]he classroom staff did not consistently implement L.D.'s behavior plan,\" his teacher reported on February 10, 2017, that she was \"incredibly proud of [L.D.'s] progress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly after the progress report was issued, SCS claimed that \"L.D.'s aggressive behavior began to increase in intensity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). L.D.'s case management team met, and it was determined that he would be sent to the TBCDC school. His parents were notified of this decision on\n   March 29, 2017, and their due process complaint followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this lawsuit, filed less than two months after the Final Order, Plaintiffs contend the ALJ erred in several ways. Specifically, they contend the \"ALJ committed reversible errors of both law and fact, including, without limitation, determining\" that (a) \"L.D.'s withdrawal from SCS did not moot the due process complaint since the Complaint sought an injunction against a student not enrolled in the SCS school district\"; (b) \"SCS did all it reasonably could within the current 'stay-put' placement to reduce the risk of injury to L.D. and others\"; and \u00a9 \"SCS demonstrated that the TBCDC program at Guild was an appropriate placement for L.D.\" (Doc. No. 1 Complaint at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Thus, \"under contemporary federal pleading standards, a complaint must contain 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,' Fed. R. Civ.

Besides, this is an appeal from an administrative proceeding under the IDEA, and any merit determination is based upon the administrative record, not the Complaint. In such circumstances, the court reviews the record \"under a modified\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard, meaning that it may set aside administrative findings in an IDEA case 'only if the evidence before the court is more likely than not to preclude the administrative decision from being justified based on the agency's presumed educational expertise, a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony, or both.' \"\n   <em>\n    N.W. ex rel.

There, the parents of a young boy named Bobby were dissatisfied with an IEP proposed by the school district for the 2002-2003 school year and filed an administrative complaint. After the hearing officer entered an order in favor of the school district, and both the State Board of Special Education Appeals and the district court affirmed that decision, the parents enrolled Bobby, who was then nine years old, in a different school district and agreed to a new IEP for the upcoming school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal, the Seventh Circuit addressed the \"capable of repetition yet evading review\" prong of the mootness doctrine.

What was right for Bobby in kindergarten may not be the proper educational program when he enters the third grade. The dispute over the 2002-2003 IEP turned on whether Bobby was ready for full-time mainstream class. Now, as a nine-year old, Bobby's readiness for mainstream education presents a different question calling for reassessment of his educational development. Were we to decide, at this later date, whether mainstreaming was right for Bobby back in 2002-2003, we would be issuing, in effect, an advisory opinion. Our decision would merely tell the parties who was correct about Bobby's outdated IEP. It would do nothing to define the contours of the parties' continuing legal relationship under the IDEA such that future repetitions of the injury could be avoided.

A.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083288\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/769/\">\n    258 F.3d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir.2001). What makes the case moot is any allegation or evidence from Plaintiffs that, if, and when, L.D. returns to an SCS school, he will be the same boy as when he left, as opposed to an\n   autistic child who presents \"an evolving set of challenges for educators[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063863\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/588/\">\n    442 F.3d at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Logic dictates that L.D. will be different if and when he is readmitted and it would be pure speculation to say how.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further, and more importantly, Plaintiffs' challenge is to the ALJ's Final Order that merely addressed the \"stay-put\" requirement. To the extent that Plaintiffs claim the ALJ procedurally erred by deciding the matter after being informed that L.D. had changed schools, this certainly is unlikely ever to repeat itself. Insofar as the ALJ is alleged to have substantively erred by relieving SCS of its obligation to maintain L.D.'s then-current placement, this, too, does not suggest a live case or controversy, or circumstances that are bound to recur. The only thing the ALJ has ruled thus far is that, during the pendency of the due process proceedings, SCS was authorized to place L.D. in the TBCDC program at Guild Elementary School for a period of forty-five school days. There is no suggestion that L.D. is likely to return to SCS prior to the completion of these proceedings, which the ALJ stated was to occur in November 2017 and Plaintiffs state in their briefing has now been scheduled for the first week in May 2018. (Doc. No. 18 at 4 n.2). Plaintiffs' fear that the ALJ's order would be followed or reimplemented at some unknown point down the road simply does not suffice to establish a case or controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Preiser v.
