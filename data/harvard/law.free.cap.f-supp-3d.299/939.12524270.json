ST. EVE, United States District Court Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 30, 2017, Plaintiff John Doe (\"Doe\") brought the present Complaint against Defendants Jane Roe and Columbia College Chicago (\"CCC\"), collectively \"Defendants,\" alleging violations of the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Title IX (\"Title IX\"), defamation, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Before the Court is CCC's motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the following reasons, the Court grants CCC's motion without prejudice and grants Plaintiff leave to file an Amended Complaint consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from an alleged sexual assault that occurred at CCC and the discipline\n   that resulted from that alleged assault. Plaintiff and Defendant Roe were both students at CCC in 2015, and after they had a sexual interaction on December 11, 2015, Roe accused Plaintiff of sexually assaulting her when she was incapacitated by alcohol. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 22-23.) CCC then suspended Plaintiff for the 2016-17 academic year-a decision Plaintiff claims was wrongful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Roe's Initial Complaint and Doe's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Doe alleges that all physical contact between himself and Roe on December 11, 2015 was consensual and that Roe requested that Doe engage in sexual intercourse with her-a request he declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Doe claims that he presented CCC with the following pieces of evidence that demonstrated he had not sexually assaulted Roe when she was incapacitated by alcohol:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 A toxicologist expert determined that Roe falsely alleged her self-induced alcohol consumption caused her to fade \"in and out of consciousness\" when interacting with Doe;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Affidavits from three CCC students indicated that Roe did not manifest signs of incapacitation the night of incident;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 CCC's panel (\"Hearing Panel\") concluded that Roe falsely alleged that Doe held her down and forced her to engage in non-consensual kissing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 A polygraph expert confirmed that Doe honestly testified that he did not force Roe to perform oral sex on him, Roe did not push his head away when he performed oral sex on her, and Roe did not appear to Doe to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Roe sent Doe a text message the morning after the incident saying she had a \"great time\" with Doe;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Roe admitted to the Hearing Panel that her responses to Doe were \"unclear or very passive\" despite previously claiming that she made repeated requests for the sexual interaction to stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Doe alleges that Roe acted with malice by falsely telling CCC that he assaulted her because she was angry that Doe declined Roe's request to have sexual intercourse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Roe's Non-Privileged Defamation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Doe alleges that in February 2016, Roe began making false statements to third parties accusing Doe of sexually assaulting her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Roe made statements, for example, to individuals who anonymously gave Doe a note on or about February 3, 2016, which threatened Doe and called him a \"fucker\" for sexually assaulting Roe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Also in February 2016, Roe made a social media post in which she stated: \"I have 46 followers her [sic] on Twitter and nothing to lose ... why the hell would I lie about being raped? ... [t]he point is Columbia needs to get their shit together because I'm leaving this school &amp; this city if they don't do something now ... [because] they are just letting a predator get away and it makes me sick.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Although that post did not mention Doe, several of her Twitter followers responded with statements such as \"[Doe] is a rapist and should not have the privilege of attending school at Columbia,\" and \"boy like [Doe] are the reason # INeedFeminism.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Roe also made statements to friends, which led female CCC students to make the following social media posts, among others:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 \"I do not feel safe knowing I live in the same building as a rapist. [D]o something about [Doe].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 \"[Doe] FROM ... AT PLYMOUTH RAPED SOMEONE. PASS IT ON.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 \"[Doe] is a rapist and endangering all of Columbia's students, &amp; he is still allowed to live here. Columbia is so disappointing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Doe alleges Roe's statements caused a female friend of hers to punch Doe and caused other friends to give him the middle finger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Doe's Complaints to CCC About Roe's Retaliatory Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 13, 2016, Doe informed CCC that he was suffering retaliation, physical assault, and widespread defamation at the hands of Roe and her friends, after he engaged in \"protected activity\" by participating in CCC's investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) CCC's Student Sexual Misconduct Policy &amp; Procedures (\"SMP\") states in \u00a7 VI that it \"is a violation of this Policy and Title IX to retaliate in any way against an individual who has ... assisted in the Grievance Procedures. Columbia will promptly investigate any allegation of retaliation and pursue disciplinary action as needed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Despite this policy and Doe's complaints, after Doe complained, CCC sent Doe a letter stating that it was not aware of Roe's friends' physically assaulting Doe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) On April 8, 2016, Doe sent CCC a social media post from a female student that stated: \"@coolandcozy one of my best friends punched [Doe] in the face. [I]t was immediately reported to the police and the dean. Isn't that cute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) On April 8, 2016, CCC Associate Dean Wilson-Taylor responded to Doe in a letter stating that CCC was not able to initially identify the student, but that CCC had addressed the issue with the female student and asking Doe to inform him if the student interacted with him at all. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Doe alleges on information and belief that CCC did not discipline the female student in the same way it disciplines male students involved in similar conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 13, 2016, Doe informed CCC that Roe's retaliation was forcing him to withdraw from CCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) He stated that it was impossible for him to focus on school after being falsely accused of sexual assault and then being physically attacked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe sent another email to CCC on March 29, 2016 informing CCC that two of Roe's friends gave him the middle finger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Doe alleges that CCC's communications with Doe did not respond to his allegations, and as a consequence, he sent a letter to CCC on April 8, 2016, stating that he believed CCC's failure to respond to Roe's retaliation created a hostile and abusive environment for himself and other male students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) On or about April 22, 2016, Doe informed CCC that a CCC student texted Doe's then girlfriend, who is now his wife, and told her he was a \"rapist\" who was \"lucky he has his teeth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) On April 25, 2016, CCC sent Doe a letter informing him that CCC had spoken to the student and told him not to have any contact with Doe or his wife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Despite this letter, Doe alleges that CCC refused to accommodate Doe's wife when she wanted to be in a different class than Roe after Roe threated to fight her on social media. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe alleges that these interactions are evidence of CCC's repeated refusal to discipline students who were engaging in retaliation in violation of Title IX. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) Doe also alleges upon information and belief that CCC never disciplined Roe for violating CCC's no-contact order or for disclosing confidential information related to CCC's disciplinary process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CCC's Disciplinary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Doe claims that he repeatedly put CCC on notice that its disciplinary proceeding violated its own policies and Title IX. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) In a March 13 letter, for example, Doe informed CCC of the following violations, among others:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 SMP \u00a7 XIV(C)(1)-\"the Coordinator ... shall serve ... the Respondent\n   with written notification than an Actionable claim has been filed, a description of the type of Sexual Misconduct alleged ..., and the investigator's name.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 SMP \u00a7 XIV(C)(2)-\"the Coordinator shall meet ... the Respondent to apprise [him] of [his] rights under this Policy and to ... provide ... notice of the types of information that likely will be disclosed during the investigation ...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 SMP \u00a7 1 XII-CCC \"shall complete an adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CCC responded by informing Doe that its policies were designed to comply with the rules and regulations issued by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (\"OCR\"), including providing due process to the alleged perpetrator and employing procedures designed to lead to supportable decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Doe claims CCC violated Title IX and its own policies because it completed its \"investigation\" of the incident and scheduled a disciplinary hearing before Doe had access to Roe's complaint and allegations and then informed Doe of Roe's accusations in person not by mail or email as CCC's policy requires. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) At the time of Doe's meeting with CCC officials, CCC had only provided Doe with an email asking him to meet, an email prohibiting him from entering certain CCC buildings, and an email stating that he may have violated CCC's sexual misconduct policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) Doe claims that he was thus denied the opportunity raise a conflict of interest issue with regard to the CCC investigator or to submit evidence and witnesses, and that he was not updated on the status of the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Eventually, on April 22, 2016, after requesting to submit evidence, Doe submitted a written statement to CCC on April 25, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) In the statement, Doe provided the names of multiple witnesses he and Roe interacted with the night of the incident and claimed that their physical interactions were completely consensual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe also claimed that he had suffered retaliation and that he would be willing to withdraw from CCC and not reapply if CCC would allow him to withdraw in good standing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe claims that he wrote this statement because CCC refused to identify the policies he was accused of violating, refused to include facts he submitted in its investigation, and refused to provide him with information about the evidence Roe provided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-57.) CCC did not provide Doe with access to the investigatory file until May 12, 2016, and Doe still did not receive CCC's investigator's interview notes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.) Doe alleges that the investigative file did not contain information about Roe's receipt of medical treatment, and he claims CCC removed this exculpatory information from the file. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Doe and his advisor attended the CCC hearing, as well as CCC's attorney, Hearing Panel Members Chindlun, Wordlow, and Baldford, and Roe and her advisor, who attended by Skype. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) The Hearing Panel found by a preponderance of the evidence that Roe falsely alleged that Doe physically held her down and that he forced her to engage in non-consensual kissing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Nevertheless, the Hearing Panel found Doe responsible for sexually assaulting Roe after determining her testimony was more credible than Doe's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, on June 7, 2016, CCC suspended Doe for the 2016-17 academic year and barred him from ever living in a CCC residence hall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On June 23, 2016, Doe appealed the Hearing Panel's decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) In his appeal, Doe claimed that he did not assault Roe and that CCC conducted an inadequate and biased investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe\n   argued in the appeal that Roe made contradictory statements, that a toxicology expert proved she was not unconscious the night of the incident, he passed a polygraph test showing he did not assault Roe, and three students provided affidavits stating that Roe was not incapacitated the night of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe's appeal claimed that CCC's investigation did not comply with the SMP and resulted in an unlawful and biased decision that CCC should have reversed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe's appeal also claimed that the Hearing Panel's decision was motivated by \"anti-male gender bias\" and that the investigation demonstrated that CCC gives preferential treatment to female alleged victims at the expense of falsely accused male students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In his appeal, Doe also claimed that the Hearing Panel did not provide an \"impartial adjudication\" in part because the Hearing Panel members received gender biased training. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Regardless of their training, Doe claimed that the Panel conducted a biased inquiry in which they unfairly questioned only his credibility while not asking critical questions of Roe or questioning her contradictory and inconsistent testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On July 11, CCC acknowledge receipt of Doe's timely appeal and sent it to Roe to allow her to provide a written response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) Roe responded on July 8, and on July 13, CCC assigned Joe Steiff as the Appeals Officer for Doe's appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.) On July 15, Doe sent CCC a letter challenging Steiff for having a conflict of interest because he created an educational documentary entitled \"How Will I Tell? Surviving Sexual Assault\" that told the story of a victim of sexual assault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) In response, CCC replaced Steiff with Elizabeth Davis-Berg an Associate Professor of Science and Mathematics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 70.) Davis-Berg rejected Doe's appeal on August 22, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Doe claims that the Hearing Panel's gender bias violated his rights under Title IX and CCC's policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.) Doe alleges, for instance, that CCC refused to provide him with information about any accommodations CCC offered Roe in response to her complaint, and he argues that she may have accused him of sexual assault to receive certain accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.) CCC told him that FERPA privacy concerns prohibited it from disclosing any accommodations it gave Roe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.) At the same time, CCC refused to grant Doe any accommodations despite Doe requesting accommodations to avoid confrontations with Roe and her friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CCC's Alleged Anti-Male Bias\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Doe alleges that SMP \u00a7 XII \"explicitly encourages\" participation in \"anti-male public awareness\" events such as \"Take Back the Night,\" the Clothesline Project, candlelight vigils, protests, and survivor speak-out events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Doe claims that these events demonstrate an intent to afford preferential treatment to females instead of implementing a gender neutral approach to alleged sexual misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) The Clothesline Project, for example, has the goal of \"break[ing] the silence and bear[ing] witness to one issue-violence against women.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) Further, Doe alleges that CCC's SMP defines Roe as a \"victim\" who CCC must avoid subjecting to \"additional trauma,\" which demonstrates an anti-male bias. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) Doe also alleges that CCC's SMP consistently requires that CCC \"protect the complainant,\" \"minimize the burden to the complainant,\" and \"accommodate the complainant,\" without any concern for the interests of the accused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Doe alleges that CCC continually refused Doe's document and information requests that would have allowed him to expose gender bias at CCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) CCC also refused Doe's requests\n   to review CCC's training materials, which would have allowed him to investigate his gender bias claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.) Doe alleges that CCC's bias arose in part from OCR complaints CCC female students filed, which caused OCR to investigate CCC and caused CCC officials to have an anti-male bias. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Furthermore, Doe alleges that the anti-male bias at CCC, and at other colleges, began in 2011 when OCR sent a \"Dear Colleague\" letter instructing colleges on how to comply with Title IX when investigating and resolving complaints of sexual misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.) According to Doe, this letter uses language that caused colleges to equate females with being victims in sexual misconduct cases and to give them preferential treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter identifies only women as victims and instructs colleges not to treat victims as if they are at fault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe claims that the letter also makes it difficult for males accused of sexual assault to defend themselves by adopting the lowest burden of proof-more likely than not-in sexual assault cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) A later communication from OCR in 2014 similarly makes it difficult for an accused male to defend himself by instructing schools that the complainant need not be present at disciplinary hearings and recommending that schools avoid \"revictimization\" and consider eliminating cross-examination of victims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) Neither the letter nor the 2014 communication were subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking, and some federal legislators, as well as private lawsuits, have challenged the communications' validity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Despite the OCR communications' allegedly questionable legitimacy, Doe alleges that CCC has treated the Dear Colleague letter as law and revised its policies in line with the letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) These policy changes and OCR's investigation of CCC, occurred at the same time CCC was investigating Roe's claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) Doe alleges that OCR pressured CCC to treat women as victims and to give them preferential treatment in sexual misconduct cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.) Doe claims that CCC felt compelled to update its policies for fear that OCR would investigate and withdraw federal funds if it found CCC to not be in compliance with its interpretation of Title IX. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-04.) As a result, Doe alleges that OCR essentially pressured CCC to severely discipline male students and alter its burden of proof standard to make it easier to find accused males responsible in sexual misconduct cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105-06.) As a result, Doe alleges that CCC ignored the exculpatory evidence establishing his innocence in fear of losing federal funds and in response to threats from the Obama Administration to punish institutions that did not adequately respond to sexual violence against women. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 111-117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Doe asserts that CCC also adopted policies that were gender-biased against males to avoid negative publicity that CCC did not adequately handle sexual assault investigations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) Doe contends that CCC uses \"archaic assumptions\" that females are always the victims in sexual misconduct cases and that males cannot be the victims, and he argues that CCC exhibited these assumptions and biases in his case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.) In addition, Doe alleges that CCC created a hostile environment for male students, which included showing a film titled \"The Hunting Ground,\" which detailed the stories of undergraduate sexual assault victims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 121-22.) Doe claims that \"The Hunting Ground\" has been criticized by many academics and news outlets for its anti-male bias. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.) CCC also hosted events and programs, such as a \"Consent Rocks\" concert and a sexual assault webinar, that Doe alleges further the anti-male bias at CCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As a result of these allegations, Doe brings several counts against Roe, CCC, and various CCC officials.

Doe alleges, for example, that CCC policies and events, such as \"Take Back the Night\" and other public awareness events, are anti-male. These events, however, are not gender-biased and instead are legitimate preventative education programs and resources that OCR has explicitly instructed universities to provide for survivors and victims of all genders. (Compl. Ex.

Doe complains, for example, that CCC excluded evidence that Roe was not intoxicated, that the student manual refers to complainants as \"victims\" suggesting a presumption of guilt, that CCC questioned Doe more aggressively than Roe, and that Doe was not provided access to training materials and communications with OCR. None of these allegations, however, are indicative of gender bias against males. As an initial matter, there are legitimate truth-seeking reasons-aside from gender bias-for these procedural measures. CCC, for example, may provide those accused of sexual assault only with documents relevant to the incident at issue to ensure that the focus of the disciplinary hearing remains on the facts related to the incident. Similarly, CCC may have questioned Doe more aggressively because his version of the facts was not consistent or questioned the alleged victim more gently to ensure she was not intimidated into not speaking out. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. A1 141-42) (noting that Doe's written and oral statements during the investigation were inconsistent.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   More importantly, even viewing these allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, they all are indicative, at best, of a bias in favor of sexual assault complainants and against those accused of sexual assault, regardless of gender. Doe has not alleged, for example, that CCC would have provided the requested documents to a female accused of sexual assault, or that CCC would have questioned a female accused of sexual assault more leniently.\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Colorado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275057\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/1064/#p1077\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d at 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting Title IX claim because even if aspects of \"truth-seeking process were unfair\" to the plaintiff, he cannot allege that they were unfair to him because he was a male). Additionally, if anything, the use of the word \"victim\" in CCC's policy manual\n   similarly creates a bias in favor of those who complain of sexual assault, not in favor of females specifically. Indeed, the manual does not use gendered pronouns and states that the policies apply \"regardless of the identity of a victim, witness, or Complainant.\" (Compl. Ex. B \u00a7 II.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v.

As the court explained in\n   <em>\n    University of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   , accommodating an alleged victim's class schedule to avoid confrontations with the person accused of sexual assault is a legitimate interim measure that complies with Title IX guidance issued by the Department of Education.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345354\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/173/586/#p606\">\n    173 F.Supp.3d at 606-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, in the 2011 Dear Colleague letter that Doe cited in his Complaint, the Department of Education explicitly stated that \"Title IX requires a school to take steps to protect the complainant as necessary, including taking interim steps before the final outcome of the investigation.\" (Compl. \u00b6 47) (citing \"Dear Colleague Letter,\" U.S. Dep't of Education Office of Civil Rights (Apr. 4, 2011) https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, Doe argues that the Court should infer gender bias from the fact that OCR previously had investigated CCC regarding Title IX complaints, and subsequent publicity from that investigation pressured CCC to investigate and punish males more harshly.

The plaintiff also alleged that university officials intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him by distorting facts relating to the alleged sexual assault, improperly attacking his credibility, and unjustifiably branding him a rapist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273533\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/799/#p822\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273533\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/799/#p822\">\n    at 826-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite having allowed the plaintiff's Title IX claim to survive, the court rejected his IIED claim finding that even if the university officials' conduct was objectionable, it was not the type of extreme conduct beyond the \"bounds of decency\" such that it would give rise to an intentional infliction claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273533\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/799/#p822\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Nungesser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343310\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/353/#p364\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court rejected the plaintiff's IIED claim because he had not alleged conduct \"so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.\" The court explained that although the plaintiff disagreed with how the university handled his sexual assault case and female students' activism on campus, he had not plausibly alleged any conduct that was extreme and outrageous.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343310\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/353/#p364\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court further reasoned that the plaintiff had not alleged any facts indicating that the university officials intended to cause him any distress.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343310\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/353/#p364\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fellheimer v.

Doe makes the boilerplate allegation that CCC's conduct was extreme and outrageous and that it intended to inflict severe emotional distress, but Doe's allegations do not state that CCC's conduct was extreme or outrageous or that it was intended to inflict emotional harm upon Doe. Doe may disagree with the findings of the Hearing Panel and CCC's application of its procedures, but his allegations make clear that CCC officials consistently responded to his communications, informed him of its policies, gave him a hearing with an adviser, considered his appeals, and responded to his complaints about other students by contacting those students and instructing them to cease their communication with Doe. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62-63, 41-42, 45-47.) Simply put, even if the Court were to accept that CCC's resolution of Roe's sexual assault complaint was unfair or unreasonable,\n   Doe does not allege conduct that constitutes the type of extreme, targeted, and malicious conduct required for an IIED claim.\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Here, Doe's NIED claim fails for the same reason that his negligence claim fails-he has failed to allege that CCC was negligent because he did not sufficiently allege that CCC owed Doe a duty to protect him from the harmful acts of third parties or that CCC owed Doe a duty under its policies and student manuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Accordingly, the Court grants CCC's motion to dismiss Doe's NIED claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For these reasons, the Court grants CCC's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss without prejudice. Plaintiff has leave to file an Amended Complaint on or before November 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    One of Doe's theories supporting gender bias is that CCC was under pressure to find males at fault for sexual assault due to OCR investigations into CCC's policies. In his Complaint, Doe referenced those OCR investigations and attached letters relating to those investigations to his Complaint. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. Ex. M.) In its Reply Brief, CCC attached an updated letter from OCR and a letter from OCR to another college. Because CCC did not attach these documents to its Motion to Dismiss, Doe argues that the Court should convert CCC's motion into a motion for summary judgment and allow Doe to engage in discovery. (R. 43, Pl.'s Surreply.) Despite Doe's arguments, the Court will not convert CCC's motion into one for summary judgment. The Court will not consider CCC's additional attachments or the specific arguments it makes with respect to the attachments, but CCC's general arguments regarding bias in OCR investigations are permissible as they are closely related to CCC's arguments in its motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Doe also includes allegations relating to CCC's handling of Roe's sexual assault complaint and its discipline of Doe in his hostile environment and deliberate indifference claims. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 160-68.) These allegations, however, do not relate to harassment and are thus not relevant to the elements required to allege either of these claims, although they are discussed below in relation to Doe's selective enforcement and erroneous outcome claims. Doe effectively concedes this point in describing the elements of hostile environment and deliberate indifference claims in his Response and by focusing his arguments on Roe and her friends' alleged harassment of Doe. (Pl.'s Resp. 12-13.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Doe does not explicitly forgo the indirect method, but he does not contend that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated students who did not engage in statutorily protected activity, which is an essential element of a prima facie case.\n    <em>\n     Turner v.
