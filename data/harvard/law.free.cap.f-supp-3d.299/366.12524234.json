For the reasons set forth below, the motion for reconsideration is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 25, 2016, Montijo was indicted for \"knowingly transport[ing] an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States, with the intent to engage in sexual activity for which he may be charged with a criminal offense\" pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 2423(a), among other offenses. (Docket No. 28 at p. 2.) On August 28, 2017, the government filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b) (\" Rule 12(b)\") seeking to \"prohibit[ ] the defendant from arguing or presenting evidence at trial that ... the minor victims somehow consented to engaging in the sexual conduct for which someone could be charged with a crime [and that] the defendant[ ] w[as] somehow mistaken as to the age of the minor victims.\" (Docket No. 68 at p. 1.) The Court entered an Order granting the government's motion. (Docket No. 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Now, Montijo requests that the Court reconsider this decision. (Docket No. 118.) Montijo argues that the alleged offenses are predicted on Article 130 of the Puerto Rico Penal Code and that Article 130 \"includes an element of knowledge of the age of the alleged victim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2 (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33 \u00a7 5191.) Montijo also contends that pursuant to Puerto Rico law, \"there is also the defense of error,\" which \"applies to any article in the Puerto Rico Penal Code,\" and that \"[i]n this case, the error is as to the age of the alleged victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33 \u00a7 5042). Montijo maintains that \"to prevent the defense to show that defendant was mistaken as to the age of the alleged victim would be error\" and \"[t]o prevent the defense that the victim consented, while the defendant believed she had the necessary age, is also error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not explicitly provide for motions for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898987\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/288/\">\n    741 F.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 n.2 (1st Cir. 2014) (\"[M]otions for reconsideration in criminal cases are not specifically authorized either by statute or by rule.\") (internal citation omitted). The First Circuit Court of Appeals, however, applies the legal standard pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) (\" Rule 59(e)\") to motions for reconsideration arising in the criminal context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673520\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/42/#p53\">\n    573 F.3d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (1st Cir. 2009) (applying the legal standard for Rule 59(e) to a motion for reconsideration in a criminal case). Although Montijo does not identify the statutory source for his motion to reconsider, the Court nonetheless applies the Rule 59(e) legal standard to Montijo's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 59(e), a district court will alter its original order only if it \"evidenced a manifest error of law, if there is newly discovered evidence, or in certain other narrow situations.\"\n   <em>\n    Biltcliffe v.

Mistake of Age\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Montijo's arguments regarding mistake of age are unavailing because a defendant's mistake of a victim's age is not available as a defense to the charge of transportation of a minor pursuant to section 2423(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because Montijo is charged pursuant to section 2423(a), the First Circuit Court of Appeals' holding in\n   <em>\n    Tavares\n   </em>\n   controls, and Puerto Rico law is immaterial.

Consent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Montijo's argument regarding the victims' consent is similarly unavailing because the age of a minor vitiates his or her consent to sexual activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The author of Commentaries to the Puerto Rico Penal Code, Dora Nevares-Mu\u00f1iz, explains in her commentary to Article 130:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   It is not relevant if the person gave consent to the sexual act, since, due to his [or her] psychophysiological immaturity, the legal system does not recognize him [or her] as capable of giving his [or her] consent.
