BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Andy B. Vinh, who is of Asian origin and of Vietnamese national origin, began working as a police officer for the Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD)-WMATA's police force-in 2008. On October 31, 2013, the plaintiff was convicted of second degree assault in Montgomery County, Maryland District Court. In response to the conviction, WMATA terminated the plaintiff's employment on November 25, 2013. He appealed his conviction and in January of 2014 the Montgomery County Circuit Court reversed his conviction and found him not guilty. At that point, the plaintiff reapplied for a position as a police officer with WMATA and was rehired, and not reinstated, on March 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of his firing and rehiring, the plaintiff was a paying union member of the Fraternal Order of the Police (\"FOP\"). On the plaintiff's behalf, FOP only filed a Step One Grievance and failed to pursue any additional grievance procedures under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\"), including arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 18, 2015, the plaintiff filed a Complaint in the present action against WMATA. He alleges three counts of discrimination under Title VII (race, national origin, and gender based discrimination). The plaintiff's allegations center on the claim that WMATA should have reinstated him, as opposed to rehiring him, following the reversal of his second degree assault conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Defendant Has Offered a Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason for Rehiring, As Opposed to Reinstating, the Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant put forth evidence that it rehired, as opposed to reinstated, the plaintiff following his conviction being overturned based on its understanding of the CBA agreement between WMATA and FOP. Chief of Police Ronald Pavlik avers that he understood Article Five of the CBA to require the plaintiff's seniority be terminated when he was fired for just cause on November 25, 2013, following his conviction on second degree assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 22-2, \u00b6 11. He subsequently decided to rehire the plaintiff following the reversal of his conviction and the expungement of his record. In his affidavit, Chief Pavlik states that he read Section Five of Article Five of the CBA to require that plaintiff's seniority start from the date of reemployment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 22-2, \u00b6 14. In other words, Chief Pavlik believed that the CBA explicitly disallowed him from reinstating the plaintiff and providing him with his previous level of seniority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff contends that WMATA's reasoning is \"conclusory\" and \"bare bones.\" ECF No. 24-2, pg. 8. Plaintiff further argues that \"there is no provision [in the CBA] stating that rehiring is the status quo under the CBA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds these arguments unavailing. Chief Pavlik's reading of the CBA is reasonable and would offer a legitimate basis for his decision. Section Five of Article Five clearly indicates that where an employee is reemployed, the \"employee's seniority date shall be the date of the employee's reemployment.\" ECF No. 22-2, pg. 16. Even if one could argue for a different reading of the CBA, the Court recognizes that \"whether an employer's proffered non-discriminatory reason is 'legitimate' is a relatively lenient standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Tabron v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272224\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/21/84/#p87\">\n    21 F.Supp.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87 (D.D.C. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    Fischbach v.

Cir. 1996). Moreover, the issue is not \"the correctness or desirability of [the] reasons offered ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [but] whether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers.\"\n   <em>\n    Fischbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n    86 F.3d at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the defendant produced evidence that the individual responsible for the decision-Chief Pavlik-was motivated by a reasonable reading of the CBA. Accordingly, the Court finds that the defendant offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Plaintiff Has Failed To Provide Evidence That Defendant's Proffered Reason for Rehiring Was Pretext For Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Since the Court finds that the defendant proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish that WMATA's reason was in fact pretext for discrimination. The plaintiff asserts three arguments in an attempt to carry his burden and the Court will address each one in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, the plaintiff points to the multiple interactions he had with FOP and WMATA officials following his conviction. He contends that \"the assurances from both the union and WMATA officials that Plaintiff would be reinstated sheds doubt on the credibility of the statement that rehiring and not reinstatement is the standard procedure.\" ECF No. 24-2, pg. 10. Specifically, the plaintiff highlights that union representatives assured him that they would fight for his reinstatement and that Captain Gaddis, an MTPD official, informed him that if he successfully appealed his conviction he would be reinstated. According to the plaintiff \"[t]he fact that the union and WMATA officials were so quick to assure Plaintiff that an overturned conviction would result in his reinstatement contravenes the Defendant's argument that the CBA and WMATA policy requires a rehire and not reinstatement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's second argument follows along the same lines. He alleges that from March 2014 to October 2014, WMATA delayed his full reinstatement. According to WMATA officials, while he was provisionally rehired in March, he could not be fully reinstated until after he acquired his Maryland Blue Card.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following months of delay, the plaintiff claims that he himself inquired into the status of his Blue Card and he learned that it was intact. Plaintiff contends that Captain Greg Hanna, an MTPD official, held up the process and that \"[t]hese are not the actions of an organization that is merely adhering to a collective bargaining agreement. These actions were taken to discriminate against the Plaintiff based upon his race.\" ECF No. 24-2, pg. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even accepting all of the plaintiff's factual assertions as true, there is still no evidence that Chief Pavlik's offered reason for this action was pretext for discrimination. Notably, Chief Pavlik is absent from the plaintiff's account. Plaintiff does not allege that he offered assurances of reinstatement or that he took part in delaying the process. Nor does plaintiff contest the fact that Chief Pavlik was the official ultimately responsible for terminating and rehiring the plaintiff (even if other officials at WMATA would have been involved in the process). Therefore, neither of the arguments above call into question his decision making nor undercut that he legitimately believed that the CBA required rehiring as opposed to reinstating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The crux of the plaintiff's third argument is that WMATA has a history of treating Asian-Americans worse than employees of other racial backgrounds. In support of that claim, plaintiff presents evidence of a number of similarly situated employees who were treated more favorably. Plaintiff also presents evidence of employees treated more favorably in order to support his claim that he was discriminated on the basis of his gender and his national origin. In total, plaintiff presents evidence of five comparators: T.H., S.B., M.S., I.N., and N.M.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 24-2, pgs. 11-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that T.H., S.B., M.S., and I.N.-all African-American individuals-were treated more favorably than him due to his race. M.S. and S.B. were both reinstated despite having been fired for malfeasance uncovered in internal investigations. T.H.-who was involved in an act of malicious vandalism-remained an officer and was allowed to carry a firearm, despite her Blue Card having been revoked. And I.N.-who was arrested on charges of trespassing into an area where he had been previously arrested for soliciting sex from a prostitute-were never even terminated in the first place, only suspended.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pgs. 4-5. Next, plaintiff contends that T.H., an African-American female, was treated more favorably due to gender.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pg. 14. And finally, N.M.-who is of Filipino national origin-was treated more favorably than plaintiff-who is of Vietnamese national origin-as evidence by the fact that he was reinstated following his termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pg. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendant responds by noting that three of the five comparators-M.S., S.B., and N.M.-are not similarly situated to the plaintiff as a matter of law because they were only reinstated pursuant to an arbitration agreement. Unlike the plaintiff, those three officers pursued their labor remedies under the CBA and an arbitrator ultimately ordered WMATA to reinstate them to their former positions and seniority. See ECF No. 22-2, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18. The plaintiff did not pursue arbitration. His union representatives failed to move past Step One of the grievance process (arbitration is only invoked after Step Four).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court finds this argument persuasive and agrees that as a matter of law, those three officers cannot be considered mutually exclusive. In order for the plaintiff to be considered similarly situated to the other officers, he is \"required to demonstrate that all of the relevant aspects of [his] employment situation were 'nearly identical' to those of the [the other officers].\"\n   <em>\n    Neuren v. Adduci, Mastriani, Meeks &amp; Schill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616721,11321686\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/1507/\">\n    43 F.3d 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1514 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). That the plaintiff did not pursue arbitration constitutes a major difference. Chief Pavlik attests that under his watch no officers, who were previously terminated, were reinstated unless he was ordered to do so by an arbitrator. Plaintiff argues that the \"union let [his] case fall by the wayside.\" ECF No. 24-2, pg. 13. But\n   even if true, that has no bearing on this analysis. The plaintiff's claims allege that WMATA officials treated him disparately from other officers by not reinstating him, not that his union representatives treated him poorly. It is also important to note another difference between the plaintiff and M.S., S.B., and N.M. Those three officers were terminated based on violations of internal policies not because they were criminally convicted, as the plaintiff was in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, the defendant contends that I.N. is not a proper comparator to the plaintiff because he was not terminated for his conduct. The plaintiff's claims are about reinstatement, not termination. He explicitly acknowledges that he does not contest WMATA's decision to terminate him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-4, pg. 2. Therefore, the actions by the defendant pertaining to an individual who was not terminated are not relevant to the present case. As it relates to I.N., the defendant did not need to face the decision of whether to reinstate or rehire, which is precisely the decision that is under scrutiny here. As a matter of law, even if the Court accepts the plaintiff's testimony related to I.N. as true,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   it does not do any work in proving that the defendant's stated reason for its action was pretext for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Court agrees with the defendant that T.H. is also not a similarly situated employee for the purpose of proving that defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason was pretext. Unlike the three officers discussed above, T.H. was reinstated without the benefit of an arbitration award. However, a major difference highlights that T.H.'s circumstances were not \"nearly identical\" to the plaintiff's circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Neuren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616721,11321686\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/1507/\">\n    43 F.3d at 1514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . T.H. was reinstated in 2007, roughly six years before the relevant facts in this case, and most importantly the decision to reinstate T.H. was made by then-Acting Chief David Shaw. Chief Pavlik avers that he was not privy to that decision and that he believes it was done contrary to the CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-2, \u00b6 19. In fact, it is the only case in the last twenty years where an officer was reinstated not as a result of an arbitration award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616721,11321686\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/1507/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that Chief Pavlik's stated reason for rehiring was pretext, it is highly relevant that the comparatively more favorable treatment was under a different decision maker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"42493\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/964/577/#p583\">\n    964 F.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (6th Cir. 1992) (\"[T]o be deemed \"similarly-situated\", the individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare his/her treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor, have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Holladay Property Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651864\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/937/32/#p37\">\n    937 F.Supp. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 (D.D.C. 1996) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiff alleges that since a reemployment decision must \"go through WMATA's HR Department and ultimately be approved by the General Manager of WMATA\" defendant's argument that the \"comparators are not similar to Plaintiff because there were different decision makers does not hold water.\" ECF No. 24-3, pgs. 12-13. The Court disagrees. While other officials are involved in these personnel decisions, the evidence indicates that Chief Pavlik was the primary decision maker. In his affidavit, Chief Pavlik asserts that he made the decision to terminate and subsequently rehire the plaintiff. The plaintiff does not suggest that the\n   decision to rehire could have been made independent of Chief Pavlik's viewpoint. But even if the Court did find T.H. to be similarly situated to the plaintiff that data point alone is not sufficient to carry the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating pretext. One incident in a twenty year period in which an officer was reinstated without an arbitration award does not prove much. And the Court is mindful of the principal that courts should \"decline to second-guess an employer's personnel decision absent demonstrably discriminatory motive.\"\n   <em>\n    Milton v. Weinberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1498603,3639270\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/696/94/\">\n    696 F.2d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, the Court is not persuaded that any of the five comparators presented by the plaintiff are similarly situated such that they can prove that Chief Pavlik's offered reason for his actions was pretextual. In his sworn testimony, Chief Pavlik conveyed his belief that the language of the CBA required him to rehire, as oppose to reinstate, the plaintiff. The Court finds that to be a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. And none of the evidence presented by the plaintiff proves \"\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that [his] reason was false,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that discrimination was the real reason.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Mary's Honor Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355912\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/502/#p515\">\n    509 U.S. at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355912\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/502/#p515\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff has failed to meet his burden and the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

In alleging that WMATA has a history of mistreating Asian-Americans on the basis of racial discrimination, the plaintiff raised the example of N.M., an Asian-American, who was terminated for his conduct and went through a lengthy process for reinstatement. Plaintiff argued that he was treated worse than T.H. and I.N., who were both African-American. Now, plaintiff cites N.M. as a similarly situated employee treated more favorable on the basis of national origin. Plaintiff appears to be arguing both that N.M. was discriminated against due to his race and yet was treated more favorably than plaintiff based on his national origin.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The defendant argues that the Court should not even accept the evidence because it was presented by the plaintiff on the basis of a newspaper article, which is hearsay evidence.
