First, a challenge to an expert's methodology will necessarily call into question the conclusions derived from the application of that methodology. Such a challenge does not impermissibly attack an expert's results simply because those results are collaterally damaged by the challenge directed towards the expert's methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Second, robustness testing of an expert's methodology-by applying that methodology to different data or with different assumptions and examining the results produced by the methodology so applied-is not an impermissible challenge to the expert's results. Rather, this robustness and sensitivity testing relates directly to two of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors articulated by the Supreme Court: whether the methodology \"can be (and has been) tested\" and the methodology's \"known or potential rate of error.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Robustness testing and sensitivity testing that produces contradictory or otherwise implausible results strongly suggest that a methodology has been insufficiently tested and that the methodology has a high potential rate of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Third, inconsistent results are an \"indicia of unreliability\" in an expert's methodologies.\n   <em>\n    Lippe v.

Dr. Seyhun\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs offer two reports from Dr. H. Nejat Seyhun: (1) an initial report dated February 2, 2017 (Decl. of David Kovel ex. G., July 10, 2017, ECF No. 2071); and (2) a rebuttal report dated May 3, 2017 (Decl. of Jefferson Bell ex. 5, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2008). We refer to these as the Seyhun Initial Report and the Seyhun Rebuttal Report. Across these two reports, Dr. Seyhun's opinions relate primarily to two subjects: (1) the determination of what LIBOR, and each bank's LIBOR submissions, would have been but-for the alleged manipulative conduct, and (2) the determination of what effect changes in LIBOR have on the trading prices of EDF contracts and options. Rabobank does not challenge Dr. Seyhun's qualifications, and we agree that Dr. Seyhun is well qualified to offer these opinions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.1. Models of But-For Published LIBOR and But-For LIBOR Submissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Dr. Seyhun first opines that certain statistical and mathematical analyses can demonstrate that the defendants' alleged conduct impacted LIBOR and calculate the amount of impact. (Seyhun Initial Report\n   \u00b6 12.) To support this conclusion, Dr. Seyhun offers several models for estimating but-for LIBOR and each bank's but-for LIBOR submissions as evidence that these statistical and mathematical analyses are available. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Seyhun Initial Report \u00b6 87.) In his initial report, Dr. Seyhun offers two methodologies that involve first the calculation of but-for published LIBOR and then the derivation of each bank's but-for LIBOR submission from but-for published LIBOR. In his rebuttal report, Dr. Seyhun offers two additional models that are entirely distinct from the two models presented in his initial report. In each of these models, Dr. Seyhun first calculates but-for LIBOR submissions for each panel bank and then applies the BBA's trimming methodology-which excludes the top quartile of submissions and the bottom quartile of submissions and averages the remaining submissions-in order to determine but-for published LIBOR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The two models presented in Dr. Seyhun's initial report each begin with the calculation of but-for published LIBOR. Dr. Seyhun models the mathematical relationship between LIBOR and a reference rate on a daily basis during a \"clean period\" using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and uses that relationship to predict LIBOR over the Class Period. Though Dr. Seyhun varies the reference rate and clean period at various points in his report,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Seyhun primarily uses the ICAP-Ask rate\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the reference rate and the aggregated period from 2000 through 2004 combined with 2013 as the clean period. (Seyhun Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 70-78, tbl.2.2.) Dr. Seyhun defines LIBOR \"artificiality\" to be the difference between his calculated but-for published LIBOR and actual published LIBOR and tests the statistical significance of the artificiality during the Suppression Period (but not Period 0) using another regression. (Seyhun Initial Report tbl.2.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Dr. Seyhun also estimates but-for LIBOR using the ICAP-Ask rate as the reference rate in a second regression. Otherwise identical, this second ICAP-Ask model uses a clean period of 2000 through 2002 aggregated with 2013. Dr. Seyhun presents an analysis of the statistical significance of his artificiality estimates\n   based on this specification (Seyhun Initial Report tbl.2.4), but does not present the results of the regression itself and does not reference this 2000-2002 plus 2013 regression elsewhere in his initial report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Dr. Seyhun then derives, for each panel bank, but-for LIBOR submissions from the first ICAP-Ask-based model of but-for LIBOR using two different methods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the first method (the \"Relative Artificiality\" model), Dr. Seyhun assesses the \"relative artificiality\" of a bank's submission by calculating the difference between a bank's actual submission and actual published LIBOR. If the bank's submission was not trimmed from the calculation of published LIBOR, the relative artificiality equals the difference between published LIBOR and the bank's LIBOR submission. If the bank's submission\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   trimmed from the calculation of published LIBOR by virtue of being higher than the third quartile submission (or lower than the first quartile submission), Dr. Seyhun limits the bank's relative artificiality to the relative artificiality of the highest (or lowest) submission that was retained in the actual LIBOR calculation. This \"relative artificiality\" in the bank's submission is then added to overall LIBOR artificiality to estimate the total extent of artificiality in the bank's submission. (Seyhun Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 92-94, figs.1E1-1E17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Under the second method (the \"CDS Spread\" model), Dr. Seyhun first estimates, for each panel bank, the relationship between the bank's LIBOR submission and the spreads on the bank's credit default swaps (CDS).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Seyhun uses a regression specified as the natural logarithm of the LIBOR submission against the natural logarithm of the CDS spread and a set of \"dummy\" indicator variables corresponding to each day, over a clean period from May 18, 2010 to December 31, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, for each bank, Dr. Seyhun calculates the percentage deviation of the bank's CDS spread from the average CDS spread across all panel banks and uses that deviation to calculate the percentage difference between the bank's but-for LIBOR submission from published LIBOR, and applies that difference to but-for LIBOR to calculate the bank's but-for LIBOR submission. (Seyhun Initial Report 95-102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In his third model (his rebuttal report's first model), which we refer to as the \"Rebuttal Period 0 Model,\" Dr. Seyhun reviews documents to identify \"events\" of trader-based manipulation and determines whether the event has \"a clear directionality,\" finding 63 \"events\" over 45 different days. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 488.) Independently, to estimate each bank's but-for\n   LIBOR submission, Dr. Seyhun regresses each bank's LIBOR submission on a given day against the ICAP-Ask rate, a one-day lag of the ICAP-Ask rate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   a set of dummy variables for each month over Period 0, a first set of interaction terms between the monthly dummy variables and the ICAP-Ask rate, and a second set of interaction terms between the monthly dummy variables and the lagged ICAP-Ask rate. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 489-91.) That is, Dr. Seyhun estimates, for each panel bank on a given day, the bank's but-for LIBOR submission based on, among other variables, that day's ICAP-Ask rate and the prior day's ICAP-Ask rate. From these but-for LIBOR submissions, Dr. Seyhun then calculates but-for LIBOR by applying the BBA's trimming methodology. Comparing the results from this model and his documentary analysis, Dr. Seyhun concludes that there is \"confirmed manipulation by at least one bank on 45 different occasions.\" (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 494.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In his fourth model (his rebuttal report's second model), which we refer to as the \"Rebuttal Suppression model,\" Dr. Seyhun conducts another regression in order to estimate each panel bank's but-for LIBOR submissions. He regresses, using an aggregated clean period of January 1, 2004 through August 7, 2007 and May 18, 2010 through December 31, 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   each bank's actual LIBOR submission against (1) the ICAP-Ask rate, (2) a one-day lag of the ICAP-Ask rate, (3) the one-month overnight indexed swap (OIS) rate, (4) the standard deviation of the panel banks' CDS spreads, and (5) the difference between the bank's CDS spread and the panel banks' mean CDS spread. Dr. Seyhun then calculates \"artificiality\" during the Suppression Period as the difference between a bank's actual submission and the bank's but-for submission estimated using his five-variable regression. As in his initial report, Dr. Seyhun also tests the statistical significance of his measured artificiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Rabobank contends that Dr. Seyhun's models, and his opinions based on these models, are unreliable because (1) the four models yield directionally inconsistent results; (2) the four models produce implausible findings of artificiality, including substantial artificiality during purported \"clean\" periods; (3) the ICAP-Ask models and Rebuttal Period 0 models produce estimates of artificiality inconsistent with Dr. Netz's opinions and Exchange plaintiffs' allegations; and (4) his Relative Artificiality and CDS Spread models of but-for LIBOR submissions are reliant on unreliable estimates of but-for LIBOR improperly estimated using 2013 as part of the clean period. We consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.1.1. Internal Inconsistencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Rabobank, relying on Dr. Hubbard's opinions, contends that Dr. Seyhun's methodologies are internally inconsistent. According to Rabobank and Dr. Hubbard, across Dr. Seyhun's four models of but-for\n   LIBOR (the two ICAP-Ask based models presented in the initial report, the Rebuttal Period 0 model, and the Rebuttal Suppression model), at least one model finds upward manipulation on 65% of days in Period 0 and at least one model finds downward manipulation of LIBOR on 89% of days in Period 0. Similarly, across Dr. Seyhun's four models of but-for LIBOR submissions (the Relative Artificiality and CDS Spread models based on the first ICAP-Ask-based model of but-for LIBOR, the Rebuttal Period 0 model, and the Rebuttal Suppression model), at least one model finds upward manipulation of Rabobank's LIBOR submission on 95% of days in Period 0 and at least one model finds downward manipulation on 84% of days in Period 0.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Because the sum of each set of figures is greater than 100%, Rabobank asserts that this \"mathematical impossibility\" establishes the unreliability of Dr. Seyhun's models. (Rabobank Seyhun Mem. 8; Hubbard Rebuttal Report \u00b6 17 &amp; n.54.) Exchange plaintiffs do not dispute Rabobank's cited statistics, but contend that those statistics are meaningless because Dr. Seyhun's models are presented as alternatives and their results therefore \"are not meant to be combined.\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Rabobank's \"mathematical impossibility\" argument is not necessarily persuasive, as the 100% threshold on which the argument relies is of little significance here. An expert's models are not necessarily questionable if that percentage exceeds 100%; the extent to which the models disagree matters more than the mathematical sum of certain results that they produce. For example, if an expert presented two models, one of which found upward manipulation on days amounting to 51 days of a 100-day class period and the other of which found downward manipulation on the remaining 49 days but also one day in which the first model found upward manipulation, that one day of conflicting results does not necessarily call into question the entirety of the models. Conversely, an expert's models may be questionable even if the relevant percentages did not exceed 100%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Dr. Seyhun's models are structured differently-at least in part-in order to reflect differences between Period 0 and the Suppression Period. (Seyhun Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 81-102; Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 487-500.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Nonetheless, in this case, the inconsistencies in the results produced by Dr. Seyhun's models do call into question the models' reliability. Even when intended to measure artificiality during the same period of time, Dr. Seyhun's models produce directionally inconsistent results a substantial portion of the time. Even though all three models are intended to estimate artificiality in Rabobank's LIBOR submissions during Period 0, the Rebuttal Period 0 model produces results directionally inconsistent\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   from those produced by and the CDS Spread and Relative Artificiality models on 49% and 40% of days in Period 0, respectively. (Hubbard Rebuttal Report \u00b6 20, tbl.1.) Similarly, the Rebuttal Period 0 model produces directionally inconsistent estimates of artificiality in LIBOR from the two ICAP-Ask-based models of but-for LIBOR on 44% and 42% of the days in\n   Period 0. (Hubbard Rebuttal Report \u00b6 24, tbl.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Accordingly, Exchange plaintiffs cannot seriously dispute that Dr. Seyhun's models produce meaningfully different estimates of artificiality, in directionally inconsistent ways. (Hubbard Rebuttal Report exs. 21A-21Q, 22.) Rabobank has not \"manipulated\" Dr. Seyhun's models as Exchange plaintiffs suggest by comparing the results produced by one model to those produced by other models; rather, Rabobank identified pervasive inconsistencies. Even if the models are formally designated \"alternatives,\" each is nonetheless intended to estimate the same measures: the amount of artificiality in LIBOR and each panel bank's LIBOR submissions. Some minor disagreement between the models would naturally be expected, but Dr. Seyhun's models produce internally inconsistent results on more than half of days. Inconsistencies of this magnitude indicate a lack of reliability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lippe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Fed.%20Appx.%20274\">\n    99 Fed.Appx. at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[The expert] failed to explain why her [two] analyses did not yield similar results-after admitting that they should.\");\n   <em>\n    In re Fed.

Implausible Artificiality Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Next, Rabobank argues that Dr. Seyhun's ICAP-Ask-based models of but-for LIBOR and his Rebuttal Period 0 model are unreliable because the three models identify artificiality in published LIBOR on a substantial percentage of days during the models' respective clean periods. Specifically, the first ICAP-Ask-based model identifies artificiality on 57% of days between 2000 and 2004, the second ICAP-Ask-based model identifies artificiality on 39% of days between 2000 and 2002, and the Rebuttal Period 0 model identifies artificiality on every single day in Period 0. (Rabobank Seyhun Mem. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Rabobank's statistics are not entirely fairly presented, as they represent percentages of only certain portions of the clean periods underlying the three models\n   rather than the entireties of the clean periods. Nonetheless, restating those percentages slightly to represent percentages of the entire clean periods, Dr. Seyhun's models continue to find significant artificiality during clean periods. The first ICAP-Ask-based model identifies artificiality on 50% of clean-period days,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   the second ICAP-Ask-based model identifies artificiality on 29% of clean-period days,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Rebuttal Period 0 identifies artificiality on at least 58% of clean-period days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   As to the ICAP-Ask-based models of but-for LIBOR, Exchange plaintiffs again do not dispute Rabobank's statistics, but contend that the clean periods in those models \"were not 100% clean periods,\" \"merely cleaner periods.\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 12 n.11.) Accordingly, they reassure us, the ICAP-Ask-based models retain validity because they find comparatively more artificiality during the Class Period than during the clean periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   We seriously question whether a period with artificiality on half of days, or even 29% of days, may be fairly characterized as a \"clean\" period. As an initial matter, this defense is plainly inconsistent with Exchange plaintiffs' theory of the case, which does not extensively allege manipulation between 2000 and 2004. But even had Exchange plaintiffs done so, the reliability of Dr. Seyhun's regressions-ultimately intended to gauge the relationship between LIBOR and ICAP-Ask absent the defendants' challenged conduct-would be seriously undermined by their incorporation of data pervasively affected by that very conduct.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fogarazzo v. Lehman Bros., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267814\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/263/90/\">\n    263 F.R.D. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105 &amp; n.124 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (expressing skepticism regarding an expert's use of control periods that had been affected by the defendants' challenged conduct). Moreover, this belated rationalization is belied by Dr. Seyhun's opinions. In offering his ICAP-Ask-based models of but-for LIBOR in his initial report, Dr. Seyhun specifically opined that \"\n   <em>\n    [b]y definition\n   </em>\n   , the estimation period should be free from manipulation\" and suggested that a clean period incorporating the period between May 18, 2010 and December 31, 2012 was inappropriate because \"there is some evidence that suggests that some manipulation may have continued into 2012 after the Class Period.\" (Seyhun Initial Report \u00b6 72, n.32 (emphasis added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Our confidence in the first ICAP-Ask-based model is further undermined by the fact that in addition to finding substantial artificiality between 2000 and 2004, it apparently finds no significant artificiality during Period 0. (Hubbard Initial Report\n   \u00b6 125, ex. 10.2.). That is, this model identifies significant LIBOR artificiality when Exchange plaintiffs have not alleged manipulation, and no significant LIBOR artificiality when they have so alleged. While sporadic findings of artificiality in clean periods may be attributable to statistical noise, this exactly-backwards relationship suggests either an unreliable model or a deeper flaw in Exchange plaintiffs' theory of the case. Because the Relative Artificiality and CDS Spread models of but-for LIBOR submissions are reliant on the first ICAP-Ask-based model's estimates of but-for LIBOR, the reliability of those models is necessarily called into question as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As to the Rebuttal Period 0 model, Exchange plaintiffs respond first that Dr. Seyhun's Rebuttal Period 0 model \"predicts artificiality [only] on days where there exists documented evidence that is consistent in direction with the model's prediction\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 11), and second that the Rebuttal Period 0 Model \"breaks up Period 0 into separate control and treatment periods\" based on \"documented evidence of TBM,\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs' first response is little more than definitional sleight-of-hand. Rabobank's contention is that the Rebuttal Period 0 model finds\n   <em>\n    mathematical\n   </em>\n   artificiality on 100% of days in Period 0-that is, the Rebuttal Period 0 model calculates a but-for LIBOR that is different from actual published LIBOR. By contrast, Exchange plaintiffs' response defines \"artificiality\" to mean mathematical artificiality supported by \"corroborating evidence\" based on Dr. Seyhun's assessment of documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   This terminological slipperiness is unavailing. In contending that Dr. Seyhun's models are in fact capable of identifying trader-based manipulation, Exchange plaintiffs argue that \"on days that documents do not show evidence of manipulation, the TBM Model finds positive\n   <em>\n    artificiality\n   </em>\n   only 51% of the time\" and \"negative\n   <em>\n    artificiality\n   </em>\n   only 49% of the time.\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 17 n.18 (emphasis added) (citing Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 493).) But this statement is wholly irreconcilable with their contention now that the Rebuttal Period 0 \"predicts artificiality [only] on days where there exists documented evidence that is consistent in direction with the model's prediction.\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 11.) Accepting this latter statement as true, then on days where no documents show evidence of manipulation, the TBM Model should find positive artificiality 0% of the time and negative artificiality 0% of the time. But it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Ultimately, Dr. Seyhun's Rebuttal Period 0 Model finds mathematical artificiality on 100% of days in Period 0, and we conclude that this implausible finding of (mathematical) artificiality undermines the reliability of the Rebuttal Period 0 Model. Exchange plaintiffs' attempt to obfuscate this reality by shifting the definition of \"artificiality\" to include a requirement of documentary corroboration does not affect our conclusion regarding the unreliability of Dr. Seyhun's methodology. Indeed, accepting this revised definition of \"artificiality,\" Dr. Seyhun's models would be wholly incapable of identifying instances of TBM-caused artificiality. The documentary corroboration requirement becomes the only filter separating true \"artificiality\" from the mathematical artificiality identified by the Rebuttal Period 0 Model on 100% of days in Period 0, even though the days may otherwise be difficult to distinguish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exchange plaintiffs' dual contentions-that\n   the Rebuttal Period 0 model is capable of identifying trader-based manipulation independent of documentary evidence on the one hand (based on its findings of mathematical artificiality) but that the Rebuttal Period 0 model does not identify artificiality on 100% of days in Period 0 (because it requires documentary evidence)-cannot be reconciled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Nor do we find much comfort in Exchange plaintiffs' assurances that Dr. Seyhun's Rebuttal Period 0 model finds positive (mathematical) artificiality on 71% of days with documentary evidence of upward manipulation and finds negative (mathematical) artificiality on 75% of days with documentary evidence of downward manipulation. (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 17 n.18.) Rephrasing slightly, this contention acknowledges that even on days for which Dr. Seyhun has already identified documentary evidence of manipulation, the Rebuttal Period 0 model has an error rate between 25% and 29%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs' second response, that the Rebuttal Period 0 model in fact divides Period 0 into a control period and a treatment period, is difficult to evaluate based on Dr. Seyhun's report, and Rabobank disputes whether Dr. Seyhun based his regressions only on days without evidence of trader-based manipulation. If Dr. Seyhun did in fact separate days in Period 0 with documentary evidence of trader-based manipulation from days without such evidence and used only the latter as a control period as plaintiffs assert, his report is conspicuously devoid of any indication to that effect. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report 487-94.) Nonetheless, we accept counsel's representation at oral argument that Dr. Seyhun did so separate (Hr'g Tr. 5:2-6:8), and conclude that this second defense is also unpersuasive. Regressions relying on piecemeal clean periods have been described as \"unorthodox,\" and at least one court has noted that the selection of a clean period wholly independent of periods involving challenged conduct is recommended practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fogarazzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267814\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/263/90/\">\n    263 F.R.D. at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, this choice of clean period becomes especially difficult to justify given that Exchange plaintiffs assert that there likely exist additional instances of trader-based manipulation in Period 0 that could be identified through additional discovery, which would taint days in the clean period-a point acknowledged by counsel at oral argument. (Hr'g Tr. 6:3-9; Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.1.3.

For instance, they suggest, if on a given day, one bank manipulated its submission downward and two banks manipulated their submissions upward, but only documentary evidence of the first bank's manipulation were available, Dr. Seyhun's models could correctly show\n   <em>\n    upward\n   </em>\n   manipulation in LIBOR even though such a result would be seemingly inconsistent with the available documentary evidence (of only the first bank's\n   <em>\n    downward\n   </em>\n   manipulation).

Seyhun Opp'n 13 n.13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The possibility of undiscovered instances of manipulation explains away little of the inconsistency between Dr. Seyhun and Dr. Netz, as further documentary evidence of manipulation by additional banks cannot explain away directional inconsistency between documentary evidence of trader-based manipulation by one bank as identified by Dr. Netz (and as alleged by Exchange plaintiffs) and artificiality in that bank's LIBOR\n   <em>\n    submissions\n   </em>\n   as calculated by Dr. Seyhun's models. Accordingly, to the extent artificiality in LIBOR as calculated by Dr. Seyhun's models shares the same direction as artificiality in LIBOR submissions, inconsistency between Dr. Netz's findings (and Exchange plaintiffs' allegations) and the former implies inconsistency between Dr. Netz's findings and the latter as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Under Dr. Seyhun's Relative Artificiality model, the direction of artificiality in each bank's LIBOR submissions will generally be the same as the direction of artificiality in overall published LIBOR. Indeed, when a bank's LIBOR submission is within the interquartile range and is therefore retained in calculating LIBOR, Dr. Seyhun's Relative Artificiality model will find artificiality in the bank's LIBOR submission identical in both direction and magnitude to artificiality in LIBOR. Similarly, under the CDS Spread Model of Rabobank's but-for LIBOR submissions, Dr. Seyhun generally finds that Rabobank manipulated its submissions upward throughout Period 0. Figure 1F13 in the Seyhun Initial Report, displaying the CDS Spread Model's results for Rabobank, generally shows Rabobank's actual LIBOR submissions to be above Rabobank's but-for LIBOR submissions during Period 0. By contrast, of the 32 instances of TBM identified by Dr. Netz associated with Rabobank, she finds that only 17 (or 53%) involved upward manipulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Netz Initial\n   Report ex. 1; Netz Rebuttal Report ex. 26.) That is, Dr. Netz reaches an inconsistent conclusion on 47% of days. Further, Dr. Seyhun acknowledges inconsistency between the direction of artificiality in a bank's LIBOR submissions suggested by documentary evidence-also the basis for Dr. Netz's opinions-and the direction of artificiality calculated by the Rebuttal Period 0 Model: two of the exhibits in the Seyhun Rebuttal Report identify only \"Documented Trader Manipulation Events Consistent with [the Rebuttal] Period 0 Model,\" suggesting the exclusion of inconsistent events. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 493, exs. 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   In sum, none of these inconsistencies between Dr. Seyhun's various models of but-for LIBOR submissions and Dr. Netz's document-based identification of manipulation can be explained away by the specter of additional documentary evidence of manipulation by additional panel banks. Accordingly, these inconsistencies further erode our confidence in the reliability of Dr. Seyhun's models.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.1.4. Inclusion of 2013 in Clean Periods\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Rabobank argues that Dr. Seyhun's inclusion of 2013 in his clean periods is improper cherry-picking, as the ICAP-Ask-based models of but-for LIBOR show no statistically significant artificiality during Period 0 when 2013 is removed from the clean period. The inclusion of 2013 is problematic, Rabobank argues, because the relationship between published LIBOR and ICAP-Ask differs between the two discontinuous pieces of Dr. Seyhun's clean periods-the spread averages 2.7 basis points between 2000 and 2004, but averages\n   <em>\n    negative\n   </em>\n   1.4 basis points in 2013 (Rabobank Seyhun Mem. 13; Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6 115, ex. 7.1)-and because the ICAP-Ask rate in 2013 exhibits data-quality problems in that it remains entirely unchanged for more than eight consecutive months. (Rabobank Seyhun Reply 3 n.8; Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6 116, ex. 8.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs admit that the spread between LIBOR and the ICAP-Ask rate in 2000-2004 (and 2000-2002) differs from the spread in 2013, do not dispute the ICAP-Ask data-quality issue, and do not appear to dispute Dr. Hubbard's findings that the Initial ICAP-Ask models identify no statistically significant artificiality when 2013 is removed from the respective clean periods. (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 14-15). Rather, they argue that the difference in spread is \"inconsequential\" because the spread is \"absorbed\" into the intercept term of Dr. Seyhun's regressions. (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 15; Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 463.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   This contention is unavailing. In assessing the relationship of LIBOR and the 3-month ICAP-Ask rate, Dr. Seyhun conducts an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   specified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   LIBOR = a +\n   <em>\n    \u00df.\n   </em>\n   - (ICAP-Ask) +\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   (Seyhun Report tbl.2.2.) In an OLS regression of this form, a represents the intercept,\n   <em>\n    \u00df\n   </em>\n   represents the coefficient capturing the relationship between ICAP-Ask and LIBOR, and e represents the error term. In turn,\n   <em>\n    \u00df\n   </em>\n   is calculated as (1) the covariance of dependent variable (LIBOR) and the single explanatory variable (ICAP-Ask), divided by (2) the variance of the explanatory variable (ICAP-Ask). The intercept term, a, is then calculated as the mean of the dependent variable (LIBOR) minus the product of the coefficient\n   <em>\n    \u00df\n   </em>\n   and the mean of explanatory variable (ICAP-Ask). The different absolute relationship between LIBOR and ICAP-Ask in 2000-2004 and in 2013 will affect the covariance of the two series, which in turn impacts the calculated beta. Exchange plaintiffs\n   are correct in that a is also impacted by this difference in spread, since a is, in part, a function of \u00df. Nonetheless, unless\n   <em>\n    \u00df\n   </em>\n   equals exactly 1, the spread between LIBOR and ICAP-Ask will never be differenced out in its entirety. That is, not only is the changing spread\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   entirely accounted for by the intercept term, the reason it is not so \"absorbed\" is because the changing spread impacts \u00df, the estimate of how much but-for LIBOR should change given a change in the ICAP-Ask rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   That is, we know that the inclusion of 2013 in Dr. Seyhun's clean periods is a significant driver of his results, even though the inclusion of 2013 in the clean periods not only introduces a significant data-quality issue but also introduces a qualitatively different relationship between ICAP-Ask and published LIBOR, a difference that is only partially absorbed into the intercept term. Absent an affirmative justification for adding 2013 to the clean periods and a more robust explanation for why such an addition does not skew the results, we conclude that Dr. Seyhun's inclusion of 2013 strongly suggests cherry-picking and renders the ICAP-Ask-based models of but-for LIBOR (and the Relative Artificiality and CDS Spread models of but-for LIBOR submissions) unreliable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.2. Effect of Changes in LIBOR on EDF Prices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Dr. Seyhun opines that \"statistical regression or other mathematical analyses\" are available to show that \"artificial LIBOR\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   Eurodollar futures (and options) contract prices to be artificial,\" and that further analyses are available to \"estimate the approximate amounts of such artificiality.\" (Seyhun Initial Report \u00b6 12.b (emphasis added).) Dr. Seyhun bases this opinion on numerous regression models, from which he derives a number of \"impact factors\" that purport to measure, on a daily basis, how a change in LIBOR would have been reflected in EDF prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Across his two reports, Dr. Seyhun calculates 31 different values representing the \"impact\" of a change in 3-month LIBOR on each of the 44 Eurodollar contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange: 10 in his initial report and 21 in his rebuttal report. (Seyhun Initial Report tbls.5, 10.2; Seyhun Rebuttal Report tbls.3, 6, 9, 12.) Dr. Seyhun also calculates corresponding sets of impact factors for changes in 1-month LIBOR and 6-month LIBOR. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Seyhun Rebuttal Report tbls.2, 4.) However, because Dr. Seyhun focuses his opinions on measuring the effect of changes in 3-month LIBOR, we so focus as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Broadly speaking, these 31 models vary in three primary ways: (1) whether the 3-month LIBOR series is contemporaneous or shifted backwards by one day (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , for each day, using the change in LIBOR between the day in question and the day\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   , rather than the change in LIBOR from the day before to the day in question); (2) whether changes in the implied 3-month forward rate are included as explanatory variables; (3) whether, and how many, lags of explanatory variables are used.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Initial Report Table 5 presents the results of three models, each using shifted LIBOR and\n   <em>\n    omitting\n   </em>\n   as an explanatory variable changes in the implied 3-month forward rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first model regresses changes in EDF prices on changes in LIBOR, with no lags. The second model regresses changes in EDF prices on lagged changes in EDF prices and changes and lagged changes in LIBOR, using the number of lags suggested by the Bayesian information criterion. The third model is like the second model, but uses the number of lags suggested by the Akaike information criterion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Initial Report Table 10.2 presents the results of seven models, each using next-day LIBOR and including as an explanatory variable changes in the implied 3-month forward rate. Each model regresses changes in EDF prices on lagged changes in EDF prices, changes and lagged changes in 3-month LIBOR, and changes and lagged changes in the implied 3-month forward rate. The number of lags varies from 0 to 6, with one model for each number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Dr. Seyhun's rebuttal report introduces 21 models intended to supersede, at least in part, the 10 models presented in his initial report. Rebuttal Report Table 3 presents the results of four models, three of which use the same regression specification as the three models presented in Initial Report Table 5. However, the results here differ from those presented in the Initial Report Table 5 because Dr. Seyhun has corrected the data processing error attributable to \"rollover\" days made in his initial report. By contrast, the fourth model regresses changes in EDF prices on changes in today's LIBOR and changes in next-day LIBOR. Dr. Seyhun uses the impact factors produced by one of these models for his damages estimates, though he does not specify which one. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 86.) Rebuttal Report Table 6 presents the results of seven models, specified exactly as the seven models reported in Initial Report Table 10.2 (including the use of next-day LIBOR). As with the relationship between Rebuttal Report Table 3 and Initial Report Table 5, the results here differ from those presented in the corresponding Initial Report Table 10.2 because Dr. Seyhun has corrected the data processing error attributable to \"rollover\" days. Rebuttal Report Table 9 presents the results of three models, specified identically to Initial Report Table 5, but using contemporaneous LIBOR rather than next-day LIBOR and correcting the data-processing error. Similarly, Rebuttal Report Table 12 presents the results of seven models, specified identically to Initial Report Table 10.2 (and Rebuttal Report Table 6), but also using contemporaneous LIBOR and correcting the data-processing error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Rabobank offers several criticisms of these models: (1) that they cannot be properly interpreted to support causation; (2) that they fail to account for intraday movements in EDF prices; (3) that they fail to account minimum price increments in\n   EDF prices; and (4) that they are contradicted by Dr. Culp's findings that EDF prices exhibit little reaction when LIBOR is published.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.2.1. Correlation, Not Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Rabobank and Exchange plaintiffs primarily dispute whether Dr. Seyhun's models can be properly interpreted to suggest that changes in LIBOR\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   determinable changes in EDF prices\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   -Dr. Seyhun's ultimate opinion for which he relies on these models.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   As to the 11 models relying on shifted (next-day) LIBOR, which, according to Dr. Seyhun, establishes that changes in\n   <em>\n    tomorrow\n   </em>\n   's LIBOR cause changes in EDF prices\n   <em>\n    today\n   </em>\n   , we reject them as unreliable at the threshold. The causal relationship purportedly supported by these regressions defies common sense: needless to say, a phenomenon must precede any effects that it causes, and Exchange plaintiffs offer no remotely cogent theory as to how changes in LIBOR manage to travel backward in time in order to affect EDF prices in the past.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Seyhun acknowledges this feature of his models, but contends that his methodology is proper because next-day LIBOR better incorporates \"any economic event that happens during most of the U.S. business hours\" and \"U.S. business developments.\" (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 84; Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n \u00b6 20.) That is, Dr. Seyhun asserts, using next-day LIBOR \"captures the fact that Eurodollar futures prices can at times react earlier to interest-rate sensitive information before LIBOR actually changes.\" (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 87.) In offering these defenses of Dr. Seyhun's models, Exchange plaintiffs have apparently lost sight of the ultimate proposition that Dr. Seyhun set out to prove: that changes in LIBOR\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   determinable changes in EDF prices. Exchange plaintiffs' references to \"economic events,\" \"business developments,\" and \"interest-rate sensitive information\" admit only one fair interpretation: namely, as a concession that those events, those developments, and that information confound the relationship between LIBOR and EDF prices presented in Dr. Seyhun's models, which offer no means of distinguishing changes in EDF prices caused by changes in LIBOR from other conditions causing changes in both EDF prices and LIBOR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   These confounding variables loom large, too, over Dr. Seyhun's remaining models relying on contemporaneous LIBOR. The\n   fact that these models do not rely on the assumption that changes in LIBOR have retrospective effect does not remedy the more glaring error that Rabobank has identified and that Exchange plaintiffs have conceded. Because Dr. Seyhun's models offer no means of controlling for the effects of economic events and business developments, we conclude that they cannot reliably support Dr. Seyhun's causation opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff v.

Dr. Seyhun's contemporaneous LIBOR models cannot support his opinions regarding causation, as Exchange plaintiffs concede (and, curiously, emphasize) that LIBOR and EDF prices are each driven by business developments and economic events (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 20; Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 84), and Dr. Seyhun's models offer no means of separating changes in EDF prices caused by those events rather than by changes in LIBOR. Dr. Seyhun's next-day LIBOR models fare even worse, not only suffering from the same confounding variable problem but also relying on the unfounded assumption that a change in LIBOR one day can effect changes in EDF prices in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.2.2. Intraday Variations in Price\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Rabobank next argues that Dr. Seyhun's models fail to analyze intraday EDF data, opting instead to rely on the daily settlement prices calculated each day at 2:00 p.m. Chicago time. This method is unreliable, Rabobank contends, because it relies upon the unfounded assumption that any artificiality in LIBOR has an impact of constant magnitude over the 23 hours per day during which EDFs are traded. (Rabobank Seyhun Mem. 21-22.) Exchange plaintiffs respond that no analysis of intraday EDF data is necessary \"because there is a single LIBOR fix per day and a single LIBOR artificiality per day,\" and consideration of intraday measurements would be \"futile for purposes of demonstrating the impact of LIBOR on EDF prices.\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Notably, Exchange plaintiffs do not dispute that Rabobank's assertion that Dr. Seyhun's decision to conduct his analysis at a daily level incorporates the assumption that LIBOR artificiality has a single, constant amount of impact on EDF prices over a given trading day. But this assumption is inconsistent with Dr. Seyhun's assertions that EDFs \"trade in efficient markets and react to all relevant information in a timely and complete manner,\" (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 124), and Exchange plaintiffs' assertion that \"EDF prices continually incorporate all fundamental information\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 22). And indeed, intraday variations in EDF pricing are of particular relevance to this action. Unlike, for example, the OTC or Lender plaintiffs, whose LIBOR-based instruments are pegged to LIBOR and reset on a periodic basis using published LIBOR on a given day, EDF traders' exposure to changes in LIBOR, even under Exchange plaintiffs' theory, was less periodic and less consistent. The record establishes that named plaintiffs actively opened and closed EDF positions within a single day (Ordover Initial Report sec. VIII), and Exchange plaintiffs themselves have acknowledged that these \"in-and-out\" traders make up a large proportion of the putative class (Nov. 1, 2017 Hr'g Tr., 12:24-13:11, ECF No. 2341).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Given the importance of intraday trading in assessing the impact of LIBOR artificiality on EDF traders, Dr. Seyhun's failure to account for intraday variation in EDF prices further undermines the reliability of his ultimate opinion that statistical methods are available to determine that impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.2.3. Minimum Price Increments (\"Tick\" Size)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Rabobank further criticizes Dr. Seyhun's model for failing to incorporate \"ticks,\" or the minimum price increments in which EDF contracts trade. Under Rabobank's theory, the impact of trader-based manipulation on published LIBOR was often less than one tick in magnitude, and such a small extent of impact will not move EDF prices by one \"tick\" even assuming some causal relationship flowing from LIBOR to EDF prices. Therefore, Rabobank argues, Dr. Seyhun's model is further flawed for this failure to incorporate minimum tick sizes. (Rabobank Seyhun Mem. 22-23.) Exchange plaintiffs respond that Dr. Seyhun has in fact offered a formula to account for minimum price increments, and that Dr. Seyhun's failure to incorporate that formula into his models is of \"no consequence\" because \"it involves a logical rather than an empirical argument.\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs are correct to the limited extent that Dr. Seyhun has indeed offered a formula regarding tick sizes. This formula is, however, wholly unhelpful: Dr. Seyhun opines that the\n   <em>\n    probability\n   </em>\n   that LIBOR artificiality affected EDF prices is equal to the amount of LIBOR artificiality divided by the tick size for the EDF contract in question. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 216.) But knowing that EDF prices will be affected, on average, a certain percentage of the time is insufficient; the operative question for class certification purposes is determining which prices were affected and which prices were not. That is, we are ultimately interested in the\n   <em>\n    empirical\n   </em>\n   question of how much EDF prices were affected by artificiality in LIBOR; knowing that EDF prices may or may not, as a matter of logic, have been impacted a certain percentage of the time is not responsive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs attempt to minimize the importance of tick sizes, reasoning that \"[t]he minimum tick size will either nullify the effect of LIBOR artificiality on that day, or amplify it, based on the tipping point of the minimum tick size.\" (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 23.) We agree with this analysis of the impact of minimum tick sizes; indeed, it is the root of our concern regarding Dr. Seyhun's failure to consider tick sizes: the difference between amplification or nullification of LIBOR artificiality,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , some impact or\n   <em>\n    no impact whatsoever\n   </em>\n   , is difficult to overstate. Knowing which of the two will occur is of critical importance in assessing the impact of LIBOR manipulation on EDF prices, and Dr. Seyhun's models offer no aid in making that assessment. While we could conceive of an additional rounding step that could be incorporated into Dr. Seyhun's models, it is Exchange plaintiffs' responsibility, and not ours, to provide models that are sufficiently complete so as to be reliable and helpful to the factfinder. Dr. Seyhun's failure to do so further supports the exclusion of his opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.3. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Rabobank's motion to exclude Dr. Seyhun's opinions is granted. Dr. Seyhun's ultimate opinions, that classwide methods are available to determine the existence and extent of LIBOR manipulation and to determine the impact of that manipulation on EDF prices, are unreliable. The numerous models that Dr. Seyhun proposes are inadequate to support this conclusion, as Exchange plaintiffs have not established that those models are themselves reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Because Dr. Seyhun's opinions regarding damages rely on his opinions regarding the determination of LIBOR manipulation and resulting impact on EDF prices, we conclude that those opinions should be excluded as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Dr. Seyhun's multitude of models of artificiality in LIBOR and LIBOR submissions are rife with inconsistencies: they are internally inconsistent, they are inconsistent with Dr. Netz's opinions, and they are inconsistent with Exchange plaintiffs' own allegations of trader-based manipulation. Dr. Seyhun's models of changes in EDF prices caused by changes in LIBOR, though greater in number, are no more reliable, as they are not only incapable of separating the effect of macroeconomic events but also incapable of actually determining when EDF prices would have changed in light of minimum price increments. We have previously questioned whether plaintiffs would \"be able to show that LIBOR suppression of a particular amount would have caused a corresponding, determinable change in [EDF] trading prices,\"\n   <em>\n    LIBOR VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207378980\">\n    2016 WL 7378980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22, slip op. at *59, and nothing in Dr. Seyhun's reports causes us to reconsider that skepticism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2. Dr. Netz\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs present two reports from Dr. Janet Netz: (1) an initial report dated February 2, 2017 (Decl. of Thomas Elrod ex. 1, July 21, 2017, ECF No. 2121); and (2) a rebuttal report dated May 3, 2017 (Decl. of Thomas Elrod ex. 2, July 21, 2017, ECF No. 2121). We refer to these as the Netz Initial Report and the Netz Rebuttal Report. In her reports, Dr. Netz offers: (1) a number of opinions derived from her review of communications between traders; (2) the opinion that manipulation in LIBOR submissions impacted published LIBOR; (3) the opinion that changes in LIBOR cause calculable changes in prices of EDF contracts and options; and (4) a number of opinions regarding the calculation of damages. Based on Dr. Netz's credentials,\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude that she is generally qualified to offer opinions of this type. We accordingly reject Rabobank's challenges to Dr. Netz's expert qualifications, but address them specifically in assessing Dr. Netz's specific opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2.1. Opinions Based on Trader Communications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Dr. Netz devotes a substantial portion of her reports to analyzing documentary evidence of communications between traders, LIBOR submitters, and other individuals affiliated with panel banks. Relying on her interpretation of these documents, Dr. Netz opines that (1) panel banks manipulated their LIBOR submissions; (2) these manipulated LIBOR submissions impacted published LIBOR; (3) panel banks believed that LIBOR manipulation would affect EDF prices. In reaching these opinions, Dr. Netz also concludes that review of documentary evidence \"is a common, class-wide method using common evidence that can prove liability.\" (Netz Rebuttal Report 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   At the outset, we note that Exchange plaintiffs and Rabobank dispute the scope of Dr. Netz's opinions. Rabobank asserts that Dr. Netz concludes that certain challenged conduct in fact occurred, and Exchange\n   plaintiffs respond that Dr. Netz \"does not opine that Defendants engaged in trader-based conduct or colluded in doing so,\" but rather opines only that \"documents consistent with those allegations are available, and are common to the class.\" (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 8 (emphasis omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Dr. Netz's opinions simply are not limited in the way Exchange plaintiffs suggest. The Netz Initial Report contains numerous conclusions that, based on her review of trader communications, certain challenged conduct in fact occurred and Exchange plaintiffs were in fact impacted. For example, Dr. Netz opines that \"[t]he discovery record shows that Defendants manipulated their LIBOR submissions in ways that were inconsistent with the reporting rules established by the BBA,\" that \"Defendants engaged in coordinated trader-based manipulation,\" and that \"Defendants engaged in suppression manipulation.\" (Netz Initial Report 13, 18, 20.) While Dr. Netz later opines on the availability and applicability of common evidence, for example that \"[l]iability can be proven using common, class-wide methods based on common evidence,\" (Netz Rebuttal Report 4), these subsequent opinions do not supersede her earlier opinions. We consider different aspects of Dr. Netz's opinions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   To the extent Dr. Netz offers her interpretation of trader communications to conclude that manipulation in fact occurred, these opinions are not based on Dr. Netz's \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\" as required by Rule 702(a). While Exchange plaintiffs correctly suggest that an expert's testimony may be permissible, for example, \"to translate esoteric terminology,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mejia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858451\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/179/#p190\">\n    545 F.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190 (2d Cir. 2008), the trader communications that Dr. Netz interprets are clear on their face and \"address issues of fact that [the trier of fact] is capable of understanding without the aid of expert testimony,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Longtop Fin.

Our concern is heightened here, as Dr. Netz offers no explanation of how the communications that she reviewed were selected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Similarly, to the extent Dr. Netz interprets trader communications to opine on the traders' actual motives and states of mind, these opinions are impermissible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Highland Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Schneider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8935591\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/379/461/#p469\">\n    379 F.Supp.2d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469-70 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Rezulin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274750\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/531/#p559\">\n    309 F.Supp.2d at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While she may opine on traders and LIBOR submitters' economic incentives as a general matter, those opinions may not extend to the traders and submitters' specific states of mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Finally, to the extent that Dr. Netz opines on the existence of documents, these opinions are also excluded. The general proposition that some documents may pertain to all class members is obvious and not insightful, and Exchange plaintiffs offer no explanation why someone with Dr. Netz's expertise and qualifications is needed to offer it. At class certification, the operative question is whether LIBOR manipulation, once established through documents or other evidence, will pertain to all class members; the issue at this stage is not whether those documents exist. Indeed, Exchange plaintiffs offer no authority\n   supporting their position that the \"existence [of documents and data regarding defendants' conduct] is an appropriate topic for the opinion of Plaintiffs' expert on class certification,\" (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 7), and we find none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Dr. Netz's opinions that documents exist establishing certain elements of liability, when properly understood, are opinions on the merits that are irrelevant at the class certification stage. An economic expert at class certification may permissibly opine that event\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   -as established through documents or otherwise-has an economic effect that is common to all class members. But she may not opine that event\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   in fact occurred, which remains for the trier of fact to determine. Even when such an opinion is formulated as \"evidence exists establishing that event\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   occurred,\" it is no more relevant at class certification and is no more admissible than a direct opinion on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Further, even if these opinions were offered at the merits stage, the latter formulation would be no less invasive of the province of the trier of fact. And as a corollary, it would be no more admissible at that stage, either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tourre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928366\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/950/666/#p675\">\n    950 F.Supp.2d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Expert testimony may not usurp the province of the judge to instruct on the law, or of the jury to make factual determinations.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, even accepting Exchange plaintiffs' characterization that Dr. Netz \"opine[s] on whether documents exist that could prove [their] allegation[s] on a common basis,\" (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 12), her opinions to that effect remain inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   In sum, we conclude that Dr. Netz's opinions interpreting documents and commenting on their existence are not admissible. Of course, this holding regarding Dr. Netz's opinions derived from her review of trader communications does not, by itself, preclude her from opining that manipulation of LIBOR submissions impacted LIBOR in a way common to all class members, or from opining that changes in LIBOR impacted EDF prices in a way common to all class members. We next consider whether those opinions are inadmissible for other reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2.2. Effect of Manipulation on LIBOR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Dr. Netz subsequently opines that \"manipulated LIBOR submissions affected published LIBOR.\" (Netz Initial Report 29.) As to trader-based manipulation, Dr. Netz first identifies, by reviewing documentary evidence, 163 instances of alleged trader-based manipulation. Dr. Netz determines that in 111 of those instances, the manipulated submission could have affected published LIBOR once the BBA's trimming methodology is considered. In turn, for each of those 111 instances, Dr. Netz assumes that, in the absence of manipulation, the panel bank in question would have made as its LIBOR submission the median submission reported by all panel banks on that day, and concludes that the replacement of a manipulated submission with the median submission would have affected published LIBOR on 65 of those days. Dr. Netz then highlights three specific examples (from the 65 days identified through her documentary analysis), examines the range of LIBOR submissions made on those dates, and explains how the alleged manipulation could have impacted published LIBOR. (Netz Initial Report 29-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Rabobank contends that these opinions are inadmissible because they are not reliable\n   and not helpful to the trier of fact. Specifically, Rabobank asserts that Dr. Netz's analysis is unreliable because it is based on the \"arbitrary and speculative assumption\" that a panel bank would have submitted the median of all banks' submissions absent trader-based manipulation. (Rabobank Netz Mem. 12.) In opposition, Exchange plaintiffs respond that Dr. Netz's analysis is probative of the \"hotly contested\" question of whether trader-based manipulation of one bank's submission could have affected published LIBOR, given the trimming of submissions outside the interquartile range. (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 13-14.) Rabobank implicitly concedes that whether a single bank's LIBOR submissions could have impacted published LIBOR is a germane question, but disputes Exchange plaintiffs' characterization of the issue as \"hotly contested\" based on the consistency between Dr. Netz's and Dr. Hubbard's opinions on the issue. (Rabobank Netz Reply 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   We cannot conclude, as Rabobank urges, that Dr. Netz's opinions in this realm are entirely unhelpful. The ability to impact the market, the existence of artificial prices, and the defendant's causation of those prices are elements of a CEA claim,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LIBOR I\n   </em>\n   , 935 F.Supp.2d at 713 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Platinum &amp; Palladium Commodities Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3985550\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/828/588/#p598\">\n    828 F.Supp.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 598 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), and the question of whether its submissions could impact published LIBOR is therefore \"a fact in issue,\" Fed. R. Evid. 702(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   We find little merit in Rabobank's contention that Dr. Netz's opinion here is irrelevant because she and Dr. Hubbard reach the same conclusion: that Rabobank could have impacted 3-month LIBOR on 46% of days in Period 0. The parties' agreement means that the issue is not as \"hotly contested\" as Exchange plaintiffs suggest, but does not render evidence directed to that fact irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Old Chief v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p179\">\n    519 U.S. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p179\">\n    117 S.Ct. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p179\">\n    136 L.Ed.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (\"The fact to which the evidence is directed need not be in dispute.\" (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 401 advisory committee's note)). Indeed, Rabobank's argument here is somewhat circular in that it relies on Dr. Netz's opinion, which it seeks to have excluded, to establish agreement on the point. The trimming methodology applied to LIBOR submissions in order to calculate published LIBOR introduces sufficient complexity such that Dr. Netz's analysis is at least somewhat helpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   We also reject Rabobank's argument that Dr. Netz's opinion is unreliable because her median-replacement methodology relies on unsupported assumptions. As Dr. Netz disclosed in her initial report, she \"do[es] not claim that the median LIBOR submission is necessarily the correct proxy for the but-for LIBOR submissions or that the LIBORs in Exhibit 2 are accurate measures of but-for LIBOR.\" (Netz Initial Report 29.) Rather, Dr. Netz opines that Rabobank's submissions could have impacted published LIBOR, which her median-replacement methodology is in fact capable of demonstrating.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the absence of any suggestion that she has implemented her methodology in an unreliable manner, we conclude that Dr. Netz's methodology is sufficiently reliable to support her opinion that Rabobank's submissions could impact published LIBOR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2.3. Effect of Changes in LIBOR on EDF Prices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Dr. Netz, like Dr. Seyhun, opines that changes in LIBOR would have affected the prices of EDF contracts and options in a determinable way, basing this opinion on an arbitrage theory, her interpretation of several communications between traders and LIBOR submitters, and a correlation analysis. (Netz Initial Report 32-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Rabobank contends at the threshold that Dr. Netz is unqualified to opine on the relationship between LIBOR and EDFs because her experience in economics broadly does not extend to the specific subject of EDFs and EDF trading. (Rabobank Netz Mem. 13-15.) Exchange plaintiffs' appeals to Dr. Netz's extensive experience in antitrust cases more broadly are not persuasive because the substance of the arbitrage theory that Dr. Netz propounds hardly resembles the issues of \"supply, demand, pricing, etc.\" at play in a more typical antitrust case (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 15); indeed, no antitrust claims remain in the Exchange plaintiffs' action at all. Nonetheless, we conclude that Dr. Netz's prior research into arbitrage-albeit in physical commodities markets-is sufficient to allow her to opine on the subject in her reports. Indeed, as an economist, Dr. Netz has sufficient training and experience in econometrics in order to conduct statistical testing of correlation and causation and to interpret the results of those tests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Turning to reliability, we consider the bases for Dr. Netz's causation opinion: interpretations of certain trader communications, an analysis of correlations between published LIBOR and EDF prices, Dr. Seyhun's analyses, and two academic papers analyzing the relationship between LIBOR and EDF prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   First, Dr. Netz interprets several communications between traders and LIBOR submitters to opine that \"traders and submitters understood that any changes to LIBOR would immediately and directly impact Eurodollar futures prices.\" (Netz Initial Report 36.) These opinions impermissibly go to the beliefs and states of mind of those traders and submitters, and are inadmissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Highland Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8935591\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/379/461/#p469\">\n    379 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   469-70 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Rezulin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274750\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/531/#p559\">\n    309 F.Supp.2d at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Second, Dr. Netz calculates the correlations between EDF prices and various tenors of LIBOR. (Netz Initial Report 36-37, ex. 3). From these correlations, her review of Dr. Seyhun's report, and two academic articles, Dr. Netz concludes that changes in LIBOR cause calculable changes in EDF prices. While correlations may be probative of causation in other circumstances, we conclude that they are not in this case: any correlation is confounded by the presence of macroeconomic events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.1.1.2.1. Exchange\n   plaintiffs argue that the presence of other factors impacting EDF prices \"does not mean that LIBOR's effect disappears in the wake of these other factors,\" (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 20), but Exchange plaintiffs have not sufficiently established that LIBOR has an effect as an initial matter and they offer no means of separating the effect of changes in LIBOR (if any) from that of other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Weaker still is Exchange plaintiffs' argument that parsing out \"macroeconomic factors affecting interest rates\" is unnecessary because they \"exist in both the real world and in the but-for world.\" (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 20.) As Dr. Netz and Dr. Seyhun both concede, those factors confound a relationship between LIBOR and EDF prices, and the failure to parse them out in assessing the difference between the real world and the but-for world is therefore likely to construct a but-for world that differs from the actual world in ways\n   <em>\n    other than the absence of alleged LIBOR manipulation\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Dr. Seyhun's causation opinions do not, as Exchange plaintiffs suggest, bolster Dr. Netz's causation opinions. (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 20.) To be sure, an expert may rely on the admissible opinions of another expert,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gussack Realty Co. v. Xerox Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11235817\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/85/#p94\">\n    224 F.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94-95 (2d Cir. 2000) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 703, but Dr. Netz is not entitled to rely on Dr. Seyhun's unreliable opinions for support. Indeed, Dr. Netz's opinions suffer from the same tick-size flaw in Dr. Seyhun's opinions: she similarly opines that she is able to determine the\n   <em>\n    probability\n   </em>\n   that EDF contract prices were impacted by changes in LIBOR, an opinion that is unhelpful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.1.1.2.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Nor do the two academic articles cited by Dr. Netz\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   support her causation opinion. We are dubious that Grinblatt and Jegadeesh's analysis of\n   <em>\n    weekly\n   </em>\n   changes in LIBOR and EDF prices supports Dr. Netz's opinions regarding daily causation given the specific timing issues discussed at length in Dr. Seyhun's and Dr. Culp's reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grinblatt &amp; Jegadeesh at 1516-19. Similarly, Fung and Leung's analysis examines actual Eurodollar rates observed in the market, not LIBOR,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fung &amp; Leung at 119 n.6 (referring to Eurodollar rate quotes corresponding to the end of the trading day in London), which has different implications for the viability of any arbitrage strategy and, by extension, the relationship between changes in LIBOR and changes in EDF prices (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Culp Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 353-61, Culp Rebuttal Report \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Absent further support, Dr. Netz's correlation analysis can show only that-correlation. Because Dr. Netz fails to bridge the analytical gulf between correlation and causation, her opinions that changes in LIBOR caused changes in EDF prices are excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2.4. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Finally, Dr. Netz offers several opinions regarding the calculation of damages: (1) that published LIBOR being lower than but-for LIBOR harmed class members who initiated or closed certain positions during different periods (Netz Initial Report 38-44); (2) that all class members were harmed because it is \"statistically improbable\" that EDF traders are unlikely to have \"benefited from or been unharmed by every single act of Defendants' LIBOR manipulation\" (Netz Initial Report 44-46); (3) that class members also suffered common harm in the form of the time-value of money in their margin accounts (Netz Initial Report 46-47), and that (4) damages can be calculated on a formulaic basis (Netz Initial Report 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   As a general matter, these opinions rely on Dr. Netz's earlier opinion that changes in LIBOR cause determinable changes in EDF prices and Dr. Seyhun's opinions to the same effect. Because we determine those opinions to be unreliable, Dr. Netz's derivative damages opinions are therefore insufficiently supported and are therefore inadmissible as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   We also make three further specific observations. First, the parties' dispute over Dr. Netz's opinion that almost all traders were \"harmed\" as a result of LIBOR manipulation is, in essence, a dispute over the proper interpretation of the term \"harmed.\" Exchange plaintiffs and Dr. Netz interpret \"harmed\" to mean \"have been negatively impacted at least once\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the trader paid too much money or received not enough money from a single EDF transaction), even if the trader benefited overall from alleged LIBOR manipulation. (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 22-23). Rabobank interprets \"harmed\" to mean a negative impact overall once all impacts of LIBOR manipulation have been taken into account. (Rabobank Netz Mem. 20-21). Given our conclusion that Dr. Netz's damages opinions are unreliable, we need not definitively resolve this question here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Second, Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on Mr. Miller's opinions to support Dr. Netz's statement that \"data could be obtained from traders themselves, their brokers (FCMs), or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\" is unavailing. (Exch. Pls.' Netz Opp'n 24-25.) Dr. Netz did not rely on Mr. Miller's opinions and instead based her opinion on her \"understanding that Eurodollar futures and options are transparent, public markets in which common practice and exchange and federal requirement[s] provide that customers for each transaction be identifiable.\" (Netz Initial Report 47 n.172.) We question whether Dr. Netz's expertise extends to a subject like the availability of trading records, and Mr. Miller's opinions provide no support because they are inadmissible as we discuss below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Third, we do not share Rabobank's certainty that Dr. Netz's opinions regarding time-value damages are entirely irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Helena Assocs., LLC v. EFCO Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 06 Civ. 861 (PKL),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202355811\">\n    2009 WL 2355811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.N.Y.

Dec. 19, 2002) (precluding a plaintiff \"from changing its damage theory nine years into this litigation\"). To the extent these damages may be taken into account, Dr. Netz's\n   opinions regarding time-value damages on the one hand and formulaic calculation on the other are in considerable tension: Dr. Netz does not opine that all EDF traders were subject to the same margin requirements, or that they all shared the same time-value of money. (Netz Initial Report 46-47.) Indeed, an assessment of each trader's margin requirements and personal discount rates appears to necessitate individualized inquiry and does not appear susceptible to formulaic calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2.5. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Rabobank's motion to exclude Dr. Netz's opinions is granted in part and denied in part. Dr. Netz's opinions derived from her review of trader communications are excluded, regardless of whether she opines that manipulation actually occurred or whether she opines that documents establishing manipulation are available. Dr. Netz's opinions that changes in LIBOR cause calculable changes in EDF prices are excluded based on the reasons discussed at length in our consideration of Dr. Seyhun's opinions, and her opinions regarding damages are excluded as well because they are reliant on her causation opinions. Dr. Netz's opinions regarding the impact of LIBOR submissions on published LIBOR, which address facts in issue, remain admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3. Mr. Beevers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs submit two reports from Mr. Craig Beevers: (1) an initial report dated February 2, 2017 (Decl. of David Kovel ex. A, July 10, 2017, ECF No. 2071); and (2) a rebuttal report dated May 3, 2017 (Decl. of David Kovel ex. B, July 10, 2017, ECF No. 2071). We refer to these as the Beevers Initial Report and the Beevers Rebuttal Report. In these two reports, Mr. Beevers offers several opinions across a number of subjects: (1) the adequacy of Rabobank's data productions; (2) a methodology for identifying trader-based manipulation; (3) a Monte Carlo analysis suggesting that panel banks engaged in collusive behavior; and (4) the frequency of alleged manipulation. We conclude that Mr. Beevers is generally qualified to offer these opinions based on his extensive experience in the financial industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.1. Data Adequacy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Mr. Beevers first offers a number of opinions regarding Rabobank's data productions. After providing an overview of trade reporting and risk reporting systems both generally and at Rabobank specifically (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 24-39), Mr. Beevers opines that Rabobank's data productions have been deficient in certain ways, (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 46-63), and that trader-level records should be produced because they are necessary to his methodology for identifying trader-based manipulation and the burden to defendants is low. (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 40-45, 64-72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.1.1. Discussion of Trade Reporting and Risk Reporting Systems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Mr. Beevers may address trade reporting and risk reporting in the financial industry generally. We agree with Exchange plaintiffs that his experience provides him with the requisite knowledge and qualifies him to so opine. He may not, however, interpolate these general opinions regarding the financial industry as a whole to Rabobank specifically. Mr. Beevers lacks knowledge as to what data Rabobank in fact possesses, a point that he\n   concedes and Exchange plaintiffs cannot seriously dispute. (Beevers Dep. 408:3-4, Decl. of Robert Lindholm ex. 73, July 7, 2017, ECF No. 2061). While we would view these Rabobank-specific opinions differently had they been anchored in specific legal or regulatory requirements, the fact that other banks possess certain data as a general matter says little about either (1) whether Rabobank ever had this data or (2) Rabobank has maintained this data until now. Therefore, Mr. Beevers's opinions are excluded to the extent they suggest that Rabobank in fact maintains certain reporting systems or possesses certain data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.1.2. Specific Data Deficiencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Mr. Beevers next opines that Rabobank's productions are deficient in four specific ways: (1) certain risk management reports are missing; (2) data files contain inconsistent formatting for date information; (3) inconsistent mapping information was provided; and (4) certain datasets appear to be incomplete and contain duplicates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Mr. Beevers's opinion that certain risk management reports are missing is not admissible for the reasons discussed above: Mr. Beevers lacks knowledge as to what data Rabobank in fact possesses (or possessed) and is forced to speculate as to the existence of those reports. This speculation is plain on the face of his opinions, suggesting, for example, that certain reports \"are routinely emailed to desk-wide or division-wide distribution lists on a periodic basis,\" and that he therefore \"believe[s] such reports\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   exist in Rabobank's email archive.\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 46-47 (emphasis added).) We find similarly speculative Mr. Beevers's contention that Rabobank did not produce all of its trade data because the number of trades appears \"to be too low by a factor of approximately two\" based solely on the opinion of unidentified \"experienced money market traders.\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   As to Mr. Beevers's remaining criticisms, each relies on the implicit assumption that Rabobank possessed immediately tractable data and should have produced it. Mr. Beevers identifies no basis for this assumption, and we find no authority for such a proposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the process of data cleansing and ensuring that data are tractable is not only a topic addressed extensively in the literature,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jonathan I. Maletic &amp; Andrian Marcus,\n   <em>\n    Data Cleansing: A Prelude to Knowledge Discovery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook\n   </em>\n   , (Oded Maimon &amp; Lior Rokach, eds. 2005) (\"Data entry and acquisition is inherently prone to errors, both simple and complex.\"), but is also a task performed by experts with regularity (including by Dr. Willig in this case (Willig Initial Report app. 4),\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    DL v.

Ohio 2014) (referencing an expert's discussion of \"the extent of each Defendant's\n   transactional data and the 'cleaning' steps [the expert] took to make the data usable\"). Indeed, Mr. Beevers's expectation appears particularly unrealistic here given the breadth of the data that he seeks and Rabobank's scale as an entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   We therefore conclude that Mr. Beevers's opinions purporting to identify specific deficiencies in Rabobank's data productions are speculative, and therefore inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.1.3. Production\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Finally, Mr. Beevers offers a number of opinions addressing whether certain trader-level data must be produced. He opines that trader-level records are \"required\" in order \"to analyze the impact of trader-based manipulation,\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6 64), and that this necessity outweighs the burden on defendants of making this production, (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 40-41). Therefore, Mr. Beevers concludes, \"data quality issues presented by Rabobank not only limit the depth and quality of analysis available to civil litigants, but likely substantially impeded regulatory investigations\" and that this poor quality \"dictates that Defendants should be required to remediate and supplement the productions to date.\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 41, 72.) These opinions are inadmissible both because they are irrelevant and because they offer legal conclusions (including on issues that we have already considered and adjudicated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   These opinions are irrelevant because Exchange plaintiffs need not identify all instances of trader-based manipulation at this stage. Exchange plaintiffs' defense of their relevance is incoherent: they simultaneously contend that Mr. Beevers must explain why he \"has not thus far been able to identify all instances of trader-based manipulation at Rabobank during Period 0\" on the one hand (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 8), and that \"Plaintiffs (through Mr. Beevers) are not required to identify all instances of trader-based manipulation at this stage\" on the other (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 11). Of course, if all instances of manipulation need not be identified at class certification, Mr. Beevers need not explain his failure to do so. Indeed, we highlight here Exchange plaintiffs' assertion that \"Mr. Beevers takes no position on\" the question of whether \"production of Defendants' trade data was necessary for purposes of Plaintiffs' class certification motion.\" (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 11 (emphasis omitted).) Accepting this concession, Mr. Beevers's opinions are plainly irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Further, these opinions amount to legal conclusions regarding the scope of discovery, one that impinges on our responsibility to assess whether the discovery being sought is \"proportional to the needs of the case.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). To the extent Mr. Beevers's opinions regarding additional production overlap with Exchange plaintiffs' prior motion to compel the production of certain trading records (Letter from Christopher Lovell &amp; David Kovel to the Court, Nov. 4, 2016, ECF No. 1636), those issues have already been resolved by our order denying that motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dec. 6, 2016 Order, ECF No. 1667, and Mr. Beevers's opinions are squarely precluded by that order. To the extent that Exchange plaintiffs rely on Mr. Beevers's opinions to request reconsideration of our order denying Exchange plaintiffs' motion to compel certain trading data, we reaffirm our conclusion that the burden of making available Exchange plaintiffs' requested production-data sufficient to establish trader positions for every single trader at Rabobank over the class period-is not proportional to the relevance and importance of that data,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   But even if these opinions extend to data not previously sought as Exchange plaintiffs suggest (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 11), that breadth does not change their fundamentally legal nature or their inadmissibility. To the extent that they rely on Mr. Beevers's opinions to so argue, we conclude that such a request is remarkably untimely. The class certification schedule for this case was established in February 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, Feb. 23, 2016, ECF No. 1327, and Exchange plaintiffs offer no explanation for why this information could not have been requested earlier. Rather, they have had more than ample time to seek additional discovery necessary for class-certification purposes, and cannot now complain of any insufficiency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Ultimately, this initial portion of Mr. Beevers's opinions reduces to the proposition that the data Rabobank has produced is not as tractable as he and Exchange plaintiffs would desire for class certification purposes. But Mr. Beevers is not permitted to offer a definition of completeness that is untethered from any concrete requirements (beyond his personal definition of what is \"necessary\") and then opine that Rabobank's productions fail to meet that wholly subjective standard. Even if these opinions are correct-and the record strongly suggests that at least some are not-they are irrelevant to our consideration of the Exchange plaintiffs' class certification motion. To the extent Exchange plaintiffs assert, relying on Mr. Beevers's expert opinions, that they were afforded insufficient class certification discovery, we reaffirm our decision to deny Exchange plaintiffs' motion to compel and further conclude that the time to litigate class-certification discovery issues has long ago passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.2. Identification of Trader-Based Manipulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   Next, Mr. Beevers offers a process for identifying trader-based manipulation, consisting of three different techniques: (1) identifying \"anomalous\" submissions based on certain mathematical criteria; (2) interpreting trader communications for \"corroborating evidence\" of manipulation; and (3) analyzing trader positions to see if LIBOR manipulation benefited particular traders. (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 73-87; Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 40-62.) Rabobank and Exchange plaintiffs dispute whether these three components of Mr. Beevers's methodology should be analyzed individually or together; Exchange plaintiffs contend that \"Rabobank improperly breaks up Mr. Beevers' methodology into three steps\" and suggest that the three components should not be analyzed separately. (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Mr. Beevers apparently disagrees with Exchange plaintiffs' argument. In responding to Dr. Hubbard's criticism that his methodology is dependent on review of trader communications, Mr. Beevers asserts that his \"anomalous submission\" criteria are sufficient to identify trader-based manipulation standing alone, as the subsequent steps merely \"corroborate\" the initial findings of anomalies. (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 57.) But even if Mr. Beevers's methodology were to consist of three steps to be considered together,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   requires as a matter of law that \"an expert's analysis be reliable at every step.\"\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p265\">\n    303 F.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"any step that renders the analysis unreliable under\n   the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors renders the expert's testimony inadmissible,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p265\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Paoli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528111\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/717/#p745\">\n    35 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   745 ), we analyze Mr. Beevers's three techniques individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.2.1. Anomalous Submissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   First, Mr. Beevers offers a two-part definition for what constitutes an \"anomalous\" submission. Under the first part, for a given bank and given tenor, a submission is considered anomalously high (or low) if three conditions are met: (1) the bank made a submission greater (or less) than published LIBOR; (2) the bank's submission is higher (or lower) than the submission made the prior day; and (3) compared to the prior day, the increase (or decrease) in the bank's submission was greater in magnitude than the corresponding change in published LIBOR. (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 47.) Under the second part, for a given bank and any two tenors, one or both submissions\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   are considered anomalous if two conditions are satisfied: (1) the bank increased its submission in one tenor compared to the day before and decreased the submission in the other tenor, and (2) such directionally dissimilar changes are observed for fewer than 25% of panel banks on the day in question. (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   We agree with Exchange plaintiffs to the limited extent they contend that an expert opinion need not have been peer reviewed and need not be generally accepted in the community in order to be admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"peer review\" is \"relevant, though not dispositive\" and rejecting the general acceptance standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Frye v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720199\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/293/1013/\">\n    293 F. 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1923) ). We agree with Rabobank, however, that Mr. Beevers's methodology for identifying anomalous submissions is insufficiently reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   As an initial matter, Mr. Beevers provides scant explanation for how this two-part definition for anomalous submissions was developed. Mr. Beevers's initial report simply defines \"anomalous\" in a footnote without further explanation. (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6 76 n.7.) Standing alone, this definition would be little more than Mr. Beevers's inadmissible\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   that the submissions in question were anomalous. Mr. Beevers's rebuttal report is slightly more detailed, explaining that his criteria are designed to capture instances where one bank \"has raised its submission from one day to the next by an inexplicably large amount\" and where changes across tenors cannot be explained by \"a general [yield] curve steepening or flattening,\" but the jump from this explanation to the specific mathematical criteria applied appears to be supported only by his\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   , which is insufficient. (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 45-54, n.16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   Indeed, it appears that the first part of the two-part definition would tend to find, for banks whose submissions were consistently above (or below) published LIBOR, anomalous submissions over periods when interest rates were consistently increasing (or decreasing), as the first two criteria would generally be satisfied. As to the second, Mr. Beevers does not explain whether one or both submissions are considered anomalous if the two criteria are satisfied. Accepting counsel's representation at oral argument that the determination of whether one or both submissions\n   are considered anomalous depends on further inquiry into the circumstances (Hr'g Tr. 16:15-19), Mr. Beevers's reports do not explain when both submissions are considered anomalous, when only one submission is considered anomalous, and if only one submission, which one of the two. Absent some explanation as to how these additional \"circumstances\" and \"facts\" are analyzed, and given the implementation error that Mr. Beevers has made in applying these criteria (Hubbard Rebuttal Report \u00b6 53 n.111), we cannot conclude this part of Mr. Beevers's methodology is sufficiently reliable such that it is admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   Our hesitation is confirmed by the nonsensical results produced by these criteria when they are applied to actual LIBOR submissions made outside of Period 0 and the but-for LIBOR submissions calculated by Dr. Seyhun. Specifically, Mr. Beevers's methodology characterizes as anomalous 27 percent of Rabobank's 3-month LIBOR submissions made between 2000 and 2002, and 19 percent of Rabobank's 3-month LIBOR submissions made in 2003 and 2004,\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   both of which are greater than the 17 percent identified during Period 0. (Hubbard Rebuttal Report \u00b6 58, ex. 29.) Exchange plaintiffs do not dispute these statistics, but assert that an evaluation of the results produced by Mr. Beevers's criteria is \"impermissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\" and that these results are not implausible because some evidence suggests that trader-based manipulation occurred as early as 2000. (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   But as we have discussed, methodology and results \"are not entirely distinct from one another,\"\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p265\">\n    303 F.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Joiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    522 U.S. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    118 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and indeed, Rabobank's robustness testing of Mr. Beevers's methodology relates directly to two of the reliability factors identified by the Supreme Court: whether a methodology \"can be (and has been) tested\" and a methodology's \"known or potential rate of error,\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 593-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the high rates of anomalous submissions between 2000 and 2004 identified by Mr. Beevers's methodology suggests that it was not well-tested and that it has a high potential rate of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs additionally respond that Rabobank engaged in trader-based manipulation as early as 2003 and that there is therefore no reason to expect Mr. Beevers's methodology to show zero instances of anomalous submissions during this time. But even assuming that Rabobank engaged in trader-based manipulation as early as 2003, Exchange plaintiffs offer no explanation for why, considering the three periods 2000-2002, 2003-2004, and Period 0, Mr. Beevers's analysis identifies the lowest rate of anomalous submissions in the third (17%) and the highest rate of anomalous submissions in the first (27%) when Exchange plaintiffs' allegations and proffered evidence of trader-based manipulation is strongest in the third and concededly nonexistent in the first. While sporadic findings of anomalous submissions prior to Period 0 might be considered indicia of only a minor flaw in Mr. Beevers's criteria, the substantial rates of anomalous submissions found prior to Period 0 and the exactly-backwards relationship between Mr. Beevers's findings of manipulation and Exchange plaintiffs' allegations suggest that Mr. Beevers's methodology has a high rate of error and is insufficiently reliable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   Similarly, Mr. Beevers's criteria characterize as anomalous a substantial percentage of the but-for LIBOR submissions calculated by Dr. Seyhun-that is, the submissions Dr. Seyhun contends that panel banks would have made\n   <em>\n    in the absence of LIBOR manipulation\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Mr. Beevers's methodology identifies as anomalous 5% to 35% of Rabobank's \"but-for\" LIBOR submissions calculated by Dr. Seyhun, depending on which of Dr. Seyhun's models is considered. Indeed, for two of Dr. Seyhun's models, Mr. Beevers's methodology finds more anomalies in Rabobank's but-for LIBOR submissions than in Rabobank's actual (allegedly manipulated) submissions. (Hubbard Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 70-72, ex. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   In response, Exchange plaintiffs assure us that any inconsistency does not bear on the reliability of Mr. Beevers's opinions because (1) the anomalous-submission definition is only the first step of Mr. Beevers's overall methodology and (2) any disagreement between Mr. Beevers and Dr. Seyhun need not be resolved now. (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 14-15). Though Exchange plaintiffs accuse Rabobank of making an \"illogical, apples-to-oranges comparison\" by comparing Mr. Beevers's \"anomalous submissions\" analysis to the results of Dr. Seyhun's methodology (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 15), Mr. Beevers himself asserts that his analysis is not necessarily reliant on subsequent steps, (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 57). And based on our previously expressed skepticism that the concept of a \"battle of the experts\" can extend to this extent of disagreement between a party's own experts, we conclude that poor performance of Mr. Beevers's anomalous-submission definition when applied to Dr. Seyhun's findings strongly suggests an untested methodology with an unacceptably high rate of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.2.2. Trader Communications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   Having identified submissions of interest based on his two two-part definition of \"anomalous submissions,\" Mr. Beevers next proposes to review various trader communications, including \"emails, instant message conversations, and recorded conversations.\" (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 11, 57.) We conclude this step is unreliable because it amounts to no methodology at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs assert that Mr. Beevers has in fact offered a methodology, \"part of which involves applying Mr. Beevers' vast experience and knowledge gained through his work in the dealing rooms of financial institutions.\" (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 15.) Such a vague methodology is not a methodology at all, and it is certainly not a methodology that can or has been tested or one with a known or potential rate of error. In the absence of some recognizable, describable methodology beyond an appeal to Mr. Beevers's qualifications, his opinions that certain documents \"clearly show\" manipulation whereas others do not (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 58) would be \"the essence of unverifiable subjectivity, amounting to the sort of\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   connection between methodology and conclusion\" that is properly excluded,\n   <em>\n    Nimely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969202\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/381/#p396\">\n    414 F.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.2.3. Individual Trader Positions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   At step three, Mr. Beevers proposes to \"consider the positions of individual traders on [each day with an anomalous submission] to see if there was a relationship between the profit motive (trader position such that a trader or group of traders would benefit from the anomalous submission) and the submission.\" (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 42.) Specifically, Mr. Beevers intends to undertake \"a comparison of which traders were long or short on each particular day with unusually high or low LIBOR submissions,\" with a \"high correlation\" between trader positions and anomalous LIBOR submissions serving as \"strong corroboration for manipulation.\" (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 55.) Mr. Beevers does not actually undertake such an analysis, asserting that \"the lack of reliable trader-level position data limits [his] ability\" to conduct it, but opines that doing so would be feasible once \"Defendants produce a complete set of accurate historical trading data for each day during the Class Period that identifies the relevant trader for each position.\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Rabobank contends that this step of Mr. Beevers's analysis is governed only by arbitrary criteria susceptible to cherry-picking, especially in light of Mr. Beevers's opinions that different traders within a single bank will often have different exposures to LIBOR (and therefore different profit motives) and in light of Mr. Beevers's failure to explain what he means by a \"relationship\" between traders' profit motive and a bank's LIBOR submission or what constitutes a \"high correlation.\" (Rabobank Beevers Mem. 11-12.) Exchange plaintiffs respond that Mr. Beevers intends to \"perform statistical analysis that would detect those traders who systematically benefit from Rabobank's LIBOR submissions over time,\" namely, significance testing of the relationship between a trader's positions and Rabobank's LIBOR submissions. (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   As an initial matter, we share Rabobank's skepticism as to whether Mr. Beevers's reports can be fairly interpreted to propose statistical testing. (Rabobank Beevers Reply 8.) The closest Mr. Beevers comes to setting forth any statistical test (which he would perform once he receives all the data he desires) is referencing a \"high correlation\" serving as \"strong corroboration for manipulation.\" (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   This lack of detail renders unpersuasive plaintiffs' defense of Mr. Beevers's opinions, even accepting plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   exegesis of his methodology. Mr. Beevers could have selected certain statistical tests to perform, discussed the data series to which he would have applied his selected tests (even if the series themselves have not yet been generated), identified what his null hypothesis would have been, and determined the level of statistical significance he would have demanded in order to reject the null hypothesis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   But he has\n   done none of those things, and his failure to do so makes examining the reliability of his methodology essentially impossible. While incomplete data may, understandably, impair an expert's ability to fully conduct the analyses that he proposes, it does not excuse the failure to construct an analytical framework under which the data is to be analyzed. The flaw in Mr. Beevers's opinion is the latter, not the former, and we therefore conclude that his opinion is inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Of course, even if Mr. Beevers's correlation methodology had been more fully developed, we would conclude that any opinions resulting from the application of that methodology would be inadmissible for lack of reliability. The first step of Mr. Beevers's analysis is unreliable for the reasons discussed above, and any correlation analysis between trader positions and Rabobank's LIBOR submissions to be performed at the third step will rely on those \"anomalous submissions\" identified at that first step as an input. (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 42, 55.) Because Mr. Beevers would not be conducting this correlation analysis using reliable data, any results that it produced would be similarly unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nimely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969202\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/381/#p396\">\n    414 F.3d at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring both \"reliable data and methodology\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 702(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   In sum, we conclude that Mr. Beevers's proposed three-step method for identifying trader-based communications is inadmissible. Each step is unreliable as we have explained, and three unreliable steps does not an admissible methodology make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.3. Monte Carlo Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   Next, Mr. Beevers conducts a statistical \"Monte Carlo\" analysis. \"Monte Carlo simulation involves repeated random sampling of various potential scenarios to compute an average result [and is] a technique which obtains a probabilistic approximation to the solution of a problem by using statistical sampling techniques.\"\n   <em>\n    Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup Glob.

Nov. 22, 2010). Based on this analysis, Mr. Beevers opines that further merits discovery will allow plaintiffs to discover more instances of trader-based manipulation, as he concludes that \"submissions are not independent and are thus consistent with collusion.\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 88, 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   As with Dr. Seyhun and Dr. Netz's probabilistic opinions, we conclude that Mr. Beevers's opinion here is irrelevant at class certification and not helpful to the trier of fact. Even assuming that Mr. Beevers's Monte Carlo analysis is reliably implemented, it cannot prove that any trader-based manipulation actually occurred, let alone on which days, by which banks, the extent to which it actually impacted LIBOR submissions, or whether those findings pertain to all class members or only certain class members. Indeed, Mr. Beevers's Monte Carlo analysis, by construction, yields results for an aggregated period and across pairs of banks at its most detailed level. Therefore, contrary to Exchange plaintiffs' contentions, Mr. Beevers's Monte Carlo analysis neither \"serve[s] to show Rabobank's anomalous submissions\" nor \"identif[ies] collusive behavior between panel banks\" with any specificity. (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   But even if Mr. Beevers's analysis were helpful to the trier of fact, it would founder on reliability grounds. Mr. Beevers's Monte Carlo simulation analyzes the relationship between a pair of banks' LIBOR submissions for every pair of panel banks, and analyzes the probability that the submissions\n   are both above or both below a reference rate (that is, the submissions have the same \"directionality\" compared to the reference rate). (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 88-110.) Mr. Beevers considers two different reference rates: published LIBOR and the mode of the panel banks' LIBOR submissions (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the most frequent submission on a given day).\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Mr. Beevers then calculates, through random simulation, the expected probability that, conditional on one bank's submission having one directionality, that each other bank's submission has the same directionality. In performing this calculation, Mr. Beevers first determines the percentage of time each bank's submission is above, equal to, or below the reference rate. (Beevers Initial Report tbls.1-2.) With these directionality distributions calculated, Mr. Beevers then runs a large number of simulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   In each simulation, using those distributions calculated at the first step, Mr. Beevers randomly determines, for each bank, whether that bank's submission was above, at, or below the reference rate. Mr. Beevers then aggregates the results of these numerous simulations in order to calculate the \"expected\" probabilities of one bank's submissions having a certain directionality given another bank submissions having the same directionality,\n   <em>\n    under the assumption that\n   </em>\n   the directionality of one bank's LIBOR submission is independent of the directionalities of all other banks' LIBOR submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   Mr. Beevers then compares these \"expected\" directionality probabilities to the actual probabilities observed, and concludes that the deviation of the actual probabilities from the expected probabilities are generally statistically significant. (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6 101.) From this result, Mr. Beevers opines that \"submissions are not independent and are thus consistent with collusion.\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   At the outset, we note that randomness is a deliberate feature of Monte Carlo simulation and reject Rabobank's arguments to the extent they suggest that this randomness by itself is a flaw rendering this analysis unreliable. (Rabobank Beevers Mem. 15.) Under Mr. Beevers's framework, each bank's submission on a given day can fall into one of three categories, meaning that for 16 banks, there are three to the 16th power, or more than 43 million, permutations of the relationships of each bank's submission to the reference rate. The \"expected\" probabilities that Mr. Beevers calculates would, most rigorously, be calculated based on all 43 million permutations. But given the computational difficulties involved in so calculating, Monte Carlo simulation is helpful in arriving at a reasonable approximation for the \"expected\" probabilities that Mr. Beevers presents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   While Monte Carlo simulation is a generally accepted technique, general acceptance does not end the reliability inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Problems in implementing the technique\n   may nonetheless render it unreliable as applied, Mr. Beevers's Monte Carlo simulation includes at least two flaws undermining its reliability. First, the Monte Carlo simulation relies on probability distributions of each bank's LIBOR submissions being above, equal to, or below, the reference rate calculated based on Period 0; and second, Mr. Beevers's assumption that each bank's directionality must be independent of all other banks' directionalities is not only unsupported, but demonstrably false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   Mr. Beevers does not identify the time period over which he draws his initial distribution of each bank's submissions compared to the reference rate. However, counsel at oral argument clarified that Mr. Beevers conducted his analysis over Period 0 (Hr'g Tr. 17:9-13), and this representation is consistent with Mr. Beevers's use, for almost all banks and tenors analyzed, of 666 daily observations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Beevers's reliance on Period 0-a period in which Exchange plaintiffs allege trader-based manipulation to be especially prevalent-as a benchmark period for his distributions undermines the reliability of the analysis. In the same way that regressions relying on clean periods overlapping with challenged conduct may be unreliable because the relationships between variables measured during the \"clean\" period will be tainted by the challenged conduct, the distributions underlying Mr. Beevers's calculations are not in fact \"clean.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Beevers's central assumption in running his Monte Carlo analysis-the statistical independence of each bank's directionality-is untenable. First, macroeconomic effects are likely to affect different subsets of panel banks differently. Mr. Beevers asserts that macroeconomic factors \"impact all banks equally,\" but this assertion is difficult to accept given geographic differences between panel banks, among other distinctions. (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 112.) The contention, for example, that European monetary policy would affect Rabobank, Bank of America, and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi to the same extent is simply not credible. To the extent Mr. Beevers tautologically defines \"macroeconomic\" factors to be those that impact all banks equally and all other factors are \"micro economic effects,\" (Beevers Rebuttal Report \u00b6 112), this definition undermines Mr. Beevers's decision to account only for credit risk in his submission analysis (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 103-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   But even disregarding macroeconomic effects, Mr. Beevers's independence assumption is false as a matter of mathematical logic because each of his reference rates is itself a function of each bank's LIBOR submissions. That is, one bank's directionality is necessarily related to all other bank's directionalities through the reference rate itself, and therefore cannot be independent to the extent Mr. Beevers assumes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   When published LIBOR is the reference rate, the directionalities cannot be completely independent because they are constrained by the method by which published LIBOR is calculated. To take an extreme example, a result that all 16 banks' submissions were below published LIBOR (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , had negative directionality) is impossible in actuality but a possible result under Mr. Beevers's independence assumption. Nor must all impossible results be so extreme: for example, a result that 4 banks had positive directionality and 12 banks had negative directionality is also impossible, because those four banks with the highest submissions would be \"trimmed\" as being outside the interquartile\n   range and the remaining 12 banks cannot all have made LIBOR submissions below published LIBOR. Similarly, when the modal submission is the reference rate, the directionalities cannot be completely independent because they are constrained by the fact that the mode must have been generated by a certain number of bank's submissions being the same. To take another example, a result that fewer than two banks' submissions was equal to the modal submission (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , had no directionality) is impossible, as that value could not be the reference rate because it would not be the mode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   In sum, even assuming that Mr. Beevers's Monte Carlo analysis can overcome a fundamental relevance problem at this stage, we are unpersuaded that Mr. Beevers has implemented his Monte Carlo analysis in a robust way that supports his conclusion of collusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.4. Continuity of Manipulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   Finally, Mr. Beevers opines that \"it will feasible to prepare a matrix of a chronological listing of each day of trader based manipulation by each Defendant,\" and that such a matrix will \"potentially likely contain thousands of instances of trader based manipulation by many of the Defendants.\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6 117.) This compound opinion encompasses two distinct opinions: (1) that a \"matrix\" listing instances of trader-based manipulation can be assembled, and (2) that panel banks \"potentially likely\" engaged in thousands of instances of trader-based manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   We agree with plaintiffs that the first part of this opinion is \"straightforward\" (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 21-22), a quality that weighs not in favor of, but against, admissibility. Mr. Beevers's opinion here appears to be that once discovered (through review of trader communications, statistical analysis, or some other method), all instances of trader-based manipulation can be compiled into a single table with one direction corresponding to each panel bank and the other corresponding to days. The rather obvious statement is not helpful to the trier of fact and is not the product of Mr. Beevers's expertise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   The second part of this opinion is more substantive. Mr. Beevers opines that panel banks \"potentially likely\" engaged in thousands of instances of trader-based manipulation, basing this opinion on allegations in Exchange plaintiffs' complaint quoting statements of facts incorporated into certain settlements between panel banks and regulatory authorities, his interpretation of the trial testimony of Rabobank trader Lee Stewart, and an analysis of Deutsche Bank's trading positions. (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 118-30.) As a general matter, these opinions are irrelevant and unhelpful to the trier of fact at this stage. The operative question at class certification is not how many times defendants engaged in trader-based manipulation in total-a point that Exchange plaintiffs have repeatedly stressed, and Mr. Beevers's attempt to quantify, however imprecisely, an upper bound on trader-based liability simply has no bearing on the class certification analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   Further, Mr. Beevers's recitation of complaint allegations and interpretation of trial testimony and trader communications is not based on his specialized knowledge. Much of this section is devoted to canvassing the documentary evidence for words suggesting frequency, such as \"weekly,\" \"regularly,\" and \"common.\" (Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 118-19, 124.) Absent some suggestion that these words have special or coded meaning in this context of trader communications, this exercise is readily performable by the trier of fact and does not require Mr. Beevers's expertise. Mr. Beevers also reviews two settlements between panel banks and regulatory authorities for evidence that trader-based manipulation\n   sometimes occurred orally and would not be documented, a task that is again performable by the factfinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Next, Mr. Beevers opines that the \"steepness\" of the yield curve implied by Deutsche Bank's 1-month and 3-month LIBOR submissions suggests that \"Deutsche Bank was intentionally misreporting its LIBOR during this period\" in order to systematically benefit its trading positions between January 2008 and September 2008, and that this manipulation is unlikely to be corroborated with documentary evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Beevers Initial report \u00b6\u00b6 125-29.) Mr. Beevers, however, does not articulate the relevance of this analysis of \"steepness\" in Deutsche Bank's submissions outside of Period 0 to trader-based manipulation by Rabobank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.5. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   Rabobank's motion to exclude Mr. Beevers's opinions is granted in part and denied in part. Though Mr. Beevers may opine on trade reporting and risk reporting systems in the financial industry as a general matter, he may not offer opinions regarding what specific data Rabobank possesses or opinions as to whether certain data should have been produced. Mr. Beevers lacks a basis on which to opine on Rabobank-specific data issues. His related opinions, regarding whether Rabobank's data productions meet his standards for completeness, are speculative and infringe on our role in establishing the scope of necessary discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   Further, his methodology for identifying trader-based manipulation is not reliable: it proceeds from an unreliable first step, as demonstrated by the implausible results it produces when applied to other time periods and data series, and compounds any unreliability with further unreliable steps. His Monte Carlo analysis is both unhelpful, as it is incapable of identifying trader-based manipulation with any specificity, and unreliable, as it depends on several assumptions that range between questionable and demonstrably false. And finally, his opinion regarding continuity of manipulation is not a product of his expertise and irrelevant as to Rabobank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   <strong>\n    1.4. Mr. Miller\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs offer a declaration from Mr. Eric Miller (the \"Miller Declaration\") dated May 2, 2017 (Decl. of Thomas Elrod ex. 13, July 21, 2017, ECF No. 2121), setting forth Mr. Miller's opinions \"regarding what information is available to identify members of the putative Exchange-Based class in this action and how the identification process could work.\" (Miller Decl. \u00b6 2.) In particular, Mr. Miller opines: (1) that EDF traders who transacted during the Class Period could be efficiently notified through a certain process; (2) that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) maintains a \"street book\" of transaction data that could be used to fill gaps in data from other sources; (3) that his class action administration firm, A.B. Data, Ltd., has the capacity to process claims forms and perform damages calculations pursuant to a methodology to be ordered by the Court; and (4) that named plaintiff Atlantic Trading held certain trading positions on EDF contracts settling in December 2007. Based on Mr. Miller's experience in the administration of class action settlements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude that he is generally qualified to offer these opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Mr. Miller first opines that class members could be identified through a notice program involving (1) the collection of \"the names and addresses of all 'Large Traders' that cleared trades\" in EDFs; (2) the collection of \"the names and addresses of all clearing Futures Commission Merchants\" (FCMs); (3) the collection of \"additional names and addresses of potential settlement class members from banks, brokers, and other nominees\"; (4) the conducting of a print and electronic media campaign; and (5) the establishment of a website and telephone hotline. (Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-14 (footnotes omitted).) Potential class members identified by name and address would be sent a \"Notice Packet\" consisting of \"the Court-Approved Notice of Class Action, Claim Form, and other documents.\" (Miller Decl. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Implicitly assuming that the individuals and entities identified through this process-Large Traders, FCMs, and class members otherwise receiving notice-maintained some records, Mr. Miller suggests that the CME retains records in the form of a \"Street Book\" sufficient to \"fill[ ] gaps\" in those records. (Miller Decl. \u00b6 15.) Mr. Miller concludes that, to the extent that potential class members have not \"retained the records necessary to perfect a claim,\" the CME's Street Book contains \"records of the historical daily activity of all transactions for futures and options contracts\" that could be used to determine each class member's transactions. (Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   Mr. Miller's opinion regarding the gap-filling \"Street Book\" rests on a speculative assumption and is inadmissible. Mr. Miller does not claim to have personal experience with data produced by the CME, but bases his opinions on his \"experience in past and current cases,\" including\n   <em>\n    In re Amaranth Natural Gas Commodities Litigation\n   </em>\n   , No. 07 Civ. 6377 (SAS) (S.D.N.Y.) and\n   <em>\n    In re Optiver Commodities Litigation\n   </em>\n   , No. 08 Civ. 6842 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y.).

In the absence of additional support for his opinion regarding a CME \"Street Book,\" this opinion in unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs attempt to bolster Mr. Miller's opinion by asserting that they had served a subpoena on the CME to produce street book data, but CME was \"instructed not to produce street book data\" at the class certification stage. (Exch. Pls.' Miller Opp'n 17.) Implicit in this argument is the suggestion that the CME might very well have street book data, and whether that data exists is simply unknown at the moment because the CME has not been required to respond to the subpoena. We find this argument unpersuasive: Mr. Miller is not entitled to base his affirmative opinion, that CME in fact maintains street book data, on mere uncertainty as to whether such data exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Further, the gap-filling purpose of \"street book\" data is implicated only if some base of (gap-containing) data exists in the first place. While Mr. Miller opines that identified EDF traders could \"provide historical transaction data in hard copy and/or electronically,\" he never states whether the EDF traders identified through the various methods of notice have maintained records at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without\n   that critical link, Mr. Miller's opinions on how best to provide notice to EDF traders-necessary\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   certification of a class (particularly in the settlement context\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   ),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B), (e) (1), are irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   While the parties dispute the import of the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   , the availability of trading records is an issue relevant to our consideration of the predominance of common questions and the superiority of class-action status. Mr. Miller's notice opinions do not address whether EDF traders, having received notice, actually possess relevant records. The subject that his notice opinions do address-the\n   <em>\n    mechanics\n   </em>\n   of the notice process-are of minimal relevance and do not help us determine a fact in issue. Nor can Mr. Miller's street book opinions salvage his notice opinions, given the speculative nature of the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Mr. Miller additionally opines A.B. Data has the capability to process claims \"precisely in accordance with the court-approved plan of allocation and settlement stipulation,\" describes certain features of A.B. Data's proprietary software, and concludes that A.B. Data can handle \"large volumes of complex damage calculations.\" (Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-26.) We have no particular reason to doubt that A.B. Data has the technological capability to process trading records and perform damages calculations on those records as a general matter. But in order for A.B. Data to do so, those trading records must exist as an initial matter, and Mr. Miller does not reliably opine that they do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Finally, Mr. Miller provides several statistics regarding named plaintiff Atlantic Trading's positions on the EDF contract expiring in December 2007. (Miller Decl. \u00b6 27.) However, Mr. Miller does not explain the data that he analyzed, the method he applied, or the assumptions that he made in making those calculations. This opinion is therefore also inadmissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   Accordingly, Rabobank's motion to exclude Mr. Miller's declaration is granted. Mr. Miller's opinions regarding the availability of a CME \"street book\" are not only speculative, but also concededly incorrect. His opinions regarding the provision of notice to EDF traders are of minimal relevance and do not help us \"determine a fact in issue.\" Fed. R. Evid. 702(a). Given the lack of context for his trading-position calculations, we also cannot conclude that those statistics are sufficiently reliable to be admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Culp Mem. 7), but this is a mischaracterization. Rather, Dr. Culp explains that changes in LIBOR do not necessarily cause changes in EDF prices. (Culp Initial Report \u00b6 19 (criticizing Dr. Seyhun's and Dr. Netz's assumption that \"changes in\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   3mLIBOR impact Eurodollar futures prices ... on days before futures contracts expire\"); \u00b6 21 (\"[C]hanges in LIBOR do not have an independent causal effect on Eurodollar futures prices.\"); \u00b6 24 (\"[Dr. Seyhun and Dr. Netz] do not have a reliable theoretical basis for their assumption that changes in LIBOR on a given day cause changes in Eurodollar futures prices.\"). This difference parallels the distinction between correlation and causation: correlation between LIBOR and EDF prices is sufficient to establish a \"mathematical relationship\" between the two, but the operative question is whether changes in LIBOR\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   determinable changes in EDF prices. With this understanding in mind, we consider Exchange plaintiffs' specific arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   First, Exchange plaintiffs contend that Dr. Culp's opinion is \"patently incorrect\" because it is contradicted by a CME publication\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   discussing implied forward rates and providing a formula for the calculation of implied forward rates. (Exch. Pls.' Culp Mem. 7-8). We reject at the start Exchange plaintiffs' arguments to the extent they suggest that Dr. Culp ignored this\n   publication, as he explicitly considered this publication in his evaluation of Dr. Netz's report. (Culp Initial Report \u00b6 41 n.103). Further, based on our review of the publication, it discusses the relationship between \"Eurodollar (Euro) futures and cash markets\" rather than EDFs and LIBOR, which is not itself a cash market. This publication does not render Dr. Culp's causation opinion fatally flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   Second, Exchange plaintiffs assert that counsel for defendant Bank of America stated at oral argument in 2013 that \"[e]ssentially what people are doing there is making bets, if you will.... [B]ut they're taking a position with respect to where LIBOR is going, up or down.\" (Exch. Pls.' Culp Mem. 8 &amp; n.4 (citing Mar. 5, 2013 Hr'g Tr. 25:25-26:4, ECF No. 325)). We reject the notion that this remark from counsel made during oral argument almost five years ago seriously calls into the question of a qualified expert witness. Indeed, counsel prefaced his statement with the remark that \"I'm not an expert in futures contracts and the Chicago Exchange.\" (Mar. 5, 2013 Hr'g Tr. 25:24-25.) And even if we did not reject the notion, counsel's statement was immediately preceded by plaintiffs' counsel's statement that EDF contracts settled at a price of 100 minus LIBOR (Mar. 5, 2013 Hr'g Tr. 25:16-20); nothing in the statement by counsel for Bank of America supports the notion that changes in LIBOR cause changes in EDF prices before the settlement date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   Third, Exchange plaintiffs argue that Dr. Culp failed to take into account their \"overlap\" theory. Under this theory, on a given day, the relationship between spot LIBOR and expected spot LIBOR at settlement is a function of the \"overlap\" between the three-month period following that day and the three-month period following the settlement date. (Exch. Pls.' Culp Mem. 10-13; Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 3-5.) Using the specific example of March 14, 2008 and an EDF contract settling on March 18, 2008, Exchange plaintiffs assert that expected 3-month LIBOR on March 18, 2008 must be a function of spot 3-month LIBOR on March 14, 2008, because the former 3-month rate covers a period between March 18, 2008 and June 17, 2008 and the latter 3-month rate covers a period between March 14, 2008 and June 12, 2008-an overlap of 87 days out of 91 days in the period. Therefore, they contend, the March 14, 2008 expectation of 3-month LIBOR on March 18, 2008 can be calculated as the weighted average of 3-month spot LIBOR on March 14, 2008 (with 95.6% weight, calculated as 87 divided by 91) and the 3-month implied forward rate calculated from spot 3-month LIBOR and spot 6-month LIBOR on March 14, 2008 (with 4.4% weight, calculated as 4 divided by 91). According to Exchange plaintiffs, Dr. Culp's failure to consider this \"mathematical fact\" renders his challenged opinions inadmissible. (Exch. Pls.' Culp Mem. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   As a threshold matter, the criticism that Dr. Culp did not consider the weighted-average formula presented for the first time in Exchange plaintiffs' motions papers (Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 5)-but not in Dr. Seyhun's reports-is mystifying. Exchange plaintiffs cannot credibly fault Dr. Culp for failing to address a novel formula never presented until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   his reports were written: Exchange plaintiffs' motion was filed on July 10, 2017, more than three months after Dr. Culp's initial report (dated April 3, 2017) and ten days after his sur-rebuttal report (dated June 30, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   In any event, Exchange plaintiffs' \"overlap\" formula fares no better on the merits. While the validity of the implied forward rate formula incorporated as an input into the weighted-average formula is not questioned,\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   they appear to have conjured the\n   weighted-average formula from absolutely nothing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, as we will explain, it rests on the unfounded assumption that a market participant attaches equal significance to each day over a given three-month period and maintains an unchanging expectation of relevant conditions during that three-month period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   Taking Exchange plaintiffs' 2008 exemplar dates, the period supposedly reflected in spot 3-month LIBOR on March 14 covers the period between March 14 and June 12, and this period is divisible into two periods: (1) the four days between March 14 and March 17 (which do not overlap with the three-month period reflected in spot 3-month LIBOR on March 18), and (2) the 87 days between March 18 and June 12 (which do overlap with the three-month period reflected in spot 3-month LIBOR on March 18). Exchange plaintiffs appear to acknowledge that the first, non-overlapping period captured in spot 3-month LIBOR on March 14 should be excluded from the determination of expected 3-month spot LIBOR on March 18, but the formula's means of excluding those dates is to reduce the weight attributable to spot 3-month LIBOR on March 14 proportionally by the number of days. But this proportional reduction is appropriate only if the expectations for the first, non-overlapping period and expectations for the second, overlapping period are themselves proportional to the number of days. Because Exchange plaintiffs similarly rely on a proportional reduction of the 3-month implied forward rate (calculated from 3-month and 6-month spot LIBOR) to exclude the non-overlapping portion of the latter period, the same proportionality and uniformity are required of the 3-month period covered by the implied forward rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   This March 14 and March 18 example establishes Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on proportionality for dates that are four days apart, but this principle generalizes to any combination of days. For example, Exchange plaintiffs' formula for spot 3-month LIBOR on March 18 expected as of March 13 would apply a 94.5% weighting (86 divided by 91) to spot 3-month LIBOR on March 13, which assumes that expectations for the five-day non-overlapping period are proportional to those for the 86-day overlapping period. Similarly, the 5.5% weighting applied to the 3-month implied forward rate assumes that expectations for the five-day overlapping period are proportional to those for the 86-day nonoverlapping period. And more generally, for all\n   <em>\n    n\n   </em>\n   between 0 and 91, Exchange plaintiffs' weighted-average formula requires proportionality between the first\n   <em>\n    n\n   </em>\n   days and the remaining 91 minus\n   <em>\n    n\n   </em>\n   days; the formula therefore assumes \"uniformity\" across all days in the 3-month period because each additional day in the overlapping period must account for 1/91 of expectations. This assumption is dubious at best, given that some days are more likely to have significant macroeconomic information impacting LIBOR (as Dr. Seyhun, Dr. Netz, and Exchange plaintiffs concede occurs): the Federal Reserve could announce a rate change, or certain government statistical releases regarding the state of the economy could be published, among many other events of significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   In sum, Exchange plaintiffs' casual empiricism is entirely unavailing. We have significant doubts regarding the weighted-average formula proposed for the first time in Exchange plaintiffs' motion papers, and it certainly does not offer a basis on which to exclude Dr. Culp's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   Fourth, plaintiffs assert that three communications between traders establish that changes in LIBOR caused changes in EDF prices, contradicting Dr. Culp's causation opinion. In particular, they rely on communications in which traders stated (1) \"higher libor caused Sep09 and Dec09 ED to sell-off\"; (2) \"libors appear only relevant for futures\"; and (3) \"[t]he front 2 contracts in Eurodollars which most closely track the LIBOR settings have gotten killed this morning[ ] as the expectation is libors will set higher out of fear.\" (Exch. Pls.' Culp Mem. 8 n.3, Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 6-7.) For one, these communications reflect only the beliefs of those traders, rather than the behavior of the market as a whole, and as Rabobank correctly notes, other traders (including several of the named plaintiffs in this action) viewed LIBOR as irrelevant in their trading considerations. Exchange plaintiffs offer no reason why, in assessing the reliability of Dr. Culp's opinions, we should give more weight to these three identified statements as compared to the named plaintiffs' sworn deposition testimony. The fact that some traders considered LIBOR in making their trading decisions does not establish that changes in LIBOR cause determinable changes in EDF prices, a distinction that Exchange plaintiffs attempt to elide. (Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Finally, in their reply brief, Exchange plaintiffs offer two critiques of Dr. Culp's empirical methodology: (1) that he improperly analyzed changes in EDF prices in a one-hour window surrounding publication of LIBOR, from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. London time, and (2) that his analysis of the relationship between LIBOR-derived implied forward rates and EDF-implied rates is irrelevant. (Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 8-10.) Because Exchange plaintiffs do not seek exclusion of these analyses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   we discuss them and Exchange plaintiffs' criticisms only briefly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   In his analysis of changes in EDF prices surrounding the publication of LIBOR, Dr. Culp finds that EDF trading prices respond quickly to significant macroeconomic events. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Culp Initial Report \u00b6 121.) Dr. Culp's focus on the publication of LIBOR itself, as a means of isolating changes\n   in EDF prices attributable to LIBOR apart from changes in EDF prices attributable to macroeconomic events would therefore appear to be a feature, not a flaw, of his analysis. Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on Dr. Seyhun's speculative \"insider trading\" theory is unpersuasive, and their suggestion that the EDF market may not be sufficiently liquid around 11:30am London time (or 5:30am Chicago time) is difficult to reconcile with their (and Dr. Seyhun's) contrary suggestions that EDFs \"trade on an efficient market.\" (Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 8; Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 126.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   In his analysis of the relationship between LIBOR-derived implied forward rates and EDF-implied rates, Dr. Culp concludes that the two rates substantially differ over the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Culp Rebuttal Report \u00b6 49.) Because the spread between the two rates ranges between negative 157.56 and 21.79 basis points over the class period, Dr. Culp concludes that these differences are substantially greater in magnitude than the maximum 0.125 basis point change in LIBOR attributable to Rabobank's alleged manipulation of LIBOR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Culp Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 48-50.) Exchange plaintiffs complain that Dr. Culp fails to take into account the fact that banks other than Rabobank may have engaged in manipulation, and the collective impact of manipulation by multiple banks could be \"more than ten-fold\" greater than the 0.125 bp maximum change attributable to Rabobank. (Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 10.) But even accepting that manipulation by more than one bank will have a greater impact on published LIBOR, Dr. Culp's point still stands: the large spreads between LIBOR-derived implied forward rates and EDF-implied rates often could not be explained by alleged LIBOR manipulation even by more than one bank. For example, the most extreme positive and negative spreads, at 21.79 bp and negative 157.56 bp, are 174 times and 1,260 times greater than the maximum Rabobank impact of 0.125 bp, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs' motion to exclude certain of Dr. Culp's opinions is therefore denied. Even accepting that Exchange plaintiffs' criticisms are anything more than attacks on Dr. Culp's conclusions premised on a mischaracterization of his reports, none of those critiques call into question the reliability of Dr. Culp's opinions. Dr. Culp's opinions are not contradicted by a CME publication discussing Eurodollar cash markets, a statement made by counsel for Bank of America during oral argument, or certain trader communications. Nor are they excludable for having failed to consider the \"overlap\" formula that Exchange plaintiffs alchemize from nothing and present for the first time in their motions papers. And ultimately, we reject Exchange plaintiffs' overarching theory that a logical or theoretical argument is not susceptible to rebuttal or disproof through empirical evidence. We would assume that empirical evidence running counter to a logical or theoretical argument would spur one to ensure that the argument is free of logical fallacies and reevaluate the theoretical basis for the argument. But even if not, Exchange plaintiffs' attempted distinction of \"logical\" and \"theoretical\" arguments on the one hand and \"empirical\" arguments on the other simply does not offer a basis for excluding Dr. Culp's opinions under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   <strong>\n    2.2. Dr. Hubbard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   Rabobank offers two reports from Dr. R. Glenn Hubbard: (1) an initial report dated April 3, 2017 (Decl. of Robert Lindholm\n   ex. 65, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2027); and (2) a sur-rebuttal report dated June 30, 2017 (Decl. of Robert Lindholm ex. 66, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2027). We refer to these as the Hubbard Initial Report and the Hubbard Rebuttal Report. Exchange plaintiffs seek to exclude only certain portions of Dr. Hubbard's opinions, those in which he addresses Mr. Beevers's opinions regarding certain data produced by Rabobank and the sufficiency of that data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   Specifically, Dr. Hubbard opines that Mr. Beevers's data-sufficiency critiques are misguided because: (1) Mr. Beevers constructed a dataset with duplicate entries (Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 174-76); (2) the date-coding issues identified by Mr. Beevers are illusory (Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 177-80); (3) information attributing trading \"folders\" to the individual trader with responsibility for that \"folder\" was made available for each of the traders identified over the course of Mr. Beevers's review of trader communications; and (4) Mr. Beevers did not consider certain risk reports produced by Rabobank (Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 181-85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   Dr. Hubbard is qualified to offer the challenged opinions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Hubbard, in the challenged sections of his report, does not opine that Rabobank's data productions were complete and contain all information necessary to identify trader-based manipulation, but rather that they are not deficient in the various ways suggested by Mr. Beevers. Accordingly, Dr. Hubbard does not need an \"understanding of, and experience with, the day-to-day conduct and reporting in dealing rooms of financial services organizations\" to offer these opinions (Exch. Pls.' Hubbard Mem. 8); rather, Dr. Hubbard's formal training in economics and his extensive experience working with economic and financial data qualify him to do so. Exchange plaintiffs' suggestions to the contrary mischaracterize the opinions in question and are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   First, citing Dr. Hubbard's statement that \"Mr. Beevers' own errors-not deficient data-are the cause of many of the data deficiencies he mistakenly claims exist in the Rabobank data\" (Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6 17b), Exchange plaintiffs claim that \"[i]t is hard to imagine how this statement could mean anything other than what it says; namely, that it is Dr. Hubbard's opinion that Rabobank's data productions are 'not deficient,' and that Mr. Beevers' opinion that they are deficient, is 'mistaken[ ].' \" (Exch. Pls.' Hubbard Reply 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   We have no such difficulty. Dr. Hubbard's statement is clear: he opines that\n   <em>\n    many of\n   </em>\n   the data deficiencies identified by Mr. Beevers are attributable to Mr. Beevers's own errors and not deficiencies in Rabobank's data. Exchange plaintiffs' interpretation overreads Dr. Hubbard's opinion, which pertains to the deficiencies identified by Mr. Beevers and is not a representation regarding the quality of Rabobank's data generally. Indeed, such an interpretation is expressly contradicted by Dr. Hubbard's qualification that \"many of\" the deficiencies identified by Mr. Beevers are not deficiencies in actuality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs also identify subsequent portions of Dr. Hubbard's report and deposition testimony regarding the presence of inconsistent date formats, the availability of \"folder mapping\" information\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   for specific traders identified in Mr. Beevers's report, and the sufficiency of certain risk reports. Again, Dr. Hubbard limits each of these statements to be a response to Mr. Beevers's opinions, and these statements cannot reasonably be read to offer an opinion regarding the overall completeness of Rabobank's production. For instance, Exchange plaintiffs identify Dr. Hubbard's opinion that inconsistent date formats \"should not have contributed to [Mr. Beevers's] inability to construct trader-level LIBOR-related positions.\" (Exch. Pls.' Hubbard Reply 5 (quoting Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6 179).) This opinion is limited, on its face, to one specific difficulty that Mr. Beevers identified in his report. Similarly, Exchange plaintiffs identify Dr. Hubbard's statement that folder mapping information is available \"for every Rabobank trader that ... Mr. Beevers identified as being involved in trader communications.\" (Exch. Pls.' Hubbard Reply 5 (quoting Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6 177 n.302).) But again, this statement is on its face limited to a certain group of traders specifically identified by Mr. Beevers and does not extend to the availability of folder mapping information for all traders more broadly. Finally, Exchange plaintiffs identify Dr. Hubbard's opinion that Rabobank produced \"most of the risk reports\" that Mr. Beevers asserts are missing, \"namely, 'risk positions by trading book on a daily basis,' and reports of 'which activities or individuals are taking significant risk positions.' \" (Exch. Pls.' Hubbard Reply 5 (quoting Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6 185 and Beevers Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 48-49).) This selective quotation mischaracterizes the scope of Dr. Hubbard's opinion, which refers only to Mr. Beevers's description of \"routine periodic reports, sometimes called 'dashboards', for use in internal and regulatory reporting,' \" (Hubbard Initial Report \u00b6 184 (quoting Beevers Initial Report \u00b6 31)), and not to trader-by-trader positions more broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   When the challenged opinions are characterized accurately, Dr. Hubbard is qualified to offer them. Dr. Hubbard's opinions are primarily directed to\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   Mr. Beevers analyzed the data, rather than\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   specific data Mr. Beevers analyzed. Accordingly, Dr. Hubbard's extensive training and experience in the fields of economics and finance renders him qualified to work with spreadsheets and data, and therefore qualifies him to opine that Mr. Beevers made certain errors in analyzing the data produced by Rabobank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   Nor are Dr. Hubbard's opinions excludable on account of incorrectness or speculativeness. Exchange plaintiffs suggest that Dr. Hubbard's opinions are not based on sufficient facts because Rabobank's data production contains \"significant deficiencies ... that are easily ascertained upon review,\" and Dr. Hubbard conceded that his opinions were incorrect. (Exch. Pls.' Hubbard Mem. 11-12). As a threshold matter, our role at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   stage is not to conclusively assess the correctness of an expert's opinions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p265\">\n    303 F.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that we\n   undertake a Daubert analysis \"without regard to the conclusions the expert has reached or [our] belief as to the correctness of those conclusions\"), a point that plaintiffs have repeatedly emphasized (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 10). Exchange plaintiffs' focus on the correctness of Dr. Hubbard's conclusions is therefore an analytic nonstarter. Further, we have already rejected the premise of the assertion that Dr. Hubbard's opinions are incorrect because Rabobank's data productions are in fact incomplete-Dr. Hubbard does not opine on the overall completeness of Rabobank's data productions, but rather only certain deficiencies identified by Mr. Beevers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   Second, Dr. Hubbard's opinions are not speculative. Dr. Hubbard undertook a review of the work product supporting Mr. Beevers's report and of the data produced by Rabobank, (Hubbard Report app. C), and one can trace a direct analytical path from that review to the conclusions that Dr. Hubbard reaches: namely, that Mr. Beevers made certain errors in analyzing the data produced by Rabobank and failed to consider certain risk reports in formulating his opinions. Indeed, the Delta reports, the MRE reports, and the Daily Revenue and Risk reports identified at paragraph 185 of the Hubbard Initial Report\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   are not cited in the appendices listing the materials relied upon in Mr. Beevers's reports. (Beevers Initial Report app. A; Beevers Rebuttal Report app. A.). Proceeding from that fact to the conclusion that Mr. Beevers failed to take those reports into account is a natural inference, not an analytical leap suggesting a lack of reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   In sum, Exchange plaintiffs' motion to exclude certain of Dr. Hubbard's opinions is denied. The motion is premised on a mischaracterization of Dr. Hubbard's opinions: the disputed sections of his report do not offer, and cannot reasonably be read to offer, the opinion that Rabobank's data productions were \"complete\" in some platonic sense. Based on his extensive training and experience in economics and finance, Dr. Hubbard is qualified to offer his opinions regarding Mr. Beevers's data analysis and any errors that Mr. Beevers may have made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3. Dr. Willig\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   UBS submits two reports from Dr. Robert Willig: (1) an initial report dated April 3, 2017 (Decl. of Jamie Heine ex. 5, July 1, 2017, ECF No. 2031); and (2) a sur-rebuttal report dated June 30, 2017 (Decl. of Jamie Heine ex. 7, July 1, 2017, ECF No. 2031). In the context of the Exchange plaintiffs' action, we refer to these as the Willig Initial Report and the Willig Rebuttal Report. Exchange plaintiffs do not challenge Dr. Willig's qualifications, and we conclude that he is qualified to offer the opinions presented in his reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   In these reports, Dr. Willig offers several opinions as to \"whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate using common proof on a classwide basis that panel banks, either individually or jointly, systematically suppressed their LIBOR submissions and the resulting published LIBOR rates during the Suppression Class Period.\" (Willig Initial\n   Report \u00b6 5 (footnote omitted).) Central to these opinions is an analysis of interbank lending transactions into which the panel banks actually entered, which Dr. Willig characterizes as \"the most informative data for evaluating the accuracy of their LIBOR submissions.\" (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 18.) Dr. Willig compiles a dataset of transactions from data files produced by the panel banks, and from this dataset identifies transactions between banks occurring in London, and matches each transaction in this dataset to a LIBOR submission by panel bank, tenor, and date. (Willig Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 30; app. 4.) Using this dataset, he concludes that \"[c]ommon evidence cannot show that the panel banks' LIBOR submissions during the Suppression Class Period were systematically 'Low',\" defining \"Low\" to mean below the \"actual borrowing costs of the panel bank that made the submission\" (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 6(a)); that \"[c]ommon evidence cannot show that any LIBOR suppression alleged by Plaintiffs was the result of the panel banks acting jointly\" (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 6(b)); and that \"[c]ommon evidence cannot show that alleged suppression of LIBOR submissions caused LIBOR rates to be lower than they otherwise would have been\" (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 6(c)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs seek the exclusion of Dr. Willig's reports, though they focus their challenges on opinions based on Dr. Willig's analysis of transaction data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   They contend that Dr. Willig's analysis runs counter to the proper interpretation of the \"LIBOR question\"-the question posed by the BBA that a panel bank is supposed to answer in making its LIBOR submission as well as certain guidance published by the BBA and certain panel banks' internal documents, among other authorities. They also assert that Dr. Willig's analysis is inadmissible because it relies on insufficient data, and because it offers an opinion on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.1. Interpretation of the LIBOR Question\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs first argue that because Dr. Willig's analysis focuses on the rates observed in actual interbank lending transactions and not offered rates, his analysis contradicts the LIBOR question and is therefore unreliable and irrelevant. (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mem. 9-10.) They further assert that Dr. Willig's methodology is \"guaranteed to produce Defendant-favorable false negatives,\" which \"gives rise to a reasonable inference that Dr. Willig's first calculation set out to find only one Defendant-favorable result: no systematic suppression,\" and that Dr. Willig's methodology \"completes Defendants' highly unusual and parallel violation of the BBA requirement of 'accountability' which was the original purpose of the offered rates.\" (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mem. 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.1.1. Exchange Plaintiffs' \"Borrowing Cost\" Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   This line of argument is readily refuted by Exchange plaintiffs' repeated references to panel banks' \"borrowing costs\" throughout the course of this litigation-or least up until interbank lending data was produced and analyzed by the parties' experts. Though Exchange plaintiffs have now amended their complaints to omit certain references to \"borrowing costs,\" the Second Circuit has made clear that \"[t]he amendment of a pleading does not make it any less an admission of the party,\"\n   <em>\n    Andrews v. Metro N. Commuter R.R.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45, 122, Apr. 30, 2012, ECF No. 134.) In a subsequent complaint, the corrected second amended consolidated class action complaint, Exchange plaintiffs asserted that \"Defendants understated their borrowing costs to the British Bankers' Association,\" that \"[b]y acting together and in concert to knowingly understate their true borrowing costs, Defendants caused LIBOR to be set at artificial levels,\" and that \"Defendants' LIBOR quotes during the Class Period did not appropriately reflect those banks' actual borrowing costs at that time.\" (Corrected Second Am. Consolidated Class Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 13, 162, Sept. 30, 2013, ECF No. 438.) The proposed third amended complaint contains similar allegations, (Proposed Third Am. Consolidated Class Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 13, 130, June 29, 2015, ECF No. 1159), as does the proposed fourth amended complaint (Proposed Fourth Am. Consolidated Class Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 13, 131, Jan. 14, 2017, ECF No. 1726).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs cannot now assert that Dr. Willig's analysis-\n   <em>\n    which performs a comparison that plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly alleged in their complaints and otherwise referenced\n   </em>\n   -is irrelevant or unreliable by changing their interpretation of the LIBOR question\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   . As a corollary, the related insinuation that Dr. Willig's methodology is \"guaranteed\" to produce only defendant-favorable results borders on the frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   Indeed, Exchange plaintiffs' attempt to evade the effect of their \"borrowing costs\" allegations is especially unpersuasive once the timing of Dr. Willig's reports is considered. In November 2016, in document requests made as part of class-certification discovery, Exchange plaintiffs defined \"LIBOR Suppression\" as \"making LIBOR Submissions below the LIBOR Panel Bank's actual cost of borrowing in the London Interbank Market.\" (Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 12, July 21, 2017, ECF No. 2112 (\"Mishkin Willig Decl.\").) In April 2017, when Dr. Willig's initial report was produced, both the operative complaint and the proposed fourth amended complaint submitted by Exchange plaintiffs in January 2017 contained numerous allegations regarding Defendants' \"borrowing costs.\" (Corrected Second Am. Consolidated Class Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 13, 162; Proposed Fourth Am. Consolidated Class Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 13, 131.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   Only after we granted further leave to amend in April 2017 and Exchange plaintiffs in fact filed their corrected fourth amended complaint in December 2017-after the class certification motions and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions had been fully briefed-did Exchange plaintiffs replace certain references to \"borrowing costs\" with \"offered rates.\" For instance, the proposed fourth amended complaint alleges that the panel banks \"conspired to suppress LIBOR below the levels it would have been set had Defendants accurately reported their\n   <em>\n    competitive borrowing costs\n   </em>\n   \" and that \"Defendants' LIBOR quotes during the Class Period did not appropriately reflect those banks'\n   <em>\n    actual borrowing costs\n   </em>\n   .\" (Proposed Fourth Am. Consolidated Class Action\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 124, 131 (emphasis added).) By contrast, in the\n   <em>\n    corrected\n   </em>\n   fourth amended complaint, Exchange plaintiffs changed these allegations, which now assert that the panel banks \"conspired to suppress LIBOR below the levels it would have been set had Defendants accurately reported their\n   <em>\n    competitive offered rates\n   </em>\n   \" and that \"Defendants' LIBOR quotes during the Class Period did not appropriately reflect those banks'\n   <em>\n    actual offered rates\n   </em>\n   .\" (Corrected Fourth Amended Complaint 115, 122, Dec. 11, 2017, ECF No. 2363 (emphasis added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   By asserting that \"Dr. Willig concluded that LIBOR supposedly was not 'systematically' suppressed\" (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mem. 6 (citing Willig Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 6, 75, 192)), Exchange plaintiffs have either continued to define LIBOR suppression as the making of submissions below actual borrowing costs or mischaracterized Dr. Willig's opinions deliberately. In each of Dr. Willig's opinions identified by Exchange plaintiffs, Dr. Willig opines that panel banks' LIBOR submissions were not systematically below their average borrowing costs as observed in interbank transaction data; he does not opine that there was no systematically suppression of LIBOR. (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 6(a) (\"Common evidence cannot show that the panel banks' LIBOR submissions during the Suppression Class Period were systematically 'Low,' \" with \"Low\" defined as being below \"the actual borrowing costs of the panel bank that made the submission\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75 (\"Plaintiffs cannot establish using common evidence that panel banks systematically made LIBOR submissions\n   <em>\n    below their borrowing costs\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 192 (\"[A]vailable data on banks ['] borrowing costs do not indicate that banks systematically made submissions\n   <em>\n    below their borrowing costs\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis added)).) Exchange plaintiffs' characterization of Dr. Willig's opinion is valid only if \"suppression\" is defined to be the making of submissions below actual borrowing costs-a position that is difficult to reconcile with Exchange plaintiffs' criticisms of Dr. Willig's opinions premised on the notion that borrowing costs observed in actual transactions are irrelevant to the LIBOR question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   In one section of his report, Dr. Willig does conduct an analysis in which panel banks' actual LIBOR submissions are replaced with the corresponding average rate observed in the transaction data. (Willig Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 89-101.) However, this analysis is intended to be illustrative of the principle that changes in LIBOR submissions may not always impact published LIBOR, as Dr. Willig explicitly disclaims: his \"re-calculations of the LIBOR rates after substituting banks' average London Interbank Borrowing costs for their submissions are not intended to be estimates of but-for rates.\" (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 96 n.82.) This analysis is comparable to Dr. Netz's median-replacement analysis, which is similarly intended to show that changes in LIBOR submissions impact published\n   LIBOR only some of the time, which is also not intended to be a calculation of but-for LIBOR, and which is also admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.1.2.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.1.2. The Text of the LIBOR Question\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs' extensive allegations regarding \"borrowing costs\" and reliance on a mischaracterization of Dr. Willig's opinions warrant denial of their motion standing alone, but we nonetheless proceed to consider the various sources on which Exchange plaintiffs rely to bolster their recently adopted interpretation of the LIBOR question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   As an initial matter, despite their repeated invocation of \"offer rates\" and \"offered rates,\" Exchange plaintiffs never define with precision what exactly they mean by those terms: it remains unclear whether, under their interpretation, whether an \"offer rate\" or \"offered rate\" refers to the first rate floated by a lending bank (regardless of how high or how serious that number might be), the first rate offered by a lending bank that is sufficiently reasonable such that it serves as a starting point for negotiations, or some other number entirely. Regardless, to render Dr. Willig's analyses inadmissible, the LIBOR question must preclude consideration of actual transaction rates altogether. None of the myriad sources relied upon by Exchange plaintiffs comes close to establishing such a proposition,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that consideration of actual transaction rates is irrelevant to considering whether LIBOR submissions were suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   We follow the parties' lead and begin with the text of the LIBOR question, which asks: \"At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 11 am\" London time? Exchange plaintiffs cite the phrase \"by asking for and accepting inter-bank offers\" to emphasize that the LIBOR question asks about offered rates, (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mem. 9.); UBS counters that the words \"accepting\" and \"offers\" indicate that the LIBOR question refers to \"final offers that would result in transactions,\" as \"[t]he offer a bank would accept is the\n   <em>\n    final\n   </em>\n   offer, not any\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   offer it might have received.\" (UBS Willig Opp'n 6, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   We conclude that the text of the LIBOR question is at least somewhat ambiguous. We agree with UBS that the LIBOR question cannot refer to any initial \"offer\" that is made, as doing so would render superfluous the LIBOR question's language \"and accepting.\" An offer could be sufficiently high such that the panel bank would not \"accept\" the offer, even as a starting point for negotiations. On the other hand, we do not share UBS's confidence that the LIBOR question refers to only final \"offers\" that are \"accepted\" (akin to how those terms are used in contract law) and become consummated transaction rates. UBS's argument would eliminate entirely the distinction between offered rates and transaction rates, and LIBOR remains an\n   <em>\n    offered\n   </em>\n   rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   We need not resolve definitively this ambiguity now, as it does not render Dr. Willig's analysis of actual transaction rates inadmissible. Dr. Willig acknowledges that LIBOR represents an \"offered\" rate (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 66), and does not suggest that panel banks' actual transaction rates should be substituted as but-for estimates of panel banks' LIBOR submissions (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 96 n.82). Rather, Dr. Willig opines that consummated transaction rates are relevant in the determination of a panel bank's LIBOR submissions; nothing in the wording of the LIBOR question suggests that this assumption is an unreliable one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.1.3. BBA Publications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   This understanding of the LIBOR question is confirmed by several BBA publications identified by the parties. None of these sources precludes the consideration of actual transaction rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   The first BBA publication addressed by the parties is the October 2010 version of a BBA webpage titled\n   <em>\n    The Basics\n   </em>\n   , which according to Exchange plaintiffs (Exch. Pls.' Willig Reply 3), states that LIBOR rates \"are not based on actual transaction[s]\" and that \"[t]he key concept is that [LIBOR] is based on the offered rate, and not the bid rate.\" (Decl. of Victor Stewart ex. 2, Aug. 4, 2017, ECF No. 2188 (\"Stewart Willig Decl.\").) In so arguing, Exchange plaintiffs conspicuously omit the first quoted sentence's full context. In full, that sentence reads: \"The rates are not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   based on actual transaction[s], indeed it would not be possible to create the suite of [LIBOR] rates if this was a requirement, as not all banks will require funds in marketable size each day in each of the currencies and maturities they quote.\" (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 2 (emphasis added).) The use of \"necessarily\" implies that actual transaction rates do form a basis for a bank's LIBOR submissions, an implication confirmed by the subsequent reference to potential data availability issues as the reason why a basis in actual transaction rates is not a \"requirement\" of panel bank's LIBOR submissions. The second quoted sentence is irrelevant to our analysis, as Dr. Willig's analysis of actual transaction rates is not an analysis of bid rates. Exchange plaintiffs also cite similar language in a May 2008 supplementary memorandum, which uses language largely identical to the\n   <em>\n    The Basics\n   </em>\n   webpage cited by Exchange plaintiffs. (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 3.) The lone difference is that it omits the word \"necessarily\" that Exchange plaintiffs also omitted in their discussion of the\n   <em>\n    The Basics\n   </em>\n   webpage, and we find plaintiffs' reliance similarly unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs also misattribute the first sentence to an October 2009 BBA document entitled \"Guidelines for [C]ontributing BBA LIBOR Rates,\" (Decl. of Fred Isquith ex. 5, July 10, 2017, ECF No. 2074 (\"Isquith Willig Decl.\")), which turns out to provide interpretive guidance. This document states that \"[u]nder certain circumstances, contributor banks will take funds at levels above or below LIBOR\" and that such an occurrence \"does not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   mean that they should raise or drop their rates to these levels\" (emphasis added), and also explains that \"the rates submitted into the process are a bank's own view of its cost of funds, based on the totality of the information available to a bank from both internal and external sources.\" (Isquith Willig Decl. ex. 5.) This document strongly suggests that a panel bank's submission should be informed by actual transaction rates, which unquestionably form part of the \"totality of information available to [the] bank.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   A second BBA webpage, titled\n   <em>\n    Definitions\n   </em>\n   , is a second point of contention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the BBA states that \"[c]ontributions must represent rates at which a bank would be offered funds in the London interbank market,\" and that \"[t]he rate at which each bank submits must be formed from that bank's perception of its cost of unsecured funds in the London interbank market.\" (Mishkin Willig Decl. ex. 8; Isquith Willig Decl. ex. 8.) Again, we interpret this page to mean that while LIBOR represents an offered rate, actual transaction rates retain relevance in a bank's determination\n   of its LIBOR submission. The rate at which the bank is\n   <em>\n    actually receiving funding\n   </em>\n   is plainly relevant to how the bank forms its \"perception of its cost of unsecured funds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs also attribute to this webpage the BBA's statement that the 1998 revision to the LIBOR question \"enables accountability for the rates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mem. 12.) According to Exchange plaintiffs, \"[s]uch 'accountability' could be achieved\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if each Defendant preserved the 'offers' on which it based its daily submissions\" (emphasis added), and that \"all Defendants have engaged in the highly unusual, parallel conduct of refusing to maintain such offers or otherwise supply an 'accountable' offer as was promised by the BBA.\" (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mem. 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   Contrary to Exchange plaintiffs' assertion, the quoted statement actually appears in a May 2008 BBA memorandum. (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 3). But regardless of source, this argument is rank speculation. Exchange plaintiffs provide no cogent explanation for why the BBA's remark about \"accountability\" made in the process of changing the focus of the LIBOR question from a hypothetical prime bank to the specific panel bank making a submission bears on the distinction between transaction rates and offered rates and whether Dr. Willig properly analyzed actual transaction data. Rather, changing the scope of the LIBOR question to be panel bank-specific is consistent with one notion of \"accountability\" in that it requires the panel bank to focus on its own circumstances and not those of a hypothetical bank, a focus consistent with Dr. Willig's approach of examining the transactions in which a panel bank actually engaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Third, Exchange plaintiffs rely on a June 2008 BBA \"consultative paper\" titled \"Understanding the Construction and Operation of BBA LIBOR-Strengthening for the Future,\" (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 8), and what appear to be two earlier drafts from May 6, 2008 and May 13, 2008 (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 4; Isquith Willig Decl. ex. 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exchange plaintiffs quote the BBA's statement in the final paper that \"[t]here is confusion amongst market commentators about what BBA LIBOR is for, and how it is constructed,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the final paper also explains that \"[t]he rate at which each bank submits must be formed from that bank's perception of its cost of funds in the interbank market.\" (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 8.) As we have discussed, a panel bank's perception unquestionably includes the rates at which it is actually obtaining funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   The two earlier drafts discuss one potential change to LIBOR and the LIBOR question, \"[l]oosen[ing] the definition of what is 'offered.' \" (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 4; Isquith Willig Decl. ex. 11.) Specifically, the drafts propose that \"[a] change could be made [from the current \"offer\" definition] to the rate at which a bank can obtain unsecured funds.\" (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 4; Isquith Willig Decl. ex. 11.) This statement also supports the contention that LIBOR is an offered rate, but again says nothing to undermine the propriety of considering actual transaction rates in a bank's determination of its LIBOR submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.1.4. Additional Authorities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   Next, Exchange plaintiffs rely on a JPMorgan Chase internal document from 2010 that purports to set forth JPMorgan Chase's LIBOR-submission policy. According to Exchange plaintiffs, JPMorgan Chase's policy establishes that LIBOR submissions are \"not based on actual transaction[s]\" and that LIBOR is to be \"based upon the offered rate, and not the bid rate.\" (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mem. 10 (emphasis omitted).) As an initial matter, the characterization of this document as a JPMorgan Chase internal document is at least somewhat misleading, as Exchange plaintiffs do not acknowledge that the document quotes a significant portion of the BBA's\n   <em>\n    Definitions\n   </em>\n   page that Exchange plaintiffs have already cited. (Isquith Willig Decl. ex. 6; Mishkin Willig Decl. ex. 9.) Further, it is unpersuasive for the same reasons we find Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on the BBA's\n   <em>\n    Definitions\n   </em>\n   page unpersuasive: the first statement that \"rates are not based on actual transaction[s],\" when read in its proper context, refers to the fact that actual transactions may not occur in all currencies and all tenors, and the second statement that LIBOR is \"based upon the offered rate, and not the bid rate\" is irrelevant because Dr. Willig analyzes observed\n   <em>\n    transaction\n   </em>\n   rates, which are neither bid rates nor (as Exchange plaintiffs strenuously contend) offered rates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs also contend that \"academic papers have repeatedly followed\" the description of LIBOR as an offer rate, citing only\n   <em>\n    A Comparison of LIBOR to Other Measures of Bank Borrowing Costs\n   </em>\n   , a 2012 working paper coauthored by Dennis Kuo, a then-PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles, and two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank, David Skeie and James Vickery. (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 5 (\"Kuo, Skeie &amp; Vickery\")). They identify specifically the authors' statement that \"Libor is an offer rate\" and that \"Libor measures the rate at which banks estimate they would be offered unsecured funds, not the rate at which they would accept those offers.\" (Kuo, Skeie &amp; Vickery at 7 (emphasis omitted).) Setting aside the question of the weight to which the paper is entitled given its unpublished nature, we find nothing in this paper that undercuts Dr. Willig's reliance on observed transaction rates. Indeed, we find Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on this paper somewhat curious, as the authors devote a substantial portion of the paper to comparing LIBOR submissions to actual interbank loan rates calculated from a payment dataset published by the Federal Reserve. (Kuo, Skeie &amp; Vickery fig.5, tbl.2.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   In reply, Exchange plaintiffs also cite a February 2010 Credit Suisse Fixed Income Research report titled\n   <em>\n    A Guide to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the Front-End and Basis Swap Markets\n   </em>\n   , and in particular, the report's statement that \"[t]he fixed LIBOR rate is not precisely linked to the rate a contributing bank would bid for funding,\n   <em>\n    nor it is directly tied to the rate at which a given contributor would offer funding\n   </em>\n   .\" (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 6. (emphasis added)). But this statement diminishes, rather than heightens, the importance of the initial rates \"offered\" by a lending bank, as it provides on its face that a panel bank's LIBOR submission is \"not directly tied\" to any specific offers. Rather, the report continues: \"Instead, it reflects where a given bank deems it could borrow funds in reasonable size should it seek to do so. In essence, the banks are being asked to disclose the rate at which they\n   <em>\n    believe\n   </em>\n   the market would be willing to offer cash to them should they desire funding. It is the contributing bank's perception of where others would offer them funding. Sentiment is, therefore, critical for the direction of LIBOR.\" (Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 6.). This discussion again suggests that a panel bank's submission should be based on its \"perception\" of the rate at which it could receive funding. Though we have already so held, it bears repeating that the rate at which the bank is actually receiving funding is relevant to the bank's belief regarding the rate at which the market would be willing to offer it funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.1.5. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   In sum, the text of the LIBOR question and various documentary sources make clear that while LIBOR represents an offer rate and is not itself a transaction rate, rates observed in actual, consummated transactions are nonetheless properly considered in a panel bank's determination of its LIBOR submissions. In turn, because actual transaction rates are properly considered in a panel bank's determination of its LIBOR submissions, they are properly considered in our assessment of whether a bank's LIBOR submissions were suppressed and whether such suppression can be established through common evidence. Exchange plaintiffs' argument to the contrary-the necessary implication of their argument here-is simply unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs' criticism of Dr. Willig's secondary analysis, in which he analyzes \"the 95th percentile spread above the weighted average rate for each bank-tenor-day\" as a \"conservative measure of the ask rate,\" (Willig Initial Report \u00b6 67 &amp; n.68), is unpersuasive for the same reasons. Exchange plaintiffs cannot dispute that the Dr. Willig's 95th percentile measure is higher than, and therefore conservative as compared to, the weighted-average transaction rates examined in his primary analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.2. Data Sufficiency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs next argue that Dr. Willig's opinions are based on insufficient data. In particular, they contend that \"Dr. Willig states that 'Bank of America had Low LIBOR submissions on only 2 percent of tenor-days and JPMorgan on 4 percent of tenor-days' during the Suppression Period' [sic]\", and that for the 3-month tenor, this assessment is based on only 15 days and 4 days of data for Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, respectively. (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mem. 19.) In support of this argument, Exchange plaintiffs cite two authorities identifying problems posed by small sample sizes in the statistical context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   First, Exchange plaintiffs offer no explanation why an assessment of Dr. Willig's\n   sample size should be based on only one specific tenor. Rather, we expect more interbank lending activity in certain tenors than others, an expectation confirmed by the BBA's statement that \"not all banks will require funds in marketable size each day in each of the currencies and maturities they quote\" (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Stewart Willig Decl. ex. 2), and through a review of Appendix 5 to the Willig Initial Report (which indicates substantially more activity in the overnight, one week, and one-month tenors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   Indeed, Exchange plaintiffs have alleged persistent suppression of LIBOR based on the panel banks' reputational concerns, and offer no reason why those concerns would be reflected in only one tenor. They cite allegations that traders sought \"to profit from the widening of the spread between the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month LIBOR tenors\" (Proposed Third Am. Consolidated Class Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 226-27), and argue that \"[t]his spread trading strategy could not have been successful if all LIBOR tenors were manipulated in the same direction at the same time.\" (Exch.

Second, to the extent Dr. Willig's class certification opinions overlap with the merits question of whether LIBOR was in fact persistently suppressed, the \"rigorous analysis\" to be undertaken at class certification often \"will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   Ultimately, Exchange plaintiffs identify no authority for this \"gotcha\" argument that Dr. Willig did not expressly reserve the right to supplement his opinions if new information were made available to him.

Even if Exchange plaintiffs were not bound by the extensive history of their allegations that panel banks suppressed LIBOR by understating their actual \"borrowing costs,\" the motion is premised on a mischaracterization of Dr. Willig's report and Dr. Willig's analysis of rates observed in consummated transactions. Rather, we conclude from our review of the text of the LIBOR question and other interpretive sources that a panel bank's LIBOR submission should be based on its perception of the rates it would be offered and the \"totality of the information\" available to it. Rates observed in consummated transactions are, almost axiomatically, part of that \"totality of the information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Though the Exchange plaintiffs seek certification of a single class of EDF traders who \"were harmed\" by trader-based manipulation, persistent suppression, or both, we conclude that the class should be analyzed as two separate subclasses: (1) class members advancing claims under a trader-based manipulation theory and (2) those advancing claims under a persistent suppression theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(5) (\"When appropriate, a class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.\").

The prefatory language corresponds to the entire class period, January 1, 2005 to May 17, 2010, whereas subpart B.3 corresponds only to Period 0 (as Exchange plaintiffs have defined it), the period between January 1, 2005 to August 6, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   We first consider whether Exchange plaintiffs' proposed trader-based class relies on an impermissible \"fail-safe\" class definition as well as preliminary issues of standing, before turning to implied requirement ascertainability and the express requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   <strong>\n    3.1. \"Fail-Safe\" Class Definition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   Courts have taken varying approaches to the propriety of certifying a \"fail-safe\" class, or one that begs the liability question and is defined circularly in terms of legal injury.

The various decisions that certified a class that had been criticized for being impermissibly fail-safe-\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Royal Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fort Worth\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re IPO II\n   </em>\n   -each used the term \"damaged\" rather than \"harmed,\" thereby suggesting that Exchange plaintiffs meant the latter, but counsel at oral argument clarified that they meant the former. Hr'g Tr. 22:16-23:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   Interpreted this way, the proposed class definition's use of \"and were harmed\" in this context is not mere surplusage, unlike the use of \"and were damaged\" deemed inoffensive in the cases upon which Exchange plaintiffs rely. In each instance, the fact of \"damage\" to any class member could be imputed from other parts of the class definition. For example,\n   <em>\n    Royal Park\n   </em>\n   considered the impairment of certain residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) resulting from the trustee's alleged failure to fulfill certain contractual obligations and considered a proposed class encompassing \"[a]ll persons and entities who held Certificates in [certain RMBS trusts] and were damaged thereby.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201331288\">\n    2017 WL 1331288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2. The fact of damage could be implied from having held the RMBS certificates in question, since those certificates ultimately became impaired.\n   <em>\n    Fort Worth\n   </em>\n   considered an analogous factual circumstance (the issuance of RMBS certificates) and an analogous class definition (\"persons or entities who, prior to March 23, 2009, purchased or otherwise acquired any Certificates [in specified offerings] and were damaged thereby\").\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4241679\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/301/116/#p126\">\n    301 F.R.D. at 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in a typical securities fraud class action brought under Rule 10b-5-where the class period corresponds to the period during which the price of the security in question is inflated due to a defendant's material misrepresentations or omissions, and where the class definition refers to purchasers of securities during those periods-language such as \"and were damaged\" also becomes superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   The fact of damage follows from the fact of price inflation and the limitation of the class to purchasers, who by definition will have overpaid for the security in question.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/#p268\">\n    862 F.3d at 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   Not so here. The mere fact that a person or entity traded in EDFs during the class period does not mean that the trader was damaged, unlike the holder of an impaired RMBS certificate or the buyer of a security who purchased at an inflated price. Indeed, by arguing that Rabobank's \"fail-safe\" argument seeks \"to limit the Class prematurely to presently-known TBM dates,\" (Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 8), Exchange plaintiffs implicitly concede that the inclusion of \"and were harmed\" in the proposed class definition serves to incorporate traders \"harmed\" by currently unidentified instances of trader-based manipulation-instances that are, by definition, not otherwise captured in the class definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   However, we need not determine finally the impact of the class definition's use of \"and were harmed\" on whether the class may be certified, as Rule 23 does not explicitly preclude certification of fail-safe classes. Rather, the contention that a class is \"fail-safe\" often serves as shorthand for defects in the requirements explicitly set forth in Rule 23, including predominance in particular.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mazzei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4254213\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/288/45/#p55\">\n    288 F.R.D. at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The fail-safe appellation is simply a way of labeling the obvious problems that exist.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kamar v.

Though the record may not be as well-developed as at summary judgment, the class certification process in this case has nonetheless entailed extensive discovery (including the production of documents pertaining more to the merits than to class certification), and evidence establishing a named plaintiff's standing should be well within that plaintiff's control in any event.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    Denney\n   </em>\n   's stringent requirement that every class member have Article III standing coupled with its relaxed standard for what constitutes Article III \"injury,\" we conclude that the proposed trader-based class satisfies Article III's standing\n   requirements. For the thirteen instances of trader-based manipulation specifically identified by date in subparts B.1 and B.2 of the class definition, the direction of manipulation alleged and the trading position specified in the class definition are sufficient to ensure that each class member captured by these subparts has experienced some injury-in-fact. As to the catch-all for undiscovered instances of trader-based manipulation, the class definition's use of \"were harmed\" necessarily limits the prefatory language and subpart B.3 to individuals and entities that were injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   Additionally, Exchange plaintiffs have presented evidence of named plaintiff Atlantic Trading's standing to assert trader-based claims in response to our January 9, 2018 order directing the submission of data regarding the named plaintiffs' trading positions on the 13 days identified in subparts B.1 and B.2 of the class definition. (Decl. of Thomas Elrod, Jan. 16, 2018, ECF No. 2405.) While this submission also indicates certain named plaintiffs had no net trading position on the 13 identified days (or engaged in no trading at all), and Rabobank identifies significant issues as to named plaintiff 303030 Trading's ability to assert claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   these issues do not defeat the class's Article III standing. For purposes of the trader-based manipulation class, these named plaintiffs could be considered merely \"absent\" class members whose standing would be assessed on allegations and the class definition rather than on evidence, since we have already concluded that the proposed class definition satisfies\n   <em>\n    Denney\n   </em>\n   's requirements as to absent class members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2.2.

Ascertainability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   Rabobank, in its brief in opposition to class certification, contended that the proposed class was not ascertainable. Citing a lack of available trading records and Exchange plaintiffs' apparent difficulty in obtaining such records, Rabobank argued that the class was not ascertainable because it was not administratively feasible. (Rabobank TBM Opp'n 7-14.) Following the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   , Rabobank has generally recast its administrative feasibility arguments as predominance arguments, limiting its ascertainability argument to the critique that Exchange plaintiffs' use of \"were harmed\" in the class definition is insufficiently definite or objective. (Letter from David Gelfand to the Court, July 21, 2017, ECF No. 2098.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   Rabobank's administrative feasibility arguments now present predominance issues; they do not raise a serious ascertainability challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/#p268\">\n    862 F.3d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Ascertainability does not directly concern itself with the plaintiffs' ability to offer proof of membership, an issue that is already accounted for in Rule 23.\" (emphasis omitted)). To the extent that Rabobank continues to contest ascertainability, we conclude that the criteria Exchange plaintiffs have used, which define class members based on the timing of their trades, are sufficiently objective and definite to satisfy the \"modest\" ascertainability requirement. Though the class definition's use of \"and were harmed\" in the class definition is perhaps not as definite as would be ideal, it remains clear \"who is suing about what,\" which is all that ascertainability requires.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/#p268\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   <strong>\n    3.4.

Though this statistic does not correspond to Period 0 (as Rabobank correctly identifies), we nonetheless find that the number of large traders in Period 0 is unlikely to be so much smaller than the number of large traders identified by the CME from 2008 through 2010 such that numerosity would be called into question. Given this high starting point, the class definition more likely than not encompasses 40 members even if limited to class members with net positions on days with trader-based manipulation, thereby satisfying Rule 23(a)(1)'s numerosity requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pa.

Under this standard, we find that the question of the days on which manipulation of Rabobank's 3-month LIBOR submission could have impacted published LIBOR is one common to the class. The inputs to this determination-Rabobank's LIBOR submissions, the submissions\n   made by the other panel banks, and the interquartile trimming methodology applied by the BBA-are sufficient to yield an answer for all class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   Rabobank asserts that the answer to the question of whether its 3-month LIBOR submissions could have impacted published LIBOR will vary day-to-day and, by extension, from class member to class member. The point is well-taken, but Rabobank poses the wrong question: the same evidence-data series of each panel bank's LIBOR submissions-suffices to determine whether Rabobank's submission could have affected LIBOR on each day in the class period. There is no reason to conduct this analysis at the daily level (as Rabobank implicitly suggests) when historical LIBOR submissions data are available as a single data series for the entire Class Period-data on which Dr. Hubbard, Rabobank's own expert, relied. We accordingly conclude that this question is a common one, as \"the same evidence will suffice for each member to make a prima facie showing.\"\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1045 (quoting 2 William B.

This issue is mitigated, but not resolved entirely, by Exchange plaintiffs' submission regarding their trading positions (Decl. of Thomas Elrod, Jan. 16, 2018, ECF No. 2405), made pursuant to our January 9, 2018 order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jan. 9, 2018 Order, ECF No. 2400.\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   We consider each named plaintiff in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   First, we find that Atlantic Trading's claims are typical of the class's claims as to the 13 days specified in subparts B.1 and B.2 of the class definition. Exchange plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   submission shows that Atlantic Trading, for each of those 13 days, held a net trading position that would have been harmed by the direction of manipulation alleged: it took a long net position on EDFs on the four days identified in subpart B.1 and a short net position on EDFs on the nine days identified in subpart B.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   Second, we conclude that 303030 Trading's claims are not typical because 303030 Trading is subject to the unique defense that its claims were invalidly assigned to it from its principal, Bradley Belden. A report from the Illinois Secretary of State establishes that 303030 Trading was not formed until November 29, 2007, (Decl. of Robert Lindholm ex. 61, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2027), and therefore could not have engaged in trading during Period 0, which ended in August 2007. After Rabobank identified in its opposition brief that Belden had not assigned any of his claims to 303030 Trading, (Rabobank TBM Opp'n 19 n.15), Belden executed an assignment of claims to 303030 Trading on August 4, 2017-the date on which Exchange plaintiffs' reply briefs in support of class certification were due. (Decl. of Thomas Elrod ex. 33, Aug. 4, 2017, ECF No. 2176.) We previously reserved judgment on the validity of this assignment. Sept. 7, 2017 Order, ECF No. 2255, slip op. at *1 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   We now conclude that Belden's assignment is invalid. As a general matter, the assignee of a claim \"possess[es] the same interest\" as the assignor \"and thus may continue to assert a claim for the same injury shared by all members of the class.\"\n   <em>\n    Cordes &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5525984,5452973\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/91/\">\n    502 F.3d at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Second Circuit has recognized, \"[i]t is indeed commonplace for an assignee to institute or continue an action of his or her assignor on an assigned claim even though he or she, apart from the assignment, is without standing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5525984,5452973\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5525984,5452973\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/91/\">\n    at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the analysis in this case is complicated by the fact that 303030 Trading was voluntarily dissolved on October 25, 2011, as evidenced by the same report from the Illinois Secretary of State. (Decl. of Robert Lindholm ex. 61, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2027.) Under Illinois law, \"a limited liability company continues after dissolution\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   for the purpose of winding up its business,\" subject to limited exceptions. 805 Ill. Comp. Stat \u00a7 180/35-3(a). As relevant here, \"[a] person winding up a limited liability company's business (1) may ... prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5525984,5452973\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 180/35-4(c). But Belden's eleventh-hour assignment to 303030 Trading of claims-based at least in part on trades occurring prior to 303030 Trading's formation-can hardly be characterized as \"for the purpose of winding up [303030 Trading's] business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5525984,5452973\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 180/35-3(a). Rather, the assignment appears wholly unrelated to the business in which 303030 Trading may have engaged during its entirely post-Period 0 existence. 303030 Trading's claims were therefore not validly assigned and are, by extension, atypical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   But of course, we need not have concluded that Belden's assignment to 303030 Trading was in fact invalid under Illinois law to hold that 303030 Trading's claims are not typical. Rather, the mere fact that 303030 Trading's claims are subject to a unique defense involving this question of Illinois law, which does not appear to have been extensively addressed by Illinois courts, is sufficient to render them atypical.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Digital Music\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309686\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/321/64/#p97\">\n    321 F.R.D. at 97-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he defendant need not show at the certification stage that [a] unique defense will prevail.\" (second alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lapin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690357\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/254/168/#p179\">\n    254 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   179 )).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   Third, we also have serious doubts as to the typicality of Metzler's claims. Some ambiguity arises as to whether Metzler's\n   constituent funds are legally distinct entities with the capacity to sue and be sued. Counsel suggested at oral argument that they were legally distinct and that only certain of Metzler's funds had assigned their claims to Metzler Investment, the named plaintiff. (Hr'g Tr. 75:22-25.) However, Metzler's 30(b)(6) representative had previously testified that the funds were not separate legal entities (Neuman Dep. 92:19-93:4, Decl. of Robert Lindholm ex. 63, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2027), and Exchange plaintiffs had previously represented that \"[n]one of Metzler's funds have authority to bring legal claims themselves, and therefore all claims must instead be brought by Metzler as the funds' investment management company.\" (Letter from Christopher Lovell &amp; David Kovel to the Court, July 5, 2017, ECF No. 2044.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   To the extent Metzler's funds are not separate legal entities, netting of EDF trading positions would need to occur across\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Metzler's funds. \"[A] plaintiff both injured and enriched by illegal activity cannot choose to recover for his injuries yet retain his windfall\" where \"both result from a single wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Minpeco, S.A. v.

Aug. 2, 2013) ). At minimum, the fact that any ambiguity persists at this point as to Metzler's status weighs against a finding of typicality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   But even accepting counsel's representation that Exchange plaintiffs' supplemental submission corresponds to each of Metzler's funds \"that was relevant\" to Period 0 or subpart C.2 of the class definition (Hr'g Tr. 75:10), we nonetheless conclude that Metzler's claims are not typical as to any of the 13 days identified in subparts B.1 and B.2 of the class definition. Rather, the only day on which any of the identified funds held a net trading position was July 30, 2007, when one of the funds held +89 EDF contracts. This trading position does not fit subpart B.2, which refers to traders having \"sold Eurodollar futures contracts or purchased put options on Eurodollar futures\" on July 30, 2007. Accordingly, Metzler's claims are not typical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   Fourth, a similar problem befalls the typicality of FTC Futures Fund PCC's claims. The only days in which it held net trading positions are September 1, 2006, and August 6, 2007, when it held +152 EDF contracts and +338 EDF contracts, respectively. As with Metzler on July 30, 2007, both of these trading positions are inconsistent with subpart B.2's description of class members having sold EDF contracts (or purchased put options on EDF contracts) on those two days.

However, the record strongly supports a finding of conflicts between class members in the context of this action, as a named plaintiff has incentive to establish trader-based manipulation only on days when it held trading positions that would have been harmed by that manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-458\">\n   The classes in the three cases cited by Exchange plaintiffs, unlike the proposed class in this case, were defined to include only traders who transacted in a single direction and alleged manipulation in defined directions over the class period. For instance, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    In re Amaranth\n   </em>\n   alleged that defendants \"artificially inflat[ed] the spread between [certain] contracts\" and \"artificially depress[ed] settlement prices\" and limited their proposed class to purchasers of natural gas futures contracts who did so for certain trading purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Amaranth\n   </em>\n   , 269 F.R.D. at 373-74. Similarly, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Kohen I\n   </em>\n   alleged that defendants sought to \"profit from artificially high prices\" of a certain futures contract and defined the proposed class to include only traders who purchased \"a [specific] Treasury note futures contract in order to liquidate a short position.\"\n   <em>\n    Kohen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3038198\" index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/244/469/\">\n    244 F.R.D. at 473, 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    In re Sumitomo Copper\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs alleged that \"copper futures contract prices rose to artificially high levels by reason of conspiratorial misconduct of defendants\" and created sub-classes for plaintiffs with long positions and plaintiffs with short positions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348810\" index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/182/85/\">\n    182 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   87 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348810\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/182/85/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348810\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/182/85/\">\n    at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining subclasses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   The proposed class here remains far more open-ended. The class definition is indeterminate not only as to the days on which trader-based manipulation occurred, but also the direction of manipulation on those days. This indeterminancy presents far more opportunity for conflicting incentives between class members than existed in\n   <em>\n    In re Amaranth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kohen I\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re Sumitomo Copper\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   An examination of the trading records produced by named plaintiff Atlantic Trading, the named plaintiff FTC Futures Fund entities, and Bradley Belden (who assigned his claims to named plaintiff 303030 Trading), confirms that these conflicts are concrete and hardly hypothetical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consider, for example, the trading position data presented in Exchange plaintiffs' January 16, 2018 submission. (Decl. of Thomas Elrod, Jan. 16, 2018, ECF No. 2405.) Again accepting as valid the underlying calculations, these data show conflicts between named plaintiffs on several of the 13 days specifically identified in the class definition. For instance, on September 1, 2006, while Atlantic Trading had a net trading position of -205.92 EDF contracts, FTC Futures Fund PCC had a net trading position of +152 EDF contracts and FTC Futures Fund SICAV had a net trading position of +405 EDF contracts. Similarly, on July 30, 2007, while Atlantic Trading had a net trading position of -2,162.68 EDF contracts, Metzler had a net trading position of +89 contracts. And finally, on August 6, 2007, while Atlantic Trading had a net trading position of -387.52\n   EDF contracts, FTC Futures Fund PCC had a net trading position of +338 EDF contracts. On those days, the named plaintiffs with opposite net trading positions will have directly conflicting incentives to establish not only the existence but also the magnitude of any manipulation that occurred on those dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-461\">\n   Further, if Dr. Seyhun's various models of suppression were admissible, the estimates of suppression that they produce-differing in both direction and magnitude-would further undermine the adequacy of named plaintiffs' representation by heightening conflicts between class members' interests. Directional differences are particularly corrosive of adequacy in that they create directly conflicting incentives, but differences in the magnitude of suppression will similarly cause different class members to advocate for different models.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   We therefore conclude that the proposed class fails to meet Rule 23(a)(4)'s adequacy of representation requirement. We find that class members' differing exposures to EDFs on different trading days creates differences between class members (both named plaintiffs and absent members) that undermine the class representatives' incentive to fully pursue the class's claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Payment Card Interchange Fee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922741\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/223/#p231\">\n    827 F.3d at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To reiterate, a named plaintiff has an incentive to establish trader-based manipulation only on days when it held trading positions that would have been harmed by that manipulation. That is, phrased in the negative, a named plaintiff has no incentive to establish trader-based manipulation on a day on which it had no exposure to EDFs and has active\n   <em>\n    dis\n   </em>\n   incentive to establish trader-based manipulation when the direction of that manipulation benefited its trading positions-even if that manipulation harmed more class members or harmed class members in the aggregate. Exchange plaintiffs' own analysis of trading positions belies the contention that \"all class members ... have the same interest in proving price artificiality\" (Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 16), and they ultimately offer no reason to believe that conflicts of this type do not exist within named plaintiffs and between named plaintiffs and absent class members throughout the class period, especially in light of the active, two-sided nature of the EDF trading market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   <strong>\n    3.5.

This argument distorts our prior holding, and Exchange plaintiffs' reliance is misplaced.

Existence and Causation of Artificial EDF Prices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-473\">\n   In order for the existence of artificial EDF prices and Rabobank's causation of those artificial prices to be common questions, Exchange plaintiffs must establish that classwide methodologies are available to determine (1) what LIBOR submissions panel banks would have made (and by extension, what LIBOR would have been) absent trader-based manipulation and (2) what impact a change from actual published LIBOR to but-for published LIBOR would have had on EDF prices. They have done neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   To satisfy the first requirement, Exchange plaintiffs rely on Dr. Seyhun's Rebuttal Period 0 model, which they assert produces \"estimate[s] of what LIBOR submissions would have been absent TBM-for each panel bank on the dates during Period 0 for which there exists documented evidence of TBM.\" (Exch.

A detailed examination of trader communications, which necessarily pertain to a single date or a limited number of days, will in turn relate only to class members with net trading positions on those days and not all class members. Indeed, we note that in a summary table identifying documentary evidence of trader-based manipulation that Exchange plaintiffs submitted in support of class certification, no document appears to pertain to manipulation by more than one bank or by the same bank on more than five days.

Again, our exclusion of those models under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   dictates the conclusion that Exchange plaintiffs have not established that impact of changes in LIBOR on EDF prices is a common question. Macroeconomic events impact both LIBOR and EDF prices (as Exchange plaintiffs have conceded), and Dr. Seyhun's model is incapable of parsing the effects of those events from the effect of changes in LIBOR itself. But even if this flaw were insufficient to render Dr. Seyhun's impact factor models inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , a mismatch would remain between Exchange plaintiffs' theory of harm and impact on EDF prices (and by extension, damages), as measured by Dr. Seyhun's models.\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exchange plaintiffs have never alleged an entitlement to recover for damages incurred as a result of macroeconomic events (nor could they plausibly do so), and Dr. Seyhun's impact factor models therefore \"fail[ ] to measure damages resulting from the particular ... injury on which [plaintiffs'] liability in this action is premised.\"\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/#p33\">\n    569 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/#p33\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-477\">\n   Further, even assuming that any change in EDF prices caused by a change in LIBOR may be isolated and measured, the issue of the minimum price increments in which EDFs trade (or \"tick sizes\") precludes the conclusion that the existence and causation of artificial prices are common questions. Exchange plaintiffs have offered no methodology to determine when a particular trade would have been impacted by changes in LIBOR: rather, Dr. Seyhun and Dr. Netz each offer probabilistic opinions that are incapable of making such a determination. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 216; Netz Initial Report 38.) Contrary to the suggestion that Dr. Seyhun's probabilistic formula (which divides artificiality on a given day by the minimum price increment)\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   is \"a methodology to determine when [a change in LIBOR] in fact affected EDF prices\" (Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 19 n.33), the output of this formula is a probability, not a concrete yes-or-no answer (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6 216).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   Indeed, Exchange plaintiffs' subsequent argument, that this formula establishes that tick size \"will either nullify the effect of LIBOR artificiality on the day in question, or amplify it,\" demonstrates the formula's very weakness. (Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 19 n.33.) Of course, if the tick size \"nullif[ies] the effect of LIBOR artificiality\" on a given day (which will occur with a certain probability per Dr. Seyhun and Dr. Netz), Exchange plaintiffs will have failed to establish both the existence of artificial prices and Rabobank's causation of those prices on that day. Exchange plaintiffs' argument, therefore, is tantamount to a\n   concession that Dr. Seyhun's models cannot (even setting aside the causation question) methodically separate instances when artificial EDF prices existed as a result of LIBOR manipulation and when they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-479\">\n   <strong>\n    3.5.4.

The possibility that certain FCMs (panel bank affiliates or otherwise) may have retained some records, as suggested by counsel at oral argument (Hr'g Tr. 11:3-8; 12:12-13:2), is insufficient. Accordingly, even to the extent a common formula to calculate damages is available, the question of the data to which that formula will be applied remains.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   In this action, common questions do not predominate over individual ones. While the proposed trader-based class certainly raises a common question as to Rabobank's ability to impact LIBOR, this common question is outnumbered and substantially outweighed by individual questions relating to whether Rabobank (or its traders) had intent to manipulate EDF prices, by how much LIBOR was manipulated (if at all), what impact that manipulation ultimately had on EDF prices, and by how much each individual class member was damaged. The proposed class therefore does not satisfy, and does not come close to satisfying, Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   <strong>\n    3.6. Superiority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-487\">\n   Rule 23(b)(3)'s superiority inquiry asks whether class status would be superior to the maintenance of individual actions. Our analysis is guided by the four factors set forth in Rule 23(b)(3),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073876\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/70/#p82\">\n    780 F.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , though the factors are not exclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-488\">\n   First, we find that class members have a strong interest in controlling the prosecution of separate actions, given the extent of conflicting interests we have identified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A). Though this case unquestionably presents complex issues, we find that individual actions would allow individual plaintiffs to better tailor the necessary inquiries into potential trader-based manipulation to the days on which they had net trading positions and\n   would not require them to assert that certain instances of trader-based manipulation occurred when those instances either do not pertain to them at all or would actively reduce their recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-489\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs' point that many class members may have \"negative value\" claims (where the cost of prosecuting an individual action would greatly outweigh any recovery) has some force, and we agree that class members may lack incentive to pursue individual actions to at least some extent. Nonetheless, we view this case as easily distinguishable from cases such as consumer class actions, in which class members allege harm that is small in magnitude but generally certain in existence. By contrast, the two-sided, zero-sum nature of the EDF trading market involved in this case likely results in many EDF traders not having been harmed (or having benefited outright) from any EDF price impact caused by LIBOR manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-490\">\n   That is, we should distinguish \"negative\" value claims-those in which the cost of prosecution exceeds recovery-from truly\n   <em>\n    negative\n   </em>\n   value claims-those in which the class member actually benefited from the conduct in question. To the extent a putative class includes a substantial number of members who were not ultimately damaged, the \"negative\" value rationale for superiority advanced by Exchange plaintiffs is properly evaluated against a concern regarding the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   effect that a certified class may have.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Kohen II, 571 F.3d at 677-78 (\"A related point is that a class should not be certified if it is apparent that it contains a great many persons who have suffered no injury at the hands of the defendant, if only because of the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   character of a class action.\" (citations omitted));\n   <em>\n    Newton v.

That appears to be the case here, and we accordingly conclude the first Rule 23(b)(3) factor weighs against superiority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-491\">\n   Second, we find that the extent and nature of any litigation already begun by class members weighs in favor of superiority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

First, Exchange plaintiffs have been on notice of the potential fail-safe class definition issue presented by their proposed definition for more than a year, when we expressed concern that \"[s]uch a class necessarily raises individual questions, as the factfinder must determine whether an individual has a claim in order to determine whether he or she belongs in the class.\" May 13, 2016 Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"406\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202851333\">\n    2016 WL 2851333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, slip op. at *4.

Because Exchange plaintiffs suggest modification without prejudice to the inclusion of additional instances of trader-based manipulation, the adequacy of representation issues identified above remain: class members, based on their trading positions, have conflicting incentives as to the discovery of those additional instances and to their inclusion in subsequent modifications of the class definition. And even if the class definition were ultimately limited to the 13 dates specified in the current definition, such a modification would not meaningfully alter the predominance analysis such that we would conclude that common questions predominate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   <strong>\n    3.7.2. Day-by-Day Subclasses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-504\">\n   In a footnote in reply, Exchange plaintiffs assert that the creation of \"single-day subclasses would meet Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirements\" if a broad class corresponding to the entire class period were not certified. (Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 13-14 n.26.) The creation of day-by-day subclasses may address some of the typicality and adequacy of representation issues that we have identified, but would not sufficiently alter the predominance calculus such that common questions would predominate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-505\">\n   Further, under Rule 23(b)(3)'s superiority prong, day-by-day subclasses are likely to become sufficiently numerous to render a class action utterly unmanageable. Even based on the current proposed class definition, day-by-day subclasses would require the creation of\n   <em>\n    thirteen\n   </em>\n   subclasses within the trader-based class, and the possibility that additional instances of trader-based manipulation beyond those currently identified (a point that Exchange plaintiffs have repeatedly emphasized) necessarily entails the likely creation of even more subclasses. For example, one declaration submitted by Exchange plaintiffs lists 62 dates in its \"Timeline of Panel Bank Defendants' Trader-Based Manipulation of LIBOR,\" (Decl. of Thomas Elrod \u00b6 203, May 2, 2017, ECF No. 1890), and Dr. Netz considers evidence of 163 instances of trader-based manipulation (Netz Initial Report 29-31).\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-506\">\n   While Rule 23(c)(5) unquestionably allows for the creation of subclasses \"[w]hen appropriate,\" we find little appropriate about the establishment of dozens, if not hundreds, of subclasses.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manual for Complex Litigation\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 21.23 (4th ed. 2004) (\"The creation of a number of subclasses ... may make the case unmanageable [and] may defeat the superiority requirement.\").

So too here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-507\">\n   <strong>\n    3.8. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-508\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs' motion for certification of a trader-based class is denied. We find that the proposed class meets the numerosity and commonality requirements of Rule 23(a) and the implied requirement of ascertainability, but fails to meet the typicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a) and the predominance and superiority requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). We decline Exchange plaintiffs' invitations to exercise our discretion to modify the class definition. Omitting \"were harmed\" from the class definition would do little to ameliorate the predominance and superiority problems from which the proposed class suffers, and even to the extent that day-by-day subclasses would resolve the typicality and adequacy of representation problems that we identify above, they would not tip the predominance balance and would additionally create intractable management problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-509\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Suppression Class\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-510\">\n   A suppression class, to the extent one is certified, would consist of (1) traders purchasing EDF contracts with less than 365 days to expiration between April 15, 2009 and May 17, 2010 (Period 3) as specified in subpart C.2 of the class definition and (2) traders who transacted in EDF contracts or options during Period 3 and \"were harmed\" as a result of LIBOR suppression, which corresponds to subpart C.1 of the class definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because antitrust claims are no longer at issue in this action, subpart A and the pre-Period 3 claims it encompasses are no longer figure into the class certification analysis-a point the parties acknowledged at oral argument. (Hr'g Tr. 25:10-21.) Accordingly, in the remainder of our analysis of the proposed suppression class, we will consider only Period 3 CEA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-511\">\n   Before proceeding to the analysis of the proposed suppression class, we consider another preliminary issue: the impact of Rabobank's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions. While Rabobank moved to exclude the opinions offered by Exchange plaintiffs' experts in the trader-based context, UBS did not. Nonetheless, to the extent that we have granted Rabobank's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions and excluded certain opinions offered by Exchange plaintiffs' experts, we will not consider those opinions as evidence in our analysis of the suppression class's compliance with Rule 23. After all, Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence establishes threshold requirements that an expert opinion must satisfy before that opinion may be considered; nothing in the Rule suggests that expert testimony offered for the same purpose that is determined to be insufficiently reliable in one context (or as to one defendant) may somehow become cured of that reliability flaw in another context (or as to another defendant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1. Class Definition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   At the outset, UBS criticizes the class definition's use of \"were harmed,\" contending that the proposed class amounts to an impermissible fail-safe class. (UBS Suppr. Opp'n 11-13.) While Exchange plaintiffs' use of \"were harmed\" is initially ambiguous, they subsequently clarify that a class\n   member is \"harmed\" by suppression if it: (1) \"purchased an EDF contract when prices were artificially inflated\"; (2) \"sold an EDF contract when prices were artificially depressed\"; (3) \"purchased an EDF call option or sold an EDF put option when EDF prices were artificially inflated\"; or (4) \"sold an EDF put or call option when EDF prices were artificially depressed.\" (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 29.) This fourth criteria, as currently formulated, directly conflicts with the third criteria; we assume Exchange plaintiffs meant to say \"sold an EDF put\n   <em>\n    option\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    purchased an EDF\n   </em>\n   call option when EDF prices were artificially depressed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   Such clarity would have been helpful at the outset, but we find no reason not to analyze the proposed class using the definition of \"harmed\" set forth in Exchange plaintiffs' reply. Exchange plaintiffs suggest that criteria (2) and (4) were never triggered during the suppression period as a categorical matter because LIBOR was strictly suppressed, but even Dr. Seyhun finds that actual published LIBOR sometimes exceeded but-for LIBOR. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report figs.14.1-14.17.) Accordingly, we interpret \"harmed\" to include all four criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-515\">\n   <strong>\n    4.2. Ascertainability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   UBS, in its brief submitted prior to the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   , argued that Exchange plaintiffs' difficulties in obtaining trading records render the proposed class unascertainable on account of administrative infeasibility. (UBS Suppr. Opp'n 13-14.) As with Rabobank's ascertainability arguments, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   's rejection of an administrative feasibility requirement deprives these arguments of persuasive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/#p268\">\n    862 F.3d at 268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As with the trader-based subclass, we conclude that the suppression-based subclass is ascertainable under\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   's standard: the proposed class definition incorporates objective and definite criteria that limit the class based on the dates and types of trades in which members engaged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.3.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-517\">\n   <strong>\n    4.3. Rule 23(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-518\">\n   UBS does not dispute that the proposed persistent-suppression class satisfies Rule 23(a)(1)'s numerosity requirement and Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement. We similarly conclude that these requirements are satisfied. As with the trader-based subclass, we find that the evidence regarding the number of \"large traders\" who traded on the CME during the suppression period (which includes Period 3) is sufficient to establish that the proposed class more likely than not contains at least 40 members and accordingly satisfies the numerosity requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.3.4.1. We also conclude that the question of whether panel bank suppressed LIBOR by making artificially low submissions throughout the suppression period is a common question, as evidence sufficient for one class member to establish that the panel bank did so will be sufficient for all other class members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   <strong>\n    4.3.1. Typicality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   UBS argues that the named plaintiffs' claims are not typical of the class's because class members hold \"hopelessly conflicting\n   interests.\" (UBS Suppr. Opp'n 25.) Under this theory, class members have differing incentives to establish the magnitude of suppression on a given day based on the trading positions they held on that day. In response, Exchange plaintiffs contend that the named plaintiffs and absent class members' claims involve \"common questions of law ... and the same course of conduct.\" (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   We conclude, as we do in the trader-based context, that 303030 Trading and Metzler's claims are not typical of the class's. 303030 Trading remains subject to the unique defense that its claims were not validly assigned to it,\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the lack of clarity as to the legal status of Metzler's funds renders its claims atypical in this context as well. Additionally, we conclude that named plaintiff Gary Francis's claims are atypical, as the evidence shows that over Period 3, Francis had no net trading position and Dr. Seyhun's methodologies would show that he ultimately benefited from LIBOR suppression.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ordover Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 144-46, tbl.24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   Accordingly, only Atlantic Trading, the two FTC Futures Fund entities, and Nathanial Haynes remain. As to these named plaintiffs, we conclude that their claims are typical of the class's. Their claims, along with the absent class members' claims, arise generally from the same course of events: the alleged pattern of suppressing LIBOR submissions motivated by reputational concerns. Unlike the episodic nature of trader-based manipulation alleged in the trader-based class that animated our concerns as to class standing and typicality, the LIBOR suppression alleged here is inherently persistent and can be reasonably characterized as a single course of conduct by each panel bank. We therefore conclude, for this subset of named plaintiffs, that their claims are typical of the class's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   <strong>\n    4.3.2. Adequacy of Representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   In challenging adequacy of representation, UBS relies on the same conflicting-interest argument supporting its typicality challenge. (UBS Suppr. Opp'n 25.) Exchange plaintiffs respond that \"[a]ll Plaintiffs have an interest in proving the maximum claim against Defendants,\" and that conflicts, to the extent they exist, are therefore not sufficiently serious to justify a finding of inadequacy of representation. (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-525\">\n   UBS correctly asserts that because Exchange plaintiffs not only held different trading positions over the class period but have also offered multiple models yielding different estimates of suppression, conflicts between class members will arise because different class members will prefer different models that maximize their recovery. Exchange plaintiffs' suggestion that \"[n]o Plaintiff controls, or wants to control, the price artificiality in the expert reports,\" (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 35), is simply incorrect, in light of the numerous models they have offered. Each plaintiff certainly has in interest in maximizing its claim against defendants, but Exchange\n   plaintiffs' response ignores entirely the difficulty that UBS correctly identifies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-526\">\n   Nonetheless, in the suppression context, we find that the conflicts created by class members' conflicting trading positions and disparate preferences for one but-for LIBOR model over others do not rise to the level of \"fundamental\" conflicts that preclude a finding of adequacy of representation. A comparison to the trader-based class, and the fundamental conflict that we identified there, is again illustrative. Unlike that class, where Exchange plaintiffs have left open the possibility of additional instances of trader-based manipulation of unknown direction and magnitude, the contours of Exchange plaintiffs' suppression claims are far more clearly defined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.3.4.4. The open-ended nature of the trader-based claims significantly amplified the conflicts generated by disparate trading positions and competing models in that context; those enhancements are not present here. We accordingly conclude that adequacy of representation is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-527\">\n   <strong>\n    4.4. Predominance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-528\">\n   We analyze predominance with respect to plaintiffs' suppression-based CEA claims using the same four elements that we considered with respect to Exchange plaintiffs' trader-based claims: \"(1) that defendant had the ability to influence market prices; (2) that he specifically intended to do so; (3) that artificial prices existed; and (4) that defendant caused the artificial prices.\"\n   <em>\n    LIBOR I\n   </em>\n   , 935 F.Supp.2d at 713 (alterations incorporated).\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   As before, EDFs remain the commodity in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LIBOR II\n   </em>\n   , 962 F.Supp.2d at 612 ;\n   <em>\n    LIBOR I\n   </em>\n   , 935 F.Supp.2d at 721.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-529\">\n   <strong>\n    4.4.1. Intent to Influence EDF Prices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-530\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs must establish specific intent to influence market prices, which in this action requires a showing of intent to manipulate EDF prices. Because EDFs are the commodity in question and not LIBOR, we again conclude that the question of intent to manipulate EDF prices is an individual question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-531\">\n   Evidence going towards panel banks' intent to manipulate\n   <em>\n    LIBOR\n   </em>\n   will generally apply throughout the suppression period and therefore pertain to all class members. A panel bank suppressing its LIBOR submission on one day based on reputational concerns is likely to have done so the day before and is likely to have done so the day after, as its reputational concerns are unlikely to materialize and disappear entirely from day to day over the financial crisis and suppression period. Accordingly, evidence showing that a panel bank possessed or lacked a reputation-based intent to suppress LIBOR on one day will be highly probative of that bank's intent (or lack thereof) throughout the suppression period. Indeed, if the critical inquiry were whether panel banks had intent to manipulate LIBOR, we would conclude that it is a common question weighing in favor of a finding of predominance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-532\">\n   But it is not, and the common nature of the question of intent to manipulate LIBOR does not translate to the EDF context. Establishing intent to manipulate EDF prices through reputation-motivated suppression of LIBOR is at least somewhat paradoxical, and we have considerable difficulty imagining what evidence tending to show (or disprove) such intent would even look like, let alone whether that evidence would pertain to all class members or only a few. To the extent we\n   can even conceive of any such evidence, that evidence would more closely resemble the individualized, day-specific, panel bank-specific evidence that Exchange plaintiffs rely on in the trader-based context than the broadly scoped evidence pertaining to a panel bank's suppression of LIBOR submissions based on an intent to protect its reputation. We accordingly conclude that the question of specific intent to influence EDF prices through reputation-driven suppression of LIBOR is an individual question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-533\">\n   <strong>\n    4.4.2. Existence and Causation of EDF Prices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-534\">\n   As in the context of trader-based manipulation, Exchange plaintiffs must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that classwide methodologies are available to determine both but-for LIBOR and how the difference between but-for LIBOR and actual LIBOR would have impacted EDF prices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   They again have done neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-535\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs rely on Dr. Seyhun's ICAP-Ask-based models and his Rebuttal Suppression Model to meet this burden. (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 3-10.) This question is closer than in the trader-based context because the suppression class considers across-the-board suppression during the later portions of the class period, which by construction is one-directional. Nonetheless, given that we have excluded Dr. Seyhun's opinions to this effect under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , they are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laumann v. Nat'l Hockey League\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360014\" index=\"409\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/105/384/#p398\">\n    105 F.Supp.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398-99 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (\"Here, [the expert's] model was the common evidence-and the model has been excluded. Therefore, no [ Rule 23 ](b)(3) class may be certified.\"). Nonetheless, we discuss here two further criticisms of Dr. Seyhun's Rebuttal Suppression Model offered by UBS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-536\">\n   First, UBS asserts that Dr. Seyhun's reliance on the ICAP-Ask data series in his Rebuttal Suppression model fails to account for differences in credit risk between the broader category of prime banks underlying the ICAP-Ask data and LIBOR panel banks. (Defs.' Upstream Opp'n 19-20.) Exchange plaintiffs' rejoinder-that Dr. Seyhun \"does adjust his analysis to take account of each Defendant's credit worthiness\"-is entirely nonresponsive. (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 8.) UBS argues that the ICAP-Ask series on which Dr. Seyhun relies in his Initial ICAP-Ask Models and Rebuttal Suppression Models fails to account for differences in credit risk between panel banks and other prime non-panel banks, not differences in credit risk within panel banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-537\">\n   Second, UBS contends that Dr. Seyhun's analysis of the relationship between CDS spreads and LIBOR submissions is flawed. (UBS Suppr. Opp'n 34-35.) Since, within the Rebuttal Suppression model,\n   CDS spreads serve as an input to the Rebuttal Suppression model that Dr. Seyhun uses to control for differences in panel banks' LIBOR submissions attributable to differences in credit risk, the absence of a relationship between CDS spreads and LIBOR submissions suggests that the Rebuttal Suppression Model does not sufficiently control for differences in credit risk across panel banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-538\">\n   According to UBS, Dr. Seyhun's regressions are based on an improper benchmark period that incorporates pre-Class Period CDS spread data, even though Dr. Seyhun himself suggests that inclusion of pre-Class Period CDS spread data is inappropriate. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 416-17.) Dr. Willig, in turn, determines that Dr. Seyhun's methodology would show no statistically significant relationship between a bank's LIBOR submission and its CDS spread when the pre-Class Period CDS spread data is omitted from Dr. Seyhun's regressions (Willig Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 6-12). Exchange plaintiffs respond that this critique is not \"passably scientific\" because Dr. Willig has not offered a justification for excluding pre-Class Period ICAP-Ask data from his analysis in addition to excluding the pre-Class Period CDS spread data disavowed by Dr. Seyhun. (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-539\">\n   This \"passably scientific\" critique demonstrates a failure to properly interpret Dr. Willig's report or a failure to understand econometrics. To the extent Exchange plaintiffs challenge Dr. Willig's analysis of the LIBOR submission-CDS spread relationship presented in the Seyhun Initial Report, that analysis did not rely on ICAP-Ask data. (Seyhun Initial Report tbl.2.5.) To the extent Exchange plaintiffs challenge Dr. Willig's discussion of the LIBOR submission-CDS spread analysis presented in the Seyhun Rebuttal Report, they fail to understand how regressions are conducted. In order to exclude the pre-Class Period CDS spread data (which Dr. Seyhun acknowledges are uninformative), Dr. Willig changed the benchmark period, a change that necessarily applies to every time-series explanatory variable included in the regression. Here, that necessarily includes both the ICAP-Ask series and the multiple CDS spread series (corresponding to each panel bank) on which Dr. Seyhun relied. By construction, a regression does not incorporate time-series data from outside the benchmark period in order to estimate the relationship between the variables in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-540\">\n   In sum, we conclude that Exchange plaintiffs have not established that the determination of what submissions each panel bank would have made in the absence of suppression is a common question. Each of the models relied upon by Exchange plaintiffs is insufficiently reliable, as we have concluded above, and their further defenses of Dr. Seyhun's Rebuttal Suppression Model are incoherent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-541\">\n   As to the second question, what impact changes in LIBOR would have had on EDF prices, we again conclude that the question is an individual one. Dr. Seyhun's and Dr. Netz's opinions remain inadmissible at the threshold under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , but they would do little more to meet Exchange plaintiffs' burden even if they were admissible. Dr. Seyhun's \"impact factor\" models remain confounded by macroeconomic variables, again resulting in a mismatch between Exchange plaintiffs' theory of harm and the impact on EDF prices that it calculates, a disparity that is impermissible under\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/#p33\">\n    569 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/#p33\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This flaw is no less fatal here than in the trader-based context. Further, Dr. Seyhun and Dr. Netz's probabilistic \"tick size\" opinions equally establish that Exchange plaintiffs cannot determine with any certainty which trades were in fact impacted by LIBOR manipulation,\n   whether in the context of trader-based manipulation or in the context of suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-542\">\n   This conclusion as to the relationship between changes in LIBOR and changes in EDF prices is bolstered by evidence that while LIBOR is published only once each day, EDF prices fluctuate significantly within a trading day in magnitudes greater than day-to-day changes in LIBOR, and by evidence that EDF prices and LIBOR move in inconsistent directions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ordover Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 65-75.) We also find noteworthy Exchange plaintiffs' experts' acknowledgement that LIBOR and EDFs have a two-way causal relationship, an acknowledgement confirmed by at least one academic paper (cited by Dr. Seyhun and Dr. Netz) that measures information transfer in both directions from LIBOR to EDF prices and from EDF prices to LIBOR. Indeed, we interpret Dr. Seyhun's cointegration findings to be consistent with such a two-way causal relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-543\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs advance numerous additional arguments and identify further pieces of evidence in their attempt to establish that changes in LIBOR cause changes in EDF prices. We find them unpersuasive taken together, but discuss several specific arguments below. First, Exchange plaintiffs assert that \"the EDF market's expectation today of what 3-month LIBOR will be at the EDF expiration is based upon today's LIBOR.\" (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 12.) This statement is true, but only to a limited extent: the evidence establishes that far more relevant than today's LIBOR is the market's expectations regarding macroeconomic conditions at expiration. Though LIBOR may capture some of those conditions and events, LIBOR does not itself form the basis of those expectations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-544\">\n   Second, Exchange plaintiffs' attempt to portray the lack of immediate response in EDF trading prices to the publication of LIBOR as a strength of their case rather than a weakness is incomprehensible. (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 12). Rather, the lack of response in EDF trading prices is more consistent with the proposition that changes in LIBOR do not necessarily cause measurable changes in EDF prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-545\">\n   Equally unpersuasive are Exchange plaintiffs' arbitrage and \"overlap\" theories of causation. (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 14-15.) Dr. Seyhun and Dr. Netz do not articulate workable arbitrage strategies, as LIBOR is not a tradable asset. (Ordover Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 60-63.) And as we discussed in the context of Exchange plaintiffs' motion to exclude Dr. Culp's opinions, the overlap theory is nonsensical; this finding is confirmed by Dr. Ordover's analysis showing a lack of convergence between spot LIBOR and expected LIBOR at settlement implied by EDF prices as Dr. Seyhun's theory would require, despite increasing overlap between the time periods in question. (Ordover Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 5-15, figs.1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-546\">\n   Finally, we are unpersuaded by Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on the \"chronological sequence of events on April 16-18, 2008,\" (Exch.

We previously found unpersuasive the April 16-18, 2008 example,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LIBOR VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207378980\">\n    2016 WL 7378980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22, slip op. at *57-59, and Exchange plaintiffs' additional gloss on that example does not cause us to reassess that conclusion. Again, EDF prices appeared to react to the announcement (that LIBOR appeared to have been suppressed)\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   LIBOR itself increased in response to this announcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-547\">\n   But even assuming we were to find this example at least somewhat persuasive, we are skeptical that a single example corresponding to three days of the class period-days that we have identified as having particular significance-that are likely less than representative of the broader class period.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LIBOR IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206243526\">\n    2015 WL 6243526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *114-15, slip op. at *274-78. Similarly, evidence that some plaintiffs considered LIBOR in making their EDF trading decisions establish that changes in LIBOR would cause changes in EDF trading prices; such behavior is equally consistent with LIBOR serving as a proxy for the macroeconomic conditions and business events that Exchange plaintiffs concede drive both LIBOR and EDF prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-548\">\n   <strong>\n    4.4.3. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   We find, as we do for the trader-based class, that the question of damages is an individual question of significant magnitude, given the extensive difficulties plaintiffs have experienced in obtaining trading records and the netting requirements that will be imposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.3.5.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-550\">\n   <strong>\n    4.4.4. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-551\">\n   We ultimately conclude that Exchange plaintiffs have not established that common questions predominate over individual ones. The limited number of common questions are substantially outweighed by individualized questions of specific intent to manipulate EDF prices through reputation-motivated suppression of LIBOR, existence and causation of artificial EDF prices, and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-552\">\n   <strong>\n    4.5. Superiority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-553\">\n   We again analyze superiority using the Rule 23(b)(3) factors and again find a lack of superiority. First, favoring superiority, we find that class members lack a strong interest in controlling the prosecution of separate actions, even though we remain unmoved by the \"negative value\" argument advanced by plaintiffs for the reasons articulated in our analysis of this factor in the trader-based context and based on evidence showing that at least several of the named plaintiffs were not harmed by LIBOR suppression.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.3.6. The conflicts within the class, limited in significance by the one-directional nature of Exchange plaintiffs' allegations of\n   <em>\n    suppression\n   </em>\n   here, and the presence of only one separate action concerning LIBOR manipulation in the context of EDF trading persuades us that this factor tips in favor of superiority. Next, our analysis of the second and third factors remains unchanged from our analysis in the trader-based context. The extent and nature of litigation already begun weighs in favor of superiority; the desirability of concentrating litigation in this forum is neutral given the limitations on an MDL court's power and concerns about foreign non-recognition of a class action's preclusive effects. And finally, though we view predominance as a somewhat closer question in this context than in the trader-based context, we again conclude that a class action would be unmanageable given our predominance findings. In sum, though the first and second Rule 23(b)(3) factors weigh in favor of superiority, we again conclude that a class action would be unmanageable in light of the predominance issues we identify, and this manageability issue is sufficient to defeat superiority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-554\">\n   <strong>\n    4.6. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-555\">\n   Exchange plaintiffs' motion for certification of a suppression class is denied. While Exchange plaintiffs have established the\n   four Rule 23(a) requirements, the proposed class stumbles at Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance and superiority hurdles. While the common-question side of the scale is weightier here than for the proposed trader-based class, Exchange plaintiffs nonetheless have not carried their burden of demonstrating preponderance by establishing that but-for LIBOR may be calculated on a classwide basis, that changes in LIBOR would have been reflected in EDF prices in a classwide manner, or that damages may be calculated for all class members relying on the same evidence. Exchange plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    pro forma\n   </em>\n   suggestion that we \"modify the Class or certify [a] remaining portion\" (Exch. Pls.' Suppr.

Defendants have moved to exclude certain portions of Dr. Webb's testimony, and Berkshire has moved to exclude certain portions of Dr. Willig's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   We again consider\n   the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions before proceeding to the class certification motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-562\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1. Dr. Webb\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-563\">\n   Berkshire offers two reports from Dr. Robert Webb: (1) an initial report dated February 2, 2017 (Decl. of Jeremy Lieberman ex. 5, May 2, 2017, ECF No. 1889); and (2) a rebuttal report dated May 3, 2017 (Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 5, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2025). We refer to these as the Webb Initial Report and the Webb Rebuttal Report, respectively. Across these two reports, Dr. Webb's opinions relate primarily to: (1) calculating the extent to which LIBOR was suppressed during the class period; and (2) calculating damages to putative class members as a result of LIBOR manipulation. Lender defendants do not challenge Dr. Webb's qualifications to offer these opinions; we agree that Dr. Webb is so qualified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-564\">\n   As to suppression, Dr. Webb first compares published LIBOR to a number of \"potential measures\" of suppression, including a \"Bank Funding Rate\" calculated based on \"the actual rates paid by Defendants in their issuance of funding instruments linked to USD LIBOR with a six months maturity\" (Webb Initial Report \u00b6 41 (footnote omitted)) and the ICAP-Ask rate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   which Dr. Webb refers to as the \"ICAP EDDR\" rate (Webb Initial Report \u00b6 46), among others. To ultimately estimate what LIBOR would have been in the absence of suppression, Dr. Webb uses a Eurodollar deposit rate published by Bloomberg, the \"Bloomberg CMPL\" rate. (Webb Initial Report \u00b6 45.) Dr. Webb calculates but-for LIBOR by regressing actual published LIBOR against the Bloomberg CMPL over an unspecified clean period\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then using the results of that regression to estimate but-for LIBOR during the class period. (Webb Initial Report \u00b6 72). Lender defendants do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seek exclusion of these opinions under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-565\">\n   As to damages, Dr. Webb opines that \"[t]he calculation of damages to the Class is susceptible to common proof on a formulaic basis,\" reasoning that \"[t]he amount of damage suffered by the Class member on [each reset date] is equal to the amount of suppression of USD LIBOR multiplied by the outstanding nominal loan amount(s) owed to that Class member\" for the reset period. (Webb Initial Report \u00b6 26.) Dr. Webb supports this opinion by taking his Bloomberg CMPL-based but-for LIBOR series and calculating damages to be the difference between the actual interest received on certain loans (calculated based on published LIBOR) and the interest that would have been received on those loans (calculated based on his but-for LIBOR series). (Webb Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 77-83.) In his rebuttal report, Dr. Webb expands on these analyses to incorporate damages on\n   LIBOR-based instruments other than loans, the issues of absorption that we identified in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR VI\n   </em>\n   , and the effect of interest-rate floors. (Webb Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 114-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-566\">\n   Lender defendants\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   seek exclusion of these opinions. They contend first that Dr. Webb's methodology does not assess damages under the out-of-pocket loss rule that we concluded applied to Berkshire's claims in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR V\n   </em>\n   , a mismatch that is fatal to class certification under\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   . Second, Lender defendants assert that Dr. Webb's damages methodology is unreliable because it fails to account for certain significant aspects of the but-for world, including (1) \"what demand and default rates for their LIBOR-linked loans would have been\"; (2) \"how alleged LIBOR suppression would have affected the price and other terms of their LIBOR-linked loans\"; and (3) \"how lenders' LIBOR-linked borrowings, hedges, and other transactions would have been impacted.\" (Lender Defs.' Class Opp'n 18-19.) We consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-567\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.1. Assessment of Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-568\">\n   Berkshire first responds that Dr. Webb's analysis is consistent with its liability case because some class members will be subject to a benefit-of-the-bargain rule (under which but-for LIBOR is relevant) and because calculation of damages using alternative rates (which is required under New York's out-of-pocket damages rule) could be performed applying \"only grade-school arithmetic\" once the alternative rate is determined. (Berkshire Webb Opp'n 13-14.) Citing\n   <em>\n    In re Scotts EZ Seed\n   </em>\n   's holding that \"Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   requires an expert to perform his analyses at the class certification stage,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759615\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/304/397/\">\n    304 F.R.D. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Berkshire contends that the operative question is \"whether plaintiffs have established a workable damages model, not whether the model actually works.\" (Berkshire Webb Opp'n 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-569\">\n   This response is unpersuasive. Though we agree that the substitution of an alternative rate, once determined, in place of but-for LIBOR would not be an analytically intensive exercise, but Dr. Webb never opines that determining the alternative rate may be done formulaically, which is necessary to support his opinion regarding the calculation of damages. Further, Dr. Webb's failure to actually perform an alternative rate is not excused by the straightforward nature of the calculation. As Dr. Webb does not claim that he lacks necessary data, his failure to do so is particularly inexcusable in light of that ease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-570\">\n   At bottom, Dr. Webb's model does not calculate, and does not purport to calculate, \"damages\" to Berkshire or any other putative class member under the out-of-pocket damages rule that we set forth in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR V\n   </em>\n   , and the out-of-pocket damages rule is of particular significance here because Berkshire is the only named plaintiff remaining.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the expert's models in\n   <em>\n    In re Scotts EZ Seed\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Webb's models simply do not \"match plaintiffs' theories of liability\" under New York law.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759615\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/304/397/\">\n    304 F.R.D. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-571\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1.2. Construction of the But-For World\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-572\">\n   Berkshire offers three responses to Lender defendants' second argument. First, Berkshire argues that regressions are considered the \"gold standard\" in antitrust actions. (Berkshire Webb Opp'n 16, 18-19.) Second, Berkshire contends that the issues that Lender defendants accuse Dr. Webb of having failed to consider are speculative as a factual matter. (Berkshire\n   Webb Opp'n 17.) Third, Berkshire asserts that, as a matter of law, Dr. Webb was not required to take into account these aspects of the but-for world because defendants must bear the consequences of any uncertainty resulting from their wrongdoing. (Berkshire Webb Opp'n 17-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-573\">\n   First, Berkshire's invocation of general case law about regressions in antitrust actions is not responsive on multiple levels. For one, this action raises fraud claims, not antitrust claims. Second, while Dr. Webb conducts regressions in order to calculate one of the inputs to his damages model-but-for LIBOR-Lender defendants' motion challenges how Dr. Webb subsequently applies the results of that regression, not the regression itself. Indeed, a regression, even if conducted in a reliable manner consistent with econometric principles, may still be applied in an unreliable way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-574\">\n   Second, Berkshire's suggestion that \"[n]either Professor Ordover nor Mr. Kelley identify a single term from any class member loan that would have definitely been different\" is simply unpersuasive. (Berkshire Webb Opp'n 17.) As to demand, Berkshire's attempt to escape the laws of supply and demand fail. Consider, for example, a would-be homeowner seeking a mortgage loan: a higher interest rate means that the borrower will have higher monthly mortgage payments for a given loan amount; a borrower who wishes to keep his monthly payment constant will seek a smaller loan amount.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Tex. Auto Dealers Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9153505\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/416/#p423\">\n    387 F.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (5th Cir. 2004) (describing \" [b]ottom-line purchasers\"). More broadly, in making loans, lenders sell a good-capital-to borrowers at a given price-the interest rate. Therefore, it is wholly unsurprising that (absent shifts in the demand curve) a higher interest rate will decrease demand, resulting in a lower volume of loans being made. Dr. Webb concedes the point himself, (Webb Dep. 276:13-18, Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 6, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2025), and as the Second Circuit summarized: \"[i]ncreased mortgage interest rates led to a spike in prices that made many homes too expensive for potential buyers, decreasing demand.\"\n   <em>\n    Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Holding Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263623\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/85/#p108\">\n    873 F.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108 (2d Cir. 2017). As to default rate, resets to higher interest rates over the life of a loan will increase defaults. Dr. Webb again concedes the point, (Webb Dep. 278:16-279:6), and as the Second Circuit recognized, \"[d]efaulting on mortgage loans became an attractive option for homeowners\" as a result of rising interest rates and decreased home values leading to the financial crisis.\n   <em>\n    Nomura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263623\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/85/#p108\">\n    873 F.3d at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And as to spread, Berkshire does not meaningfully rebut Dr. Ordover's testimony that spreads on floating-rate loans are subject to negotiation or, for that matter, its own representative's testimony that its loans were in fact negotiated and that its spreads were sensitive to underlying interest rates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ordover Report \u00b6\u00b6 39-40; Lukens Dep. 36:5-7, 240:4-6, 271:4-6,\n   Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 7, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2025 (\"Lukens Dep.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-575\">\n   Third, Berkshire's reliance on\n   <em>\n    In re Electronic Books\n   </em>\n   , which held that an expert was not required to model various \"features of a but-for world\" because \"the but-for world does not exist\" is unavailing in this context.\n   <em>\n    In re Elec.

The but-for world, by construction, does not exist, but it still must be constructed in a reasonable way such that a reasonable approximation of damages may be made.

(Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 3, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2025.) As in the Exchange-based action, the Willig Report includes several opinions based on an analysis of interbank lending transactions into which panel banks actually entered. (Willig Report \u00b6 14.)

(Willig Report \u00b6 16.) Like Exchange plaintiffs, Berkshire bases this challenge on the LIBOR question itself, BBA documents, and certain other sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-584\">\n   As in the Exchange-based action, Berkshire's repeated reliance on panel banks' \"borrowing costs\" in its allegations is sufficient to warrant denial of this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820983\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/705/#p708\">\n    882 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   707 ;\n   <em>\n    TufAmerica, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124448\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/968/588/#p600\">\n    968 F.Supp.2d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, in the operative complaint, Berkshire alleges that Defendants manipulated LIBOR by making submissions that \"did not honestly reflect the submitting banks' actual borrowing costs on the interbank market\" and conspired to make LIBOR submissions \"below their actual borrowing costs.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 261, 377.) Further, Berkshire repeatedly asserted that interbank transaction data were necessary to assess the true extent of suppression. For instance, Berkshire alleged that \"[t]he Panel Bank Defendants'\n   <em>\n    actual borrowing costs\n   </em>\n   were not publicly disclosed, rendering it impossible to discern without internal documents and sophisticated expert analysis the full extent of their fraud,\" (SAC \u00b6 284 (emphasis added)), and that the public unavailability of data on \"the rates at which panel banks could borrow\" served as a basis for tolling statutes of limitations, (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6 333). Berkshire's earlier complaints contain materially similar allegations. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , First Am. Consolidated Class Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 252, 368, Nov. 17, 2015, ECF No. 1238; Am. Class Action Compl., ECF No. 242, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 88, Nov. 21, 2012, ECF No. 242.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-585\">\n   Berkshire, in reply, accuses Lender defendants of \"elevat[ing] form above substance,\" and now contends that its repeated references to \"borrowing costs\" were merely \"short-hand wording in the Complaint\" intended to refer only to offered rates. (Berkshire Willig Reply 3.) Even if we were to accept this revisionist history, which is truly difficult to reconcile with Berkshire's own understanding that LIBOR represents the rate at which a panel bank \"actually borrowed in the market\" (Krausz Dep. 19:2-7, Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 10, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2025 (\"Krausz Dep.\")), Berkshire's argument would still fail. Berkshire relies largely on the same sources relied upon by Exchange plaintiffs: the text of the LIBOR question; the BBA \"definitions\" page; the Kuo, Skeie, and Vickery working paper; the Credit Suisse Fixed Income Research Report; and the JPMorgan Chase internal document purporting to set forth the bank's LIBOR submission policy. (Berkshire Willig Mem. 5-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-586\">\n   We have already analyzed these sources and have already concluded that they establish that while LIBOR represents an offered rate and is not itself a transaction rate, rates observed in actual transactions are, at minimum, properly considered in a bank's determination of its LIBOR submissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.2.3.1. Given that actual transaction rates are properly considered in a panel bank's determination of its LIBOR submissions, they may similarly be properly considered in determining whether a bank's LIBOR submissions were suppressed\n   and whether such suppression can be established through common evidence. Indeed, Berkshire's argument here is particularly surprising given that Dr. Webb constructs a \"Bank Funding Rate\" series using actual interest rates paid by panel banks in issuing certain funding instruments and compares that rate to LIBOR submissions (Webb Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 41-42), and further given Dr. Webb's concession that \"unsecured borrowing transaction[s] by a panel member in the London interbank market [is] are relevant to the LIBOR question (Webb Dep. 24:21-25, Decl. of Jamie Heine ex. 6, July 21, 2017, ECF No. 2105). To conclude, we reaffirm our conclusion that actual transactions are relevant in analyzing whether a panel bank made suppressed LIBOR submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-587\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2.2. Bid-Initiated and Offer-Initiated Transactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-588\">\n   Second, Berkshire asserts that Dr. Willig did not distinguish transactions initiated by offers from transactions initiated by bids in conducting his analysis, and that this oversight undermines the reliability of his opinions because \" '[b]ids' and bid [-initiated] transactions are irrelevant to the LIBOR Question.\" (Berkshire Willig Mem. 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-589\">\n   We are unpersuaded that the distinction between bid-initiated transactions and offer-initiated transactions is a meaningful one. While bids are unquestionably different from offers (or asks), Berkshire provides no credible authority for why bid-initiated\n   <em>\n    transactions\n   </em>\n   would be different from offer-initiated\n   <em>\n    transactions\n   </em>\n   , particularly in the LIBOR context where the parties to interbank transactions are banks, and generally large ones, by definition. Notably, the sources on which the parties rely in advancing their interpretations of the LIBOR question refer to \"transaction[s],\" with no distinction made between whether the transactions were initiated by a bid or an offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-590\">\n   Indeed, the price (which in this case is an interest rate) at which a transaction actually occurs will generally represent some compromise between the parties' initial positions after negotiation. Berkshire's primary argument rests on the proposition that the seller's initial position-the offer-is a pre-negotiation position distinct from the ultimate transaction rate produced through the negotiation process, which in turn is distinct from the buyer's initial position, the bid. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Berkshire Willig Reply 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-591\">\n   But bid-initiated transaction rates and offer-initiated transaction rates are first and foremost (post-negotiation)\n   <em>\n    transaction\n   </em>\n   rates. That is, bids are distinct from offers, and both are distinct from transaction rates. Berkshire has not established that, within the broader category of\n   <em>\n    transactions\n   </em>\n   , rates will differ post-negotiation based on whether the seller approached the buyer or vice versa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-592\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2.3. Contradiction by Bank Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-593\">\n   Finally, Berkshire contends that the reliability of Dr. Willig's analysis is undermined by \"the Panel Banks' own Class Period admissions as to where their LIBOR submissions should be,\" relying on communications between panel bank employees speculating as to what a panel bank's LIBOR submission should have been. (Berkshire Willig Mem. 24.) Berkshire also suggests that Dr. Willig's reliance on data that is \"so unreliable and irrelevant\" \"can only be explained by ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-594\">\n   'bad faith.' \" (Berkshire Willig Mem. 24.) Neither argument is remotely persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-595\">\n   The comparison of Dr. Willig's interbank transaction rates to but-for LIBOR (and but-for LIBOR submissions) as contemplated by certain panel bank employees is inapt. Berkshire's attempted direct comparison mischaracterizes Dr. Willig's opinions, as it ignores Dr. Willig's statement that his \"re-calculations of the LIBOR rates after substituting banks' average London Interbank Borrowing costs for their submissions are not intended to be estimates of but-for rates.\" (Willig Report \u00b6 93 n.80.) Indeed, Dr. Webb comes comparably close to using transaction rates to calculate but-for LIBOR, constructing a \"Bank Funding Rate Implied LIBOR\" series. (Webb Initial Report \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-596\">\n   Berkshire's additional suggestion that Dr. Willig's decision to analyze interbank transaction data instead of alternative data sources can be explained only by \"bad faith\" is simply not credible. Berkshire has repeatedly relied on such a comparison over the course of this case, as we have recounted above. Further, Dr. Willig explains-in portions of his report that Berkshire does not seek to exclude-why the alternative data sources for which Berkshire advocates (and on which Dr. Webb relies) are inferior choices compared to his analysis of transaction rates. (Willig Report \u00b6\u00b6 118-43.) We need not decide whether these explanations are ultimately persuasive in order to conclude that Berkshire's \"bad faith\" aspersion is wholly miscast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-597\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2.4. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-598\">\n   Berkshire's motion to exclude sections IV through VI of the Willig Report is denied. Even if Berkshire were not bound by the history of its allegations that panel banks suppressed LIBOR by making submissions below their \"actual borrowing costs,\" our review of the LIBOR question itself and other interpretive sources confirms that while LIBOR represents an offered rate, a bank's LIBOR submission should be based on its perception of the rates it would be offered and the \"totality of the information\" available to it. Berkshire's attempted distinction of bid-initiated transactions and offer-initiated transactions is illusory and does not render Dr. Willig's analysis unreliable; its attempt to paint Dr. Willig's transaction analysis as a calculation of but-for LIBOR is a mischaracterization and fares even worse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-599\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Class Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-600\">\n   Turning to Berkshire's motion for class certification, we consider whether the proposed class complies with the four Rule 23(a) requirements, the implied requirement of ascertainability, and the Rule 23(b)(3) requirements of predominance and superiority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-601\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1. Rule 23(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-602\">\n   Lender defendants do not appear to dispute that the requirements of numerosity and commonality are satisfied, though they do dispute typicality and adequacy of representation. We consider Rule 23(a)'s requirements in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-603\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1.1. Numerosity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-604\">\n   Berkshire contends that LIBOR-based loans were made \"by thousands of financial institutions\" such that the numerosity requirement is satisfied. (Berkshire Class Mem. 7) Though Berkshire provides no evidence in support of this assertion, we nonetheless conclude that it is more likely than not that more than 40 institutional lenders made LIBOR-based loans that reset during the class period and that numerosity is therefore satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pa. Pub. Sch. Emps.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314722\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/111/#p120\">\n    772 F.3d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-605\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1.2. Commonality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-606\">\n   We also conclude that the proposed class raises at least one common\n   question. In the context of \"fraud claims based on uniform misrepresentations made to all members of the class,\" misrepresentation is a common question because \"the standardized misrepresentations may be established by generalized proof.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11441914\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/1247/#p1252\">\n    306 F.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Berkshire alleges that panel banks made misrepresentations by making inaccurate LIBOR submissions, and those submissions, which form the basis of published LIBOR, necessarily pertain to all class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-607\">\n   While Lender defendants correctly point out that proof of misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, and intent will differ across panel banks and days, these differences do not render these issues individual in nature. Each bank's submission serves as an input into published LIBOR, and published LIBOR is the means through which each class member was impacted by the alleged misrepresentations. And while different class members' LIBOR-based loans are likely to have different reset schedules such that different specific dates are of relevance to different class members, this day-to-day variation is of limited significance in the context of Berkshire's claims of persistent suppression and does not preclude a finding of commonality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-608\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1.3. Typicality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-609\">\n   Next, Lender defendants contend that Berkshire's claims are not typical because Berkshire in fact has no claim at all. They rely, in particular, on evidence that Berkshire had issued $22 million in LIBOR-based debt, which is greater in face value than the six LIBOR-based loans alleged in the complaint. (Lender Defs.' Class Opp'n 17.) Berkshire responds that the $22 million in \"debt\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   was issued by its holding company, and that Berkshire also held more than $100 million in LIBOR-based auction rate securities. (Berkshire Class Reply 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-610\">\n   If an entity had no exposure to LIBOR (or negative exposure such that it benefited from alleged suppression), we would agree that that entity's claim is atypical of the class's claims. Here, however, the factual record on this point remains underdeveloped and makes an assessment of Berkshire's overall exposure to LIBOR difficult. In its complaint, Berkshire alleges that it issued six LIBOR-based loans: (1) a $1.389 million amortizing mortgage; (2) a $2 million amortizing mortgage; (3) a $1.352 million amortizing real estate loan; (4) a $7.364 million commercial revolver; (5) a $5 million revolver; and (6) a $440,000 amortizing loan. (SAC \u00b6 20.) These loans total approximately $18 million in face value (though Berkshire's total LIBOR exposure at any given point in time would be less because many of the loans are amortizing), which is less than the $22 million of LIBOR-based securities issued by Berkshire's holding company. However, neither Berkshire nor Lender defendants have submitted comprehensive evidence of other LIBOR-based instruments that were held by Berkshire or its corporate affiliates during the class period. We ultimately know little about the $22 million \"debt,\" and we know even less about the $100 million in auction-rate securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-611\">\n   On this record, we conclude that Berkshire's claims are typical of the class's claims. We accept counsel's representation that the $22 million debt issuance was made by Berkshire's holding company and\n   not Berkshire itself (Hr'g Tr. 61:5-7), and by extension the proposition that Berkshire had some positive exposure to LIBOR. In the absence of a full record and assuming Berkshire was a lender with net LIBOR exposure, we agree that the alleged conspiracy to suppress LIBOR is sufficiently central to all class members' claims such that typicality is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-612\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1.4.

Applying the factors outlined above, we conclude that Mordchai Krausz's 15% interest in attorneys' fees earned by class counsel is sufficient to create the \"appearance of impropriety\" and renders Berkshire an inadequate class representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-617\">\n   First, the relationship between Berkshire, with Moses Krausz as Berkshire's CEO, and Mordchai Krausz is sufficiently close to raise at least some appearance of impropriety. Berkshire correctly identifies that this case is unique in that the named plaintiff is a corporate entity with a board of directors rather than an individual plaintiff, but a close relationship need not be familial in order to raise adequacy issues: \"a close familial\n   <em>\n    or business relationship\n   </em>\n   or friendship with class counsel\" is enough to do so. 1 William B. Rubenstein,\n   <em>\n    Newberg on Class Actions\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3:70 (5th ed.)

Berkshire's acknowledgement of an extensive business relationship with Mordchai Krausz beyond the context of this litigation (Hr'g Tr. 30:5-9) does not lessen this concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-618\">\n   This concern is confirmed by the remaining factors that are frequently analyzed in assessing whether a close personal or business relationship precludes a finding of adequacy of representation. Mordchai Krausz's role in this case-let alone his entitlement to fees-was not disclosed until recently, and then only by Lender defendants. Further, Mordchai Krausz has not entered a notice of appearance nor has he signed any of the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re IMAX\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275515\" index=\"459\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/272/138/#p155\">\n    272 F.R.D. at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even to this day, [the related attorney] has not filed a notice of appearance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-619\">\n   Further, the amount of attorneys' fees to Pomerantz-and Mordchai Krausz's 15% share thereof-is likely to greatly exceed any recovery by Berkshire. Berkshire's complaint alleges a total of $45,861 in damages under its \"but-for LIBOR\" theory of damages. (SAC \u00b6 20.) Mordchai Krausz would stand to receive more than this amount if Pomerantz's fee award were to exceed $305,740; given that this action has been extensively litigated for more than five years and that Berkshire has settled with Citi and HSBC for a combined $27 million, any fee award to Pomerantz is likely to greatly exceed this amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-620\">\n   And finally, we find that the record suggests that Mordchai Krausz's role in the litigation has been limited such that a 15% cut of Pomerantz's fees-potentially 4.5% of the total recovery-would be disproportionate. Berkshire contends that Mordchai Krausz is experienced and \"has assisted substantially in the prosecution of this claim including the review of filings and providing comments to Pomerantz.\" (Berkshire Class Reply 29.) Even assuming Mordchai Krausz's experience and qualifications, Berkshire's description of his role in this litigation-having reviewed the pleadings and provided comments to class counsel-nonetheless suggests a limited role, not an extensive one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-621\">\n   Resisting this conclusion, Berkshire suggests that our power to review proposed settlements for fairness is sufficient to protect the class despite any potential impropriety. (Berkshire Class Reply 30.)

Rule 23(a)(4) requires us to ask whether \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4), not whether we believe the interests of absent class members are being fairly treated,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

Contrary to Berkshire's characterization (Letter from Jeremy Lieberman to the Court, Aug. 25, 2017, ECF No. 2240), the related lawyer's role in\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   had\n   been disclosed: the related lawyer had been named as class counsel,\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"469\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203668844\">\n    2017 WL 3668844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, and a review of the docket shows that not only had the related lawyer entered a notice of appearance well before class certification, but the related lawyer had also been actively involved in litigating the case. He signed a number of the pleadings and motions papers filed by the plaintiff and made a number of court appearances on the putative class's behalf-including presenting oral argument in opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   , No. 14 Civ. 9438, ECF Nos. 1, 37, 44.) Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   's facts are simply not comparable to the facts here. Rather, under the factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   which we analyze above, Mordchai Krausz's relationship with Berkshire and his father the CEO-and his previously undisclosed 15% interest in any attorneys' fees awarded to Pomerantz-suggests that Berkshire is not an adequate representative.

Further, there was no indication in those cases that the related lawyers were actively involved in litigating the case in which their relative was serving as named plaintiff, unlike Mordchai Krausz.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3853365\" index=\"475\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/252/233/\">\n    252 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   244-45 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Cardizem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1273874\" index=\"476\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/200/326/\">\n    200 F.R.D. at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The firms in those cases also had a defined role, whereas Mordchai Krausz's role here remains unclear and limited at best. Additionally, the presence of multiple class representatives in those cases reduces the likelihood that a single named plaintiff-like Berkshire here-may conduct the litigation in an individually beneficial but class-detrimental way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the court in\n   <em>\n    Zakaria\n   </em>\n   explicitly acknowledged that \"a relationship between the named plaintiff and class counsel can defeat adequacy of representation,\" but reasoned that \"in general, more than such a relationship must be shown.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206662723\">\n    2016 WL 6662723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.

However, we also reasoned that \"such evidence may be insufficient in the face of, for instance, a showing that the Lender plaintiffs knew about or were indifferent to LIBOR suppression.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202912519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-635\">\n   We now conclude that reliance in this case is an individual question. \"Reliance\" on LIBOR (by issuing or holding a LIBOR-based loan) is distinct from (legal) reliance on LIBOR's accuracy. As we held in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR IV\n   </em>\n   , the reasonableness of a class member's reliance on LIBOR's accuracy \"depends on each particular plaintiff's reasons for investing in LIBOR-based instruments, the alternatives available to each particular plaintiff, each particular plaintiff's ability to investigate the possibility of LIBOR manipulation, and how much credence a reasonable investor would have lent to news articles criticizing LIBOR.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206243526\">\n    2015 WL 6243526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *67, slip op. at *168. Answering these questions will require the assessment of plaintiff-specific evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-636\">\n   First, different lenders had varying exposures to LIBOR, as some lenders often obtained funding at LIBOR-based interest rates in order to issue LIBOR-based loans. (Kelley Report \u00b6\u00b6 97-100; Ordover Repot \u00b6\u00b6 66-74.) The extent of a lender's reliance on LIBOR depends, at least in part, on the lender's exposure to LIBOR-a lender with no net exposure to LIBOR is far more likely to have been indifferent to the level at which LIBOR is set, and is far less likely to have relied on LIBOR at all-and a lender's net exposure to LIBOR cannot be determined without evidence specific to that lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-637\">\n   Because of LIBOR's dual nature in the lending context, Berkshire's reliance on\n   <em>\n    In re U.S. Foodservice\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Osberg v. Foot Locker, Inc.\n   </em>\n   is unavailing.\n   <em>\n    In re U.S. Foodservice\n   </em>\n   reasoned that \"payment may constitute circumstantial proof of reliance upon a financial representation,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699958\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/108/#p129\">\n    729 F.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Osberg\n   </em>\n   extended this reasoning to hold that receipt of payment may similarly constitute circumstantial proof of reliance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   No. 07 Civ. 1358 (KBF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205800501\">\n    2014 WL 5800501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 7, 2014). Neither case addresses a circumstance like that of an institutional lender that both makes and receives payments based on LIBOR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-638\">\n   Berkshire's reliance on cases in the federal securities context is similarly unavailing. We are skeptical that the federal securities framework is applicable to Berkshire's common law fraud claims, as the presumption of reliance often available in the securities fraud context is not available here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LIBOR IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206243526\">\n    2015 WL 6243526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *65, slip op. at *162 (\"[T]he common law does not generally recognize a 'fraud on the market' theory of reliance.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sec.

BDO Seidman, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239555\" index=\"494\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/63/#p73\">\n    222 F.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73 (2d Cir. 2000) (\"[C]ommon-law fraud claims require a different analysis than those brought under the federal securities regulation scheme.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-639\">\n   Similarly, lenders had different reasons for issuing LIBOR and had non-LIBOR alternatives for issuing loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Berkshire's allegations regarding the omnipresence of LIBOR (Berkshire Class Reply 23) suggest that lenders may have relied on LIBOR despite knowledge of its inaccuracy, and Berkshire acknowledged that its selection of benchmark rates were \"determined on a case-by-case basis\" (Krausz Dep. 14:24-15:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-640\">\n   Additionally, lenders likely had different understandings of what LIBOR represents, as evidenced by Berkshire's internally\n   inconsistent views of LIBOR. Though Berkshire now advances a conception of LIBOR as strictly an \"offered rate,\" (Berkshire Willig Mem.), its own representative testified that LIBOR represented \"a rate at which the banks actually borrowed in the market\" (Krausz Dep. 19:2-7). Berkshire's highly qualified expert witness Dr. Webb has advanced similarly inconsistent opinions on the meaning of LIBOR: in his initial report, for example, Dr. Webb refers to LIBOR as \"the prevailing unsecured cost of USD denominated funds borrowed in the London interbank Money Market,\" opines that LIBOR suppression resulted when panel banks \"submitt[ed] quotes which were lower than the rate at which they could actually borrow short term funds in the London inter-bank Money Market,\" and compares LIBOR submissions to \"the actual rates paid by [panel banks] in their issuance of funding instruments linked to USD LIBOR.\" (Webb Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 41.) His rebuttal report, by contrast, emphasizes LIBOR's nature as an offered rate. (Webb Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 52-55.) Given Dr. Webb's lack of consistency on this point and our broader conclusion that the text of the LIBOR question is at least somewhat ambiguous,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.2.3.1.2, we conclude that lenders having different understandings of LIBOR is not a speculative improbability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-641\">\n   Finally, lenders may have had knowledge of alleged LIBOR suppression. As we held in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR IV\n   </em>\n   , \"news articles in Spring 2008 revealed a meaningful probability that LIBOR had been, and continued to be, manipulated,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"495\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206243526\">\n    2015 WL 6243526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *67, slip op. at *168, and our conclusion that certain lenders may have had knowledge is buttressed by Berkshire's and Dr. Webb's comparison of LIBOR to other publicly available interest rates that correlated closely to LIBOR prior to the alleged suppression. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6\u00b6 81-97.) To the extent that certain lenders monitored comparable interest rates, this exercise of diligence would tend to undermine any claim of reliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"496\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p231\">\n    522 F.3d at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[D]ifferences in plaintiffs' knowledge and levels of awareness [may] also defeat the presumption of reliance.\"). The fact that some of the lenders captured in the class definition are sophisticated financial institutions-including some that participated in the interbank lending market-suggests that the probability that some class members had knowledge is not as speculative as Berkshire suggests it to be. (Ordover Report \u00b6\u00b6 66-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-642\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that assessing reliance would require extensive consideration of lender-specific evidence and is an individual question. The uncontroverted evidence in the record (and Berkshire's own testimony) hardly resembles the \"bald speculation\" found insufficient to render reliance an individual question in\n   <em>\n    In re U.S. Foodservice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699958\" index=\"497\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/108/#p129\">\n    729 F.3d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-643\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.3.

As a general matter, the Second Circuit has made clear that an assessment of predominance requires consideration of the \"elements of the claims\n   <em>\n    and defenses\n   </em>\n   to be litigated.\"\n   <em>\n    Nextel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072481\" index=\"499\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/128/#p137\">\n    780 F.3d at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting 1\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin on Class Actions\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5:23 (11th ed. 2014) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Visa Check\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392655\" index=\"500\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/124/#p140\">\n    280 F.3d at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] court must examine the relevant facts and both the claims\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    defenses\n   </em>\n   in determining whether a putative class meets the requirements of Rule 23(b) (3).\" (emphasis added)).

Contrary to Berkshire's suggestion (Berkshire Class Reply 24-25), any statute-of-limitations issues impacting the class here are not reducible simply to a question of inquiry notice. Even assuming inquiry notice operates on a classwide basis,\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   inquiry notice is of course only one form of notice; actual notice is no less effective at starting the limitations clock.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"513\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    N.Y.

Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-651\">\n   Though damages is necessarily an individual question (at least to some extent) in all cases, we find that it is a question of greater significance in this case than in others. Individual inquiry will be required into, at minimum, four aspects of determining damages: (1) what alternative rate a plaintiff would have used, (2) what spread would have been used (and what other terms of the loan would have been) had LIBOR not been suppressed, (3) the presence and applicability of interest-rate floors, and (4) netting against benefits received from other LIBOR-based instruments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-652\">\n   First, we held in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR V\n   </em>\n   that New York adheres to an out-of-pocket damages rule, the application of which requires a determination of the alternatives that each plaintiff would have used for each loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"517\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206696407\">\n    2015 WL 6696407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-11, slip op. at *26-30. The record establishes not only that other benchmark rates are available, (Lukens Dep. 143:9-25, 240:7-14; Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 18, July 3, 2017, ECF No. 2025), but also that a given loan may be tied to multiple interest rates and not only LIBOR (Ordover Report \u00b6 80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-653\">\n   Second, the evidence shows that a floating-rate loan's spread above or below the benchmark rate is subject to negotiation. (Ordover Report \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) Indeed, Berkshire's\n   representative testified that its loans were \"individually negotiated,\" that spreads may be sensitive to changing interest rates, and that \"negotiation could be over what benchmark to use as well as over the spread.\" (Lukens Dep. 36:5-7, 143:12-16, 240:4-6, 271:4-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-654\">\n   Third, the record establishes that lenders-including Berkshire itself-frequently use interest-rate floors to guard against fluctuations in interest rates. (Kelley Report \u00b6\u00b6 102-14.) The inclusion of an interest-rate floor in a loan will tend to reduce the amount of damages attributable to that loan, as the floor places an upper bound on the impact that LIBOR suppression may have had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-655\">\n   Fourth, consistent with our dismissal of Highlander Realty in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"518\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206696407\">\n    2015 WL 6696407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22-24, slip op. at *61-63, a lender's net exposure to LIBOR is plainly relevant in considering damages.

In particular, Lender defendants argue that state substantive law varies along three dimensions: reliance, statutes of limitations, and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-665\">\n   A first dimension of variation in state substantive law is reliance. As Lender defendants correctly point out, state substantive law varies materially on what suffices to establish reliance and when a would-be plaintiff is charged with a duty to investigate. Berkshire responds that states' substantive standards on reliance fall into only two categories. (Berkshire Class Reply 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-666\">\n   This response is an oversimplification and is belied by the first appendix to Berkshire's reply brief, which purports to catalog 52 jurisdictions' reliance standards. (Berkshire Class Reply 26 n.21.) We do not canvass Berkshire's state-law appendices for accuracy, but we are skeptical that Berkshire has in fact characterized state law correctly in all instances. For example, Oklahoma appears to impose an absolute duty to investigate, rather than a duty to investigate only if facts make it obvious to the plaintiff that the representation is not true as Berkshire suggests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silver v.

Similarly, West Virginia appears to impose a duty to investigate in cases of obvious falsity, rather than possible falsity as Berkshire suggests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kidd v.

(Berkshire Class Reply app. I. (emphasis omitted))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-668\">\n   Within these broad categories, different states also impose varying standards. For example, within the first broad category (states imposing a duty to investigate if the plaintiff is aware of facts indicating the representation may be false), Iowa, Missouri, South Carolina, and Tennessee appear to consider certain characteristics of the plaintiff while Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Ohio and Virginia apply a strictly objective standard.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spreitzer v.

Berkshire counters that variations in discovery rules and notice standards present no predominance issue, asserting that we have previously held that in the context of discovery rules, \"constructive notice occurred as to all class members (except under California law) on May 29, 2008\" (Berkshire Class Reply 27).\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   Berkshire does not explain why such a holding precludes actual notice to a\n   plaintiff\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   May 29, 2008 or why this holding alleviates our concern regarding variations in statutes of limitations and discovery rules (which, as we have held, some states do not apply at all).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LIBOR IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"565\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206243526\">\n    2015 WL 6243526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *126-33, slip op. at *303-17 (analyzing state-by-state variations in statutes of limitations and discovery rules).\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, as Berkshire concedes (Berkshire Class Reply 27), California's treatment of inquiry notice based on news articles is unique,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LIBOR IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"566\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206243526\">\n    2015 WL 6243526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *127, slip op. at *306-07, and the Second Circuit has emphasized that this assessment requires analysis of when \"\n   <em>\n    the plaintiff\n   </em>\n   was aware of the reporting in question,\"\n   <em>\n    Schwab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516091\" index=\"567\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/68/\">\n    883 F.3d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added), which in turn requires plaintiff-specific evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-670\">\n   A third dimension of variation in state substantive law is the damages methodology that is to be applied. Lender defendants correctly identify that some states always apply a \"benefit of the bargain\" rule, some states (like New York) always apply an \"out of pocket\" rule, and other states allow for either measure of damages depending on the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Lender Defs.' Class Opp'n 27.) Berkshire acknowledges the difference between benefit-of-the-bargain damages and out-of-pocket damages, but contends that 48 of 52 jurisdictions apply benefit-of-the-bargain while the remaining four apply out-of-pocket. (Berkshire Class Reply 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-671\">\n   This response is again an oversimplification and is again belied by Berkshire's state-law appendices. While the ultimate amount of damages in each state is calculated using two different formulae, complexity nonetheless arises in determining\n   <em>\n    which\n   </em>\n   rule to apply in the states allowing both forms of damages. And indeed, states differ in that decision rule: for example, according to Berkshire's own state-law appendix, Ohio defaults to the out-of-pocket rule while Washington defaults to the benefit-of-the-bargain rule.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Northpoint Props. v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-674\">\n   Common issues do not predominate over individual ones. While the question of misrepresentation is a common issue, this common question is outweighed by the individual questions presented by reliance, damages, affirmative defenses, and variation in state laws. Though the presence of any one of these individual questions may be insufficient to support a finding of no predominance standing alone,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Roach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051169\" index=\"572\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/401/#p405\">\n    778 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   408 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Nassau Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671494\" index=\"573\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/219/#p225\">\n    461 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   225 ;\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"574\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202912519\">\n    2017 WL 2912519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8, these individual questions, when taken together, significantly outweigh common ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-675\">\n   <strong>\n    2.4. Superiority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-676\">\n   Finally, we consider whether class-action status in this case would be superior to the maintenance of individual actions. Our analysis is again guided by the factors set forth in Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-677\">\n   We find that the second factor, the extent and nature of any litigation already begun, and the third factor, the desirability of concentrating litigation in this forum, support a finding of superiority. Only a limited number of suits advancing a loan-based theory of injury attributable to LIBOR suppression were commenced, and concentration here is desirable for the reasons stated by the JPML in creating this multidistrict litigation in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re LIBOR-Based Fin.

(Berkshire Class Mem. 22, 26.) Indeed, the argument that superiority is established simply because individual actions \"may not be pursued, [and] would be less efficient and lead to conflicting results,\" begs the superiority question and proves far too much: this reasoning could be deployed in almost every putative class action. As we explained in analyzing superiority in the Exchange-based action, this case does not resemble the type of consumer fraud class actions where damages are small in magnitude for each class member but certain in existence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.3.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-679\">\n   But even absent this skepticism, a class action is not superior because of manageability problems presented by the absence of predominance and the presence of variations in state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073876\" index=\"576\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/70/#p82\">\n    780 F.3d at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[M]anageability 'is, by the far, the most critical concern in determining whether a class action is a superior means of adjudication.' \") (quoting\n   2 William B.

Mass. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-680\">\n   Anticipating this issue, Berkshire contends that any manageability concerns are overblown. (Berkshire Class Reply 28.) Berkshire invokes the Second Circuit's identification of \"a number of management tools available to a district court to address any individualized damages issues that might arise in a class action, including: (1) bifurcating liability and damage trials with the same or different juries; (2) appointing a magistrate judge or special master to preside over individual damages proceedings; (3) decertifying the class after the liability trial and providing notice to class members concerning how they may proceed to prove damages; (4) creating subclasses; or (5) altering or amending the class.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Visa Check\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392655\" index=\"579\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/124/#p140\">\n    280 F.3d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-681\">\n   These tools address our manageability concerns, which are rooted in variations in state substantive law, only minimally. The first three pertain to individualized issues of damages and are not responsive. We have also rejected the creation of numerous subclasses, as the number of state-law subclasses required here would remain generally unmanageable. And finally, because Berkshire offers no serious argument that we should consider modification of the class definition or issue certification, we will not consider whether those approaches would be viable in this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lundquist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508811\" index=\"580\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/11/#p14\">\n    993 F.2d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-682\">\n   <strong>\n    2.5.

While Berkshire has established the numerosity, commonality, and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) through (3), we find that Berkshire would not be an adequate representative based on the previously undisclosed fee arrangement between Mordchai Krausz and interim class counsel. While our doubts about Berkshire's adequacy as a class representative is sufficient to preclude certification, the joinder of additional named plaintiffs that would fairly and adequately represent the class still would not render class certification appropriate, as we also conclude that common questions do not predominate over individual ones and that class-action status would not be superior to the maintenance of individual actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-684\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V.

The Article III inquiry asks whether plaintiffs have suffered an injury-in-fact traceable to defendants' challenged behavior, not whether they have suffered a specific form of injury-in-fact. Injury suffered on swap purchases as a result of LIBOR suppression is not meaningfully different in the Article III context from injury suffered on bond purchases as a result of LIBOR suppression. Rather, named plaintiffs need only establish some injury from LIBOR manipulation, irrespective of the specific type of financial instrument on which that injury was incurred, to establish Article III standing; they have done so here. To the extent that differences between types of financial instruments raise \"standing\" considerations, they raise issues of class standing, not Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-707\">\n   To establish class standing to represent absent class members, a named plaintiff must \"plausibly allege[ ] (1) that he personally has suffered some actual injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant, and (2) that such conduct implicates the same set of concerns as the conduct alleged to have caused injury to other members of the putative class by the same defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    RBPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055610\" index=\"590\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/154/#p160\">\n    775 F.3d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    NECA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518333\" index=\"591\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/145/#p159\">\n    693 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   162 ).

Typicality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-714\">\n   OTC plaintiffs assert that their claims are typical of the class's claims, as all of the claims in question arise from the alleged suppression of LIBOR during the class period. (OTC Pls.' Class Mem. 16-17; OTC Pls.' Class Reply 28.) OTC defendants challenge specifically the typicality of Bucks County's claims based on a 2012 termination agreement between Bucks County and RBC, the panel bank with which Bucks County had transacted. (OTC Defs.' Suppl. Opp'n 2-5.) OTC defendants also challenge generally the typicality of the named plaintiffs' claims, contending that each named plaintiff is subject to the defense that it was not actually injured. (OTC Defs.' Class Opp'n 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-715\">\n   <strong>\n    2.2.1.1. Bucks County\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-716\">\n   OTC defendants contend that Bucks County is subject to a unique defense: in terminating its swap with RBC, Bucks County released the claims it now asserts. (OTC Defs.' Suppl. Opp'n 2-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-717\">\n   The swap between Bucks County and RBC, initiated in April 2005 and intended to run through June 2019, was supported by several underlying documents: an ISDA Master Agreement between RBC and Bucks County setting forth more general provisions, an accompanying \"Schedule\" setting forth certain of the swap's specific attributes, (Decl. of Brian Poronsky ex. B, Nov. 3, 2017, ECF No. 2340 (\"Poronsky Bucks County Decl.\")), and an additional confirmation setting forth further terms of the swap (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. C.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-718\">\n   The swap was terminated in 2012, as reflected in a termination agreement between RBC and Bucks County. The Termination Agreement defined the \"Transaction\" to be \"a transaction on 14 Apr 2005\" with certain enumerated attributes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   further provided that \"[t]he Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the parties agree that any existing and subsequent interest rate swap and currency exchange transactions together with confirmations exchanged between the parties confirming such transactions shall be governed by and form part of the Agreement.\" (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. D.) Among other provisions, the Termination Agreement then provided that \"[t]he Transaction shall be terminated and cancelled as of 14 Feb 2012 ... and all rights, duties, claims and obligations of each of [RBC] and [Bucks County] thereunder shall be released and discharged on that date.\" (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-719\">\n   OTC plaintiffs assert that the release does not extend to Bucks County's claims. Specifically as to the implied-covenant claim, OTC plaintiffs contend that despite the language of the termination agreement, Bucks County's claim is not released because the \"Transaction\" is defined separately from the ISDA Master Agreement. Under this theory, termination of the swap could not have affected Bucks County's claim arising from the ISDA Master Agreement, which remained in effect following the termination. (OTC Pls.' Suppl. Reply 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-720\">\n   This attempt to divorce the Transaction from the ISDA Master Agreement is unavailing. While OTC plaintiffs correctly assert that the ISDA Master Agreement \"shall remain in full force and effect\" under the Termination Agreement, this statement refers only to \"any existing and subsequent interest rate swap and currency exchange transactions together with the confirmations exchanged between the parties confirming such transactions.\" (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. D.) The ISDA Master Agreement and the confirmation documents supporting a transaction \"form a single agreement between the parties\" (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. B \u00b6 1(c)), a principle confirmed by the Termination Agreement's reference to the ISDA Master Agreement \"together with confirmations exchanged between the parties,\" (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. D 2). OTC plaintiffs' contention that their claim for breach of the implied covenant arises only out of the ISDA Master Agreement and not the contractual documents supporting the swap itself is unavailing, as nothing in the ISDA Master Agreement standing alone incorporates LIBOR or obligates RBC to pay interest to Bucks County at a rate determined with reference to LIBOR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-721\">\n   Further, the Termination Agreement refers to the \"Transaction\" and the parties' \"rights, duties, claims and obligations ... thereunder.\" (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. D.) The \"Transaction\" is \"evidenced by a Confirmation (as described in the [ISDA Master] Agreement),\" but the Termination Agreement does not restrict the \"Transaction\" to refer only to the ISDA Master Agreement or the accompanying confirmations. Accordingly, \"thereunder\" refers to the \"Transaction\" itself and not merely the documents supporting and memorializing the \"Transaction.\" Absent the swap-the \"Transaction\" in question as defined in the Termination Agreement-Bucks County would have no implied covenant claim against RBC at all. We conclude that Bucks County's implied covenant claim was released under the Termination Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-722\">\n   As to unjust enrichment, OTC plaintiffs argue that their unjust enrichment claims are not asserted under any contract and\n   therefore could not have been released under the Termination Agreement. OTC plaintiffs correctly recite our holdings in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    LIBOR III\n   </em>\n   , in which we determined that OTC plaintiffs' \"unjust enrichment claims against counterparty banks are not barred by the existence of the contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    LIBOR III\n   </em>\n   , 27 F.Supp.3d at 483-84. We reasoned that \"[a]lthough the swap contracts clearly required defendants to pay plaintiffs the prescribed floating rate of return using the LIBOR reported by the BBA, the contracts did not clearly cover the subject matter now at issue, namely whether defendants were permitted to manipulate LIBOR itself and thereby depress the amount they were required to pay plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    LIBOR III\n   </em>\n   , 27 F.Supp.3d at 483 (alterations incorporated and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    LIBOR II\n   </em>\n   , 962 F.Supp.2d at 630 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-723\">\n   We are nonetheless unpersuaded that the extracontractual nature of an unjust enrichment claim implies that it was not released by the Termination Agreement. As we explained above in the implied covenant context, the Termination Agreement releases all claims arising under the \"Transaction,\" which is defined to be the swap and includes more than simply the ISDA Master Agreement and accompanying confirmations. The operative question is not whether the unjust enrichment claim arises under the ISDA Master Agreement; it is whether it arises under the swap. We conclude that it does.\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-724\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the release contained in the Termination Agreement extends to both Bucks County's implied covenant claim and its unjust enrichment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n   While \"a representative may satisfy the typicality requirement even though that party may later be barred from recovery by a defense particular to him [or her] that would not impact other class members,\"\n   <em>\n    Lapin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690357\" index=\"598\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/254/168/#p179\">\n    254 F.R.D. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Frontier Ins.

Because Bucks County's presence is the only reason RBC remains as a defendant in this litigation, the unique defense that Bucks County released its claims nonetheless \"threaten[s] to become the focus of the litigation\" at this juncture.\n   <em>\n    Baffa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239507\" index=\"601\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/52/#p59\">\n    222 F.3d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-725\">\n   Accordingly, we find that Bucks County's claims are not typical of the class's claims because it is subject to a unique defense: that it previously released its claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Bucks County is the\n   only named plaintiff with standing to assert claims against RBC, no class will be certified against RBC even if the remaining Rule 23 requirements are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-726\">\n   <strong>\n    2.2.1.2. Lack of Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-727\">\n   As to net injury, OTC defendants assert that each class representative is \"subject to the unique defense that it suffered no injury,\" citing the \"individualized, economically complex analysis required to evaluate injury.\" (OTC Defs.' Class Opp'n 28.) OTC Plaintiffs reply that because \"netting and absorption apply to\" all class members \"and can be addressed with the same common formula,\" the defense is not \"unique\" and does not defeat typicality. (OTC Pls.' Class Reply 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-728\">\n   We find that, in this context, the named plaintiffs' purported lack of injury (unlike the release contained in the Bucks County termination agreement) is not a\n   <em>\n    unique\n   </em>\n   defense precluding a finding of typicality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 William B.

(Westlaw 2017) (\"Courts generally find typicality lacking if the proposed class representative's claims are subject to a procedural bar such as res judicata or if the claims arose before the law on which the class claims are based came into effect.\"). Indeed, this argument is difficult to reconcile with OTC defendants' broader argument that many of the named plaintiffs and a substantial portion of absent class members were not injured. Accepting those arguments, the lack of injury would hardly be a \"unique\" defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-729\">\n   \"[A] purported representative who lacks\n   <em>\n    standing\n   </em>\n   is not a member of the putative class and thus cannot satisfy the typicality or adequate representation requirements,\" 1\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin on Class Actions\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4:18 (14th ed.) (Westlaw 2017) (emphasis added), but the named plaintiffs here do have standing. A lack of net injury does not compel a finding that the named plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient injury-in-fact for Article III standing purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2657087\" index=\"602\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/253/#p264\">\n    443 F.3d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-730\">\n   Rather, this typicality argument is largely a repackaging of the damages arguments that OTC defendants offer in the predominance context.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-732\">\n   We accordingly find that the named plaintiffs' claims-with the exception of Bucks County's-are typical of the class's claims and that Rule 23(a)(3)'s typicality requirement is satisfied. However, Bucks County's claims are not typical, and because Bucks County is the only named plaintiff that transacted with RBC, no class will be certified against RBC. Furthermore, OTC plaintiffs have never filed a complaint that includes Bucks County as a named plaintiff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n   and doing so has been rendered unnecessary by our conclusions here as to the typicality of Bucks County's claims. RBC is dismissed, with prejudice, as a defendant in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-733\">\n   <strong>\n    2.2.2. Adequacy of Representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-734\">\n   Turning finally to adequacy of representation, OTC defendants contend that named plaintiffs are not adequate representatives because several of them \"likely benefited from any persistent suppression\" and because absorption of any LIBOR suppression into swap and bond transactions creates conflicting incentives to establish suppression based on the timing of class members' transactions. (OTC Defs.' Class Opp'n 28-29.) OTC plaintiffs respond that netting and absorption do not create significant conflicts because the Court will set, as a matter of law, the scope of any netting required and because any netting requirement can be implemented formulaically. (OTC Pls.' Class Reply 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-735\">\n   We find, as OTC defendants argue, that when the effects of absorption are taken into account, the damages attributable to different class members will be maximized by different amounts of suppression over time. That is, each class member has incentive to establish lower amounts of suppression at the time it entered into a swap and greater suppression thereafter, thereby minimizing the extent to which absorption will reduce its damages. To be sure, these incentives do create the potential for some conflict. However, we considered substantially similar arguments in the Exchange-based action and concluded as to the\n   <em>\n    suppression-based\n   </em>\n   class that conflicts created by differing incentives to establish the extent of suppression were not sufficiently fundamental so as to preclude a finding of adequacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.4.3.2. Unlike the\n   <em>\n    trader-based\n   </em>\n   class in the Exchange action, any diverging incentives within the putative OTC class (and within the proposed suppression class in the Exchange-based action) are necessarily limited by\n   <em>\n    suppression\n   </em>\n   's one-directional nature. Further, absorption is limited to swaps initiated during the suppression period. Accordingly, we again conclude that these conflicts, constrained as such, do not rise to the level of \"fundamental\" conflicts defeating adequacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Payment Card Interchange Fee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922741\" index=\"603\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/223/#p231\">\n    827 F.3d at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-736\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.

Rubenstein,\n   <em>\n    Newberg on Class Actions\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4:50 (5th ed. 2012) ). Even when a common methodology or calculation may be applied, the evidence to which the methodology is applied or the calculation is based will generally vary from class member to class member. (Ordover Report \u00b6\u00b6 126-49.) Even assuming panel banks retained centralized records as to the swaps into which it entered (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bernheim Initial Report \u00b6 210), the calculation of damages as to bonds will likely require individual records given their more actively traded nature; a class member cannot recover damages for reduced LIBOR-based interest payments if it had previously sold the underlying bond entitling the class member to those payments in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-744\">\n   In addition to the individual question of exactly which LIBOR-based instruments a class member purchased from which panel bank, OTC defendants identify two additional individual issues: netting and absorption. By absorption, we mean specifically the principle we set forth in\n   <em>\n    LIBOR VI\n   </em>\n   that because parties \"entering into a swap transaction ... take into consideration the present level of LIBOR and their view of how LIBOR will change in the future,\" \"the negotiated components [of a swap] absorbed the effects of LIBOR suppression\" to some extent.\n   <em>\n    LIBOR VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"608\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207378980\">\n    2016 WL 7378980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *20, slip op. at *53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-745\">\n   We agree that any netting requirements will add individual issues.

We will require some degree of netting in order to calculate damages, and determining exactly what other LIBOR-based instruments a class member held will entail individual inquiry. For example, a class member that purchased a LIBOR-based swap from a panel bank, with the express purpose of eliminating all or part of its LIBOR exposure from other LIBOR-based financial instruments-for example, its issuance of a LIBOR-based floating-rate note (Ordover Report \u00b6 125 &amp; tbl.27)-would receive an unwarranted windfall if the LIBOR-based note were not considered. The determination of what instruments should be incorporated into the netting analysis will require extensive evidence that is specific to a given class member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-746\">\n   We also conclude that absorption, at least for swaps initiated during the suppression period, cannot be measured on a classwide basis given the negotiated nature of swaps. We acknowledge that plaintiffs' expert Dr. Bernheim and defendants' expert Dr. Ordover disagree on the issue. We find Dr. Ordover's opinions more compelling, given the variation in the fixed-rate components of swaps observed in the market-including among swaps entered into by the named plaintiffs. (Ordover Initial Report \u00b6\u00b6 50-70.) We do not find that Dr. Bernheim's opinions fully support the proposition that the impact of absorption can be calculated formulaically for all class members with no class member-specific evidence required (Ordover Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 9-13), and Dr. Bernheim concludes only that the effects of absorption \"\n   <em>\n    should be similar\n   </em>\n   across market participants,\" (Bernheim Rebuttal Report \u00b6 296 (emphasis added)). Accordingly, we find that for swaps initiated during the suppression period, determining the fixed-rate component of the swap will require individual evidence. Our finding here comports with our earlier observation that \"there is every expectation that the negotiated component compensated for manipulated LIBOR.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-747\">\n   <em>\n    LIBOR VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"611\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207378980\">\n    2016 WL 7378980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *20, slip op. at *54 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gelboim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916444\" index=\"612\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/759/\">\n    823 F.3d at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The disputed transactions were done at rates that were negotiated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-748\">\n   In sum, even to the extent that panel banks maintain centralized records of the swaps they issued, damages present an individual question that will require class member-specific evidence to analyze.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-749\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.1.3.

Nothing in this holding suggests that it is translatable to the antitrust context or, for that matter, any claim involving a series of payments between the same parties rather than a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-762\">\n   In sum, we are skeptical of\n   <em>\n    In re Nexium\n   </em>\n   's holding that a single impacted payment is sufficient to establish antitrust injury, both as a general matter and as specifically applied to this action. Nonetheless, we need not squarely decide its applicability, as we conclude that the definition of injury does not ultimately alter the predominance balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-763\">\n   On the one hand, accepting OTC plaintiffs' definition of injury, we conclude that they have established that the question of whether each class member has experienced\n   injury as a result of the alleged 16-bank conspiracy is a common one. To show injury, OTC plaintiffs will need to offer classwide evidence that actual published LIBOR was suppressed (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , below but-for LIBOR). Regardless of whether this evidence consists of regressions that are capable of estimating but-for LIBOR over the class period in a few calculations (like those offered by Dr. Bernheim), or something more complex as Dr. Willig suggests is necessary, this evidence will nonetheless be classwide. OTC defendants' point that proof of the extent of suppression will differ across panel banks, tenors of LIBOR, and days is again well-taken, but these differences do not create individual questions because each putative class member is ultimately affected through published LIBOR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-764\">\n   On the other hand, if we accepted OTC defendants' definition, the element of \"injury\" would be an individual question, just as damages is an individual question, but it would be one that adds little to that side of the predominance balance. As counsel for the OTC defendants expressed at oral argument, \"all that damages is in an antitrust case is the quantum of injury, not the fact of injury.\" (Hr'g Tr. 44:12-14.) Under OTC defendants' definition of injury, an assessment of whether a class member has been\n   <em>\n    injured\n   </em>\n   becomes an assessment of what amount of\n   <em>\n    damages\n   </em>\n   the class member has suffered and whether that amount of damages is greater than zero. The considerations that underlie this determination of \"injury,\" including issues of absorption and netting, are otherwise identical to the determination of damages. Because any class member-specific question of fact relating to injury will be reducible to corresponding questions of fact relating to damages, and because those corresponding questions of fact are already taken into account as weighing against predominance in this action, those injury questions are of little marginal weight on the individual question side of the scale and do not tip the balance. That is, injury (as defined by OTC defendants) and damages would involve the same underlying (individual) questions of fact, and those same questions of fact should not be double-counted in the predominance inquiry simply because they bear on two closely related legal elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-765\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3.1.4.

(OTC Pls.' Class Reply 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-773\">\n   This argument misreads the standardized ISDA Master Agreement, which includes a choice-of-law provision that reads in full: \"Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Porosnky Bucks County Decl. ex. B at 13.) Rather than designating either New York law or English law as OTC plaintiffs suggest, the ISDA Master Agreement designates governing law only with reference to a separate transaction-specific \"Schedule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consideration of each individual schedule is therefore necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-774\">\n   The next provision in the ISDA Master Agreement does reference New York law and English law, but is itself not a choice-of-law provision. Titled \"Jurisdiction,\" the provision states that each party \"submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. B. at 13 (emphasis added).) This provision suggests that many parties will in fact designate English law or New York law as controlling, but it is not itself a choice-of-law provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-775\">\n   In short, we find that the ISDA Master Agreement does not mandate that all, or even most, of the contracts underlying swaps will be analyzed under New York law. Rather, choice-of-law would appear to raise an individual question, in that the governing law will vary from class member to class member based on the law designated in the transaction-specific schedules attached to the each ISDA Master Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-776\">\n   After oral argument, at which we identified OTC plaintiffs' failure to properly interpret the ISDA Master Agreement (Hr'g Tr. 47:23-48:10), OTC plaintiffs submitted supplemental materials supporting the contention that the ISDA Master Agreements controlling each of the named plaintiffs' transactions of LIBOR-based instruments designated New York law as governing. (Letter from William Carmody to the Court, Jan. 25, 2018, ECF No. 2414;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-777\">\n   Decl. of Geng Chen, Jan. 25, 2018, ECF No. 2415 (\"Chen Decl.\").) OTC defendants responded to this submission, identifying an ISDA Master Agreement governing certain transactions by named plaintiff Yale University that designated English law rather than New York law. (Letter from Abram Ellis to the Court, Feb. 1, 2018, ECF No. 2419; Decl. of Abram Ellis, Feb. 1, 2018, ECF No. 2420.) OTC plaintiffs responded that the Yale ISDA Master Agreement designating English law did not apply to any of Yale's LIBOR-based instruments. (Letter from William Carmody to the Court, Feb. 13, 2018, ECF No. 2424.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-778\">\n   Accepting this latter representation, the proposition that each of the ISDA Master Agreements underlying the\n   <em>\n    named plaintiffs'\n   </em>\n   LIBOR-based transactions with panel banks designated New York law as the substantive law to be applied is a correct one. But this fact hardly establishes that all of the\n   <em>\n    class's\n   </em>\n   ISDA Master Agreements so designated (or at least a sufficiently overwhelming percentage such that variations in controlling law do not pose predominance issues). Rather, Yale's English law ISDA Master Agreement-even if did not ultimately support any of Yale's LIBOR-based transactions-suggests that the designation of non-New York law in an ISDA Master Agreement is hardly hypothetical. Certain other named plaintiffs' designation of non-New York law-even if limited to certain issues of law-corroborates OTC defendants' suggestion that not all ISDA Master Agreements designate only New York law. Taken together, we find that this evidence is sufficient to suggest that\n   <em>\n    for the class as a whole\n   </em>\n   -the inquiry of relevance here-not all class members will have ISDA Master Agreements designating only New York law. In the absence of definitive evidence to the contrary, examples in the record of ISDA Master Agreements designating non-New York law render OTC defendants' argument here easily distinguishable from the \"bald speculation\" rejected by the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re U.S. Foodservice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699958\" index=\"668\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/108/#p129\">\n    729 F.3d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . OTC plaintiffs have not established that all ISDA Master Agreements designate New York law; any requirement that OTC defendants more actively\n   <em>\n    disprove\n   </em>\n   the proposition that New York law controls all ISDA Master Agreements would improperly invert the burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-779\">\n   Further, in focusing on whether the ISDA Master Agreements governing the LIBOR-based\n   <em>\n    swaps\n   </em>\n   have designated New York law, OTC plaintiffs have not addressed the choice-of-law issues relating to\n   <em>\n    bonds\n   </em>\n   , which remain equally relevant to the proposed class. Specifically, while ISDA Master Agreements govern swaps, no evidence in the record suggests that ISDA Master Agreements also govern bonds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the structure and terms of the ISDA Master Agreement contemplate an ongoing relationship between two specified parties, which is applicable in the swap context but is incongruent with the more retail nature of bond issuances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, provisions referring to the netting of payments have little bearing in this context: after the bond is initially purchased, payments are made only by the bond issuer to the bondholder. Similarly, provisions referring to default by either party (ISDA Master Agreement \u00b6 5) are inapplicable in the context of a bond issuance, where the obligations flow only from\n   the bond issuer to the bondholder; the concept of \"default\" by a bondholder in this context is nonsensical. In sum, the extensive references of this type to mutual obligations suggest that the ISDA Master Agreements apply in the swap context but not the bond context. OTC plaintiffs have offered no evidence that all (or even most) LIBOR-based bonds were governed by New York law, under an ISDA Master Agreement or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-780\">\n   In sum, we find that while ISDA Master Agreements control the vast majority of swaps, they do not uniformly designate only New York law as controlling. Further, based on our reading of the ISDA Master Agreement and the absence of evidence relating specifically to bonds, we find that bonds encompassed within the proposed class definition are not governed by ISDA Master Agreements at all. Because ISDA Master Agreements apply to only a portion of the LIBOR-based instruments in the class, certification of the proposed class will likely require the application of the substantive laws of multiple jurisdictions to OTC plaintiffs' implied covenant claim. Variations in substantive law are therefore a relevant consideration, and we turn to that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-781\">\n   As OTC defendants correctly point out and other courts have identified, the scope of the implied covenant varies across states.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lane v.

(Letter from Abram Ellis to the Court, Feb. 1, 2018, ECF No. 2419.) Citing certain named plaintiffs' ISDA Master Agreements belatedly supplied by the OTC plaintiffs, OTC defendants contend that even among choice-of-law provisions designating New York law, some explicitly exclude New York choice-of-law rules whereas others are silent on the issue. For example, one of named plaintiff Baltimore's ISDA Master Agreement Schedules designates simply \"the laws of the State of New York,\" (Chen Decl. ex. C at 19), whereas another one of Baltimore's ISDA Master Agreement Schedules designates \"the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its choice of law doctrine,\" (Chen Decl. ex. E at 7). Accordingly, OTC defendants contend, New York choice-of-law provision notwithstanding, that the determination of what substantive law to apply will continue to introduce individual issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-803\">\n   New York law, however, appears to treat as identical a choice-of-law provision designating New York law exclusive of New York conflict-of-law principles and a choice-of-law provision designating New York law without such an exclusion.

We accordingly reject OTC defendants' argument that the class members' subjective understandings of LIBOR will introduce additional individual questions. (OTC Defs.' Class Opp'n 24-25.) Given the strictly objective nature of this aspect of the class's implied covenant claims, this consideration does not weigh on the individual question side of the scale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-813\">\n   However, we lack OTC plaintiffs' confidence that a similar analysis of the implied covenant can be applied to all of the LIBOR-based instruments specified in the class definition. Because the implied covenant is limited by the \"other terms of the contractual relationship,\"\n   <em>\n    Dalton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594537\" index=\"741\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/384/#p389\">\n    87 N.Y.2d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594537\" index=\"742\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/384/#p389\">\n    639 N.Y.S.2d 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594537\" index=\"743\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/384/#p389\">\n    663 N.E.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the underlying contract must\n   be analyzed. In this case, while ISDA Master Agreements (and accompanying schedules) govern the vast majority of\n   <em>\n    swap\n   </em>\n   transactions covered by the class definition, no evidence exists in the record as to whether bonds are similarly governed. Rather, as we analyzed above, the structure and format of the ISDA Master Agreement strongly suggests that bonds generally are not governed by ISDA Master Agreements at all. Again, OTC plaintiffs have offered no evidence of contracts governing bonds and have offered no analysis of whether those contracts may differ between bond issuances (even if issued by the same panel bank). In the face of this evidentiary void, we are skeptical that common questions will predominate over individual ones in analyzing the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contracts at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-814\">\n   This skepticism is confirmed by several additional dimensions of variation even within ISDA Master Agreements: some contain arbitration clauses, as suggested by an ISDA publication that \"provides guidance on the use of an arbitration clause with either the ISDA 2002 Master Agreement ... or the ISDA 1992 Master Agreement ... and includes a range of model arbitration clauses\" (OTC Defs.' Class Opp'n 24 &amp; n.19); some contain waivers of a right to trial by jury, as one of Jennie Stuart's and one of Baltimore's ISDA Master Agreements do (Chen Decl. ex. B at 36, ex. C at 21); and some designate exclusive jurisdiction in other forums, such as the designation of Maryland state court or federal court in the District of Maryland in two of Baltimore's ISDA Master Agreements (Chen Decl. ex. D sched. at 7, ex. E sched. at 7), and the designation of Pennsylvania state court or federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Bucks County's ISDA Master Agreement (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. B at 29). Each of these dimensions of variation raises individual issues bearing directly on the justiciability of a putative class member's claims in a class action before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-815\">\n   <strong>\n    2.4.2. Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-816\">\n   Limiting the class to instruments with a choice-of-law provision designating New York law also does not salvage class treatment for OTC plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims. Those claims do not arise under a contract in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LIBOR III\n   </em>\n   , 27 F.Supp.3d at 483 ;\n   <em>\n    LIBOR II\n   </em>\n   , 962 F.Supp.2d at 630 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schwab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516091\" index=\"744\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/68/\">\n    883 F.3d at 96-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, OTC plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims are not subject to any choice-of-law provision that may be contained in the contract(s) underlying the transaction. Thus, the proposed modification would not ameliorate the predominance issues presented by variations in states' substantive laws of unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-817\">\n   <strong>\n    2.4.3. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-818\">\n   Modification of the class definition in the manner proposed by OTC plaintiffs at the eleventh, or perhaps thirteenth, hour would not cure the deficiencies that we have previously identified. Common questions would not predominate OTC plaintiffs' implied covenant claims even when the individual issues raised by variations in state law are not weighed in the predominance analysis. OTC plaintiffs have not established that the contracts underlying the LIBOR-based instruments specified in the class definition are sufficiently similar in material respects, and the individual questions introduced by the variations within ISDA Master Agreements identified by the OTC defendants further weigh against predominance. Further, modification of the class definition would have no impact on the predominance analysis as to unjust enrichment, given that contractual choice-of-law provisions will not dictate the state substantive law under which the unjust enrichment claims will be analyzed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-819\">\n   <strong>\n    2.5. Superiority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-820\">\n   Once again applying the Rule 23(b)(3) factors, we conclude that class action treatment would be superior as to OTC plaintiffs' antitrust claims, but not their state-law implied covenant and unjust enrichment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-821\">\n   As we have discussed in the context of the other putative class actions, class members lack a strong interest in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions in the absence of serious conflicts between them, supporting a finding of superiority under Rule 23(b)(3)(A). This action has progressed further than the other actions asserting similar claims, thereby supporting superiority under Rule 23(b)(3)(B).

(Westlaw 2017) (noting that in a nationwide class of state-law claims, \"common issues may not predominate ... and/or the case may be unmanageable and therefore not a superior method of litigation\"). Further, OTC plaintiffs have not attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of ameliorative measures such as the certification of subclasses grouped to accommodate variations in state law. Accordingly, as to OTC plaintiffs' state-law claims, we conclude that class-action treatment would not be superior to the maintenance of individual actions based on our manageability concerns. By contrast, OTC plaintiffs' antitrust claims, asserted under federal law, raise no such concerns; we accordingly find that class-action treatment would be superior as to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-823\">\n   <strong>\n    2.6. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-824\">\n   OTC plaintiffs' motion for class certification is granted in part and denied in part. A class limited to OTC plaintiffs' antitrust claims against Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (Count 1 of the Corrected Third Consolidated Amended Complaint) will be certified. As to those claims, we conclude that OTC plaintiffs have sufficiently established the requirements of Rule 23, including the requirement that common questions predominate over individual ones. The individual questions of damages identified by OTC defendants are insufficient to defeat predominance or, by extension, certification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-825\">\n   While we certify a class as to their antitrust claims, OTC plaintiffs have not established that common questions predominate as to their state-law claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for unjust enrichment. Variations in the substantive law to be applied introduce individual questions defeating predominance and superiority for the class\n   as initially proposed, and modification to limit the class to transactions including a New York choice-of-law provision would not tip the predominance balance as to these claims. Choice-of-law provisions do not govern OTC plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims, and OTC plaintiffs have not established predominance in the analysis of their implied covenant claims given the variations in ISDA Master Agreements observed in the record and the lack of evidence as to LIBOR-based instruments not governed by ISDA Master Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-826\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, a class is certified under Rule 23(b)(3), defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-827\">\n   All persons or entities residing in the United States that purchased, directly from a Panel Bank (or a Panel Bank's subsidiaries or affiliates), a LIBOR-Based Instrument that paid interest indexed to a U.S. dollar LIBOR rate set any time during the period August 2007 through August 2009 (\"Class Period\") regardless of when the LIBOR-Based Instrument was purchased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-828\">\n   The term \"LIBOR-Based Instrument\" is defined with reference to page 298 of this opinion, and certain individuals and entities are excluded from the class consistent with the exclusion set forth on page 298 of this opinion. Additionally, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland; the City of New Britain, Connecticut; Vistra Energy Corp.; Yale University; and Jennie Stuart Medical Center, Inc. are appointed as lead plaintiffs.

First, all three groups of plaintiffs have been afforded more discovery than is typical at the class certification stage. The class certification schedule lasted for almost a year and a half (Letter to Counsel from the Court, Dec. 23, 2015, ECF No. 1268), and as counsel for OTC plaintiffs have summarized, the record in this case has included more than 1.1 million documents and 6000 audio files (Dec. 15, 2017 Motion, ECF No. 2386). As we recognized even before the class certification process began in earnest, plaintiffs\n   have had access to the materials generated by \"multiple government investigations, consent decrees, [and] trials\" regarding LIBOR manipulation. (Dec. 16, 2015 Hr'g Tr. 21:1-2, ECF No. 1271.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-832\">\n   Thus, the record is well-developed, and this extensive record has been considered in reaching the certification decisions set forth above. The parties have had ample time to marshal the strongest evidence in support of or in opposition to class certification, and the time to supplement the record-at least for class certification purposes-has passed. A lingering possibility as to the existence of more documents or data, potentially relevant to the propriety of certification but undiscovered after more than six years of litigation, will not be sufficient to render our certification decisions \"questionable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-833\">\n   Second, in resolving these motions, we have analyzed-over the course of several hundred pages-each of the class certification requirements as they pertain to the three proposed classes, even when doing so was not strictly necessary to reach a decision on the certification question itself. Issues of standing, the varying definitions of what constitutes \"injury,\" and the applicability of the First Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Nexium\n   </em>\n   in this circuit have presented some challenge, and further clarity on those issues may broadly be helpful. However, none of our holdings depends strictly on our analysis of an unsettled area of law; rather, they represent our application of well-settled principles of class certification law to a unique set of facts. Accordingly, we do not view class certification in this case as having presented any \"novel legal question[s] ... of fundamental importance to the development of the law of class actions\" that are also \"likely to escape effective review after entry of final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sumitomo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9482491\" index=\"752\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/262/134/#p140\">\n    262 F.3d at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-834\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     VII.

This argument is not necessarily persuasive, as Dr. Seyhun's opinions regarding the relationship between changes in LIBOR and changes in EDF prices apply equally to changes in LIBOR caused by trader-based manipulation in Period 0 and changes in LIBOR caused by persistent suppression in the later part of the Class Period. Dr. Culp finds meaningfully different results when Dr. Seyhun's analyses are conducted separately only over Period 0 and not the Suppression Period (Culp Initial Report \u00b6 216, tbl.6), which lends support for the theory that macroeconomic factors-which differed substantially between Period 0 and the Suppression Period-heavily influence the \"impact factors\" that Dr. Seyhun calculates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-878\">\n    We are similarly skeptical of Rabobank's arguments relying on inconsistency between Dr. Seyhun's findings and Dr. Culp's findings, as any such inconsistency would not call into question the reliability of Dr. Seyhun's methodologies.
