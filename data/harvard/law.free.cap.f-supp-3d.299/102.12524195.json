INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Jemmie L. Welch, an employee of the Smithsonian Institution (\"Smithsonian\"), brings this action against Defendant David. J. Skorton, the Secretary of the Smithsonian. Mr. Welch alleges that the Smithsonian failed to accommodate his disability, intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of disability, retaliated against him after he filed Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") complaints, and subjected him to a hostile work environment, all in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. The Smithsonian moves for summary judgment, asserting that no reasonable jury could find that it refused Mr. Welch's request for an accommodation; that Plaintiff did not suffer any adverse employment action to support his claims of retaliation and disability discrimination; that the Smithsonian had legitimate, nondiscriminatory and non-retaliatory reasons for any alleged action that might be construed as adverse and Mr. Welch has failed to rebut those explanations; and that the conduct Mr. Welch alleges is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to rise to the level of a legally cognizable hostile work environment claim. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Jemmie L. Welch began working at the Smithsonian Institution's Office of Protection Services in October 2008. Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def.'s SUMF\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 24; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Opp'n to MSJ\") at 2, ECF No. 25. In February 2010, Mr. Welch was diagnosed with diabetes. Opp'n to MSJ at 2. The Smithsonian's Office of Equal Employment and Minority Affairs granted Mr. Welch accommodations in the form of regular breaks to monitor and control his diabetes. Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 5. Specifically, the Smithsonian and Mr. Welch agreed that he would take breaks at 10:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 2:00 p.m., barring an emergency. Decision of Accommodation Request (Dec. 28, 2010), Ex. C, ECF No. 24-1; Email from Carlos Davila to Joseph Powell (Sept. 30, 2015), Ex. D, ECF No. 24-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Welch alleges that on March 9, 2015, Sergeant Joseph Powell, Mr. Welch's first-line supervisor, did not relieve Mr. Welch at 2:00 p.m. so that he could take his scheduled break. Compl. at 4, ECF No. 1. Mr. Welch phoned Sgt. Powell around either 2:30 p.m. or 2:40 p.m. to ask why he had not yet received his scheduled break. Aff. of Jemmie L. Welch (\"Welch Aff.\") at 3, Ex. A, ECF No. 24-1 (asserting that he called Sgt. Powell \"after 2:40 p.m.\"); Dep. of Joseph A. Powell (\"Powell Dep.\") 44:18-24, Ex. F, ECF No. 24-1 (asserting that Mr. Welch called at \"about 2:30 p.m.\" to request his last break). Sgt. Powell told Mr. Welch that he had simply forgotten to relieve him of his post, as he had been distracted by other tasks. Welch Aff. at 3; Powell Dep. 45:2-10. Shortly after the phone call, Mr. Powell sent someone to relieve Mr. Welch, and Mr. Welch received his break at approximately 2:45 p.m. Compl. at 4. During the nearly 45 minutes that Mr. Welch was forced to wait to address his health condition, he contends that he urinated himself. Compl. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next day, Mr. Welch complained to Carol Gover, the Affirmative Employment Program Manager at the Smithsonian's Office of Equal Employment and Minority Affairs, and to Sergeant Carlos Davila, Mr. Welch's Unit Supervisor. Email from Jemmie Welch to Carol Gover &amp; Carlos Davila\n   (Mar. 10, 2015), Ex. G, ECF No. 24-1. In his message, Mr. Welch contended that Sgt. Powell had failed to timely release him for his breaks on other occasions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response to Mr. Welch's email, Ms. Gover recommended that Mr. Welch contact his supervisor within fifteen minutes of any missed break. Email from Carol Gover to Jemmie Welch (Mar. 10, 2015), Ex. G. In addition, Ms. Gover forwarded Mr. Welch's message to Larry Carpenter, a Security Manager, who promised to \"do everything possible to ensure that [O]fficer Welch receives his official breaks on time.\" Email from Larry Carpenter (Mar. 18, 2015), Ex. G. Mr. Carpenter explained that he had instructed each supervisor to notify him by email each day to confirm that Mr. Welch had received his scheduled breaks.\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   Email from Larry Carpenter (Mar. 10, 2015), Ex. E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Welch claims that Sgt. Powell retaliated against him for contacting his supervisor and Ms. Gover to file an EEO complaint. Compl. at 5. Mr. Welch alleges that Sgt. Powell's retaliatory conduct consisted of unfairly singling him out on two separate occasions. First, Mr. Welch claims that, on March 12, 2015, during a roll call at which five other officers were present, Sgt. Powell informed the other officers that Mr. Welch had filed an EEO complaint against Sgt. Powell. Compl. at 5-6. Sgt. Powell then requested that Mr. Welch to e-mail him after each of his breaks to confirm that he had received the requested breaks. Compl. at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Powell Dep. 96:24-98:12. Sgt. Powell contends that he was later instructed by his supervisors that it was his responsibility to email to confirm that Mr. Welch had received his scheduled breaks. Thus, Mr. Welch only emailed to confirm that he received breaks on March 12, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Powell Dep. 98:5-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, Mr. Welch claims that, on March 23, 2015, Sgt. Powell singled him out for criticism. That day, Mr. Welch was assigned to a post on the loading dock, but he briefly left his post to relieve another officer who needed an emergency bathroom break. Compl. at 7-8. Sgt. Powell called Mr. Welch back to his post on the loading dock and blamed him for a door being left open at the site. Compl. at 8-9. Mr. Welch contends that this criticism was unfair because he did not know that the door on the loading dock had been left ajar because he had stepped away to relieve another officer. Compl. at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a result of these incidents, Mr. Welch filed the present suit in March 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Mr. Welch's complaint alleges that Defendant violated the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20791\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and it also asserts common law tort and contract claims for \"breach of Reasonable Accommodations, ... tort[i]ous interference with written and agreed upon accommodation, for intentional infliction of emotional distress, [and] for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\" Compl. at 1-2.

Specifically, he alleges that (1) Defendant failed to accommodate his disability; (2) Defendant intentionally discriminated against him because of his disability; (3) Defendant retaliated against him for filing EEO complaints; and (4) Defendant subjected him to a hostile work environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 5-10. Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on each claim. Specifically, Defendant contends that Mr. Welch's failure-to-accommodate claim fails because he cannot show that the Smithsonian refused to accommodate him; that Mr. Welch's intentional discrimination and retaliation claims fail because Mr. Welch has not shown that he was subjected to any adverse actions; that the Smithsonian has offered legitimate, non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory explanations for any purportedly adverse actions; and that Mr. Welch's hostile work environment claim does not assert allegations that are sufficiently severe or pervasive to entitle him to relief. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"Def.'s MSJ\") at 10-14, ECF No. 24. For the reasons explained below, the Court grants Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Failure to Accommodate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Welch first contends that the Smithsonian violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to accommodate his disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 4. Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because the undisputed material facts show that the Smithsonian did not refuse to accommodate Mr. Welch. Def.'s MSJ at 9-10. The Court agrees and grants summary judgment for Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To prevail on a failure-to-accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence (1) that he was disabled, (2) that his federal employer had notice of his disability, and (3) that the employer denied his request for a reasonable accommodation of his disability.\n   <em>\n    Chenari v. George Washington Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188682\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/740/#p746\">\n    847 F.3d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 746-47 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Defendant does not dispute that the first two requirements are met-Mr. Welch was disabled and the Smithsonian had notice of Mr. Welch's disability. Defendant contends, however, that Mr. Welch cannot produce sufficient evidence to meet the third element because no reasonable jury could find that the Smithsonian denied Mr. Welch's request for a reasonable accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ordinarily, a failure-to-accommodate case involves an employer's purported refusal to participate in good faith in the interactive process of developing a plan to enable an employee to continue working despite his disability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward v. McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178994,4110651\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/24/\">\n    762 F.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31-32 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (explaining the standard for evaluating such a claim). Mr. Welch's claim, however, is different. Mr. Welch does not dispute that he requested an accommodation in the form of periodic breaks to tend to his health condition and that the Smithsonian granted the request, approving a schedule that would afford him daily breaks in the mid-morning, at lunchtime, and in the afternoon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decision on Accommodation Request (Dec. 28, 2010), Ex. C. Likewise, Mr. Welch does not argue that the schedule that the parties developed did not reasonably accommodate his disability. Rather, Mr. Welch contends that the Smithsonian denied him an accommodation on March 9, 2015 when it was about forty-five minutes late in providing Mr. Welch's scheduled break. The Court agrees with the Smithsonian that no reasonable jury could find that Defendant's provision of a delayed break on one occasion, or even a handful of sporadic occasions\n   before he complained, constituted a denial of an accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, to be sure, the Court agrees with Mr. Welch's general assertion that an employer does not meet its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act by agreeing to accommodate an employee in theory and then failing to do so in practice.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norden v.

Second, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   , there is substantial evidence on record showing efforts to ensure that Mr. Welch's supervisors adhered to his accommodation plan going forward. For example, Carol Gover \"thank[ed]\" Mr. Welch for notifying her of \"the supervisor's oversight\" regarding the provision of breaks and \"recommend[ed] that [Mr. Welch] contact the appropriate supervisor within 15 minutes of a missed break if an oversight occurs in the future.\" Email from Carol Gover to Jemmie Welch at 1, Ex. G. Likewise, Lieutenant Arnold Moss instructed Mr. Welch to contact a supervisor if he did not receive his break within three to five minutes of the scheduled time. Email from Arnold Moss to Jemmie Welch, Ex. E. And Security Manager Larry Carpenter specifically demanded that Mr. Welch's supervisors \"[e]nsure the MPO Jemmie Welch receives his daily breaks at 10:00 am, 12:00pm, and 2:00pm\" and requested that the supervisors send \"daily e-mail notifications\" to confirm that Mr. Welch had received his breaks.

The allegations plainly do not rise to the level of an adverse employment action as none can be said to tangibly affect the terms, conditions, or privileges of Mr. Welch's current or future employment.

Welch Aff. at 3; Powell Dep. 45:2-10. Though Mr. Welch has provided some evidence that Sgt.

Powell was \"on the computer reading Msn Sport page\" when he was supposed to relieve Mr. Welch for his scheduled break), ECF No. 25-3, Mr. Welch has provided no evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that Sgt. Powell intentionally delayed giving Mr. Welch his break because of Mr. Welch's disability. Furthermore, Defendant has asserted that Sgt. Powell asked Mr. Welch to email to confirm that he had received his scheduled break because he was attempting to make sure that Mr. Welch was properly accommodated. Def.'s MSJ at 15. Mr. Welch has offered no evidence that might undermine this explanation. These are legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanations for Defendant's conduct.

First, the allegedly harassing conduct was infrequent, occurring only on a small number of occasions. Mr. Welch has not argued that the purportedly hostile environment extended beyond the incidents on March 9, 2015, when Mr. Welch belatedly received his scheduled break; on March 12, 2015 during roll call; and on March 23, 2015 at the loading dock. Second, Mr. Welch was in no way physically threatened by any of the alleged incidents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p788\">\n    524 U.S. at 787-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p788\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a factor in assessing the hostility of a work environment is whether plaintiff was physically threatened). Third, Mr. Welch's claims appear\n   to primarily involve work-related actions by supervisors, and courts have generally rejected such claims as sufficient to constitute a hostile work environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wade v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239978\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/780/1/#p19\">\n    780 F.Supp.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19 (D.D.C. 2011) (collecting case). Fourth, \"in order to succeed on a hostile work environment claim, the behavior complained of must be 'so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim's employment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Townsend v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268044\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/280/#p312\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312-13 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503242\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/75/#p81\">\n    523 U.S. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503242\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/75/#p81\">\n    118 S.Ct. 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503242\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/75/#p81\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). None of the behavior Mr. Welch complains of is objectively offensive. For example, while it is surely unfortunate that Mr. Welch purportedly urinated himself because of Sgt. Powell's forty-five minute delay in providing Mr. Welch's scheduled break, this does not show that Sgt. Powell's behavior was itself offensive. Mr. Welch does not allege-and certainly offers no evidence showing-that Sgt. Powell delayed in providing a timely break in an attempt to prompt such a response from Mr. Welch or to otherwise humiliate him. And no reasonable jury could infer such an intent on this record. In sum, even affording Mr. Welch all reasonable inferences, as this Court must, he has not provided facts sufficient to permit an inference that his employer's conduct created a hostile work environment. Accordingly, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 24) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    At the motion-to-dismiss stage, Defendant had originally argued that Mr. Welch had failed to exhaust administrative remedies under the Rehabilitation Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 5-6, ECF No. 3.
