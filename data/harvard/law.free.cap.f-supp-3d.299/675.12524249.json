After an earlier partial motion to dismiss was granted, Defendant filed an Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Now, the City of Philadelphia, former Commissioner of the Philadelphia Prison System Louis Giorla, Warden William Lawton, Correctional Lieutenant Kevin Sizer, and Correctional Officer Ervin Young (collectively, the \"City Defendants\"), move to dismiss all claims asserted against them for failure to state a plausible claim to relief. For the following reasons, the motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges the following facts, which are presumed to be true for the purposes of the motion to dismiss. On July 19, 2014, Plaintiff, an inmate on the C-1 cell block at the Philadelphia House of Correction, was assaulted by another inmate, Defendant Allen Tumblin, in the presence of Sizer, Young, and other unnamed correctional officers. While Plaintiff was being attacked by Tumblin, his head hit protruding water pipes, which lacerated his forehead, causing permanent facial nerve damage and scarring. Plaintiff was first sent to the prison medical officials, and then to a hospital, where he received fourteen stitches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of the attack, Tumblin was a pretrial detainee being held on charges including simple assault, robbery while inflicting bodily harm, possession of an instrument of crime, and terroristic threats. The day before Tumblin assaulted Plaintiff, Tumblin had physically injured another inmate, Nicholas Williams. Plaintiff alleges, upon information and belief, that Defendants Giorla, Lawton, Sizer, and Young knew that Tumblin's July 18 assault of Williams was unprovoked and not based on personal animus. Nevertheless, the corrections officers took no action to segregate Tumblin from the general population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that, after the assault, Sizer, Young, and other corrections officers conspired to cover up the incident by creating false write-ups blaming Plaintiff for the incident and placing him in solitary confinement. Plaintiff asserts that the conspiracy was motivated by discrimination against him based on his race and ethnicity. Plaintiff also asserts that the City had a policy and custom of condoning racial and ethnic discrimination in prison disciplinary proceedings. Plaintiff further claims that the Defendants intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him and that he was falsely imprisoned. Plaintiff seeks relief in the form of monetary damages, including compensatory damages, punitive damages, treble damages, consequential damages, delay damages, and attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In evaluating a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must \"accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires \" 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,' in order to 'give the defendant fair notice of what the...claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This pleading standard does not mandate \" 'detailed factual allegations,' \" but it requires more than an \"unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, in order \"to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This standard \" 'simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of' the necessary element.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, \"[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Count I (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    and Eighth Amendment Violations)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Giorla, Lawton, Sizer, and Young violated his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to\n   the substantial risk of serious harm that Tumblin's presence on the C-1 cell block posed to Plaintiff, and failed to protect Plaintiff when Tumblin attacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In order to state a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a plaintiff must plead that an individual acting under the color of state law deprived him or her of a constitutional right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this context, a prison official does not violate the Eighth Amendment unless (1) \"the deprivation [is], objectively, sufficiently serious,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   such that it \"result[s] in the denial of 'the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities,' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) the official has a \"sufficiently culpable state of mind.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the first factor, an inmate must demonstrate that \"he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the second factor, an inmate must show that the prison official's state of mind is \"one of deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put differently, a prison official may not be held liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate adequate conditions of confinement unless \"the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,\" and \"the official [is] both [ ] aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he [ ] also draw[s] the inference.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, to prevail in a civil rights action, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant was personally involved in the alleged wrongful conduct; liability cannot be predicated solely on the operation of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[P]ersonal involvement can be shown through allegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and acquiescence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the outset, Defendants Giorla and Lawton argue that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against them because he has not plausibly alleged that they were personally involved in any wrongful conduct, or that they were aware of a substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiff's safety. The Court agrees. The Amended Complaint fails to allege any specific duties breached by Giorla and Lawton other than the general assertion that \"Defendant Tumblin should and would have been removed from the general prison\n   population\" under \"appropriate prison procedures\" and the conclusory statement that all City Defendants \"were aware\" of Tumblin's prior charges and unprovoked assault against Williams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a claim of deliberate indifference may not be based solely on \"the risk that an inmate with a history of violence might attack another inmate for an unknown reason,\" and Plaintiff has alleged no basis for concluding that Giorla and Lawton deliberately violated any specific prison procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Count I will be dismissed as to Defendants Giorla and Lawton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In contrast, Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a \u00a7 1983 claim against Defendants Sizer and Young. Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that both officers were present when Tumblin assaulted Plaintiff and failed to intervene to stop the assault. The Third Circuit has stated that if an officer witnesses an inmate assault and fails to intervene, \"his actions would seemingly constitute a paradigm case of deliberate indifference,\" if Plaintiff can show that the officer had \"a realistic and reasonable opportunity to intervene\" and \"simply refused to do so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this stage of the proceedings, Plaintiff is entitled to additional discovery to determine whether Sizer and Young's alleged failure to intervene was unreasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, Plaintiff will be permitted to proceed with Count I as to Defendants Sizer and Young.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Count III (State Law Negligence)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the City negligently maintained exposed water pipes at the Philadelphia House of Correction that posed a hazard to inmates' safety, failed to cover the pipes, and failed to warn Plaintiff and other inmates of the hazard. The City moves to dismiss on the grounds of immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While state municipalities are generally immune from liability for state tort law claims, Pennsylvania's Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act (\"TCA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   waives this immunity under certain conditions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   including the failure to properly maintain real property in the \"care, custody or control\" of the local agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City asserts that Plaintiff's claims fall outside this \"real property exception\" because the exception only applies to cases where \"the artificial condition or defect of land\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   causes injury, not merely when it facilitates injury by acts of others.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court disagrees. The facts as alleged in this case are distinguishable from cases in which courts have held that real property merely facilitated a plaintiff's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Philadelphia Housing Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court held that a municipal agency was immunized from suit where it did not adequately maintain security cameras on its property, which would have alerted employees to a third party illegally residing at the housing project who shot the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, the court reasoned that the victim's injuries were not caused by any physical defect of the property, but rather by a superseding cause-the unforeseeable shooting by the third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In contrast, the same court has held that under the real property exception of an analogous immunity statute, a Pennsylvania state agency can be held liable for injuries set in motion by the action of a third party when the negligently maintained property proximately caused the injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Philadelphia Housing Authority\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth Court held that a municipal agency could not assert immunity where the victim was \"injured on [government] property when a third party pushed her, causing her to fall and hit the stump of a metal pole protruding from the ground, thereby injuring her ankle.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court held that, even though a third party \"set the action in motion that caused [the] injuries,\" the agency could still be held liable for causing Plaintiff's injuries when it could not show that the \"plaintiff's injuries would have been the same even without its negligence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, like in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff alleges that a third party forcibly caused him to collide with an exposed fixture of municipal real property, thereby causing injury. Assuming the truth of Plaintiff's allegations, it is plausible that Plaintiff's injuries would not have been of the same magnitude if not for the protrusion of the pipes, and further factual development is needed. Therefore, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that his negligence claim against the City falls within the real property exception to the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Count IV (False Imprisonment)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In support of his state law false imprisonment claim, Plaintiff alleges that the City, Sizer, and Young created false prison write-ups and unlawfully placed him in solitary confinement in \"the hole\" for two weeks. To state a claim for false imprisonment under Pennsylvania law, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that (1) he or she was detained, and (2) the detention was unlawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court is unaware of any cases in which a prisoner who was lawfully incarcerated was permitted to proceed with a false imprisonment claim under Pennsylvania law based on the conditions of his or her confinement. Nonetheless, the Court need not decide whether such a claim can ever proceed, because the elements of detention and unlawfulness in this context would require, at the very least, the deprivation of a cognizable liberty interest without due process, and Plaintiff's allegations have failed to meet that burden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Third Circuit has held that \"an administrative sentence of disciplinary confinement, by itself, is not sufficient to create a liberty interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, a plaintiff asserting a deprivation of due process must allege facts sufficient to show a deprivation of a protected substantive right that is \"atypical and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\" such as denial of access to the courts, or retaliation against the exercise of such a right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, a plaintiff must also establish the denial of a basic opportunity to be heard and to defend against the allegations against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has made no such allegations in his Amended Complaint. Specifically, he has not alleged the deprivation of any substantive right other than confinement in administrative custody for two weeks, which courts have held does not deprive a plaintiff of a liberty interest as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor has he alleged facts indicating any intent by the City, Sizer, or Young to prevent Plaintiff from exercising-or to retaliate against any attempt by him to exercise-a protected right. Finally, Plaintiff has not alleged that he was denied an opportunity to challenge the allegedly false evidence against him. Accordingly, Claim IV will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Count V (Malicious Prosecution)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because Plaintiff has withdrawn his malicious prosecution claim, Count V of the Amended Complaint will be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Count VI (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Defendants intentionally caused him to suffer severe emotional distress alongside his physical injuries. An action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") requires a plaintiff to show that (1) the conduct is extreme; (2) the conduct is intentional or reckless; (3) the conduct caused emotional distress; and (4) the distress is severe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   To state a claim for IIED in Pennsylvania, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's conduct was \"so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The only ground Defendant asserts for dismissing Plaintiff's IIED claim is that the Amended Complaint does not specifically allege \"competent medical evidence\" of emotional distress. Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Kazatsky v. King David Memorial Park, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which the Supreme Court of\n   Pennsylvania affirmed the trial court's decision to grant compulsory nonsuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs introduced no competent medical evidence of emotional distress during trial. However, most federal district courts in this circuit have declined to require specific allegations of medical evidence at the motion to dismiss stage, and there is nothing in the text of\n   <em>\n    Kazatsky\n   </em>\n   itself that suggests the court intended to create a heightened pleading requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court declines to hold that\n   <em>\n    Kazatsky\n   </em>\n   bars Plaintiff's IIED claim at this stage.

The Court agrees.
