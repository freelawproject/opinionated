(Docket No. 50.)

Arnaldo Fern\u00e1ndez-Caraballo (\"Fern\u00e1ndez\"), a task force agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, conducted an investigation regarding Cartagena's purported possession of a machine gun on August 20, 2017. (Docket No. 1.) The following narrative is premised on Fern\u00e1ndez's affidavit in support of the criminal complaint. (Docket No. 1, Ex. 1.) The Court sets forth this narrative for the sole purpose of placing the pending motion to quash in its proper context, and makes no factual findings at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 20, 2017, Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\") agents from the Vega Baja Stolen Vehicles Unit refueled their patrol car at a Total Gas Station located in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1. The PRPD agents observed a white Kia Soul vehicle at a nearby carwash.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on their experience, the PRPD agents inferred that the Kia Soul displayed a fake license plate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The PRPD agents approached Cartagena and another individual, both of whom were seated at the carwash waiting area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. After identifying themselves as police officers, PRPD agents asked Cartagena whether the Kia Soul belonged to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cartagena said no. Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As PRPD agents questioned carwash employees about the Kia Soul, Cartagena ran from the location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cartagena disregarded the PRPD agents's order to stop until he fell along a ditch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, Cartagena brandished a firearm and fired at the PRPD agents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The PRPD agents fired back at Cartagena, as Cartagena continued to flee on foot while firing at PRPD agents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cartagena ultimately surrendered after sustaining a gunshot wound.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PRPD agents arrested Cartagena, and recovered from his person a Glock pistol containing a 30-round high-capacity magazine loaded with five rounds of ammunition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Attached\n   to the firearm was a device enabling it to fire in the fully automatic mode.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. PRPD agents also seized a 15-round capacity magazine loaded with 15 rounds of ammunition from Cartagena's immediate area, as well as a cell phone, a car key, and $2,090 United States dollars.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After further investigation, PRPD agents learned that the Kia Soul was previously reported stolen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The license plate that prompted the intervention was indeed fake.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. The car keys seized from Cartagena opened the Kia Soul, where PRPD agents recovered a Massachusetts driver's license bearing the name of an individual named Kevin Cartagena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Cartagena entered a plea of not guilty before Magistrate Judge F.

The Court ordered the parties to appear for a status conference on March 8, 2018, at which point the Court and the parties would discuss defendant's psychological evaluation and the progression of this case.

This status conference constituted a Rule 17.1 pretrial conference, not a trial or formal proceeding in which the parties would proffer evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Rule 17 identifies the subject of the subpoena as a \"witness,\" an individual who \"sees, knows, or vouches for something,\" and \"who gives testimony under oath or affirmation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 661 (9th ed. 2009). The subpoena issued for L\u00f3pez requested that he serve as a witness, not a mere messenger of documents within the chain of custody.

(Docket No. 50, Ex. 1.) This expansive language suggests that Cartagena has embarked on a fishing expedition, rather than seek to compel the production of relevant and admissible evidence. Cartagena's response to the United States's motion to quash reinforces the Court's characterization of the subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   According to Cartagena, \"criminal defense attorneys have an ethical obligation to investigate cases.\" (Docket No. 52 at p. 3.) This is true. A duty to investigate does not, however, grant defendants a license to invoke the subpoena power of the Court in a manner that undermines Rule 17. Cartagena surmises that the subpoenaed records have \"the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     potential\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to bolster the complaint's allegations, it has the potential to undermine them, provide possible material impeachment, or give rise to the alternative theories of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5 (emphasis added).

Moreover, Cartagena cites no authority in support of the proposition that searching for \"alternative theories\" is a proper basis to compel production of documents. Consequently, Cartagena's desire to procure impeachment material, or evidence favorable to his case or to sentencing, cannot sustain the subpoena issued to L\u00f3pez at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In short, the Court cannot authorize a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum\n   </em>\n   that serves to unearth \"potential\" evidence because doing so would convert Rule 17 into the discovery tool it is not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noriega\n   </em>\n   , 764 F.Supp. at 1492 (\" Rule 17(c) which covers subpoenas for documents and other materials, is not a discovery device.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.
