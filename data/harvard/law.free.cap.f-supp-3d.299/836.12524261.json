MAZZANT, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court are Defendant Texhoma Fiber, LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 36) and Plaintiff PEG Bandwidth TX, LLC's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 37). Having considered the relevant pleadings and evidence, the Court finds that Plaintiff's motion should be granted. The Court further finds that Defendant's motion should be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff PEG Bandwidth TX, LLC (\"PEG\") provides network solutions for cellular telephone carriers. In 2010 and 2011, PEG began discussions with the Hilliary family about providing PEG access to fiber optic cables for the purpose of supplying \"backhaul\" service to cellular carriers in the Wichita Falls area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Texhoma Fiber, LLC (\"Texhoma Fiber\") is owned by the Hilliarys. The fiber in Wichita Falls was owned by Community Telephone, a subsidiary of Comcell, Inc. (\"Comcell\"), which was owned by the Humpert family. The Hilliarys were in discussions to purchase Comcell, but had not finalized the acquisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties negotiated an agreement whereby Texhoma Fiber would lease to PEG pre-existing fiber in the Wichita Falls area and PEG would pay Texhoma Fiber to build out and extend the Wichita Falls fiber network to make it suitable for PEG to supply backhaul service to its customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2011, the parties finalized the contract into an agreement called the Dark Fiber Lease Agreement (the \"Lease Agreement\"). Texhoma Fiber was named as the lessor in the Lease Agreement. The dark fiber leased in the Lease Agreement would eventually connect numerous sites in the Wichita Falls area. Under the Lease Agreement, PEG could connect its equipment to the fiber at each site and thereby use the fiber to transmit data between the sites for the benefit of its customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, PEG used the fiber leased pursuant to the Lease Agreement in order to service three CMRS [Commercial Mobile Radio Service] carriers-Verizon Wireless, US Cellular, and AT &amp; T. The term of the Lease Agreement was thirty (30) years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Lease Agreement stated that \"TEXHOMA FIBER owns and operates a continuous fiber optic network between the points identified in Exhibit A.\" The Lease Agreement defined the location of the fiber in Exhibit A as the \"Texhoma Fiber Route.\" The Lease Agreement provided for PEG to pay Texhoma Fiber $1.6 million in order to design, engineer, and construct a continuous fiber optic network in the Wichita Falls area that PEG could lease for the purpose of serving its cellular telephone customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Initially, the network would consist of 48-count fiber optic cable that connected the cell sites described on Exhibit \"A\" to the Lease Agreement. As amended, the Lease Agreement gave PEG the exclusive right to use only six of those fibers throughout the network.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, there were 42 fibers in the bundle to which PEG did not have exclusive access, even though it had largely paid for the construction of the network for those additional fibers. In total, PEG paid Texhoma Fiber $2,240,000 for the Texhoma Fiber Route.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In order to protect PEG's interests, the parties agreed that Texhoma Fiber could lease the other 42 fibers to other lessees subject to a non-circumvention provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   18.1 NON-CIRCUMVENTION. TEXHOMA FIBER shall not, directly or indirectly through other customers, offer or provide services to licensed CMRS carriers at the sites contained in Exhibit A, without the prior written consent of PEG. Nothing herein shall restrict TEXHOMA FIBER'S right to provide any services to wireless carriers at sites not contained in Exhibit A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lease Agreement, at \u00a7 18.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This 30-year non-compete obligation restricts Texhoma Fiber from directly or indirectly offering or providing any service to any licensed CMRS carriers at any of the sites located on Texhoma Fiber Route (or any other sites that became subject to the Lease Agreement), without first receiving written consent from PEG. The non-circumvention provision allowed Texhoma Fiber to use the other 42 fibers to service customers other than licensed CMRS carriers, such as local businesses seeking to connect multiple sites. It also permitted Texhoma Fiber to use the other\n   42 fibers to provide backhaul service to CMRS carriers at locations not subject to the Lease Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 15, 2011, PEG entered into a Master Services Agreement (the \"US Cellular Agreement\") to provide cellular communication services to United States Cellular Corporation (\"US Cellular\"). On August 10, 2011, pursuant to the US Cellular Agreement, US Cellular issued a Market Service Order that authorized PEG to provide cell site backhaul services to US Cellular for five years at fourteen new cell sites in the Texhoma Fiber Route.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Texhoma Fiber ultimately never finalized its purchase of Comcell. Because Texhoma Fiber was using fiber owned by Comcell's subsidiary, Community Telephone, apparently without compensating Comcell, Comcell and Community Telephone eventually threatened to disconnect their fiber from the Texhoma Fiber Route. Then, Comcell and Community Telephone filed suit against both Texhoma Fiber and PEG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Texhoma Fiber settled with Comcell and Community Telephone in 2014. In the settlement, Texhoma Fiber agreed to pay Comcell and Community Telephone $250,000, to assign to Comcell the Lease Agreement, and to convey to Comcell half the fiber in the route served by the Lease Agreement. PEG was not a party to this settlement. On January 1, 2014, Texhoma Fiber, pursuant to \u00a7 18.10 of the Lease Agreement, assigned the Lease Agreement to Comcell (\"Comcell Assignment\"). The relevant assignment provision reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Texhoma does hereby assign and transfer unto Comcell, effective as of [January 1, 2014], all of Texhoma's benefits, obligations and liabilities under the PEG Bandwidth Contract, to have and hold the same. Subject to the provisions of Section 1(b) below, Comcell hereby accepts such assignment and transfer and therefore agrees to assume all of Texhoma's benefits, obligations and liabilities under the PEG Bandwidth Contract pursuant to the terms of this Assignment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Dkt. # 36, Exhibit 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By letter dated March 12, 2014, Texhoma Fiber, pursuant to \u00a7 18.10 of the Lease Agreement, notified PEG about the Comcell Assignment, and directed PEG to send all further payments due under the Lease Agreement to Comcell. The notice letter stated, \"Texhoma Fiber, LLC assigned to Comcell Inc., all rights, title and interest in the Dark Fiber Lease Agreement .... By this Notice, you are directed to make all future payments due under said Lease and amendments to Comcell, Inc.\" (Dkt. # 37, Exhibit 21). On July 2, 2014, PEG and Comcell agreed to amend the Lease Agreement for a third time to include Comcell as successor in interest to Texhoma Fiber. After the assignment, the fiber optic sheath in the Texhoma Fiber Route contained 24 fibers owned by Texhoma Fiber and 24 fibers owned by Comcell, with Comcell's fibers servicing PEG (Dkt. # 37, Exhibit 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the assignment, Texhoma leased certain fiber to Dobson Technologies (\"Dobson\"), which Dobson has used to provide cellular communication services to US Cellular at some of the US Cellular Sites (Dkt. # 39 at p. 7). In 2016, US Cellular did not renew its contract with PEG. US Cellular instead contracted for Dobson Technologies to provide service at the same sites subject to the Lease Agreement in the Wichita Falls area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 1, 2016, PEG filed its amended complaint asserting that Texhoma Fiber breached the Lease Agreement's thirty-year non-compete obligation by leasing fiber to Dobson at some of the US Cellular Sites where PEG formerly provided cell site backhaul services to US Cellular\n   (Dkt. # 4). On December 8, 2017, the Texhoma Fiber filed its Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 36). On the same day, PEG filed its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 37). On December 29, 2017, both parties filed their respective responses (Dkt. # 38; Dkt. # 39). On January 5, 2018, Texhoma Fiber filed its reply (Dkt. # 41). On January 8, 2018, PEG filed its reply (Dkt. # 43). On January 8, 2018, PEG filed its sur-reply (Dkt. # 44). On January 11, 2018, Texhoma Fiber filed its sur-reply (Dkt. # 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The purpose of summary judgment is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

The Court, sitting in diversity, applies Texas law in the interpretation of contracts.\n   <em>\n    H.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

Under Texas law, \"[t]he elements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) the existence of a valid contract between plaintiff and defendant; (2) the plaintiff's performance or tender of performance;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) the defendant's breach of the contract; and (4) the plaintiff's damage as a result of the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Staley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323527\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/490/#p499\">\n    320 S.W.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2010, no pet.). PEG claims that it can establish each element. Texhoma Fiber argues that the non-circumvention provision is invalid because it is overly broad, and that even if the covenant is valid, it did not breach the terms. The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 18.1 of the Lease Agreement disallows Texhoma Fiber from, directly or indirectly through other customers, offering or providing services to licensed CMRS carriers at the sites contained in Exhibit A, without the prior written consent of PEG. It is undisputed that Texhoma Fiber, indirectly through its customer Dobson, has since 2016 provided service to US Cellular at sites listed in Exhibit A to the Lease Agreement, as amended (Dkt. # 39 at \u00b6 18). Thus, Texhoma Fiber would seem to be in breach of the Lease Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, Texhoma Fiber argues that it assigned to Comcell all of its \"benefits, obligations and liabilities\" under the Lease Agreement. It further argues that the Lease Agreement does not limit the rights or obligations it can assign under the Lease Agreement, but simply requires it to provide notice to PEG of the assignment pursuant to \u00a7 18.10. Thus, the assignment did not exclude any of Texhoma Fiber's obligations under the Lease Agreement, and therefore, included the thirty-year non-circumvention obligation. Texhoma Fiber further claims that it conveyed to Comcell all of the fibers in the Wichita Falls Network that PEG had an exclusive right to use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   PEG claims that Texhoma Fiber's notice was incomplete. PEG asserts that Texhoma Fiber notified PEG only that it had \"assigned to Comcell, Inc., all\n   <em>\n    rights, title, and interest\n   </em>\n   \" in the Lease Agreement. Further, PEG asserts that the notice specifically addresses only payments due from PEG, which are to be directed to Comcell, instead of Texhoma Fiber, going forward. Thus, PEG claims that Texhoma Fiber did not notify PEG Bandwidth about assignment of any \"obligations,\" such as the non-circumvention obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   PEG further claims that Texhoma Fiber's notice was false because Texhoma Fiber had not assigned\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   rights, title, and interest to Comcell. Rather, Texhoma Fiber had retained its rights, title, and interest in\n   <em>\n    half\n   </em>\n   of the fiber which is the subject matter of the Lease Agreement. The Settlement Agreement with Comcell required Texhoma Fiber to execute a Bill of Sale, in\n   which Texhoma Fiber conveyed only half of its interest in the Texhoma Fiber Route. As a result, at most locations in the Texhoma Fiber Route, the fiber optic sheath contained twenty-four fibers owned by Texhoma Fiber and twenty-four fibers owned by Comcell, with Comcell's fibers servicing PEG Bandwidth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   PEG further argues that \u00a7 18.10 does not permit an assignment of all obligations, including the non-circumvention provision, but only part of the rights. According to PEG, in order to avoid the non-circumvention obligation with respect to its retained fibers, Texhoma Fiber has to prove a novation with respect to that obligation and asserts Texhoma Fiber has not presented any evidence showing PEG agreed to extinguish the non-circumvention obligation with respect to half of the fibers. PEG further argues Texhoma Fiber cannot point to any authority allowing it to destroy a contractual obligation by purporting to assign the obligation while keeping the contractual rights or property to which that obligation pertains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court need not address whether Texhoma Fiber's notice of the assignment was sufficient because it finds that the Lease Agreement does not extinguish Texhoma Fiber's non-circumvention obligation through an assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Seagull Energy E &amp; P, Inc. v. Eland Energy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Texas Supreme Court held that an assignment relieves a party of its obligations only if it effects a novation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8402504\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/207/342/#p346\">\n    207 S.W.3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (Tex. 2006).

Section 18.8 of the Lease Agreement provides that \"[n]o subsequent agreement concerning the Route shall be effective unless made in writing and executed by authorized representatives of the parties.\" There is no written, executed agreement releasing half of the fibers in the Texhoma Fiber Route from the non-circumvention obligation. Furthermore, the purpose of the non-circumvention provisions was to prevent Texhoma Fiber from providing cell site backhaul service to PEG's competitors at the sites subject to the Lease Agreement using the network paid for by PEG. To allow Texhoma Fiber to assign its non-circumvention obligation, retain half of the fibers subject to the Lease Agreement, and then subsequently lease those fibers to one of PEG's competitors would directly contradict that purpose. Therefore, the Court finds that Texhoma Fiber has a continuing obligation to not, directly or indirectly through other customers, offer or provide services to licensed CMRS carriers at the sites contained in Exhibit A to the Lease Agreement. Thus, the Court finds granting summary judgment in Texhoma Fiber's favor is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Texhoma Fiber further asserts that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   the general rule of reason [under the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act] does not apply to the noncompete obligation at issue in this case. Texhoma does not dispute that the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act is patterned off federal antitrust statutes or that the rule of reason standard that governs most restraints of trade under federal antitrust law also generally applies to contracts in restraint of trade under Texas law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Dkt. # 39 at p. 23).

The Court disagrees with PEG's argument but finds the Texas Covenants Not to Compete Act is still inapplicable to the Lease Agreement because the non-circumvention provision is a restrictive covenant running with the land, i.e. the Texhoma Fiber Route, and should be analyzed as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although not legally binding, the Court finds the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Rolling Lands Investments, L.C. v.

PEG concedes that \"[a]s of now, the Texas Legislature still has not fixed the hole created by case law construing Texas statutory law so as not to allow recovery of attorney fees from a limited liability company in a breach of contract action.\" (Dkt. # 38 at p. 5) (citing\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vast Construction, LLC v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2017, no pet. h.) ). Both PEG and Texhoma Fiber are limited liability companies and such a request for attorneys' fees is misplaced and PEG's claim for attorneys' fees should be dismissed. Summary judgment should be granted on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It is therefore\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 37) is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and the Court declares that Defendant is bound by the non-circumvention obligation until the expiration of the thirty-year Lease Agreement. Therefore, no material questions of fact exist with regard to whether Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for breach of the Lease Agreement. The only remaining issue to be decided by the trier of fact is the amount of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 36) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part. Defendant's motion is granted only as to Plaintiff's claim for attorneys' fees and Plaintiff's claim for attorneys' fees is hereby dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    \"Backhaul\" service connects a cell phone tower or site to a switch location designated by the cellular telephone carrier in order to enable the cellular carrier to service a market.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    This is a typical arrangement in the telecommunications industry whereby the lessor installs, maintains, and retains title to the fibers but attaches no electronics to the fibers. Instead, at each end of the fibers and at other locations between the end points, the lessee attaches the transmitting and receiving electronic equipment that processes and passes the communications signals over the optical fibers. Typically, as is the case here, the lessor builds a network consisting of a large number of fibers and then leases or otherwise conveys, pursuant to a substantial upfront fee paid prior to and/or contemporaneously with the delivery of the fibers, the exclusive right to use a subset of those fibers to the lessee for the entire anticipated useful life of the fibers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    After negotiations, the parties agreed that Texhoma Fiber would lease two fibers to PEG in the \"backbone\" of the fiber route, and four fibers in the \"lateral\" routes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In its Response to PEG's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Texhoma fiber asserts that \"PEG committed a prior breach of the [Lease Agreement] which excused Texhoma from continuing to perform.\" (Dkt. # 39 at p. 20). \"[T]he contention that a party to a contract is excused from performance because of a prior material breach by the other contracting party is an affirmative defense that must be affirmatively pleaded.\"\n    <em>\n     Pivotal Payments, Inc. v.
