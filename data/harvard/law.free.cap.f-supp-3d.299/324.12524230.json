Plaintiffs object to the motion to dismiss and also move for discovery on the issue of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. no. 95. Getinge AB objects to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs bring claims in individual cases for injuries they allege were caused by hernia repair products made from C-Qur mesh. They further allege that the C-Qur mesh products were developed, manufactured, marketed, and sold by the defendants, Getinge AB, Atrium Medical Corporation (\"Atrium\"), and Maquet Cardiovascular US Sales, LLC (\"Maquet\"). Atrium and Maquet are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Getinge AB. The cases have been consolidated in this court for pretrial proceedings as multi-district litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Getinge AB moves to dismiss all claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs object, arguing that they have satisfied their burden of showing that the court has personal jurisdiction over Getinge AB. Plaintiffs also move for leave to conduct discovery limited to Getinge AB's personal jurisdiction in the event that the court is not inclined to deny the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Master Long Form Complaint, plaintiffs allege that Getinge AB is a Swedish corporation with its principal place of business in Sweden. They allege that Atrium is incorporated under the laws of Delaware with its principal place of business in New Hampshire, and Maquet is incorporated under the laws of Delaware with its principal place of business in New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With regard to defendants' personal jurisdiction, plaintiffs allege:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   24. Defendants have and continue to conduct substantial business in the State of New Hampshire and in this District, distribute Hernia Mesh Products in this District, receive substantial compensation and profits from sales of Hernia Mesh Products in this District, and made material omissions and misrepresentations and breaches of warranties in this District, so as to subject them to\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction in this District.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   25. Defendants conducted business in the State of New Hampshire through sales representatives conducting business in the State of New Hampshire, and because Defendants were engaged in testing, developing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distributing, promoting and/or selling, either directly or indirectly, and/or through third parties or related entities, Hernia Mesh Products in New Hampshire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   26. Consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, this Court has\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over Defendants, because Defendants are present in the State of New Hampshire, such that requiring an appearance does not offend traditional notices of fair and substantial justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Doc. no. 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs do not allege that Getinge AB itself has any physical presence in New Hampshire or anywhere in the United States. They allege, however, that this court has personal jurisdiction over Getinge AB for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Getinge AB was directly responsible for the design, development, manufacture and sale of the C-Qur devices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. no. 53 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, 15, 16, 18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Getinge AB assumed Atrium's liabilities, and is therefore liable as Atrium's successor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Getinge AB is liable for Atrium's and Maquet's actions because they are Getinge AB's agents and/or alter egos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Getinge AB moves to dismiss, contending that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because it is a Swedish corporation without jurisdictional contacts with any state in the United States. It further contends it did not assume Atrium's liabilities and that plaintiffs cannot show that the activities of Atrium and Maquet can be imputed to Getinge AB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs object, arguing first that Getinge AB has waived a personal jurisdiction defense or should be judicially estopped from asserting the defense. Plaintiffs also argue that personal jurisdiction exists because, as they alleged in their complaint, Getinge AB is responsible for the C-Qur products sold after it acquired Atrium and because the activities of Atrium and Maquet can be attributed to Getinge AB under theories of assumption of liability, agency, and alter ego. Alternatively, plaintiffs move for leave to conduct discovery on the jurisdictional issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Waiver\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A defendant waives the defense of a lack of personal jurisdiction by failing to raise it in a timely motion or failing to include it in a responsive pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1). A defendant may also waive the defense through conduct that is inconsistent with the defense.\n   <em>\n    Vazquez-Robles v.

Conduct that may constitute waiver of the personal jurisdiction defense, in addition to a failure to raise the defense in a timely manner, includes \"participation in, or encouragement of, the district court proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Precision Etchings &amp; Findings, Inc. v.

Getinge AB argues that its involvement in routine case management matters did not waive its right to assert a lack of personal jurisdiction defense. Getinge AB also represents that it reserved the right in its response to plaintiffs' motion for transfer and consolidation and then asserted the defense in its answer and moved to dismiss in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A defendant does not waive a personal jurisdiction defense by participating in the initial proceedings for multi-district litigation as long as that defendant raises the defense in a timely motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    In re: Mobile Telecomms. Techs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274882\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/545/#p551\">\n    243 F.Supp.3d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551-52 (D.N.J. 2017). In this case, Getinge AB raised the lack of personal jurisdiction as an affirmative defense in its answer filed on June 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. no. 77 at 18. On the same day, Getinge AB filed its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. no. 80. Its participation in the preliminary multi-district litigation proceedings does not operate as a waiver of the defense. In short, plaintiffs have not shown that Getinge AB waived the defense of a lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Estoppel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Getinge AB is barred by judicial estoppel from raising the defense. In support, plaintiffs assert that Getinge AB's participation in a\n   related product liability action in New Hampshire state court and in a product liability action in California state court, without asserting a lack of personal jurisdiction defense in either case, bars the defense here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also rely on Getinge AB's suit in Delaware state court against the founder and primary shareholder of Atrium, Steve Herweck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The doctrine of judicial estoppel \"typically applies when, among other things, 'a party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.' \"\n   <em>\n    Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.

Although Getinge AB participated as a defendant in two cases without raising the defense, Getinge AB has not affirmatively taken a contrary position to the one it asserts here; that is, Getinge AB has not persuaded the courts in those two cases to find that personal jurisdiction existed there. Further, plaintiffs have not shown that Getinge AB is attempting to gain an unfair advantage by asserting the defense here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, plaintiffs have not shown that Getinge AB is barred from raising the defense of personal jurisdiction based on a theory of judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Personal jurisdiction implicates the power of a court over a defendant.

Plaintiffs review the standards provided under the transferor states' law but do not appear to rely on any specific provisions of state law.

Specifically, plaintiffs point to a Getinge advertisement in General Surgery News promoting the C-Qur family of products and directing customers to the Getinge website (www.Getingegroup.com). Plaintiffs also note that the website identifies C-Qur products as part of Getinge's hernia mesh products, and that it refers to the items as \"our\" products. Finally, plaintiffs submit a June 2016 letter from Getinge to customers regarding a competitor's hernia mesh product, which discusses \"Maquet Medical Systems USA/Getinge Group (formerly Atrium Medical Corporation)\" and refers to \"our\" C-Qur products. The letter lists an address for Getinge Group as 45 Barbour Pond Drive, Wayne, NJ 07470.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Getinge AB does not dispute that the products at issue in this litigation are marketed and sold under the Getinge name. It argues, however, that the name \"Getinge\" is used as a \"master brand,\" tradename, and trademark for marketing, and that this use is separate from the corporate identity of Getinge AB, a defendant in this case. It also distinguishes the \"Getinge Group,\" an entity with a New Jersey address, from Getinge AB, though it does not precisely explain the relationship between the entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Atrium and Maquet's Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the activities of Atrium and Maquet can be attributed to Getinge AB. Atrium and Maquet do not challenge the court's personal jurisdiction over them. Atrium has its principal place of business in Hudson, New Hampshire, and as such is \"at home\" in New Hampshire. Maquet has its principal place of business in New Jersey, making it \"at home\" there. In addition, Atrium and Maquet do not dispute that they are engaged in business in the United States and do not dispute that they have sufficient minimum contacts with all of the states implicated in this case to support personal jurisdiction. Therefore, their conduct could support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Getinge AB if either or both are operating as agents or alter egos of Getinge AB.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Medici v.

Getinge AB contends that plaintiffs' theory does not apply since it acquired Atrium in a \"reverse triangular merger,\" and otherwise argues that plaintiffs' proffered evidence does not show that Getinge AB assumed Atrium's liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that, in the alternative, Atrium and Maquet are Getinge AB's agents or alter egos. Plaintiffs cite evidence that Getinge AB, Atrium, and Maquet represent that they are a single entity, including statements and press releases from Atrium's website and Getinge AB's annual report. Plaintiffs also refer to Getinge AB's June 2016 letter that accepts ownership of the C-Qur products and directs customers with questions to contact a Maquet/Getinge AB representative, rather than an Atrium representative. Finally, plaintiffs point to the Maquet website which directs customers to contact \"Vascular Systems (formerly Atrium Medical)\" and which provides a VSpurchaseorders@Getinge.com email address. Getinge AB contends that plaintiffs are misreading the cited evidence and that, at best, the evidence shows \"an intent to unify under a common 'Getinge' brand and logo.\" Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   no. 113 at 13. It maintains that Atrium and Maquet are separate corporate entities from Getinge AB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Appropriate Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs have shown that complex relationships exist among Getinge AB and its subsidiaries. Plaintiffs point to evidence that Getinge AB assumed Atrium's liabilities and that Atrium is no longer operating as a separate entity. Getinge AB disputes the inferences plaintiffs urge from the evidence and other circumstances and denies that it assumed Atrium's liabilities or that Atrium and Maquet operate as its agents or alter egos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The jurisdictional issues raised here at this pre-discovery phase present difficult questions that are dominated by disputed facts. For example, the Getinge AB website and other advertising raise a question about Getinge AB's activities in advertising and marketing C-Qur mesh products in the United States. In addition, even if Atrium and/or Maquet are liable for plaintiffs' claims in this litigation, Getinge AB's liability depends on whether it is directly responsible for manufacturing and marketing C-Qur mesh products in the United States or whether it is responsible through assumption of Atrium's liabilities, agency, or alter ego status. Therefore, these questions raise issues both as to Getinge AB's personal jurisdiction and its liability on the merits of the claims in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In light of these factors, the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   standard is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    Foster-Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409614\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/138/#p143\">\n    46 F.3d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (courts should not use the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   standard in \"closer\" cases \"that feature conflicting versions of the facts\"). In addition, in light of how closely related the issues of personal jurisdiction are to questions surrounding Getinge AB's liability, the court will not employ the preponderance standard.\n   <em>\n    Hilsinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365734\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/409/#p418\">\n    109 F.Supp.3d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (courts should avoid the preponderance standard when it could raise \"potential issues regarding issue preclusion and law of the case\"). The likelihood standard is the middle ground between the extremes, the\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   and preponderance standards. For the reasons explained above, the court finds that the likelihood standard is most appropriate here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Jurisdictional Discovery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In addition to objecting to Getinge AB's motion to dismiss, plaintiffs have moved for leave to conduct jurisdictional discovery to develop additional proof to support the existence of personal jurisdiction over Getinge AB. A \"diligent plaintiff who sues an out-of-state corporation and who makes out a colorable case for the existence of\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction may well be entitled to a modicum of jurisdictional discovery if the corporation interposes a jurisdictional defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Negron-Torres v.

In addition, as mentioned, a court employing the likelihood standard must ensure that the parties have a meaningful opportunity to present evidence and reasonable access to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, plaintiffs have made out a colorable case for the existence of jurisdiction and sought jurisdictional discovery immediately\n   in response to a jurisdictional challenge.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Orion Seafood Int'l, Inc. v.

Aug. 29, 2012) (finding that plaintiffs were entitled to jurisdictional discovery to determine whether one defendant exercised control over another). Therefore, because there are legitimate questions as to Getinge AB's role in the actions underlying this lawsuit and the relationship between the three defendants, and in light of the court employing the likelihood standard, the court finds that plaintiffs are entitled to jurisdictional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs propose jurisdictional discovery in the form of 106 requests for production of documents, video depositions of a Rule 30(b)(6) designee of Getinge AB, a video deposition of a Rule 30(b)(6) designee of Maquet, a video deposition of Reinhard Mayer, the Chief Financial Officer of Getinge AB, and a video deposition of Steve Herweck. In response, Getinge AB contends that any discovery must be \"limited to exploring whether Atrium and [Maquet] are mere instrumentalities of Getinge AB.\" Plaintiffs and Getinge AB cite cases from a variety of jurisdictions to support or oppose theories of a parent's separation from or lack of separation from its subsidiaries. Both plaintiffs and Getinge AB, however, focus largely on the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. GAF Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV 93-432-M,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20WL%20279752\">\n    1994 WL 279752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.H.

In particular, Getinge AB objects to plaintiffs' requests for production that reference \"any and all\" of Getinge AB's subsidiaries and affiliates when only Atrium and Maquet are at issue here. Getinge AB also objects to the requests for copies of all employee health insurance plans for Getinge AB, Atrium, and Maquet on the ground that those plans do not relate to the\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   factors. In addition, Getinge AB asserts that the requests must be limited to the date of the complaint. Getinge AB also asserts that plaintiffs' discovery requests implicate European Union and Swedish privacy laws and requests \"further briefing on the regulations, restrictions, and consequences imposed by\" those laws. Doc. no. 109 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that the issues of assumption of liabilities, agency, and alter ego are fact-intensive, requiring reasonably broad discovery. With respect to time, plaintiffs contend that because the cases are continuing to be filed in this litigation, their inquiry cannot be limited to the date of the master complaint. Plaintiffs explain that they directed discovery broadly to all of Getinge AB's affiliates and subsidiaries because they anticipate that Getinge AB will dispute which entity acquired Atrium. They also contend that health insurance plan information pertains to whether Getinge AB is intermingling accounts and records with Atrium and Maquet and other alter ego factors. They dismiss the privacy laws raised by Getinge AB as a red herring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs' proposed discovery is broader than necessary to address the jurisdictional issues that have arisen here. For example, plaintiffs have not shown that discovery of documents, communications, and other matters related to any and all subsidiaries and affiliates of Getinge AB is within the scope of the jurisdictional issues raised here. Nor have plaintiffs shown that production of all health insurance plans is necessary to determine which entity paid for health insurance. For that reason, plaintiffs shall not serve the proposed discovery attached to their motion for leave to conduct discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs are granted leave to conduct limited discovery that is focused on the issues necessary to decide whether the court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Getinge AB. Plaintiffs shall revise and narrow their discovery for that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Any objection to plaintiffs' revised discovery shall be addressed and resolved by counsel.

To the extent plaintiffs intended to argue that Getinge AB's failure to challenge personal jurisdiction in other cases operates as a waiver of the defense, that argument is without merit. As Getinge AB points out, consent to jurisdiction in one case does not constitute waiver of a jurisdictional defense in another case.\n    <em>\n     Klinghoffer v. S.N.C.
