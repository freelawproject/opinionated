This matter is before the Court on plaintiff's Motion for Judgment of Reversal and the SSA's Motion for Judgment of Affirmance. For the reasons discussed below, the Court denies the former and grants the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff submitted an application for DIB on January 11, 2013. (A.R. 168-74.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, she was 36 years of age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (A.R. 70.) According to plaintiff, she became disabled on May 3, 2012, (A.R.168), because of the condition of her neck, shoulder, arm, hand and leg, and the resulting pain she experiences, (A.R. 204). SSA denied her application on March 29, 2013. (A.R. 93-96). Plaintiff sought reconsideration of the decision, (A.R. 97), without success, as the SSA found \"that the previous determination ... was proper under the law,\" (A.R. 98). On August 5, 2013, plaintiff requested, (A.R. 107-08), and SSA scheduled, (A.R. 133-37), a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\"). The hearing took place on May 13, 2015. Plaintiff, who then was represented by counsel, testified at the hearing, as did an impartial vocational expert. (A.R. 40-69). The record remained open for 14 days after the hearing in order that plaintiff submit updated treatment records; plaintiff filed none. (A.R. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The ALJ issued his decision on June 25, 2015 that plaintiff is not disabled and, therefore, is not entitled to period of disability or disability insurance benefits. (A.R. 33). On July 5, 2015, plaintiff sought review of the ALJ's decision. (A.R. 14-15). The Appeals Council denied the request on July 16, 2016. (A.R. 1-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B. Medical Records\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to plaintiff, she has \"endured [her] condition since 2005.\" (Mot. for J. of Reversal at 1; A.R. 360). She reported that she has severe pain in her back, neck, right arm and right hand. (A.R. 212). Plaintiff underwent magnetic resonance imaging (\"MRI\") of the right shoulder in May 2012. (A.R. 441). The test revealed \"[m]ild AC joint arthropathy,\" but \"no significant tear of the rotator cuff or labrum,\" (A.R. 441), and was \"[o]therwise [a] negative study.\" (A.R. 441;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R. 260). X-rays of plaintiff's cervical spine in May 2012 showed \"[m]ild degenerative spondylosis and foraminal stenosis.\" (A.R. 440). An MRI of plaintiff's cervical spine in June 2012 showed \"[d]egenerative disk spondylitic change with multilevel neural foraminal encroachment,\" but \"no spinal stenosis or cord compression.\" (A.R. 369;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R. 258).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July and August 2012, plaintiff attended four sessions with a physical therapist. (A.R. 265). Eight sessions had been scheduled, yet plaintiff discharged herself and chose not to return after a fourth visit. (A.R. 264).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff presented to Avery Healthcare Associates, PC, on January 30, 2013, complaining of neck, shoulder and back discomfort, and requested a referral for consultation with an orthopedic specialist. (A.R. 360). On March 13, 2013, Dr. Elliott Aleskow conducted a disability evaluation. (A.R. 306-14). Plaintiff complained of \"pain radiat[ing] to the middle of her back and both shoulders,\" and stated she had not sustained a neck injury at any time. (A.R. 306). She required no assistive device; she could sit and stand 15-30 minutes; she could walk 4-5 blocks; she could travel without difficulty. (A.R. 306). In addition, plaintiff \"was able to walk on heels and toes, squat rise from a squatting position and tandem walk without difficulty.\" (A.R. 307). The strength of her hand grip was normal bilaterally, and she \"was able to do fine-motor skills without significant difficulty.\" (A.R. 307). According to Dr. Aleskow, plaintiff \"had full range of motion of all extremities with the exception of the cervical spine region,\" and aside from this limited range of motion, plaintiff \"appear[ed] to be stable medically\" and without \"any obvious neurological deficit[.]\" (A.R. 307).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff consulted with Dr. Damon Robinson, a pain management specialist, (A.R. 50), on June 7, 2013, complaining of \"continuous, throbbing, aching, shooting and severe\" pain that had begun seven years previously and gradually progressed. (A.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   436). After conducting a physical examination, Dr. Robinson's \"primary diagnosis [was] cervical radiculopathy secondary cervical disc displacement.\" (A.R. 437). Dr. Robinson conducted cervical examinations on July 5, 2013 (A.R. 433-34), July 26, 2013 (A.R. 430-31), September 25, 2013 (A.R. 421-22), October 25, 2013 (A.R. 418-19), November 11, 2013 (A.R. 415-16), November 27, 2013 (A.R. 411-12), May 5, 2014 (A.R. 404-05), September 9, 2014 (A.R. 401), October 7, 2014 (A.R. 397), November 21, 2014 (A.R. 392), and March 17, 2015 (A.R. 371). He reported nearly identical negative results from these examinations. Dr. Robinson conducted lumbar examinations on September 13, 2013 (A.R. 427), March 12, 2014 (A.R. 408-09), November 21, 2014 (A.R. 393), and March 17, 2015 (A.R. 371), and one thoracic examination on November 21, 2014, with negative results. (A.R. 393).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Robinson referred plaintiff to physical therapy on November 27, 2013. (A.R. 321). Plaintiff was considered \"an excellent candidate for physical therapy intervention to decrease the pain in the arm and in the neck, teach proper posture and body mechanics, and overall therapeutic exercises to promote muscle strength and restore over all function.\" (A.R. 324). On February 19, 2014, plaintiff reported that her \"pain condition [was] unchanged,\" (A.R. 342), and significant improvement with her range of motion and strength in her neck and shoulder, (A.R. 344). Her last appointment was February 25, 2014. (A.R. 348).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff had an MRI of her cervical spine on November 7, 2015, (A.R. 10), which revealed \"[m]ultilevel degenerative changes with severe left and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at C4-C5, moderate to severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing at C5-C6, and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing at C6-C7,\" (A.R. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 6, 2016, plaintiff underwent an MRI of her lumbar spine, which revealed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Specific disc disease is as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   L4-L5: There is a mild diffuse disc bulge and a moderate-sized central annular fissure.

There is no significant spinal canal narrowing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The remainder of the vertebral levels are unremarkable with no evidence of significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   IMPRESSION:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Mild diffuse disc bulges and moderate central annular fissures at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with abutment of the descending S2 nerve roots at L5-S1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (A.R. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   C. Plaintiff's Hearing Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff, a single woman, was 39 years of age at the time of her hearing. (A.R. 44). She lived in a house with her children (ages 25, 16 and 15) and visited with and occasionally cared for her grandson (age 4). (A.R. 45). She earned a Bachelor's degree in business administration with a concentration in human resources management. (A.R. 46). Her last paid work was as a recruiter at a nursing home ending in November 2011. (A.R. 46-47). She resigned from that position for non-medical reasons. (A.R. 47).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In prior years, plaintiff\n   held another position as a recruiter, (A.R. 47), performed administrative work and also had been a bank teller and a money transfer representative. (A.R. 48-49;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R. 221-28). Since May 2012, plaintiff had not had paid work, had not applied for any jobs, and had not engaged in any volunteer activities. (A.R. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff testified that she experienced pain in her neck and back, received treatment from Dr. Robinson, a pain management specialist, and experienced significant relief from the pain medication he prescribed. (A.R. 50-51). Without medication, she rated her pain level as between eight and nine on a 10-point scale; with medication, she rated her pain level as three or four. (A.R. 51). Side effects from the medications included drowsiness and blurred vision. (A.R. 52). She has had no surgeries to address her issues, and no surgery ever has been recommended. (A.R. 51-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to plaintiff, she could walk a block or two, stand up for less than one hour, sit down for less than one hour, and lift no more than 10 pounds. (A.R. 52). However, plaintiff occasionally would lift her grandson, who weighed \"maybe 30, 40 pounds.\" (A.R. 52). Plaintiff testified that she bathed herself, dressed herself, cooked, and shopped for groceries, and shared laundry and house cleaning duties with her children. (A.R. 54). She enjoyed baseball, fishing, plays, puzzles, and reading. (A.R. 54-58). Plaintiff had attended four baseball games the previous year and stayed for the entire games. (A.R. 56). She had gone fishing the previous summer and was able to cast a fishing rod. (A.R. 55). Plaintiff also explained that sitting, standing or cooking for longer periods of time was uncomfortable, and that she had difficulty with grocery shopping because lifting and carrying bags could be painful. (A.R. 59-60). When she would do something strenuous, she described the pain in her right arm as \"shooting through [her] elbow and [going] through [her] wrists, through [her] fingers,\" and her \"fingers get numb.\" (A.R. 62). Plaintiff also testified that she experiences pain in her right leg, her neck and her back, and her worst pain is in her neck and shoulders. (A.R. 63). She did not have any issues reaching overhead, however. (A.R. 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   D. Residual Functional Capacity Assessments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dr. Esther Pinder, a State agency medical consultant, reviewed plaintiff's records and determined that plaintiff has a medically determinable severe impairment in the category Spine Disorders. (A.R. 73). However, in Dr. Pinder's view, \"[t]he totality of medical evidence [did] not warrant a disabling impairment.\" (A.R. 74). Plaintiff could lift and/or carry 10 pounds frequently, stand and/or walk six hours in an eight-hour work day, and sit for six hours in an eight-hour work day. (A.R. 74). In addition, plaintiff could climb stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch and crawl, and she had no manipulative, visual, communicative, or environmental limitations. (A.R. 75). However, because of plaintiff's reduced range of motion, she should avoid ladders, ropes or scaffolds. (A.R. 75). And although plaintiff's conditions impose \"some limitations in [her] ability to perform work related activities,\" Dr. Pinder concluded that \"these limitations do not prevent [plaintiff] from performing work [she has] done in the past as a/an HR Assistant.\" (A.R. 77). Dr. Veronica Bedeau conducted an independent review of plaintiff's record and agreed with Dr. Pinder's conclusion. (A.R. 79-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   E. Vocational Expert's Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ted D. Mitchell, a certified vocational evaluation specialist, (A.R. 64), classified plaintiff's past work experience as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [T]he claimant's past work experience as a personnel recruiter. It has a DOT code\n   of 166.267-038. It has an exertional level of sedentary, and SVP of 7, which is a skilled position. She has experience as an administrative clerk. It has a DOT code of 219.368-010. It has an exertional level of light, and SVP 4, so it's semi-skilled. She has experience as a teller. It has a DOT code of 211.362-018. It has an exertional level of light, and a SVP of 5, so it's a skilled position. And she also has experience as a foreign bank code teller. It has a DOT code of 211.362-014. It has an exertional level of sedentary. It has a SVP of 5, so it's a skilled position[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (A.R. 65). The ALJ asked Dr. Mitchell if a hypothetical individual of plaintiff's age, with her education, work history, and physical limitations, could perform any of plaintiff's past work. (A.R. 65-66). Dr. Mitchell responded that this hypothetical individual \"would be able to perform the job of personnel recruiter, and foreign banknote teller.\" (A.R. 66). In addition, Dr. Mitchell testified, this hypothetical individual would be able to perform the jobs of addressor, call out operator, and surveillance system monitor. (A.R. 66). These jobs are classified as sedentary and unskilled. (A.R. 66). According to Dr. Mitchell, there were approximately 8,133 full time addressor employees, 8,089 full time call out operators, and 4,564 full time surveillance system employees in the nation. (A.R. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Judicial review in Social Security disability cases is limited to determining whether SSA's findings are supported by substantial evidence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

He deemed her \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of [her] symptoms ... not entirely credible.\" (A.R. 27). Plaintiff maintained full strength in her upper extremities (A.R. 30), and physical therapy not only improved range of motion in her neck and shoulder, but also provided some relief from her neck pain.

Further, \"[i]n comparing [plaintiff's] residual functional capacity with the physical and mental demands of this work,\" the ALJ found that plaintiff \"is able to perform it as generally performed.\" (A.R. 31).

He then made \"alternative findings for step five of the sequential evaluation process,\" taking into consideration plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, and consulting to the Medical-Vocational Guidelines,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2. Ordinarily, if a\n   claimant \"had the residual functional capacity to perform the full range of sedentary work, a finding of 'not disabled' would be directed by Medical-Vocational Rules 201.28 and 202.21[.]\" (A.R. 32). This plaintiff's \"ability to perform all or substantially of the requirements of [sedentary] work has been impeded by additional limitations,\" however. (A.R. 32). Based on the vocational expert's testimony, the ALJ determined that \"an individual with [plaintiff's] age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity ... would be able to perform the requirements of [three] representative occupations: addresser ..., call out operator ..., and surveillance system monitor,\" all sedentary, unskilled jobs available in the national economy. (A.R. 32). Accordingly, the ALJ concluded, plaintiff \"is capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy,\" such that \"[a] finding of 'not disabled' is therefore appropriate[.]\" (A.R. 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff deems SSA's decision \"unfair\" because she purports to \"have a chronic neck and back condition (bulging discs and degenerative discs) that does not allow [her] to live\" as she once did \"prior to [her] condition getting worse in 2012.\" (Compl. at 2 (page number designated by ECF) ). She claims she cannot engage in activities such as household chores, sitting, standing or walking because they not only \"increase[her] pain significantly,\" but also \"prohibit[ ] [her] from working a full time job[.]\" (Mot. for J. of Reversal at 2 (page number designated by ECF) ). Her challenge to the ALJ's Decision boils down to her own assessment of her condition, its purported date of onset, and its supposed effects on daily living and ability to work. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 2; Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for J. of Affirmance &amp; Mot. for J. of Reversal at 8-9). She refers to additional medical information she submitted in 2016, (Compl. at 2; Mot. for J. of Reversal at 2 (page number designated by ECF) ), but these documents are not relevant. This Court's review is limited to the record before the ALJ, and these documents pertain to examinations conducted in April 2016 and November 2015, (A.R. 8-11), months after the ALJ issued his Decision on June 25, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court concurs with the ALJ's determination. It remains plaintiff's burden to demonstrate disability, and nothing in her complaint, motion for judgment of reversal or opposition to SSA's motion for judgment of affirmance undermines the ALJ's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Having reviewed the administrative record, the parties' cross-motions and oppositions thereto, the Court concludes that SSA's decision is supported by substantial evidence.
