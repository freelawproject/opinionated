(Docket No. 31 (\"Williams Decl.\"), at \u00b6 4). In September 2002, Williams was hired by the DHMH as a Public Health Nurse Level II in the Bureau of Tuberculosis Control. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). The Bureau of Tuberculosis Control maintains four health centers: the Fort Greene Chest Center, the Washington Heights Chest Center, the Corona Chest Center, and the Morrisania Chest Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). In 2003, Williams assumed the responsibilities of Patient Care Manager, and in 2004, she was assigned the title of Public Health Nurse Level III. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7). Williams was assigned to work primarily at the Fort Greene Chest Center, but she occasionally worked at the Washington Heights Chest Center as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In or about May 2013, Williams was diagnosed with herniated lumbar discs, arthritis of the spine and knees, and sciatica; she also suffered from gout and diabetic neuropathy, chronic conditions that she had previously developed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Williams Decl., Ex. 2 (\"2015 Tambor Letter\") ). As a result of these challenges, Williams's doctor, Jeffry Tambor, opined that she was \"unable to stand longer than 2-3 minutes and ... to walk greater than 80 feet without stopping.\" (2015 Tambor Letter). In the fall of 2013, Williams informed her supervisor, Errol Robinson, that she had a medical condition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 32 (\"Sackowitz Decl.\"), Ex. 1 (\"Robinson Depo.\"), at 27). According to Williams, her initial treatment plan was ineffective, and her pain management doctor recommended that she undergo surgery. (Williams Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 39 (\"Murrell Decl.\"), Ex. E, at 3-32). Prior to the surgery, Williams was granted leave from the date of her surgery (January 15, 2015), until her expected return date (June 2, 2015). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Murrell Decl., Ex. G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 19, 2014, before Williams began her medical leave, one of the laboratory associates she supervised at the Fort Greene Chest Center-Sofiya Mazuryan-filed a charge of discrimination against the DHMH with the EEOC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Williams Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Sackowitz Decl., Ex. 5 (\"Mazuryan Charge\") ). Significantly, Mazuryan specifically-and exclusively-complained about Williams, claiming that she had treated Mazuryan \"less favorably than the other non-white employees she supervise[d].\" (Mazuryan Charge). On December 8, 2014, the EEOC issued its final determination, concluding that Mazuryan was, in fact, \"treated less favorabl[y] than non-white employees and subjected to retaliation after she complained of discrimination.\" (Murrell Decl., Ex. N (\"EEOC Proceedings\"), at 59-60). To resolve the charge, the EEOC recommended, among other remedies, that the DHMH \"transfer Ms. Carrie Williams from the Fort Greene location\" so that Mazuryan would \"no longer be under the direct or indirect supervision of Ms. Williams.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 5, 2015, apparently unaware \"that the [DHMH] had decided to transfer [her],\" (Williams Decl. \u00b6 47), Williams submitted a \"Request for Reasonable Accommodation\" to her supervisor (Williams Decl., Ex. 1 (\"First RFRA\") ). According to Williams, she \"feared that while [she] was out on medical leave the [DHMH] might transfer [her] to the Corona and Morrisania locations.\" (Williams Decl. \u00b6 47). Citing her herniated discs, arthritis, sciatica, gout, and diabetic neuropathy, Williams requested that she remain primarily at the Fort Greene Chest Center and that she be assigned a parking space. (First RFRA). Two days later, one of Williams's supervisors informed her that she was to be reassigned from the Fort Greene Chest Center to the Corona and Morrisania centers. (Williams Decl., Ex. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2015, while Williams was still out on leave, she filed a second Request for Reasonable Accommodation, advising the DHMH that she was ready to return to work on April 13, 2015, and seeking again to remain at the Fort Greene Chest Center. (Williams Decl., Ex. 7 (\"Second RFRA\") ). She noted that \"[d]riving a car longer than one hour causes back and leg pain\" and that transfer to the Morrisania or Corona offices would be infeasible because the commute between her home on Staten Island and either site would exceed two hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Shortly thereafter, Williams informed the DHMH that her medical leave would be extended to June 1, 2015. (Sackowitz Decl., Ex. 9, at 1). In light of that extension, the DHMH advised Williams that her Request for Reasonable Accommodation was \"moot\" and that if she needed an accommodation \"on or about June 2, 2015,\" she should submit a new request at a later date. (Williams Decl., Ex. 9 (\"April 14 E-mail\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 1, 2015, Williams submitted her third Request for Reasonable Accommodation, seeking the same relief that she had sought in her prior two requests. (Williams Decl., Ex. 11 (\"Third RFRA\") ). In her third request, Williams reported that she could neither drive a car longer than an hour nor take public transportation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Williams also advised that she was able to return to work sooner than expected-on May 11, 2015-so long as she was not required to report to the Corona or Morrisania clinics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Errol Robinson, her supervisor, responded by informing Williams that she should report to the Corona Chest Center on May 11, 2015. (Williams Decl., Ex. 14). A week later, when Williams had still not reported to the Corona location, Jewel Jones, the DHMH's EEO Investigator, e-mailed Williams requesting her attendance at a meeting the following day to discuss Williams's accommodations. (Williams Decl., Ex. 15). Williams contacted her union representative, Judith Arroyo, who was unable to make the meeting on such short notice. (Williams Decl., Ex. 16). The meeting did not take place. (Williams Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 85-86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 29, 2015, Williams e-mailed Jones, reminding the latter that she was able to return to work. (Williams Decl., Ex. 16). Having not heard back from Jones by June 2, 2015-the day Williams was to return to work-Williams initiated a complaint of discrimination with the EEOC. (Williams Decl., Ex. 20). On June 5, 2015, James Hallman, the DHMH's Chief Diversity and EEO Officer, e-mailed Williams and scheduled a meeting for June 12, 2015. (Williams Decl., Ex. 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Williams Decl. \u00b6 93). At that meeting, attended by several DHMH supervisors, the DHMH offered Williams a proposed accommodation: Williams could become a \"Nurse Coordinator\" at the \"Gotham Center,\" a Long Island City facility. (Williams Decl., Ex. 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Williams Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-94). Williams rejected the proposal in an e-mail four days after the meeting, stating that commuting to the Gotham Center would require her \"to drive more than one hour\" and that the job responsibilities of Nurse Coordinator would require her to visit all four tuberculosis clinics. (Williams Decl., Ex. 22 (\"June 16, 2015 E-mail\") ). In response, the DHMH argued that transit from Staten Island to the Gotham Center would take less than an hour and that visits from the Gotham Center to other facilities would not be required \"every day or every week.\" (Williams Decl., Ex. 25 (\"June 23, 2015 E-mail\") ). Jones also advised Williams that she could use public transportation or the Access-A-Ride service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On June 25, 2015, Williams responded by e-mail, confirming that she would not accept the Nurse Coordinator role and disputing the DHMH's transportation calculations. (Williams Decl., Ex. 30 (\"June 25, 2015 E-mail\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In that same e-mail, Williams also disclosed to Jones that she had filed a charge with the EEOC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jones responded by seeking further information about the charge, eventually telling Williams that the DHMH would close the request-for-reasonable-accommodations (or \"RFRA\") process if she did not provide information about her EEOC complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Williams Decl., Ex. 33 (\"July 16, 2015 E-mail\") ). Williams did not provide the information, and, on July 20, 2015, the DHMH closed Williams's matter because of her \"failure to participate in the reasonable accommodation interactive process.\" (Williams Decl., Ex. 35 (\"July 20, 2015 E-mail\") ). Further, by letter dated July 28, 2015, the DHMH informed Williams that she had been referred for disciplinary charges because of her failure to return to work on July 14, 2015 (the date to which Williams's leave of absence had been extended) and because she had \"failed to follow up\" on her request for reasonable accommodation. (Williams Decl., Ex. 36;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087567\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/41/#p45\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 23). Several months later, on February 23, 2016, the DHMH sent Williams a Notice and Statement of Charges, charging her with being absent from her work location. (Williams Decl., Ex. 37 (\"Notice and Statement of Charges\") ). Williams resigned from the DHMH on March 7, 2016. (Williams Decl. \u00b6 178).

In all three of her RFRAs, Williams made the same demand: that she be reassigned back to the Fort Greene facility from the Morrisania and Corona clinics. But it is undisputed that DHMH reassigned Williams from that facility in order to separate her from Mazuryan after the EEOC found that Williams had discriminated against Mazuryan on the basis of her race. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EEOC Proceedings 65-66). Contrary to Williams's argument, it is immaterial that the DHMH disputed the EEOC's finding that Williams discriminated against Mazuryan \"on the basis of her race, national origin and participation in a protected activity.\" (Docket No. 46 (\"Pl.'s Reply Mem.\"), at 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   EEOC Proceedings 65). The fact that the EEOC's recommended remedy \"was not binding\" on the DHMH is similarly irrelevant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The undisputed fact is that there was a serious \"personality conflict between [Mazuryan] and Ms. Williams\" that was \"exacerbated by Ms. William[s'] seemingly unpleasant managerial style.\" (EEOC Proceedings 65). And separating Williams and Mazuryan at the Fort Greene Chest Center \"was not feasible,\" as it was a small facility. (Def.'s Mem. 15). Given those undisputed facts, Williams's proposed accommodation was not reasonable as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

For example, Williams takes issue with the DHMH's \"refusal to substantively communicate with Plaintiff about either her first or second RFRA.\" (Pl.'s Mem. 16).

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 109-16). Retaliation claims under the ADA are also subject to the burden-shifting framework of\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paxton v.

As an initial matter, Williams identifies two allegedly adverse employment actions: the DHMH's \"refusal to provide [her] with a reasonable accommodation\" and \"her effective termination.\" (Pl.'s Mem. 21). The second, however, can be traced back to the first, as Williams resigned rather than face disciplinary charges for her undisputed absenteeism, (Williams Decl. \u00b6 180), and she stopped going to work because the DHMH had denied her Third RFRA, (Williams Decl. \u00b6 172). Thus, Williams's claims turn on whether she can prove that the DHMH denied her Third RFRA in retaliation for her filing an EEOC complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even assuming that Williams has met her\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   burden, the DHMH has proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying her Third RFRA: her failure to participate in the reasonable accommodation process, as manifested in her refusal to provide basic information about her EEOC filing to Jones. Under New York City's \"Equal Employment Opportunity Policy,\" when an agency is made aware of a complaint filed with the EEOC, the agency EEO Officer is supposed to transfer the matter to the agency General Counsel. (Sackowitz Decl., Ex. 16 (\"EEO Policy\"), at 11). As the DHMH explained, the purpose of the policy is to permit the agency General Counsel to determine which entity-the agency itself or the law department-should respond to the EEOC action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Murrell Decl., Ex. I, at 71;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 22 (explaining that the policy enables the DHMH \"to defend itself more efficiently and effectively by localizing all decision-making regarding the [DHMH]'s defense against plaintiff's EEOC Charge as well as the resolution of her [RFRA] in the General Counsel's office\") ). In furtherance of that policy, the DHMH requested that Williams provide the date on which she had filed her charge. Williams-inexplicably-refused to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The failure to comply with the DHMH's minimal request and, thus, to participate in the reasonable accommodation process is a legitimate and non-retaliatory reason for closing Williams' Third RFRA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tillery v. N.Y. State Office of Alcoholism &amp; Substance Abuse Servs.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CV-1528 (LEK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202870502\">\n    2017 WL 2870502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (N.D.N.Y. July 5, 2017) (holding that the defendant's justification for its adverse action against the plaintiff-that it was \"more efficient\"-was legitimate and non-retaliatory). The burden thus shifts to Williams to demonstrate that the proffered justification was \"merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    Treglia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9317629\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/713/#p719\">\n    313 F.3d at 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence falls well short of that standard. Indeed, Williams does not identify any evidence (and the Court does not discern any evidence) even suggesting pretext. On top of that, for the reasons discussed above, the record is also clear that Williams's sole proposed accommodation was unreasonable as a matter of law. As a result, the DHMH denied Williams's Third RFRA and, after she had failed to return to work for months, initiated a disciplinary proceeding against her. Accordingly, summary judgment is also granted to the DHMH on Williams's retaliation claims under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
