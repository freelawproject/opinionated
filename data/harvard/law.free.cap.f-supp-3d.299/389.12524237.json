Compl. \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. A (the Fax) to Am. Compl. [Doc. # 39-1].) That fax states, \"Learn about AT &amp; T's new Mobile Share Value Plan!\" and \"For a limited time, switch from T-Mobile and receive up to $450 when you trade in your current smartphone!\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex.

It further states, \"All products and services are manufactured and/or provided by AT &amp; T and not Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (\"Wyndham\") or its affiliates,\" and \"Neither [Wyndham] nor its affiliates are responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any statements made in this advertisement, the content of this advertisement (including the text, representations and illustrations) or any material on a website to which the advertisement provides a link or a reference.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant \"did not obtain Plaintiff's 'prior express invitation or permission' before sending Exhibit A.\" (Am.

The \"goods or services\" advertised in Exhibit A are AT &amp; T's, and AT &amp; T \"receive[s] some or all of the revenues\" from the sale of those goods or services.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff asserts a single cause of action claiming that AT &amp; T sent unsolicited fax advertisements to Plaintiff and a class of other persons. As part of that claim, it argues that even if AT &amp; T claims to have sent its faxes pursuant to an EBR or with the recipients' \"prior express invitation or permission,\" the failure of Defendant to comply with the opt-out notice requirements set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(iii) &amp; (iv) constitutes the transmission of an unsolicited advertisement. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim must be dismissed because it fails to sufficiently allege Plaintiff never gave permission to receive the fax. Defendant further contends that because the faxes were actually solicited, no opt-out notice is required and that, to the extent Plaintiff relies only upon the insufficient opt-out notice to support its claim, it has not alleged a concrete and particularized injury and therefore lacks standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff Alleged the Fax was Unsolicited Under the TCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Junk Fax Provisions of the TCPA make it unlawful for \"any person within the United States, or any person outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States ... to use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an\n   <em>\n    unsolicited\n   </em>\n   advertisement[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(c) (emphasis added). The TCPA defines unsolicited advertisement to mean \"any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services which is transmitted to any person\n   <em>\n    without that person's prior express invitation or permission, in writing or otherwise\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) (emphasis added). Thus, in order for Plaintiff to make out a valid TCPA claim, the fax at issue must have been sent without its prior express permission, i.e. consent.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cochran v. Massey\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:12-CV-765 DRH DGW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20335288\">\n    2014 WL 335288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.

Here, Plaintiff alleges the fax was sent on behalf of Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the fax sender may be defined as the person or entity \"whose goods or services are advertised or promoted in the unsolicited advertisement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These regulations and the case law interpreting them make clear that the question is not who physically sent the fax, but which party benefitted from it being sent.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Imhoff Inv., L.L.C. v.

Thus, these cases do not provide guidance for the circumstances alleged in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on the language of the regulations and subsequent case law, Defendant's argument-that Plaintiff's cause of action must fail because it did not allege it never gave Wyndham permission to send the fax-has no merit. Defendant concedes Plaintiff's Complaint alleges it never gave Defendant permission to send the fax. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss [Doc. # 40-1] at 5.) Defendant also concedes that it qualifies as a \"sender,\" for its product was advertised in the fax. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Plaintiff has properly alleged that the fax, whose \"sender\" was Defendant pursuant to the regulations, was unsolicited. Insofar as Defendant claims that the fax was solicited because of the relationship between Wyndham and Plaintiff, as Judge Bolden recently found, \"[t]he issue of whether the faxes were solicited ... is better determined at a later stage of this case.\" Ruling and Order on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [Doc. # 46] at 6,\n   <em>\n    Gorss Motels, Inc. v.

On this theory, Plaintiff has alleged only \"purely technical\" procedural harms related to the opt-out notice and has not alleged any specific harm suffered as a result of the deficiency. Because the Court has determined that Plaintiff adequately pled the fax was sent without prior express permission, and because this claim is not dependent upon its allegations that the opt-out notice did not comply with the regulations, Plaintiff has standing.
