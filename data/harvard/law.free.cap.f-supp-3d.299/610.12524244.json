Denis' allegations mirror what many plaintiffs before him have charged: that Medco defrauded the government by favoring certain drugs in exchange for kickbacks from AstraZeneca disguised as discounts, and Medco failed to share these discounts with its clients as required. (D.I. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5). The court previously dismissed Denis' Third Amended Complaint under two separate provisions of the False Claims Act: the first-to-file rule and the public disclosure bar.\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel Denis v.

Del. Jan. 5, 2017). Now pending before the court is Medco's motion to dismiss Denis' Fourth Amended Complaint. (D.I. 114). Medco raises several arguments, including the first-to-file rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5), the public disclosure bar,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4), and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b). (D.I. 115). Because the court finds that dismissal is warranted under the public disclosure bar, it does not reach Medco's other arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 111-3). The new content is essentially (i) speculation that the same conduct continued after Denis left his employment with Medco in 2008, (ii) ancillary details about events already alleged, or (iii) legal argument. Accordingly, the court refers the reader to its previous memorandum opinion\n   for a general factual background and will discuss any new allegations where relevant below.\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n    2017 WL 63006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 111-13).

When a relator alleges a continuing fraud that spans the time before and after the amendments, several courts in the Third Circuit have applied the pre-2010 version of the statute to pre-2010 conduct and the post-2010 statute to post-2010 conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

May 30, 2014). For reasons explained below, the court questions this approach, but will nevertheless follow it. Accordingly, the court will first describe the changes to the public disclosure bar and why it questions the bifurcated approach to a continuing fraud\n   claim. Then the court will apply both versions of the public disclosure bar to Denis' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Amendments to the Public Disclosure Bar\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2010, Congress amended the public disclosure bar. Under the pre-2010 statute, the public disclosure bar deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction if: (1) the public disclosures appear in certain enumerated sources; (2) the publicly disclosed information constitutes allegations or transactions of fraud; (3) the relator's complaint is \"based upon\" the public disclosures; and (4) the relator is not an \"original source.\"\n   <em>\n    Zizic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698218,6052871\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/228/\">\n    728 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   235 &amp; 239 ;\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Shipbuilding Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2540543\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/506/#p519\">\n    473 F.3d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (3d Cir. 2007) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2006). This version of the statute defines \"original source\" as \"an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B) (2006). In contrast, the post-2010 statute provides that the court must \"dismiss an action or claim\" if: (1) the public disclosures appear in certain enumerated sources; (2) the publicly disclosed information contains \"substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim\"; and (3) the relator is not an \"original source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2010). The amended statute defines \"original source\" as an individual who has voluntarily disclosed information to the government or one \"who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to\" information already publicly disclosed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B) (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Some of the changes to the public disclosure bar are significant. First, the pre-2010 statute requires application of the Rule 12(b)(1) standard for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, whereas the post-2010 statute requires application of the Rule 12(b)(6) standard for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n    812 F.3d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, no presumption of truthfulness attaches to pre-2010 allegations, but post-2010 allegations receive the benefit of every reasonable inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067928\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/458/#p464\">\n    724 F.3d 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464 (3d Cir. 2013). Second, the amended statute limits the sources that qualify as public disclosures by, among other things, changing \"civil hearings\" to \"federal civil hearings in which the government or its agent is a party.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2006) to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A)(i) (2010) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Mar. 31, 2016) (describing changes in enumerated sources). Third, the amended statute expands the definition of \"original source\" by removing the words \"direct knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Freedom Unlimited\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201255294\">\n    2016 WL 1255294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13. Direct knowledge is knowledge based on first-hand information.\n   <em>\n    Zizic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698218,6052871\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/228/\">\n    728 F.3d at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Previous cases have held that a relator does not have direct knowledge when the knowledge is gained from reviewing documents and discussing them with colleagues who participated in the underlying events.\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Schumann v. AstraZeneca Pharm. L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265414\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/837/#p848\">\n    769 F.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848 (3d Cir. 2014). The removal of the words \"direct knowledge\" suggests that a relator may now qualify as an original source even though he or she does not have first-hand information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the previous motion to dismiss, the court applied the pre-2010 public disclosure bar, because Denis failed to allege any specific facts of post-2010 conduct.\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n    2017 WL 63006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Instead, the Third Amended Complaint made the speculative assertion that the same fraudulent scheme from before 2010 continued past 2010.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When asked to identify specific allegations in the Third Amended Complaint of post-2010 conduct, Denis pointed\n   to a conversation he had with Regina Dennis, a Vice President at Medco.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found those allegations insufficient, however, because no specific time was alleged and none could be reasonably inferred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Fourth Amended Complaint confirms that the conversation occurred before 2010, not after. (D.I. 111 \u00b6 145). Like the Third Amended Complaint, the Fourth Amended Complaint alleges that any post-2010 conduct is a continuation of a pre-2010 fraudulent scheme. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 168 (\"This scheme began in 2005, continued in 2007 when the agreements were renewed through 2009, and was still continuing with Express Scripts until at least 2013.\"). The only specific allegation of post-2010 conduct is that Medco renewed its contract with Astra Zeneca in 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111 (\"The original AZ contract signed in 2005 expired in 2007, that contract was renewed in 2007, 2009, 2010, and again in 2011....\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When the complaint alleges a continuing fraud that spans the time period before and after the 2010 amendment, several courts in the Third Circuit have established a rule that \"the court applies the pre-amendment version ... to conduct occurring prior to the amendment's enactment and the post-amendment version to conduct occurring after the amendment took effect.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel LaPorte v.

By contrast, some courts in other circuits have applied the pre-2010 version of the public disclosure bar to the entire continuing fraud claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cause of Action v.

In\n   <em>\n    Cause of Action\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit recognized the general rule that courts apply the version of the public disclosure bar in force when the underlying events took place, but thought it was not \"necessary or appropriate\" to characterize a fraud continuing from 2009 to 2010 \"as discrete events.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146807\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/267/\">\n    815 F.3d 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271 n. 14. In\n   <em>\n    Bridgepoint\n   </em>\n   , the court applied the pre-2010 bar to a scheme that spanned both versions of the public disclosure bar, because \"the majority of the most important aspects of the fraudulent conduct\" occurred before the amendments became effective, i.e., defendants executed a multi-year agreement and the public disclosures were issued before 2010.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204892259\">\n    2015 WL 4892259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. From this court's perspective, the better approach would be to apply the pre-2010 public disclosure bar to the entire continuing fraud claim, because that was the statute in effect at the time the claim accrued, and the statute is not retroactive. Nevertheless, the court will follow the approach previously affirmed by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Judd.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(D.I. 111-3). Any new details elaborating on that scheme do not overcome the conclusion that it is substantially similar to the public disclosures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the previous motion to dismiss, the court also found that Denis was not an original source, because he lacked direct knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n    2017 WL 63006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. As the court explained, the Third Amended Complaint did not allege that Denis participated in the administration or negotiation of any contracts between Medco and AstraZeneca.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, all of his knowledge was gleaned from reviewing documents and having conversations with colleagues who participated in the underlying events.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Contrary to Denis' assertions, this does not result in a rule that \"only instigators can qualify as original sources.\" (D.I. 116 at 13). Innocent bystanders are often first-hand witnesses to bad acts. Admittedly, the direct knowledge requirement restricts the number of individuals that qualify as an original source. But perhaps that is the reason why Congress removed the direct knowledge requirement from the amended statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Denis cites a collection of allegations from the Fourth Amended Complaint purportedly demonstrating he is an original source with direct knowledge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   D.I. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 108-09, 113, 121, 123-24, 126, 129, 132, 139-40, 142-45, 148-56, 158, 160-67, 176-81, 193-96)). But these allegations are insufficient for one of four reasons. First, they are unchanged from the previous complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 111-3 \u00b6\u00b6 129, 132, 139-40). They are, therefore, insufficient for the same reasons given on the previous motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n    2017 WL 63006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9. Second, the allegations elaborate on a fraudulent scheme proposed to Merck or another drug company, which does not demonstrate first-hand knowledge of a fraudulent scheme related to Astra Zeneca.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 148-54;\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n    2017 WL 63006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 n. 9 ;\n   <em>\n    Judd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=638%20Fed.%20Appx.%20162\">\n    638 Fed.Appx. at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (being an original source with respect to one health care provider does not necessarily establish that the relator is an original source with respect to a different health care provider). Third, the allegations show that Denis received his knowledge second-hand through reviewing documents or being told information. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 126, 193-94). This is not direct knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2063006\">\n    2017 WL 63006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Finally, the allegations assert facts without a basis from which the court can reasonably infer that it is coming from Denis' first-hand knowledge. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 108-09, 113). In other words, the complaint does not allege that Denis saw or heard the information first-hand. For these reasons, Denis has not demonstrated that he qualifies as an original source under the pre-2010 disclosure bar. Accordingly, Denis' pre-2010 claim is dismissed with prejudice for lack of subject matter\n   jurisdiction pursuant to the pre-2010 public disclosure bar.\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Atkinson v. PA. Shipbuilding Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2540543\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/506/#p519\">\n    473 F.3d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (3d Cir. 2007) (explaining that repleading is futile after dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because \"the legal inadequacy cannot be solved by providing a better factual account of the alleged claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Post-2010 Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The issue under the post-2010 public disclosure bar is whether Denis qualifies as an original source once the direct knowledge requirement has been removed. The post-2010 public disclosure bar provides that the court must \"dismiss an action or claim\" if: (1) the public disclosures appear in certain enumerated sources; (2) the publicly disclosed information contains \"substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim\"; and (3) the relator is not an \"original source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2010). The first two elements of the post-2010 public disclosure bar are not in dispute. The court determined on the previous motion to dismiss that \"the relevant allegations are essentially redundant of the claims in\n   <em>\n    Schumann\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hunt.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 109 at 3 n. 1).\n   <em>\n    Schumann\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   are federal cases in which the government was a party and, therefore, qualify as public disclosures under the amended statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A)(i) (2010). Because \"based upon\" in the pre-2010 statute means \"supported by\" or \"substantially similar\" to the public disclosures, this element is essentially unchanged after the amendments. As a result, the court's analysis above finding that Denis' complaint is \"based upon\" the public disclosures is applicable to the post-2010 claim. This leaves for dispute whether Denis is an original source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the post-2010 public disclosure bar, a relator is an original source if the relator has \"knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to\" information already publicly disclosed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B). \"[A] relator materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegation or transaction of fraud when [he] contributes information-distinct from what was publicly disclosed-that adds in a significant way to the essential factual background: the who, what, when, where and how of the events at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n    812 F.3d at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the court bifurcated Denis' claim, the post-2010 original source standard applies only to conduct that occurred after March 23, 2010. The only post-2010 conduct alleged in the complaint is that Medco renewed the agreements with Astra Zeneca in 2011, and those agreements remained in effect until 2013. (D.I. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 111, 166). These allegations do not add anything significant to the \"who, what, when, where and how\" of the fraudulent scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=638%20Fed.%20Appx.%20162\">\n    638 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   168 n. 7 (finding that relator did not materially add to the prior disclosures by alleging that the fraud continued into a new time frame). Accordingly, Denis does not qualify as an original source, and his post-2010 claim does not overcome the post-2010 public disclosure bar. The court grants Medco's motion to dismiss the post-2010 claim for failure to state a claim. Dismissal is with prejudice, because it would be futile for Denis to file a fifth amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gasoline Sales, Inc. v.

(D.I. 116 at 7). This argument does not raise a distinction that overcomes the substantial similarity requirement in the public disclosure bar. It is unlikely the government would be thrown off the trail of fraud by the nuanced differences between the terms \"purchase discounts\" and \"Purchase Discounts.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     Schumann\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hunt\n    </em>\n    refer respectively to\n    <em>\n     U.S. ex rel.
