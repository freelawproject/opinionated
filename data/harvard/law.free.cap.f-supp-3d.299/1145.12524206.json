INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Chris Bunger brings this action against Defendant Unum Life Insurance Company of America (Unum) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   He seeks to recover benefits under the Costco Employee Benefits Program's-Voluntary Short Term Disability Plan (STD Plan) and the Costco Employee Benefits Program's-Long Term Disability Plan (LTD Plan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court previously denied the parties' cross motions for judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52, issuing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in an Order dated July 20, 2016. Dkt. 24. As described in that Order, Mr. Bunger became ill in early 2014, while working as a Web Content Specialist for Costco Wholesale Corporation. After providing STD benefits for periods of time between January and August 29, 2014, Unum found plaintiff no longer eligible for STD benefits and denied LTD benefits. Mr. Bunger filed suit, alleging total disability due to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), Lyme disease, or an unspecified illness causing fatigue and inability to concentrate. Unum argued plaintiff has no properly diagnosed conditions and has not shown his inability to perform his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court concluded Unum failed to sufficiently develop the record. Unum had denied benefits because (1) it was unlikely Mr. Bunger has Lyme disease ; (2) Mr. Bunger was not properly diagnosed with CFS because other potential causes of symptoms had not been ruled out, with no re-test for Lyme disease or referrals to an infectious disease specialist, neurologist, or behavioral health specialist; and (3) Mr. Bunger had not undergone cognitive testing. However, these arguments only showed a need for more information, which Unum had not requested or even suggested. Unum appeared to conflate the issue of whether Mr. Bunger is sick with the issue of whether he has been properly diagnosed. Even if not correctly diagnosed, it did not mean Mr. Bunger was not sick, and Unum should have informed Mr. Bunger of the need for further testing, diagnosis, or treatment. The Court remanded with instructions to Unum to inform Mr. Bunger of the additional testing or diagnostics required to make an informed decision as to whether he is able to perform his job functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On remand, Unum again denied Mr. Bunger benefits. Mr. Bunger filed an unopposed motion to reopen the action. This matter now comes before the Court on the parties' second cross motions for judgment under Rule 52. Mr. Bunger seeks a judgment declaring he meets his burden of showing disability under the STD plan from August 30 to October 4, 2014, disability from his \"own job\" under the LTD plan from October 5, 2014 to July 5, 2015, and disability from \"any gainful occupation\" under the LTD plan from July 6, 2015 through the present. Dkt. 47. Unum asks that the Court affirm its benefits decision and grant judgment in its favor. Dkt. 53. Unum also argues that, if the Court finds Mr. Bunger meets his burden of proving his inability to perform his own job at Costco for the first nine months of LTD benefits, the Court should remand to Unum the question of whether Mr. Bunger was disabled under the more stringent any gainful occupation standard after that point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As before, the Court conducts a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   trial of this matter under Rule 52 based on the administrative record considered by Unum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 24 at 2-3. The administrative record now before the Court is comprised of (1) Unum's file for plaintiff's claim for STD benefits (STD 1-447), Dkt. 12; (2) Unum's file for plaintiff's claim for LTD benefits (LTD 1-513), Dkt. 12; and (3) Unum's expanded claim file ( AR 1 -992), Dkt. 48.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also asks that the Court consider a new declaration not included in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 51. The Court now issues the following findings and conclusions pursuant to Rule 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1. The Court incorporates its prior findings of fact as set forth in its July 20, 2016 Order. Dkt. 24. With exceptions to allow for a complete understanding of the issues, the Court does not re-state those facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2. Chris Bunger's job as a Web Content Specialist for Costco Wholesale Corporation required \"[e]xcellent written and verbal communication skills, ... [s]trong organizational and analytical skills, and attention to detail[,]\" as well as the ability to multi-task and perform a variety of complex tasks. LTD 368, 370. Through his employment with Costco, Mr. Bunger was offered STD and LTD benefits in plans administered by Unum Life Insurance Company of America. STD 378; LTD 450.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   3. Unum's STD Plan provides for 26 weeks of benefits, awarded if an employee is \"limited from performing the material and substantial duties of [his] own job ... due to ... sickness or injury; and [he] ha[s] a 20% or more loss in weekly earnings.\" STD 367, 371.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   4. Unum's LTD Plan provides for benefits beyond the 26-week window. LTD 434. For the first nine months of LTD coverage, \"disabled\" is defined in the same way for LTD benefits as it is for STD benefits. LTD 428. After nine months, an employee must show he is disabled from \"any gainful occupation\" as opposed to just his \"own job.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   5. Both the STD and LTD plans define \"sickness\" as \"an illness or disease,\" and require a showing the claimant is \"under the regular care of a physician.\" STD 358, 377; AR 420, 450. \"Regular care\" is defined as personal visits to a physician and receipt of \"the most appropriate treatment and care which conforms to generally accepted medical standards for your disabling condition(s) by a physician whose specialty or experience is the most appropriate\" for those conditions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   6. Under the LTD plan, disabilities \"which are primarily based on self-reported symptoms, and disabilities due to mental illness have a limited pay period up to 18 months.\" AR 436 (emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   7. The STD and LTD plans provide for payments to stop at the earliest of certain events. For STD benefits and for the first 9 months of LTD benefits, payments stop when a claimant is \"able to work in [his] own job or a reasonable alternative\" offered by the claimant's employer \"on at least a part-time basis but [the claimant] choose[s] not to[.]\" STD 371; AR 436. After the first 9 months of LTD benefits, part-time work need not be offered by the claimant's employer, and payments stop \"when you are able to work in any gainful occupation on a part-time basis but you chose not to[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Part-time basis \"means the ability to work and earn between 20% and 80%\" of weekly earnings for STD benefits and indexed monthly earnings for LTD benefits. STD 376; AR 449.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   8. Unum approved Mr. Bunger's claims for STD benefits for some 22 weeks between early January and August 29, 2014. STD 56, 77, 145, 150, 250. Unum denied further STD benefits and LTD benefits, STD 339; LTD 388-89, and, on January 23, 2015, denied Mr. Bunger's appeal, LTD 480-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   9. Dr. Traci Taggart, a naturopath and Mr. Bunger's primary care provider, gave Costco an update on his status in a January 30, 2015 letter. AR 793. Mr. Bunger continued to have chronic fatigue, weakness in his lower extremities, anxiety, and cognitive impairments, and was unable to work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Taggart extended Mr. Bunger's FMLA leave for an additional month and estimated his return to work as March 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   10. Although Mr. Bunger remained symptomatic, he improved to the point he was able to return to work\n   part-time. Dr. Taggart approved Mr. Bunger's return to his job, for two days a week, six hours per day, from March 2 through June 30, 2015. AR 787-92. Mr. Bunger could not start work before 7:00 a.m., had symptoms that may wax and wane, and may miss some scheduled work days or need to leave early.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   11. In June 2015, Dr. Taggart approved an increase to eight-hour days, two days a week, following further improvement in Mr. Bunger's symptoms. AR 786. However, Mr. Bunger stopped working that same month. AR 854. He at times found it difficult to focus and concentrate, became exhausted after a few hours, missed scheduled days, and ultimately had to stop working.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   12. On June 29, 2015, Mr. Bunger filed suit in this Court. Dkt. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   13. By September 2015, Mr. Bunger's health had improved and Dr. Taggart approved his return to work for three days a week, eight hours per day, through October 31, 2015. AR 779, 781-84. Dr. Taggart noted physical examination revealed hyperreflexia and mild weakness in Mr. Bunger's lower extremities and labs showed mild immune dysregulation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Taggart suggested the ability to work remotely would mitigate some of Mr. Bunger's challenges in returning to work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   14. In early November 2015, Dr. Taggart reported that Mr. Bunger continued to show significant improvements in his health, but was starting a new treatment protocol, which would likely cause him to feel worse initially. AR 778. His symptoms remained and physical examination revealed mild hyperreflexia, improved from the previous visit, and mild weakness in his hands.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Taggart approved work three days a week, one-to-two days in the office and one-to-two days at home, for eight hours per day, through December 31, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   15. Costco declined Mr. Bunger's request to return to work on a part-time basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 692, 854.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   16. Following the Court's July 2016 remand, Dr. Robert G. Sise, MD, a psychiatrist, conducted a Comprehensive Psychiatric Evaluation of Mr. Bunger on behalf of the Social Security Administration (SSA). AR 626-30. In the September 10, 2016 examination, Mr. Bunger reported a variety of symptoms and indicated he needed assistance in his day-to-day functioning, had difficulty shopping, made few mistakes on tasks given the simplification of his life, and avoided most social situations. AR 626-27. He was enrolled as a fulltime student \"in a BS in software development\" at Western Governor's University (WGU), where he was passing his \"graded pass-fail\" classes. AR 628. On mental status examination (MSE), Mr. Bunger had fair cooperation and effort, appeared spontaneous and genuine, with a somewhat timid interpersonal style, and struggled at times to initiate his responses, but was overall fairly social, with fair attention, a restricted affect, and glimpses of depression and anxiety.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Sise diagnosed unspecified anxiety, depressive, and neurocognitive disorders. AR 629. Given the description of several neurovegetative symptoms and a somewhat depressed affect, Dr. Sise found a clear concern for depression.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"He also reports experiencing significant anxiety and excessive worry that cause him considerable subjective distress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Sise found Mr. Bunger's report of a \"modest cognitive decline from a previous\n   level of performance in the domains of complex attention, learning and memory\" to be \"somewhat apparent\" on examination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Sise stated formal neuropsychiatric testing would facilitate a more thorough assessment of deficits, and that Mr. Bunger's \"psychiatric illness may be secondary to Lyme Disease but other indeterminate etiologies may also contribute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Sise found no evidence of malingering or factitious disorder, the psychiatric diagnoses somewhat treatable, prognosis fair, and improvement possible in the next twelve months assuming optimal treatment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Sise opined Mr. Bunger had fair ability to perform simple and repetitive tasks and fair to limited ability to perform detailed and complex tasks and perform work activities on a consistent basis without special or additional instructions based on his cognitive examination performance; fair to limited ability to perform work activities at a sufficient pace based on his ability to perform activities of daily living; fair to limited ability to maintain regular attendance and complete a normal workday without interruption given his current functional status and recent work history; and fair to limited ability to interact with coworkers, superiors, and the public, and to adapt to usual work stresses based on his interpersonal presentation.

Mr. Bunger submits extrinsic evidence in the form of an August 2017 declaration addressing his ongoing education at WGU. Dkt. 51. He also requests the opportunity to testify, should the Court wish to \"test\" his credibility. Dkt. 54 at 9. The declaration addresses the depiction of Mr. Bunger as a full-time student at WGU. Mr. Bunger clarifies his WGU classes take place on-line, at the time and in the amount of time of his choosing, entail his earning of \"competency units\", not credits, and that he spends, on average, only fifteen-to-twenty hours a week on his schooling. Dkt. 51 at 2. Mr. Bunger could have included this information in his January 2017 declaration. That declaration is a part of the administrative record and includes a discussion of Mr. Bunger's activities and their impact on his functioning, without any mention of his schooling. AR 854-56. Further, the information in the new declaration appears to relate solely to the period of time after July 5, 2015, and the determination of whether Mr. Bunger could work in any gainful occupation. Because the Court finds further proceedings necessary before such a determination can be made, it need not consider the new declaration in order to conduct an adequate\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of Mr. Bunger's exhausted claim. Nor is there any basis or need for Mr. Bunger to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   5. Unum also takes issue with the record and arguments before the Court. Unum asserts Mr. Bunger submitted new, unrequested documents in an attempt to expand the record and improperly changed his theory. However, Mr. Bunger's unprompted submission of records was neither surprising, nor unwarranted. The Court remanded the case based on Unum's failure to sufficiently develop the record. Unum took no action for almost four months following remand and Mr. Bunger appropriately provided information identified by Unum as pertinent to his claim. Mr. Bunger also complied once Unum\n   made specific requests. All of the information provided is appropriately included in the record. The identification of other, previously undiagnosed conditions does not constitute an improper change in theory. As discussed below, the change in diagnoses is explained by the nature of the conditions at issue and the differential diagnostic technique commonly associated with those conditions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mongeluzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412934\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/938/#p944\">\n    46 F.3d at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he claim of [CFS] is not a new claim, but simply a new explanation for Mongeluzo's disability.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Mr. Bunger asserts that the ERISA regulations governing appeals of adverse benefit determinations apply to court-ordered remands, and that Unum violated those regulations by allowing Mr. Jones to conduct the review after remand and through the continued consultation with Drs.

Nor was it apparent those regulations would appropriately apply in this case. The Court did not direct Unum to start anew with consideration of Mr. Bunger's claim, or to re-assign the claim to new administrative personnel or reviewing medical health care professionals. The Court directed Unum to take a specific course of action; that is, to inform Mr. Bunger of what additional testing or diagnostics it required in order to make an informed decision as to whether he is able to perform his job functions. It is not clear why Unum waited some four months before taking any action on remand.

The Court does not find the involvement of Mr. Jones or the consultation with Drs. Lyons and Bress rendered the process on remand procedurally flawed. Moreover, if the Court did find the procedural violations alleged, the appropriate remedy considering the circumstances in this case would be a remand to Unum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lafleur v.

The same definition of disability applies to the period of time remaining in which Mr. Bunger may be found eligible for STD benefits and for the first nine months of his eligibility for LTD benefits. At issue is whether Mr. Bunger establishes his limitation from performing the material and substantial duties of his job as a Web Content Specialist due to sickness from August 30 to October 4, 2014 under the STD plan and from October 5, 2014 to July 5, 2015 under the LTD plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   2. Medical records added to the claim file following remand appear to eliminate Lyme disease and neurological or behavioral health explanations for Mr. Bunger's physical symptoms. A definitive diagnosis or explanation for those symptoms remains elusive, but includes CFS or fibromyalgia. The elimination of a number of different possible causes makes these remaining diagnoses of exclusion more likely to be accurate.

Pointing to the most recent, negative Lyme result and Dr. Taggert's diagnostic techniques, treatment protocol, and status as a naturopathic physician, Unum argues Dr. Taggart's incorrect treatment and diagnosis calls into question the validity of her opinions, and demonstrates her care did not meet the \"generally accepted medical standards\" contemplated by the STD and LTD plans. STD 358, 377; AR 420, 450. Unum previously relied on evidence from Dr. Taggart in awarding Mr. Bunger STD benefits. It may not now rely on Dr. Taggart's professional qualifications as a basis for denying benefits given that it never provided this rationale during the administrative process.\n   <em>\n    Harlick v. Blue Shield of Cal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904459\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/699/#p719\">\n    686 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719-20 (9th Cir. 2012). Unum contends the \"unreliability of Dr. Taggart is not the result of her naturopathic training per se, but rather arises from her demonstrably erroneous opinions and treatment.\" Dkt. 55 at 4. However, while Dr. Taggart's diagnosis of Lyme disease was not supported by further testing, she also diagnosed CFS and her use of multiple working diagnoses finds support in the opinion of Dr. Neiman and case law, as reflected below. Dr. Taggart's treatment records suffice to demonstrate Mr. Bunger was under the \"regular care\" of a physician as contemplated by the STD and LTD plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   STD 358, 377; AR 420, 450. Her records provide pertinent observations and findings, and a longitudinal picture of Mr. Bunger's symptoms over time. While the evidence from Dr. Taggart does not alone suffice to establish disability, it need not and should not be considered in isolation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031676\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/822/#p834\">\n    538 U.S. at 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031676\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/822/#p834\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ERISA plan administrator may not arbitrarily refuse to credit reliable evidence, including evidence from a treating physician).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   5. Unum also denies the existence of support in the record for a diagnosis of either CFS or fibromyalgia, or a \"sickness\" under the STD and LTD plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 49, 53 and 55. Unum asserts Dr. Neiman never made or explained an actual diagnosis of either condition, merely alluded to potential differential diagnoses, and lacked any direct knowledge of Mr. Bunger prior to November 2016. Unum contends Dr. Taggart's January 2014 CFS diagnosis failed to satisfy diagnostic criteria in that Mr. Bunger had not presented with severe fatigue lasting six months or longer, other potential causes of symptoms had not been ruled out, and the existence of other criteria, as set forth by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), had not been considered. Unum notes that Dr. Taggart has never diagnosed fibromyalgia, and that Dr. Neiman made findings inconsistent with such a diagnosis, including the absence of fibromyalgia tender points\n   and an unremarkable CRP test. Unum urges the Court's acceptance of the opinions of Drs. Lyon, Bress, and Beth Schnars. As stated in the Court's July 2016 Order, Dr. Schnars opined prior to remand that the records did not identify an underlying etiology for reported fatigue given the absence of documented additional diagnostic criteria or basic in-office testing of cognitive functioning, and that Mr. Bunger did not receive the typical treatment for chronic fatigue, which is aerobic activity and cognitive behavioral therapy.

Results from the subsequent neurological examination by Dr. Liou and the January 2017 Lyme test provide further support for the remaining diagnoses of CFS and fibromyalgia. Dr. Neiman conducted an in-person evaluation and found Mr. Bunger's reports credible and no reason to suspect malingering or symptom magnification. AR 636. Likewise, Drs. Sise and Badger rendered opinions based on their in-person encounters with Mr. Bunger and found no basis for disbelieving his account of psychological symptoms occurring only secondary to his physical impairment. AR 626-31. The opinions of Drs. Neiman, Sise, and Badger are reliable, probative, and persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   8. In contrast, Drs. Lyon, Bress, Schnars, and Ursprung were unable to personally observe Mr. Bunger or assess the credibility of his reporting. The opinions addressing Mr. Bunger's physical symptoms reflect a rigid approach to the symptomatology, diagnosis, and treatment of CFS and fibromyalgia. They appear to require an etiology, objective findings, and/or symptoms that may not exist, or courses of treatment that may not be warranted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 360, 472-73, 883-87. The Court is not persuaded by the opinions of the reviewing physicians as they pertain to Mr. Bunger's ability to perform his own job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   9. The evidence of disability in this case is not overwhelming. The cause of Mr. Bunger's symptoms and the appropriate diagnosis remain unclear, and his claim necessarily relies in significant part on his subjective account. Dr. Taggart appeared to focus her treatment on a condition that was later ruled out. Most of the examinations occurred well after the time period relevant to the determination of whether Mr. Bunger could perform his own job, and at a time at which his symptoms had improved. However, the absence of additional evidence closer in time to the period under consideration resulted in part from Unum's failure to engage in the meaningful dialogue required by ERISA. As with the review conducted prior to remand,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 24 at 20, Unum did not take the opportunity to request that Mr. Bunger attend\n   an independent medical examination (IME).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salomaa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386362\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/666/#p677\">\n    642 F.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating, in review for an abuse of discretion, that an insurer may have declined an opportunity to conduct an IME given the \"risk that the physicians it employs may conclude that the claimant is entitled to benefits\");\n   <em>\n    Montour v.

On balance, the evidence weighs in Mr. Bunger's favor and he meets his burden of establishing his entitlement to disability benefits through July 5, 2015. Whether as a result of CFS, fibromyalgia, or another condition, a preponderance of the evidence shows Mr. Bunger had a sickness precluding his ability to perform the high level of mental functioning required for the performance of his job as a Web Content Specialist, to sustain the necessary employment-related activities, or to maintain attendance at that job on a consistent basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Mr. Bunger also seeks a determination that he is unable to perform any gainful occupation and entitled to LTD benefits from July 6, 2015 through the present.

Mr. Bunger maintains the existence of\n   medical opinions and records timely, relevant to, and supporting his LTD claim in relation to the issue of any gainful occupation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   4. An exception to the exhaustion requirement would not be appropriate in this case. There are notable differences between both the issue to consider and the evidence dated before and after July 5, 2015. According to both Mr. Bunger and Dr. Taggart, Mr. Bunger's symptoms began to improve at least as early as late February 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 792, 854. His condition had further improved by September 2015, allowing for his return to his own, mentally demanding occupation for three full days a week. AR 779, 781-84, 854. In September 2016, Mr. Bunger reported successfully taking on-line classes in software development. AR 628. Dr. Sise, that same month, assessed Mr. Bunger with a fair ability to perform simple and repetitive tasks, and as fair to limited in all other respects. AR 630. In early November 2016, Dr. Neiman described Mr. Bunger as \"about 70% better.\" AR 633. Later that month, Mr. Bunger had a normal neurological examination with Dr. Liou and reported his neurologic symptoms had \"mostly improved.\" AR 707-14. This and other evidence in the record raises serious questions as to whether Mr. Bunger would be able to demonstrate his inability to perform in any gainful occupation, on a full- or part-time basis. Unum has never considered this claim. Nor has Unum considered other potentially relevant policy terms, such as the LTD plan limitation to only eighteen months total of benefits for disabilities primarily based on self-reported symptoms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 436. Further proceedings are necessary to allow for consideration of Mr. Bunger's claim for disability under the LTD plan as of July 6, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   5. While the additional delay imposed by remand is unfortunate, Mr. Bunger's concerns as to futility can be mitigated at least in part. The Court has determined Mr. Bunger had a sickness as required for coverage under the LTD plan through July 5, 2015. Further proceedings can include additional information relating to Mr. Bunger's condition on or after July 6, 2015, including his declaration regarding WGU. Unum must continue to engage in the meaningful dialogue required by ERISA and, in order to ensure a full and fair review of Mr. Bunger's remaining LTD claim, Unum should employ the services of different reviewing physicians and appoint an individual other than Mr. Jones to conduct the review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court hereby FINDS and ORDERS:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   1) Defendant's Second Motion for Judgment (Dkt. 53) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   2) Plaintiff's Second Motion for Judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (Dkt. 47) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Mr. Bunger establishes his disability under Unum's STD plan from August 30, 2014 to October 4, 2014, and under the LTD plan from October 5, 2014 to July 5, 2015, and is entitled to recover benefits. However, the Court REMANDS to Unum the issue of Mr. Bunger's entitlement to LTD benefits from July 6, 2015 and beyond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   3) The parties shall meet and confer regarding the appropriate amount of benefits owed and any prejudgment interest, and jointly submit a proposed\n   judgment within\n   <strong>\n    ten (10) days\n   </strong>\n   of the date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   4) Plaintiff may also, within\n   <strong>\n    ten (10) days\n   </strong>\n   from the date of this Order, file a motion to recover any attorney's fees and costs sought. The motion shall be supported by documentary evidence reflecting the amount of fees and costs sought, and shall include argument as to the authority upon which fees and costs may be granted and why the fees sought are reasonable. Defendant shall file a response in accordance with the Local Rules and plaintiff may file a reply in accordance with the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   5) This matter is now CLOSED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Unum states the own job LTD period runs through June 5, 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 49 at 13; Dkt. 53 at 5. However, as reflected in the Court's prior findings of fact and acknowledged in Unum's briefing, the LTD eligibility period began on October 5, 2014, Dkt. 24 at 10, Dkt. 49 at 3, Dkt. 53 at 4, and the nine-month conclusion of that period would extend through July 5, 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Plaintiff explains that the first 513 pages of the expanded claim file are, with few exceptions, the same as the original LTD claim file, with some new material at pages AR 1, 3, and 16, and newly added documents at AR 514 through AR 992.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
