For the reasons set forth below, the defendants' motion to dismiss is\n   <em>\n    granted\n   </em>\n   and Burnham's motion to further amend him complaint is\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Summary of Underlying Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Burnham's claims relate to an incident which occurred on March 3, 2012 at the time of his arrest by the Southbridge Police Department. More specifically, Burnham alleges that while in police custody, he had a medical emergency (a seizure) and soiled himself. He alleges that the police department had a video of the incident from its surveillance cameras and provided a copy to employees of the Dudley District Court. Burnham was brought to court at March 7, 2012, for a custody proceeding. He alleges that at the proceeding, employees of the courthouse looked at him and laughed. He further alleges that whenever he was brought to the Dudley District Court for the next year and a half, courthouse employees continued to laugh at him and mock his seizure. As a result, Burnham has been humiliated and attempted to commit suicide on a number of occasions. Upset about the courthouse employees' conduct, he acted out in court and as a result, lost custody of his children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Motion To Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants assert that Burnham's claims against them under Section 1983, 1985 and 1986 for violation of his civil rights and conspiracy to violate his civil rights, as well as all state law claims against them, must be dismissed because they are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.

Title II provides that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012132\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Title II of the ADA). To state a claim under Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he was either excluded from participation in or denied benefits of a public entity's services, programs or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against; and (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was due to his disability.\n   <em>\n    Buchanan v. Maine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756898\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/158/#p170\">\n    469 F.3d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 170-71 (1st Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In order to establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability, Burnham must establish that he:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   suffers from a physical or mental impairment that affects life activities that are 'major,'\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 'of central importance to daily life.' Major life activities are basic activities of daily life that an average person in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty-'functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.' Finally, he must show that the impairment 'substantially limits' the identified major life activity. In assessing whether someone is disabled under the ADA, we must consider the impairment's effect on the particular individual. The limitation caused by the impairment must be permanent or long-term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Ramos-Echevarria v. Pichis, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050002\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/182/#p187\">\n    659 F.3d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187 (1st Cir. 2011) (internal citations and citation to quoted case omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this case, Burnham alleges that he suffered a seizure which resulted in him soiling himself, that the incident was captured on video surveillance tape and court employees who viewed the videotape thereafter laughed at him and humiliated him every time he came to court. He asserts that he suffers from unspecified mental health issues. He asserts that the courthouse employees' conduct caused him to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation. He further asserts that it caused him to act inappropriately during court proceedings, which led to him losing custody of his children. Burnham provides details of the alleged conduct of court employees and its effect on him. However, as pointed out by the defendants, provides scant details of the nature of his mental illness and its effect on his major life activities. To the extent that he is alleging that his impairment includes suffering seizures-he does not specify whether the seizure was related to a medical condition. Thus, for the reasons stated by the defendants, he has failed to state claim under Title II of the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Whether The Amendment Should Be Allowed\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff seeks to amend his complaint for the Fourth time. Plaintiff's motion to amend adds additional factual allegations, primarily related to his ADA claim. Given that his factual and legal allegations relating to his ADA claims are intertwined with his civil rights claims, it is impossible for the Court to determine whether his proposed complaint would state a claim under the ADA. What is clear, however, is that the federal civil\n   rights and state law claims asserted in his proposed amended complaint would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and therefore, as to those claims, allowing the amendment would be futile. For these reasons, the Court is denying Burnham's motion to file a Fourth Amended Complaint, without prejudice. Plaintiff shall have additional time to file a further amended complaint in which he may reassert\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   his ADA claim. Burnham is advised that his further amended complaint should address the deficiencies in his ADA claim noted by the defendants in their memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss. If Burnham fails to file his further amended complaint by April 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1.
