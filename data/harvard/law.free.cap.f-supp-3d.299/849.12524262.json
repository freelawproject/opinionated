Reeves, United States District Judge\n   This action arises out of Plaintiff David Moore's claim for disability benefits under a group insurance policy purchased by his former employer, Defendant American Water Works Company, Inc. (\"American Water\"), and insured by Defendant Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MetLife\"). [Record No. 18 \u00b6\u00b6 4-10] Moore claims that MetLife improperly omitted certain benefits when it approved his claim for total disability benefits. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-23] MetLife contends that Moore's assertion is based on an old version of his policy, and that the applicable version does not provide for the benefits he seeks. [Record No. 39] Moore continues to believe that he is entitled to the omitted benefits, and moves for judgment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). [Record No. 40] He also contends that MetLife failed to conduct a full and fair review of his claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201133\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Conversely, MetLife argues that its benefits determination was correct, and moves for a judgment dismissing Moore's claims. [Record No. 39]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Moore also asserts that American Water breached its fiduciary duty by failing to sufficiently advise him of any change to his benefits and by providing him with incorrect policy documents. [Record No. 40] He seeks equitable relief and the imposition of statutory penalties under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) and (c), and moves for summary judgment against American Water. [Record No. 40] American Water asserts that there is no evidence to support Moore's claims, and moves for summary judgment in its favor. [Record No. 41]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, MetLife's motion for judgment will be granted, and Moore's motion for judgment against MetLife will be denied. Moore's motion for summary judgment against American Water will be granted, in part, and denied, in part. Finally, American Water's motion for summary judgment will be granted, in part, and denied, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   David Moore was working for American Water and was enrolled in a group insurance policy purchased by American Water and insured by MetLife when he suffered a heart attack and stroke in January and February of 2015. [Administrative Record (\"AR\") 521, 523-24, 526] He initially received short-term disability benefits for 26 weeks, after which MetLife automatically opened a claim under the life insurance component of the plan. [AR 71, 180] MetLife informed Moore by letter dated December 7, 2015, that he satisfied the requirements for Total Disability, and that effective July 14, 2015, his life insurance premiums would be waived while he remained \"Totally Disabled\" under the plan. [AR 61] The approval letter further stated that Moore's coverage for Basic Continued Life Protection was $69,000, and his coverage for Optional Employee Continued Protection was $169,000, for a combined total of $235,000.00, which would reduce to a combined total of $10,000.00, when Moore turned 70 years old on March 2, 2033. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Moore was at that point in possession of a 2002 Summary Plan Description (\"SPD\") provided by American Water. [Record No. 40-2, pp. 2-3] The 2002 SPD provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [i]f you become eligible for a Permanent and Total Disability benefit and the disability lasts for six months or more, a\n   monthly income of $18 for each $1,000 of the amount of your basic and optional insurance is payable. The monthly income will continue until the amount of your insurance, plus interest as may be declared by Aetna on the unpaid balance, is exhausted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33] Additionally, the 2002 SPD did not provide for a reduction in benefits when Moore turned 70 years old. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moore's wife called MetLife on December 23, 2015, for an explanation of the approval letter. [AR 66] She called again five days later to inquire about the payment of a monthly income of $18 for each $1,000 of life insurance coverage. [AR 66] She was advised that MetLife did not offer any coverages that paid benefits to employees. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moore's attorney then sent letters to MetLife and American Water on June 13, 2016, requesting \"a complete copy of the life insurance policy, insurance certificate, life insurance plan document(s), and summary plan description.\" [AR 78-83, 150-51] MetLife called Moore's attorney the following day and advised him that he would need to contact American Water to obtain the documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [AR 65] American Water responded by e-mail on July 15, 2016, and attached two documents. [AR 152] The first was a copy of a 2011 SPD which did not provide for the payment of Disability Life Installment Benefits and stated that total disability benefits \"reduce[ ] to $10,000 when you reach age 70.\" [Record No. 41-8, p. 13] The second was a life insurance certificate which provided for Disability Life Installment Benefits of $18.00 a month for each $1,000 of life insurance coverage and did not contain a reduction at age 70. [AR 103, 117] The 2011 SPD also stated that, \"[i]f a conflict arises between this summary and any official plan documents, the official plan documents will govern.\" [Record No. 41-8, p. 3]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Moore's attorney sent MetLife a letter on July 25, 2016, requesting the payment of Disability Life Installment Benefits and clarification of MetLife's statement that the benefits payable upon Moore's death would reduce when Moore turned 70 years old to a combined total of $10,000. [AR 85-87] In support, he attached the certificate he had received from American Water. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85-138] MetLife responded by letter dated August 18, 2016, that \"[t]he customer's certificate you submitted to our office for review is not the applicable customer's certificate that was used for Mr. Moore's claim review.\" [AR 140] Moore's attorney responded in a letter dated August 29, 2016, with the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Are you saying that the Plan sent with my July 25 letter is not the correct plan? Or are you saying that you simply used a different certificate in conducting your review? Are you saying that the certificate you used is the correct one? Could you please send me a copy of the certificate you believe is the correct one and whatever certificate you used for your review, if it is different?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [AR 148]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   MetLife investigated the matter to confirm that it had used the correct certificate in reviewing Moore's claim, and that the certificate Moore's attorney provided was incorrect. [AR 157-179] MetLife's review revealed that American Water had a version of its benefits plan in effect in 1996,\n   which was insured by Aetna and included Disability Installment Life Benefits in the amount of $18 per $1,000 of life insurance coverage with no later reduction in the benefit amount. [Record No. 39-1, pp. 2-3 (citing Record No. 35-3, pp. 11-13) ] The 2002 SPD that Moore possessed appears to correspond to this policy. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record No. 40-2.] MetLife began insuring the plan on January 1, 2003, and issued a policy to American Water including these same benefits. [Record No. 39-3, p. 527] This is the policy that American Water provided in response to the request from Moore's attorney. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record No. 18-1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, the policy was amended on April 1, 2006, and retroactively effective to January 1, 2006, and replaced by a new certificate of insurance designated as Certificate 11. [Record No. 39-3, p. 567] Certificate 11 continued to have Disability Installment Life Benefits in the amount of $18 per $1,000 of life insurance coverage, but reduced the amount of Death Benefits During Total Disability to $10,000 at age 70. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 583, 597-98] Additionally, it stated that, \"[i]f any prior certificate relating to the coverage set forth herein has been given to the Employee, such certificate is void.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 570]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Certificate 15 replaced Certificate 11 on January 1, 2011, and was retroactively effective to January 1, 2006. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 566, 620, 622] Certificate 15 retained the reduction in benefits at age 70, and also did not provide for Disability Installment Life Benefits. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 620-73] Certificate 20 replaced Certificate 15 on March 28, 2011, and retroactively to November 17, 2010. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 537-38, 674, 676] As with Certificate 15, Certificate 20 included the reduction of Continued Death Benefits During Total Disability at age 70 to $10,000, and did not include any provision providing Disability Installment Life Benefits. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 674-773] According to MetLife and American Water, Certificate 20 is the governing document for Moore's benefits claim. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Nos. 35, 36, 39, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The 2011 SPD that American Water sent to Moore's attorney on July 15, 2016, is consistent with Certificate 20. [Record No. 41-8] Moore does not recall having received the 2011 SPD until that time. [Record No. 40-2] However, in July of 2012, American Water retained A+ Letter Services, Inc., to distribute the SPDs to American Water employees along with a cover letter explaining the document and its importance. [Record Nos. 44-6; 44-7] Moore's name and address was included in a list of union employees identified as Lot # 4 Pension Eligible. [Record Nos. 44-8; 44-9, p. 23] A+ Letter Services, Inc., billed American Water for mailing the SPDs to the Lot # 4 members on July 31, 2012. [Record No. 44-6]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Having determined that the certificate used for its review was correct, and that the certificate Moore obtained from American Water was incorrect, MetLife sent the following e-mail to American Water on December 22, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   We received an inquiry regarding a Life Waiver of Premium claim (David M. Moore). Specifically, Mr. Moore and his attorney forwarded MetLife the attached certificate they received from American Water regarding his WOP Claim. It appears Mr. Moore should have received Certificate 20 (attached) which is applicable for All American Water Union Employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Can you confirm if this is correct, and if so, would you be able to provide Mr. Moore and his attorney with Certificate 20. Provided below is the contact information to Mr. Moore's attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [AR 391] However, Moore never received a response from MetLife or American Water. [Record No. 40, p. 10] Moore filed this action in the Clark Circuit Court on January 30, 2017. [Record No. 1-1, pp. 5-11]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   MetLife removed the matter to this Court on March 1, 2017, and attached a copy of Certificate 20 to its notice of removal. [Record No. 1-2] This was the first time that Moore obtained a copy of Certificate 20. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record No. 40, pp. 10-11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moore's attorney wrote to American Water on March 23, 2017, to advise that MetLife had produced a different insurance certificate than the one American Water provided on July 15, 2016, and to inquire regarding which certificate applied to Moore's claim. [Record No. 40-4] American Water sent the following response a week later: \"Our Benefits Team has confirmed that the Exhibit B Certificate you received from MetLife is the correct Certificate applicable to Mr. Moore. I apologize for the confusion.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, Moore nonetheless issued a subpoena duces tecum to American Water on July 14, 2017, requesting copies of insurance policies or certificates applicable to Moore from 2005 to the present. [Record No. 14-1] American Water responded by providing a copy of the same certificate it had sent Moore on July 15, 2016, rather than Certificate 20. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record No. 40, p. 11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moore filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 5, 2017, adding American Water as a defendant. [Record No. 18] On September 7, 2017, Moore filed a motion to compel MetLife to respond to discovery requests aimed at determining which certificate applied to Moore's claim. [Record No. 33] American Water filed a response to the motion, attaching a copy of Certificate 20, and a declaration from its benefits manager, Sean King, stating that Certificate 20 was indeed the applicable policy, and not the certificate initially provided to Moore. [Record Nos. 35-1, 35-5] This was the first time that Moore received a copy of Certificate 20 directly from American Water.

He argues that the 2011 SPD was insufficient because it misleadingly retained a section titled \"Total Disability Benefits\" and did not specifically advise participants of the changes to their policy removing Disability Life Installment Benefits and reducing total disability benefits at age 70. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Nos. 41-8, p. 13; 43, pp. 4-7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Both of these arguments are unavailing. \"ERISA does not require plan administrators to republish the summary plan description every time an amendment is made to the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Crosby v.

However, when the plan administrator does provide a new SPD when changes or modifies a plan, it is not also required to provide participants with a description of the modifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202520\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .104b-3 ;\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

This heading does not misleadingly indicate that Disability Life Installment Benefits remain available or that there will be no reduction to a participant's total disability benefits. Contrary to Moore's contention, it is not \"easy to understand\" how Moore could have read the 2011 SPD and understood it to mean that he was entitled to these benefits.

[Record No. 39, pp. 21-23; 43, pp. 10-11] However, American Water provided these documents in 2016 and 2017, well after Moore's claim for total disability benefits had already been approved. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 61, 103, 117; Record No. 40, p. 11.] Accordingly, Moore cannot demonstrate that this alleged misrepresentation would have mislead \"a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision in pursuing disability benefits to which [he] may be entitled,\"\n   <em>\n    Krohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621100\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/542/#p548\">\n    173 F.3d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or that the misrepresentation influenced his conduct, causing prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Deschamps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173493\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/267/#p276\">\n    840 F.3d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[AR 78-83, 150-51] American Water promptly responded, attaching an accurate 2011 SPD and\n   <em>\n    inaccurate\n   </em>\n   certificate to its response. [AR 103, 117, 152] It was reasonable for Moore to believe that he may have been entitled Disability Life Installment Benefits with no reduction based on these documents, given that the 2011 SPD stated that \"[i]f a conflict arises between this summary and any official plan documents, the official plan documents will govern.\" [Record No. 41-8, p. 3] Accordingly, Moore's attorney sent MetLife a letter on July 25, 2016, requesting payment and clarification of these benefits. [AR 85-87] After receiving the letter from Moore's attorney, MetLife determined that American Water had sent an inapplicable certificate, and notified American Water of the error on December 22, 2016. [AR 391] But American Water did not contact Moore, and Moore filed this civil action without having been informed of which certificate applied to his claim. [Record No. 1-1]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moore did not receive a copy of Certificate 20 until March 1, 2017, and he only received it then because MetLife attached a copy to its notice of removal. [Record No. 1-2] Moore's attorney notified American Water of the discrepancy between the certificates on March 23, 2017. [Record No. 40-4] American Water confirmed that Certificate 20 was the applicable policy for the first time on March 30, 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, American Water\n   <em>\n    again\n   </em>\n   sent a copy of the inapplicable policy in response to the subpoena duces tecum Moore issued on July 14, 2017. [Record No. 14-1] The matter was not fully resolved until American Water filed a declaration from its benefits manager on September 28, 2017, clarifying that Certificate 20 was the applicable certificate. [Record No. 35-1]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   American Water's failure to provide Moore with the applicable certificate governing his benefits claim within 30 days of his request constitutes a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201024\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4), and the imposition of statutory penalties is appropriate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). The Court does not find that American Water's conduct was in bad faith, and Moore was not prevented from making a claim for benefits as a result of American Water's conduct. However, American Water's ERISA violation created confusion regarding Moore's benefits, leading to litigation. Despite being notified by MetLife of the error over a month before Moore filed this civil action, American Water did not timely cure its mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that statutory penalties in the amount of $15 per day is warranted to induce administrators to timely provide participants with requested plan documents, and to penalize American Water's failure to do so in this case.\n   <em>\n    Bartling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840604\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/1062/#p1068\">\n    29 F.3d at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \" \u00a7 1132(c)(1) penalty calculations begin only 31 days after the plaintiffs made their document requests.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840604\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/1062/#p1068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840604\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/1062/#p1068\">\n    at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
