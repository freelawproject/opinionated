Rec. Doc. 2 \u00b6 4. In October 2012, Defendant hired Jason Gunderson to work as a deckhand on one of Defendant's boats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. While employed by Defendant, Gunderson was never disciplined regarding his performance of the essential functions of his job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. In January 2013, Gunderson began having marital problems and, as a result, began experiencing emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. He separated from his wife a few months later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. In April 2013, Gunderson asked his manager, Randy Whittaker, for a referral to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to obtain help coping with the stress of his separation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Whittaker, a Health, Safety and Environmental Manager for Defendant, provided Gunderson with a list of numbers to call\n   for EAP assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. He told Gunderson, who expected to miss five days of work, that he would not be allowed to return to work without first obtaining a release from the company doctor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23. Specifically, Whittaker told Gunderson that he \"would not be able to send him back to his assigned vessel due to safety reasons and concerns regarding [Gunderson's] need to seek EAP assistance for his emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gunderson returned to work approximately three weeks later, on or about May 20, 2013, at which time he presented a medical release from the company's doctor stating that he could return to work without any restrictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The doctor's note \"determined that Gunderson had 'situational' depression.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Upon his return, Gunderson worked without restrictions, and he was given no indication of concern about his performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. However, two weeks later, on June 5, 2013, Defendant discharged Gunderson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gunderson filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging disability discrimination by Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. The EEOC found reasonable cause to believe that there had been a violation and issued a Letter of Determination that Defendant had discriminated against Gunderson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Subsequently, the EEOC attempted to remedy the discriminatory practice and to secure a conciliation agreement with Defendant; however, such attempts were unsuccessful and the EEOC issued a Notice of Failure of Conciliation on September 11, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10-13. The EEOC then filed a complaint in this court against Defendant on September 21, 2017, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended (ADAAA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rec. Doc. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The complaint alleges that Defendant discriminated against Gunderson by discharging him \"because the Defendant perceived him to be a threat to the safety of others due to perceived 'distraction' caused by his situational depression or adjustment disorder in violation of the ADA[AA].\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(A).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    \u00b6 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doc. 2 \u00b6 33. The complaint alleges that Defendant knew of Gunderson's request for EAP assistance and, based on the note from the company doctor, that Gunderson was diagnosed with \"situational depression.\" Therefore, the EEOC's position is that Gunderson was improperly discharged two weeks after Defendant learned of Gunderson's depression from the company doctor's note because Defendant regarded Gunderson as having depression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The second claim alleges that Defendant discriminated against Gunderson in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4)(A) by requiring Gunderson to obtain a doctor's note before returning to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rec.

Therefore, the EEOC maintains that Defendant imposed a medical exam on Gunderson as an unlawful precondition of his returning to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   However, Defendant fails to request dismissal of the two claims actually pleaded in the complaint. Rather, Defendant seeks dismissal of \"all claims ... arising from a disability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(A) &amp; (B)\" and of \"all claims ... for allegations of a failure to reasonably accommodate....\" Rec.
