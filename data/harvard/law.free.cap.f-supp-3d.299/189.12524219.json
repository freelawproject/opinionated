Count I of the Amended Complaint alleges a breach of the NDA, and CopyWatch has not challenged the authenticity of the copy submitted by Red Cross. Therefore, the Court will consider the text of the NDA in deciding the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Red Cross has also submitted a copy of the MOU.

Red Cross's argument proceeds in two steps. First, it argues, the Amended Complaint \"directly contradicts the facts set forth in [CopyWatch's] original complaint\" with respect to the MOU, and so the Court should strike the discredited allegations in the Amended Complaint and look to the original complaint instead. Def.'s Br. at 5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hourani v.

Second, Red Cross asserts that the original complaint clearly references the MOU by describing an agreement reached on August 10, 2015 (the date of the MOU) with the same subject matter as the MOU.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6771537,5768585\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6771537,5768585\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/1/\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Red Cross's argument founders at the first step. While the Court may strike \"sham\" allegations that represent a \"180 degree change\" from the original complaint, the amendments in this case are not so extreme.\n   <em>\n    Clay v. Howard Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758907\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/22/#p26\">\n    128 F.Supp.3d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26-27 (D.D.C. 2015). CopyWatch's original complaint alleged that it agreed on August 10, 2015, to perform an audit for Red Cross. Orig. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. In its Amended Complaint, CopyWatch omits any reference of an agreement reached on August 10, 2015, and instead alleges that a similar agreement to perform an audit occurred at the earlier June 2015 meeting. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-31. Red Cross may well be correct that this amendment represents gamesmanship, an effort on CopyWatch's part to prevent the Court from considering the MOU in connection\n   with this motion. But the \"argument that the changes in [CopyWatch's] amended complaint rise to the level of direct contradiction overstates the changes [CopyWatch] has made.\"\n   <em>\n    Clay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758907\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/22/#p26\">\n    128 F.Supp.3d at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is conceivable that the parties reached an understanding regarding the audit report in the June 2015 meeting and reaffirmed it in August 2015, when the MOU was executed. Thus, the allegations in both complaints could be true, and the amendment \"does not fundamentally change the nature of Plaintiff's allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758907\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/22/#p26\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, no part of the Amended Complaint will be stricken, and the entire document remains CopyWatch's operative pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For that reason, the Court must follow the \"hornbook law that an amended complaint supersedes the prior complaint and renders it of no legal effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Halldorson v.

If an agreement to perform the audit occurred in June 2015, as CopyWatch now alleges, then the Court cannot conclude that the MOU is integral to its claims. Therefore, the MOU is not within the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The remaining three documents consist of an email from Macon to CopyWatch dated July 6, 2015, Wright Decl.

Count I: Breach of the NDA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under District of Columbia law, CopyWatch must establish four elements to prevail on its claim for breach of contract: \"(1) a valid contract between the parties; (2) an obligation or duty arising out of the contract; (3) a breach of that duty; and (4) damages caused by breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Tsintolas Realty Co. v.

CopyWatch alleges that Red Cross breached its obligations under the NDA by exploiting CopyWatch's confidential information for financial gain, thereby depriving CopyWatch of \"lost income for its services.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62-67. Red Cross does not dispute that the NDA is a valid contract between the parties, or that the contract obligated Red Cross not to use CopyWatch's confidential material. Red Cross does, however, argue that CopyWatch has not adequately alleged a breach of that duty or damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 9-11. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, Red Cross argues, the Audit Report does not constitute confidential information protected by the NDA because the report was not proprietary and amounted to nothing more than a \"sales pitch.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. But the NDA does not clearly exclude nonproprietary information or \"sales pitches\" from \"Confidential Information,\" which is defined as \"certain confidential information relating to copier and printer cost recovery service.\" Wright Decl. App. 1, at 5. CopyWatch alleges that the Audit Report met that definition: the report was marked as \"confidential\" and explained how Red Cross could reduce its copying\n   and printing costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-41. The Court has also examined the Audit Report itself, which Red Cross has filed under seal, and its contents do not make those allegations implausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Audit Report. Plausibility is enough at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Council on Am.-Islamic Relations Action Network, Inc. v.

Of course, it will ultimately be CopyWatch's burden to show that the Audit Report was among the \"\n   <em>\n    certain\n   </em>\n   confidential information\" that the parties intended to protect. Wright Decl. App. 1, at 5 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Red Cross next argues that CopyWatch has not adequately alleged that Red Cross actually used any confidential information in violation of the agreement. Def.'s Br. at 8-9, 10-11. CopyWatch's allegations, Red Cross argues, are too conclusory to \"nudge[ ] [its] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v.

The Court disagrees, because the Amended Complaint specifically alleges that a Red Cross employee called CopyWatch's president \"boasting that, since having CopyWatch's work product, [Red Cross] had been able to drive down its cost-per-copy rate to 2.7 cents.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 56. Red Cross argues that this conversation merely speaks to Red Cross's \"separate negotiation with its vendor\" and that the cost savings were not necessarily \"due either to CopyWatch or to the contents of its report.\" Def.'s Reply at 5-6. But the employee's alleged statement-that Red Cross had reduced its costs \"since having CopyWatch's work product\"-clearly supports an inference that Red Cross had won those savings by using CopyWatch's report and other confidential advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Red Cross argues, CopyWatch has not adequately pleaded damages caused by the breach. Def.'s Br. at 10-11. In Red Cross's view, because the NDA disclaimed \"any expectation of a business relationship,\" CopyWatch has no right to the profits that it expected to earn from a future business relationship as damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court concludes that this argument does not warrant dismissal of CopyWatch's claim at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The damages recoverable in a breach of contract action include those damages which 'arise directly from the breach itself, or could reasonably have been in contemplation of both parties when they made the contract.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mercer Mgmt.

When all inferences are drawn in CopyWatch's favor, the Amended Complaint adequately alleges that CopyWatch's lost income constituted damages within the contemplation of the parties. The NDA allowed the parties to use each other's confidential information only \"to the extent necessary\" to \"explore business opportunities of mutual interest.\" Wright Decl. App. 1, at 5. And CopyWatch's business model, which it allegedly explained in advance of its first meeting with Red Cross, is to provide its advice and assistance in exchange for payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-17, 27. The agreement can therefore be plausibly read to reflect an understanding that Red Cross would not use CopyWatch's confidential information for its own benefit without first securing CopyWatch's consent by agreeing to pay, and that damages for breach would include some form of compensation for unauthorized use. In an analogous situation, the Seventh Circuit has suggested that the plaintiff might be able to recover \"the amount an unauthorized user of proprietary\n   information would have agreed to pay if negotiating in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Vojdani v.

Effect of Written Contracts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to Red Cross, two written contracts preclude Count II of the complaint: the NDA and the MOU. As an initial matter, a written agreement does not always preclude the formation of an implied-in-fact contract. Cases are legion holding that \"where the parties have a contract governing an aspect of the relation between themselves, a court will not displace the terms of that contract and impose some other duties not chosen by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Emerine v. Yancey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7867371\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/680/1380/#p1384\">\n    680 A.2d 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1384 (D.C. 1996). But that principle relates to extra-contractual duties imposed under an equitable theory of unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7867371\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/680/1380/#p1384\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7867371\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/680/1380/#p1384\">\n    at 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An implied-in-fact contract is, by contrast, a true contract between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7867371\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/680/1380/#p1384\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the right circumstances, the terms of a written contract can be supplemented with terms implied from the parties' conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   at 1384.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even if it applies, the principle that Red Cross invokes here does not preclude\n   Count II. It is generally true that \"a claim for\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   cannot stand where there is an express written agreement between the parties,\" but only if the agreement concerns \"the same subject matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Cobell v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268230\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/126/#p159\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159 (D.D.C. 2017). The NDA does not appear to concern the same subject matter as the contract alleged in Count II. That written agreement does not directly address the key aspect of this claim: CopyWatch's compensation. Rather, the NDA was expressly intended to protect the parties while they negotiated a separate agreement that would govern payment for CopyWatch's services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wright Decl. App. 1, at 5 (explaining that the parties \"wish to explore business opportunities of mutual interest\"); Def.'s Br. at 11 (\"[T]he NDA itself expressly disclaimed that it created a business relationship, or any expectation of a business relationship, between Red Cross and CopyWatch.\"). According to CopyWatch, the implied-in-fact contract underlying Count II is that separate agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   If CopyWatch is able to prove damages for breaches of both the NDA and the alleged implied-in-fact contract, those damages may overlap to some extent-but not necessarily completely. For example, CopyWatch alleges that it prepared \"a draft lease buyout letter for [Red Cross] to send to its current vendor,\" and provided contact information for the vendor's \"Vice President of Sales.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. If CopyWatch in fact authorized Red Cross to send the agreement to the vendor, as one could infer from the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint, then it presumably would not have constituted confidential information within the scope of the NDA. Nonetheless, CopyWatch's work on the letter could potentially constitute services compensable under Count II. As that example shows, \"without the benefit of discovery, it is not yet clear whether the activities at issue in the [implied-in-fact contract and] unjust enrichment claim[s] against [Red Cross] overlap entirely with the breach of contract claim\" in Count I.\n   <em>\n    Dist. Title v. Warren\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-1808 (ABJ),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012964657\">\n    2015 WL 12964657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (D.D.C. June 1, 2015). Therefore, the Court declines to dismiss Count II on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Red Cross also invokes the MOU as a written agreement barring Count II. As explained above, the MOU is not properly before the Court on this motion to dismiss. Moreover, even if it were before the Court, Red Cross's argument would have no purchase because it is not at all clear that the MOU is an agreement. This is so because the document, on its face, does not unambiguously evince a key element of contract formation: \"intention of the parties to be bound\" by at least some of its terms.\n   <em>\n    United House of Prayer for All People v. Therrien Waddell, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876395\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/112/330/#p337\">\n    112 A.3d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337-38 (D.C. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Georgetown Entm't Corp. v.

Rather, the document is internally inconsistent on this point. At times it appears to provide for a binding obligation: \"[n]o offer, commitment, estoppel, undertaking or obligation of any nature whatsoever\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be implied in fact, law or equity until ... final written agreements have been executed and delivered.\" Wright Decl. App. 2, at 9 (emphasis added). Elsewhere, however, the MOU states that\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of its terms, apparently including the foregoing, are binding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 9, 10. In an analogous case-where one party attempted to enforce a right of first refusal contained in a nonbinding letter of intent-another court concluded that the document was ambiguous, requiring the court to \"go beyond the four corners\" of the document to determine whether the right of first refusal was binding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Space Imaging Europe, Ltd. v. Space Imaging L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11623089\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/38/326/#p335\">\n    38 F.Supp.2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (Chin, J.). Similarly,\n   this Court could not determine on a motion to dismiss whether the parties intended to be bound by any of the MOU's terms, even if the MOU were before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Therefore, at this stage the Court cannot conclude that any written agreement between the parties compels dismissal of Count II of the Amended Complaint. For the same reasons, this argument must be rejected as to Count III as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Formation of an Implied-in-Fact Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because no written agreement requires dismissal of Count II, the Court turns to consider whether CopyWatch has properly pleaded the existence of an implied-in-fact contract. According to Red Cross, CopyWatch has failed to plausibly allege three elements of an implied-in-fact contract: that CopyWatch rendered \"valuable services\"; that the Red Cross \"accepted,\" \"used\" and \"enjoyed\" those services; and that Red Cross did so \"under such circumstances as reasonably notified [Red Cross] that [CopyWatch] expected to be paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan Keys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014344\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/870/58/#p62\">\n    870 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   62 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Red Cross's argument, however, is largely grounded in the MOU. If that document were in fact within the pleadings, it might very well compel the dismissal of Count II. That is because the MOU, even if not a binding contract, clearly states that Red Cross did not intend to be bound to compensate CopyWatch for its work until the parties executed a final agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wright Decl. App. 3, at 9;\n   <em>\n    Berry Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984492,6055742\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/505/\">\n    777 F.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding there was no reasonable expectation of payment where the defendant clearly communicated that the work in question was preliminary and would not be compensated);\n   <em>\n    Arcadian Phosphates, Inc. v.

But the MOU is not before the Court, and so this argument cannot prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Rather, the Amended Complaint plausibly alleges that Red Cross accepted CopyWatch's services with the understanding that it would have to pay for them. CopyWatch alleges that, starting in June 2015 when the parties first met, Red Cross understood that CopyWatch expected to be paid, although the parties had not yet agreed on \"potential payment structures.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. Macon allegedly sent correspondence to CopyWatch reflecting that understanding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Moreover, just when CopyWatch was about to \"finalize payment terms\" with Macon, it discovered that Macon had mysteriously left Red Cross-from which CopyWatch infers that Red Cross had sought to avoid its commitments to pay CopyWatch by firing the person in the organization who had most clearly expressed those commitments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-50. CopyWatch then reached out to other Red Cross employees, who allegedly \"continued to seek and accept CopyWatch's services while stringing CopyWatch along with respect to payment terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. That alleged course of dealing makes this case similar to others in which the defendant provided \" 'verbal assurances' that [the plaintiff] would be compensated for consulting services.\"\n   <em>\n    New Econ. Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924683\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/881/1087/#p1095\">\n    881 A.2d at 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Amended Complaint thus pleads sufficient facts to plausibly allege that Red Cross was on notice that CopyWatch expected to be paid at the time it accepted and used CopyWatch's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Red Cross points to the Macon email dated July 6, 2015, which it has attached to its motion to dismiss, as evidence that the Amended Complaint does not sufficiently allege that CopyWatch ever reasonably expected payment. Wright Decl. App. 3, at 12. In particular, it argues that the document suggests that Red Cross did not accept CopyWatch's customary 30% fee and wanted to \"discuss different payment structures.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924683\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/881/1087/#p1095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But other statements in the email are ambiguous. Macon also appears to memorialize an agreement \"that the process could start under a MOU, while the parties discuss the contract terms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924683\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/881/1087/#p1095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is plausibly consistent with CopyWatch's account, according to which Red Cross had not yet agreed to particular payment terms, but nonetheless understood that it would eventually have to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. Thus, the email does not undermine CopyWatch's claims. Nor does the Court agree that, because CopyWatch failed to send an invoice until May 2016, Red Cross could not have been on notice earlier that it was expected to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 17 (citing Wright Decl. App. 5, at 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Red Cross suggests, in its reply, that the \"agreement\" to provide audit services in June 2015 failed to include the amount of compensation, a material term of a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 4. That argument is of no moment because CopyWatch does not allege that an oral contract formed at the June 2015 meeting, or ever. Rather, CopyWatch alleges that the meeting put Red Cross on notice that it would have to pay for CopyWatch's services, and that an implied-in-fact contract formed later when Red Cross actually accepted and benefitted from CopyWatch's services. CopyWatch will, however, ultimately have to show that discussions of payment terms were sufficiently advanced by then that Red Cross can be considered to have agreed to definite terms of compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Queen v. Schultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180173,4154726\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/879/\">\n    747 F.3d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884-86 (D.C.

Red Cross relies primarily on the Audit Report, which it characterizes as \"sales pitch efforts ... expended to earn Red Cross's eventual business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180173,4154726\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/879/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But an examination of the Audit Report (filed under seal) does not, at this stage of the litigation, compel the conclusion that the parties understood it as nothing more than a sales pitch. Rather, for purposes of this motion, the Court must accept as true CopyWatch's allegation that the audit in fact constituted substantial and valuable work and was understood as such.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-31, 38. The parties may revisit their dispute over how to characterize the Audit Report after discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, Red Cross argues that it never used and benefitted from the services that CopyWatch provided. But for the same reasons explained above in connection with Count I, CopyWatch plausibly alleges just that.

Count III: Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Red Cross advances essentially the same arguments regarding CopyWatch's unjust enrichment claim. It first argues that written agreements preclude the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 11-13. That argument fails for the same reasons set forth above in connection with Count II. Nor is the Court convinced by Red Cross's argument that CopyWatch has failed to plead the elements of unjust enrichment, as explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Count III is based on a theory of \"quasi-contract,\" which \"is not a contract at all\" but rather a \"duty thrust under certain conditions upon one party to requite\n   another.\"\n   <em>\n    New Econ.
