CASEY RODGERS, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This is a multidistrict product liability action against the manufacturers and marketers of the prescription drug Aripiprazole, more commonly known as Abilify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that, after taking Abilify as prescribed, they developed impulsive and irrepressible urges to engage in certain harmful behaviors, including impulsive gambling, eating, shopping, and sex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants\n   deny the allegations and maintain that Abilify could not, and did not, cause Plaintiffs' impulse control problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants have moved for summary judgment on the issue of general causation-that is, whether Abilify is capable of causing uncontrollable impulses to engage in certain harmful behaviors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 428. Both the motion,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   , and the response,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 463, are supported by expert testimony. Each side challenges the other's experts as unreliable and those motions are also pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A four-day evidentiary hearing was conducted jointly with Magistrate Judge Gary R. Jones of this Court, and Judge James J. Deluca of the New Jersey Superior Court, who presides over multiple similar cases in New Jersey state court. Now, having carefully considered the law, the voluminous record, and the parties' arguments, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden to demonstrate that a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether Abilify can cause uncontrollable impulsive behaviors in individuals taking the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Abilify is an atypical antipsychotic drug developed and manufactured by Defendants Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc., who jointly market and distribute it in the United States with Defendant Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Master Complaint, ECF No. 108-1 at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2002, Abilify was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for the treatment of schizophrenia. Since then, Abilify also has been approved for use in patients with bipolar disorder, irritability associated with autistic disorder, Tourette's Syndrome, and as an add-on treatment for major depressive disorder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Product Label, ECF No. 428-1 at 2. \"[T]ens of millions of patients worldwide have used Abilify to help manage the symptoms of these very debilitating mental health conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSJ, ECF No. 428-26 at 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2010, the first published reports suggesting a possible link between Abilify and pathological gambling began appearing in the medical literature. More published reports followed, as well as hundreds of informal reports from patients and healthcare professionals to Defendants and the FDA, describing the onset of impulsive gambling and other impulse control disorders in patients treated with Abilify. The scientific community, the FDA, Defendants, and public health agencies worldwide took notice and began examining whether Abilify is linked to impulse control disorders. The research findings and conclusions of these bodies are at the heart of the motions currently pending before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, following a safety review of Abilify based on reports of pathological gambling with patients' use of the drug, the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") required Defendants to modify the drug's product label in Europe to include pathological gambling as a possible \"post-marketing undesirable effect\" of Abilify and to warn of an \"increased risk\" of pathological gambling in Abilify patients with a prior history of gambling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA Pharm. Vigil., ECF No. 428-11 at 5, 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In November 2015, Health Canada also found an \"increased risk\" of pathological gambling, as well as hypersexuality, with Abilify use and ordered that the drug's product monograph in Canada be updated to advise of these possible adverse effects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 12. Health Canada's safety review and subsequent product monograph update prompted the FDA to initiate a pharmacovigilance review in the United States to evaluate whether the potential link between Abilify and impulse control disorders presented a \"safety issue warrant[ing] any regulatory action.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The FDA's review identified an association between Abilify and impulse control disorders, based on an analysis of cases in its adverse event reporting database (FAERS), the published scientific literature, and Defendant's clinical trial and post-marketing patient data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 29. On May 3, 2016, the FDA issued a safety warning that \"uncontrollable and excessive urges\" to \"gamble, binge eat, shop and have sex\" had been reported with the use of Abilify, even in patients with no prior history of impulsive behaviors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In August 2016, the FDA required Defendants to modify Abilify's product label in the United States to warn of \"post-marketing case reports suggest[ing] that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking\" the drug.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Product Label, ECF No. 428-1 at 2, 24. The United States product label was also modified to warn of \"[o]ther compulsive urges, reported less frequently, [which] include: sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   At that point, Abilify had been on the market in the United States for almost 14 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A short biochemistry discussion may be helpful at this point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The human brain is a tremendously complex biochemical system. It contains billions of interconnected nerve cells, called neurons, that use chemical\n   and electrical signals to send information throughout the body. The function of a neuron is to process and transmit information-it receives signals from other neurons, integrates and interprets those signals, and transmits signals to other, adjacent neurons. The signals within neurons are carried throughout the brain in the form of electrical impulses. When a signal is sent from one neuron to another, it must cross a microscopic gap between the two communicating neurons. This gap is called a synapse or synaptic cleft. At the synapse, the electrical signal within the neuron is converted to a chemical signal and sent across the synapse towards the receiving neuron.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This chemical signal is transported by molecules, called neurotransmitters, that attach to special structures on the outer surface of the receiving neuron, called receptors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are many different types of receptors, categorized by the type of neurotransmitters with which they interact. The attachment of neurotransmitters to receptors can either stimulate or inhibit electrical activity in the receiving neuron, depending on which neurotransmitter is released and which receptors it activates. In any one synapse, there may be hundreds of neurotransmitters continually moving between, and acting on, neurons, triggering varying physiological effects throughout the brain and the body. Any disruption to the neuronal communication process-whether to the production, release, or attachment of the various neurotransmitters-can alter brain function and, as it relates to this case, human behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that is believed to play an integral role in a number of physiological processes, including movement, cognition, emotional stability, and, relevant to this case, reward-motivated behaviors. It acts on five different receptors-D\n   <sub>\n    1\n   </sub>\n   , D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   , D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   , D\n   <sub>\n    4\n   </sub>\n   , and D\n   <sub>\n    5\n   </sub>\n   -along four major pathways in the brain-the nigrostriatal pathway, the mesocortical pathway, the mesolimbic pathway, the tuberoinfundibular pathway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case is primarily concerned with the activity of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway, which regulates pleasure, reward processing, and motivation. Under normal circumstances, the brain responds to rewarding activities or stimuli by releasing dopamine into the mesolimbic pathway, where it binds with dopamine receptors to produce feelings of pleasure. As dopamine levels subside, so do the feelings of pleasure. If the rewarding activity is repeated, then dopamine is again released, and more feelings of pleasure are produced. The release of dopamine and the resulting pleasurable feelings serve as positive reinforcements that motivate repetition of the pleasure-inducing activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pharmaceutical companies create drugs that can mimic, duplicate, or block the activity of natural, or \"endogenous,\" dopamine in the brain. The effect of a given drug depends on two pharmacological properties that relate to the manner in which the drug interacts with dopamine receptors: affinity and intrinsic activity. Affinity refers to whether and how tightly the drug binds to dopamine receptors. Intrinsic\n   activity refers to the degree to which the drug, once bound, activates dopamine receptors to produce a measurable physiological effect. Based on these properties, drugs that bind to dopamine receptors can act as agonists or antagonists. A full agonist has both high affinity and 100% intrinsic activity, meaning that it binds tightly to dopamine receptors and mimics the activity of dopamine, producing the same level of physiological response that dopamine naturally produces. Antagonists bind to dopamine receptors, but produce no physiological effects; instead, they simply occupy a receptor site, thereby preventing endogenous dopamine from binding to and activating it. A partial agonist binds to dopamine receptors, but produces less of a response than a full agonist. The functional activity of some partial agonists depends on the presence or absence of endogenous dopamine in the surrounding area. Where dopamine concentrations are high, the partial agonist functions as an antagonist (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , functional antagonist), but where dopamine concentration is low, the partial agonist functions as a full agonist (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , functional agonist). In this case, Plaintiffs' position as to how Abilify causes impulse control problems centers on how the drug binds and interacts with two dopamine receptors-D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   and D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   -to produce physiological effects in the form of impulsive behaviors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Expert Challenges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To establish general causation, Plaintiffs have proffered the testimony of five experts: Dr. Antoine Bechara, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, Dr. Eric Hollander, Dr. Russell V. Luepker, and Dr. David Madigan. Simply stated, each of Plaintiffs' experts opines that Abilify can cause impulsive behaviors and each presents scientific evidence in support of his conclusion. Defendants challenge the admissibility of Plaintiffs' expert testimony on general causation as unreliable under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). More specifically, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to provide\n   <em>\n    reliable\n   </em>\n   scientific evidence demonstrating a statistically significant association between Abilify and impulsive behaviors. According to Defendants, this omission is a fatal flaw in Plaintiffs' case because their remaining evidence is insufficient as a matter of law, even in the aggregate, to establish general causation by Eleventh Circuit standards. Defendants rely on five experts of their own-Dr. Pierre Blier, Dr. Deborah Leiderman, Dr. Marc Potenza, Dr. Douglas Weed, and Dr. Catherine Winstanley-to support their position that Abilify cannot cause impulse control disorders, each of whom submitted an opinion that Plaintiffs in turn challenge as unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard for Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rule 702, as explained by\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, governs the admissibility of expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    Rink v.

The Court disagrees and, for the reasons that follow, finds the Etminan Study sufficiently reliable to support an expert opinion on general causation in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Etminan Study is an epidemiological case-control study in which the authors analyzed medical and pharmaceutical billing information for over six million individuals, drawn from a large insurance claims database known as LifeLink.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Etminan Study, ECF No. 428-13 at 1.

Next, from the same data, the authors drew a random sample of similar individuals whose records contained neither diagnostic code. These individuals served as \"controls.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The authors then compared the cases (individuals diagnosed with pathological gambling or impulse control disorders ) to the controls (individuals with no such diagnoses) based on the prevalence of exposure to Abilify in each group. Exposure to Abilify was defined for the cases as one prescription for Abilify having been filled during the year before the pathological gambling or impulse control disorder diagnosis, and in corresponding calendar time for the controls. The Study found that individuals exposed to Abilify had a statistically significant higher incidence of pathological gambling and impulse control disorder diagnoses than did unexposed individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Etminan Study described the existence and strength of the association found between Abilify, pathological gambling, and impulse control disorder in the random sample from the LifeLink database in terms of \"rate ratios,\" also known as relative risk. Relative risk is simply a comparison of the incidence of a disease in exposed individuals with its incidence in unexposed individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref. Man. at 566. A relative risk of 1.0 means there is no difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups; in other words, there is no association between exposure to the drug and the disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref. Man. at 567;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11549647\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/1300/#p1312\">\n    184 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1315 n.16. A relative risk above 1.0 indicates an\n   increased risk in the exposed group,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ref. Man. at 567, and \"[r]isks greater than 2.0 permit an inference that the [disease] was more likely than not caused by the [drug],\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11549647\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/1300/#p1312\">\n    184 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1315 n.16. Relative risk estimates are often accompanied by a \"confidence interval,\" which provides, in essence, a margin of error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref. Man. 579-80. Confidence intervals identify the range of likely values, on either side of the relative risk estimate for a population sample, that would be expected to encompass the results a specified percentage of the time (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 95%) if random samples were repeatedly drawn from the same population as the subject study.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 580. Importantly, if the confidence interval contains the value 1.0 or less, then the results of the study are not considered statistically significant. On the other hand, if the lower bound of the confidence interval exceeds 1.0, then the results are considered statistically significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In this case, the Etminan Study reported a relative risk of 5.23 for pathological gambling in individuals exposed to Abilify as compared to unexposed individuals, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.78-15.38.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Etminan Study, ECF No. 428-13 at 3. This means that the Study predicted that the increased risk of pathological gambling for Abilify patients within any given sample of the entire LifeLink database would likely fall anywhere between 1.78-15.38. Because the lower bound of the confidence interval (1.78) exceeds 1.0, this is statistically significant. The Study also reported a relative risk of 7.71 for impulse control disorder, with a 95% confidence interval of 5.81 and 10.34. This too is statistically significant. Finally, an analysis restricted to patients with bipolar disorder alone yielded a relative risk of 3.38 for pathological gambling in Abilify patients, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.68-8.48, which is also statistically significant. Defendants do not dispute the accuracy of the Etminan Study's relative risk and confidence interval calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs' biostatistician, Dr. David Madigan, analyzed the Etminan Study and found it to be \"methodologically sound\" with a \"highly statistically significant result.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 30.

By Dr. Madigan's calculation, the\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   -value for pathological gambling in the Etminan Study is .002, which is well below the traditional threshold for statistical significance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 25. According to Dr. Madigan, this\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   -value indicates that the probability of the Etminan Study producing a 5.23-fold increased risk of pathological gambling by chance alone is one in 500.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 49.

In particular, with respect to the potential effect of bias on the Study's results, Dr. Madigan explained that the relative risk calculations are simply too \"substantial\" and \"robust\" to be explained by investigator bias.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 70. In short, Dr. Madigan opines that a case-control study is \"highly unlikely\" to yield increased risk estimates like those found in the Etminan Study \"in the absence of a true\" association.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Supp., ECF No. 427-1 at 91. In his view, the FDA called for a case-control study \"clarify[ing]\" the association between Abilify and impulse control disorders, and the Etminan Study reliably did exactly that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants argue that numerous methodological flaws render the Etminan Study unreliable under Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , including a deficient study design, failure to account for the risk of confounders, and the presence of bias. They also challenge Dr. Madigan's defense of the Etminan Study, which they claim is untenable in light of his prior published research criticizing both healthcare database research and the use of\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   -values as a measure of statistical significance.

This criticism has little, if any, merit. The use of health insurance claims databases for epidemiologic research is well-supported by the medical literature, which is an important consideration under\n   <em>\n    Daubert.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 589-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, large databases are particularly advantageous for studying relatively rare adverse effects of a drug, as in this case, or where multiple possible adverse effects are of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 325, DX-122 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   With that said, large database research is not without limitations, one of which is the unavailability of medical records to confirm the accuracy of the data and to provide potentially significant clinical information not reported in the database.

In other words, the DSM-5 acknowledges the condition of iatrogenic gambling and explains that the diagnostic criteria for idiopathic gambling do not apply to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208149\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/385/#p400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, the ICD-9-CM definition of \"pathological gambling\" does not appear to be limited, either explicitly or implicitly, to idiopathic gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICD-9-CM, PX-063 at 1. By its terms, the ICD-9-CM diagnostic code encompasses\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \"preoccupation with gambling and the excitement that gambling with increased risk provides,\" even where \"it may lead [the patient] to lie, steal, or lose a significant relationship, job, or educational opportunity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208149\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/385/#p400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There simply is no carve out for, or exclusion of, iatrogenic gambling (medication-induced) from the ICD-9-CM definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208149\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/385/#p400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, it would be reasonable for a scientist to conclude that \"pathological gambling\" under the ICD-9-CM includes iatrogenic gambling. In turn, the Etminan Study's use of that same ICD-9-CM code to identify cases of pathological gambling in the LifeLink database is likewise reasonable. This challenge does not undermine the reliability or admissibility of the Etminan Study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants' last argument is that the Etminan Study is unreliable because the time between exposure to Abilify and the diagnoses of pathological gambling in the random sample taken from the LifeLink database was too short to be compatible with a cause-effect relationship. This argument is based on the Study's finding that five patients were exposed to Abilify in the year preceding their diagnoses of pathological gambling, with an average, or mean, time to diagnosis of 20 days and a standard deviation of 17.4 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Etminan Study, ECF No. 428-13 at 3.

Man. at 239. None of the five actual time-to-diagnosis periods was individually reported\n   in the Study.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208149\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/385/#p400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Defendants claim that the standard deviation in the Study indicates that at least one of the five patients was diagnosed with pathological gambling within three days of his exposure to Abilify, which even Dr. Etminan, at his deposition, agreed was \"unlikely.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Etminan Tr., ECF No. 427-3 at 80;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Madigan Motion, ECF No. 427-20 at 9. Defendants insist that, under the DSM-5 criteria, gambling disorder \"takes up to twelve months to develop into a disease,\" so if the five diagnoses in the Etminan Study followed this criterion, the patients' pathological gambling necessarily would have preceded their exposure to Abilify. DSJ, ECF No. 428-26 at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This criticism is not fatal to the Study's reliability under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   for several reasons. First, the standard deviation of 17.4 days does not dictate a conclusion that there must have been a three-day period between exposure and diagnosis for at least one of the five patients in the random sample analyzed in the Study. At his deposition, Dr. Etminan, the Study's lead author, testified that while the time-to-diagnosis for one of the patients could have been \"a matter of days,\" he could \"not [be] sure exactly what\" the actual times-to-diagnosis were for any of the five patients \"without having the data\" from the LifeLink database to review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See Etminan\n   </em>\n   Dep., ECF No. 457-7 at 42.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Madigan, who is the only statistics expert in this case, calculated at least two possible distributions of the five individual time-to-diagnosis periods, given the mean time of 20 days and the standard deviation of 17.4 days: (1) a distribution of 3, 41, 13, 37, and 8 days, respectively; or (2) a distribution of 50, 16, 8, 8, and 17 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan PPT, PX-051 at 22;\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 24. According to Dr. Madigan, there is no way to determine, from the information reported in the Study, which of these two possible distributions represents the actual distribution of time-to-diagnosis periods for the five patients found to have been exposed to Abilify within the year preceding their diagnosis of pathological gambling in the LifeLink database.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 62-63. None of Defendants' experts disputed Dr. Madigan's calculations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the evidence shows that the minimum\n   time-to-diagnosis in the Etminan Study could have been as few as three, or as many as eight, days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, the possibility of pathological gambling or other impulse control symptoms developing within either three or eight days of exposure to Abilify is consistent with the scientific literature. Multiple published case reports describe a \"rapid onset\" of such symptoms following exposure to Abilify, with patients' times-to-onset ranging from a few days to a week after starting treatment with the drug.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glenmullen Tr., ECF No. 596-2 at 64. While this anecdotal evidence obviously cannot establish the times-to-onset or diagnosis for the patients in the Etminan Study, it does reliably indicate that a three-or eight-day time-to-onset and diagnosis is not wholly \"implausible.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weed Tr., ECF No. 596-8 at 65. Instead, the Court agrees with Dr. Glenmullen that a patient with \"a very sudden onset\" of \"distressing\" impulse control problems after starting \"a new [and] powerful antipsychotic drug\" like Abilify could reasonably be expected to call his doctor's office and get a diagnosis of pathological gambling or impulse control disorder\"within days or a week\" of beginning treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glenmullen Tr., ECF No. 596-2 at 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, as the Court has already found, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder do not govern the diagnosis of iatrogenic (medication-induced) gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSM-5, ECF No. 428-3 at 68. Indeed, the DSM-5 clearly contemplates that \"patients taking dopaminergic medications\" may \"experience urges to gamble\" that \"dissipate when [the] medications are reduced in dosage or ceased.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208149\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/385/#p400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that scenario, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria-including the requirement that an individual have exhibited at least four \"problematic gambling behavior[s]\" in a 12-month period-do not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208149\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/385/#p400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 428-3\n   at 64, 68. On the other hand, the ICD-9-CM imposes no minimum duration requirements for an individual's \"preoccupation with gambling\" to qualify as \"pathological gambling.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICD-9-CM, PX-063 at 1. Because the LifeLink database classifies medical diagnoses according to ICD-9-CM codes, and not the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, there is no basis for assuming from the medical billing codes used that the pathological gambling behaviors must, or even may, have preceded the patients' exposure to Abilify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Confounders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants also argue that the Etminan Study is unreliable for its failure to control for potential confounders,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , known risk factors for pathological gambling, specifically, depressive disorders, anxiety disorder, and personality disorders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSJ, ECF No. 428-26 at 29. According to Defendants, this flaw is \"independently fatal\" to the Etminan Study because it means that the pathological gambling diagnoses in the LifeLink database could be attributable to one or more of these underlying conditions rather than Abilify, particularly since they are in many cases the precise medical conditions for which Abilify is prescribed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSJ Reply, ECF No. 484 at 10-11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants insist that because the Etminan Study failed to take into account the relationship between pathological gambling and these medical conditions, it cannot reliably establish the existence of an association between pathological gambling and Abilify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   When assessing the reliability of an epidemiological study, a court must consider whether the study adequately accounted for confounding factors, or confounders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref.

Man. at 591-93. Importantly for purposes of this case, a variable only has the potential to act as a confounder where it is independently related both to exposure and to the disease of interest; that is, where the variable itself is both associated with exposure to the drug and a causal risk factor for the disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 591;\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deutsch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802660\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/420/#p432\">\n    768 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   432 ; Noel S.

For this reason, when confounders can be identified, they should be accounted for.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802660\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/420/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, failure to control for every conceivable potential confounder does not necessarily render the results of an epidemiological study unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See id.; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bazemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208149\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/385/#p400\">\n    478 U.S. at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208149\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/385/#p400\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Normally, failure to include variables will affect [a statistical analysis'] probativeness, not its admissibility.\").

First, Abilify is not indicated for treatment of anxiety or personality disorders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Product Label, ECF No. 428-1 at 2, 4. Nothing in the record as it currently stands suggests that Abilify is even prescribed off-label for these two categories of psychiatric conditions. This is significant because, for epidemiological purposes, no matter how strongly a variable is related to the disease in question, if it is not\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   related in some way to drug exposure, it cannot be a true confounder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref.

Here, there is no evidence that anxiety and personality disorders are related in any way to Abilify exposure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, no matter how strongly those disorders may be related to pathological gambling, neither is a true confounder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, the medical literature is inconclusive on the question of whether depressive, anxiety and personality disorders are causal risk factors for pathological gambling. It is true that the DSM-5 provides that \"[i]ndividuals with gambling disorder have high rates of comorbidity with\" these categories of psychiatric conditions. Am. Psychiatric Ass'n, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS 589 (5th ed. 2013) (\"DSM-5\"), ECF No. 428-3 at 68. It also is true that at least two cross-sectional studies have confirmed the prevalence of problem gambling behavior in the major depression and mood disorder populations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lena C.

In any event, \"it is not possible to establish the temporal relation between exposure and disease-that is, that the exposure preceded the disease, which would be necessary for drawing any causal inference\"-by reference to a cross-sectional study. Ref. Man. at 560-61. In sum, science has not yet determined with any reliability the precise nature of the relationship, if any, between pathological gambling and depressive, anxiety, and personality disorders. The Court may not simply ignore this gap in scientific understanding by excluding the Etminan Study for failing to consider these psychiatric conditions as causal risk factors for pathological gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hendrix II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692857\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/1183/#p1193\">\n    609 F.3d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]ourts may only admit the state of science as it is.\");\n   <em>\n    Rider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414989\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1194/#p1199\">\n    295 F.3d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Law lags science; it does not lead it.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, other evidence in the record reliably supports the conclusion that depressive, anxiety, and personality disorders did not confound the results of the Etminan Study.

The results of these disproportionality analyses-one by the FDA,\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   -certainly are not conclusive evidence that Abilify causes pathological gambling.

Bias\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendants further argue that the Etminan Study is unreliable because its results were compromised by bias. More specifically, they first argue that through his actions, Dr. Etminan created a conflict of interest that affects the integrity of the Study's findings. This argument is based on the fact that Dr. Etminan contacted Plaintiffs' counsel shortly after learning about this litigation on AboutLawsuits.com, before he developed the research protocol for the Study. The implication, of course, is that Dr. Etminan was predisposed towards results that would support Plaintiffs' theory of general causation in this case. The problem with Defendants' position is that the uncontroverted record evidence with respect to this communication does not demonstrate impropriety by either Dr. Etminan or Plaintiffs' counsel. According to Dr. Etminan, the conversation lasted only two minutes, during which he advised Plaintiffs' counsel that he intended to conduct a study on Abilify, gambling, and impulse control disorders, but he did not discuss any specifics about how the study would be designed or what its results might be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Etminan Dep., ECF No. 457-7 at 27-30. Plaintiffs' counsel immediately ended the conversation and refrained from any further discussions about the study with Dr. Etminan until after it was published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs did not fund the Etminan Study and, although they later retained Dr. Etminan as a consultant in this case, the record is devoid of any evidence that they shaped or directed Dr. Etminan's research.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   While contacting Plaintiffs' counsel\n   may have been \"a strange thing to do,\" without more, it does not invalidate \"the whole exercise, the protocol, and [ ] the study.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 69.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Importantly, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that any methodological aspect of the Etminan Study or its results was tainted by Dr. Etminan's alleged bias. Although the Etminan Study has its limitations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Prod. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20230818\">\n    1997 WL 230818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. May 5, 1997) (\"[T]here is no such thing as a perfect epidemiological study.\"), none of Defendants' experts raised concerns about its impartiality. Not surprisingly, neither did any of Plaintiffs' experts, including Dr. Madigan, who acknowledged the ethical dictate that science be kept separate from economic influence, but found no indication of bias in the Etminan Study.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 69. Finally, as aptly observed by Dr. Madigan, to the extent that Dr. Etminan may have been biased, that bias was mitigated by the participation of his co-author, Dr. Ric M. Procyshyn, who at the time had an ongoing relationship with Defendant Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, Defendants' argument that Dr. Etminan's alleged bias in favor of Plaintiffs renders the Etminan Study unreliable is not supported by the record. Concerns about litigation bias go to the Study's weight, not its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Lab. Corp. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148950\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/1322/#p1334\">\n    760 F.3d 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1334 (11th Cir. 2014) (holding that bias in an expert witness's testimony generally goes to its weight, not its admissibility).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants next argue that the Etminan Study is unreliable due to its failure to control for detection bias, also called reporting bias. In this context, detection bias refers to the possibility that pathological gambling and impulse control disorders were more likely to be detected and diagnosed in the exposed group (individuals taking Abilify ) than in the unexposed group, due to increased medical awareness of the particular problems allegedly associated with Abilify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zoloft I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4295395\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/26/449/#p464\">\n    26 F.Supp.3d at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Detection bias means that an abnormality ... is more likely to be detected in the exposure group, often due to increased medical vigilance of exposed [individuals].\"). Heightened public awareness, the argument necessarily goes, would have led doctors to probe for signs of pathological gambling and impulse control disorders in individuals from the exposed group, but to search less vigilantly for those signs in unexposed individuals, thereby increasing the likelihood of diagnoses in the former and decreasing the relative proportion of diagnoses in the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The only evidence offered by Defendants to demonstrate the potential for detection bias in this case is a single \"suspect adverse reaction report\" by a patient who only reported having experienced an \"urge to gamble\" when he took Abilify after seeing an advertisement in 2014, which said that Abilify\"causes compulsive gambling and was a bad drug.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 460-13 at 1. A single adverse reaction report is insufficient to discredit the Etminan Study as a whole. As the Court has already noted, adverse event reports are \"one of the least reliable sources\" of scientific information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176778\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/1233/#p1242\">\n    401 F.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, this particular adverse reaction report is distinguishable from the data analyzed in the Etminan Study in that it reflects an apparent layperson's self-assessment of his own symptoms, rather than a physician's diagnosis of pathological gambling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that a single patient may have been prompted, by an advertisement, to attribute his gambling \"urge\" to Abilify is not evidence that the gambling disorder diagnoses in the Etminan Study were prompted by publicity or are medically incorrect. In fact, during the time period analyzed by the Etminan Study, there was very little public information available about a possible link between Abilify and pathological gambling. Even according to Defendants' epidemiology expert, Dr. Douglas Weed, the first case reports raising the issue were not published in the medical literature until 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weed Supp., 419-23 at 13-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although several more case reports were published in 2011 and 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176778\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/1233/#p1242\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and at least one patient saw an advertisement in 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 460-13, most of the publicity around the issue did not begin until well after the time period covered by the Etminan Study.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these circumstances, the Court agrees with Dr. Madigan that it is \"hard ... to imagine\" how publicity-related detection bias \"could exert a lot of influence\" on the diagnoses compiled by the Etminan Study,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr. at 66, especially to a degree that necessitates exclusion of the Study under\n   <em>\n    Daubert.\n   </em>\n   As with Defendants' litigation bias concerns, this publicity-related detection bias challenge implicates the weight, not admissibility, of the Etminan Study.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148950\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/1322/#p1334\">\n    760 F.3d at 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

The Court disagrees because Dr. Madigan's opinion in this case is not inconsistent with his prior publications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   From 2009 to 2013, Dr. Madigan served as principal investigator for the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (\"OMOP\"), a public-private partnership between the FDA, academia, and the pharmaceutical industry that was established, in part, to empirically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of observational healthcare database studies of the effects of medical products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Madigan testified that the focus of his research with the OMOP was large-scale automated observational health database research, which involves the use of high volume, generic data mining techniques to uncover hidden relationships of potential clinical significance to drug safety. Madigan Dep., ECF No. 427-1 at 106, 133-35; Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 43-44. His work with the OMOP culminated in the publication of a series of peer-reviewed, scientific articles criticizing generic automated database analysis for its potential for bias, confounding, and inaccurate results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Dr. Madigan's published criticisms of generic automated database research do not contradict his endorsement of the Etminan Study because, in short, the Etminan Study is not the product of generic automated database research. Rather, it was custom-designed to analyze a very specific clinical question-whether Abilify is associated with pathological gambling and other impulse control disorders-and narrowly tailored to account for a number of factors unique to the LifeLink database and to the Abilify patient population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 44-45, 88-89; Madigan Dep., ECF No. 427-21 at 40. This customized design and implementation distinguishes the Etminan Study from the generic automated studies criticized by Dr. Madigan and the OMOP. Indeed, several of Dr. Madigan's publications actually recommend such \"customizing [of] analyses to databases\" and \"thoughtful and careful study design\" as means of improving the accuracy and performance of generic automated database research.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan 2014, DX-117 at 27, 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Madigan 2013b, ECF No. 427-8 (\"It is conceivable that customizing the analytical approach to [drug-outcome] pairs could lead to greater consistency across databases.\"). The Etminan Study also implements many of the specific design-level and analytical strategies that Dr. Madigan and the OMOP suggest for reducing potential errors in generic automated database research, including careful matching of cases and controls, adjusting and controlling for potential confounders, and the use of sensitivity analyses to assess the potential consequences of unknown confounders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan 2014, DX-117 at 15-17. None of Defendants' experts disputed Dr. Madigan's explanation of the distinctions between customized database research, like the Etminan Study, and generic database research, like the studies criticized by Dr. Madigan. To the contrary, on this record, Dr. Madigan's opinion with respect to the Etminan Study is consistent with his prior\n   published literature and does not \"violate[ ] his own standard of proper methodology.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rezulin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274750\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/531/#p563\">\n    309 F.Supp.2d at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Dr. Madigan's failure to calculate a calibrated\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   -value was not, as Defendants suggest, a failure to \"employ in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of\" an expert statistician in the field.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kumho Tire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p141\">\n    526 U.S. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p141\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the absence of such evidence is not fatal to the experts' general causation opinions, it does weaken the force and reliability of their conclusions as to dose-response. Nonetheless, the Court agrees with the FDA that a number of the published case studies-those describing positive dechallenge and rechallenge events, in particular-indicate a \"temporal relationship between the initiation of [Abilify ] treatment and the onset of\" impulse control problems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA Pharm.

Background Risk\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Two of Plaintiffs' experts, Drs. Glenmullen and Hollander, provide the background risk or prevalence of various\n   impulse control disorders, including compulsive gambling, in the general population, as reflected in the scientific literature. More specifically, Dr. Glenmullen, relying on the DSM-5, stated that the past-year prevalence rate of gambling disorder is approximately 0.2%-0.3% in the general population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glenmullen Rep., ECF No. 424-1 at 59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the DSM-5, the lifetime prevalence rate of gambling disorder in the general population is about 0.4%-1.0%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSM-5, ECF No. 428-3 at 66. Dr. Hollander referenced several scientific studies identifying the background risks for compulsive shopping (6%-7%) and hypersexuality (3%-6%) in the general population, and for compulsive eating (1.6%) in the general adolescent population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Rep., ECF No. 459-1 at 8-9. The Court finds that these figures constitute reliable evidence of background risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The fact that Plaintiffs' experts do not offer a more expansive analysis of background risk in this case does not present a \"serious methodological deficiency\" or \"substantial weakness\" in their general causation opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201160\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/1296/#p1303\">\n    766 F.3d at 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the FDA, at least as recently as March 2016, there had been \"no large studies of the life-time prevalence of most [impulse control disorders ] in the general population, except pathological gambling.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA Pharm. Vigil., ECF No. 428-11 at 7. Thus, this is not a case where Plaintiffs' experts simply ignored the available evidence regarding the background risk of various impulse control disorders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kilpatrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702918\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1329/#p1336\">\n    613 F.3d at 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that an expert who \"ignore[s]\" available evidence about background risk \"place[s] the reliability of [his] conclusions in ... doubt\").

Biological Plausibility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Plaintiffs' experts share the opinion that the biological mechanism by which Abilify can cause pathological gambling and impulse control disorders is its effect on dopamine neurotransmission in the brain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Antoine Bechara provides the most thorough analysis of the medical literature offered in support of this position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Rep., ECF No. 423-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court first briefly summarizes Dr. Bechara's biological plausibility opinion and then considers Defendants' reliability challenges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   According to Dr. Bechara, Abilify binds to over 90% of postsynaptic D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors in the nucleus accumbens and acts as a functional antagonist, occupying the D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors and preventing dopamine molecules from attaching and activating them, thereby blocking dopamine neurotransmission at those sites. The brain compensates for the resultant decrease in dopaminergic activity by increasing, or upregulating, the number of dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens; and also by increasing the sensitivity of those receptors, so that when activated by dopamine they produce greater, more \"potentiated\" physiological responses than would occur naturally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Tr., ECF No. 596-3 at 100-101.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   At the same time, the \"displaced\" dopamine molecules, unable to bind to D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors, diffuse towards the other available receptors in the nucleus accumbens, most of which are D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors. Abilify occupies and \"strongly stimulates\" about 30% of these D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors, producing in them between 50% and 100% of the physiological response that dopamine naturally produces.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Rep., ECF No. 423-1 at 7. The remaining D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors, which are upregulating and hypersensitive, bind with the endogenous dopamine to produce \"supercharge[d]\" reward-seeking behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Tr., ECF No. 596-3 at 98. Finally, Dr. Bechara also opines that Abilify's functional antagonism at D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors may disrupt the brain's ability to process the consequences of negative behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendants challenge the reliability of Plaintiffs' experts' proposed mechanism of action on the ground that it lacks evidentiary support and instead is premised on \"pure speculation.\" Def.

Displacement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants argue that there is no scientific support for the proposition that endogenous dopamine is \"displaced\" when Abilify occupies a majority of D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors in the nucleus accumbens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. The Court disagrees. Even Defendants' own psychopharmacology expert, Dr. Pierre Blier, agrees that Abilify displaces dopamine at D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blier Dep., ECF No. 455-2 at 241, 248, 258-59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover,\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   . The fact of displacement also appears to be supported by the scientific literature, which indicates that, at therapeutic doses, Abilify occupies and blocks over 90% of postsynaptic D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors in the nucleus accumbens, leaving only \"10% or fewer D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors [ ] available for endogenous dopamine to bind\" with.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Takashi Hamamura &amp; Toshiki Harada,\n   <em>\n    Unique Pharmacological Profile of Aripiprazole as the Phasic Component Buster\n   </em>\n   , 191 PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY 741, 742 (2007) (\"Hamamura 2007\"), PX-020 at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given this evidence, the \"displacement\" premise of Plaintiffs' experts' opinions cannot be considered \"pure speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Again, the Court disagrees. As explained in Maeda 2014, which is a peer-reviewed, published article relied on by Dr. Blier,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Blier Rep., ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   No. 455-1 at 15-16, the only available method for directly measuring human receptor occupancy is PET imaging,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maeda 2014 at 600, DX-062 at 12.

This evidence supports a plausible conclusion that Abilify binds to D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors (affinity), and thereby occupies them, with greater frequency and strength than it does to D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors. For this reason, the Court finds Dr. Bechara's opinion that \"Abilify would occupy relatively more D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors\" than D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors supported by reliable scientific evidence in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Rep., ECF No. 423-1 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Dr. Bechara's opinion that \"displaced\" endogenous dopamine diffuses towards, and binds with, other available receptors in the nucleus accumbens, most of which are D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors, is also biologically plausible based on the scientific evidence in this case. It appears to be well-established in the scientific literature that, in humans, D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors predominate in the mesolimbic regions of the brain, including the nucleus accumbens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, only one expert, Dr.\n   Blier, has offered a different opinion. In his expert report, Dr. Blier stated that D\n   <sub>\n    1\n   </sub>\n   , D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   , D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   , and D\n   <sub>\n    4\n   </sub>\n   receptors \"are all expressed in the nucleus accumbens, the first three in high density.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blier Rep., ECF No. 455-1 at 16. Dr. Blier offers a single citation in support of this opinion, a 2003 book by Jack R.

However, there is no corresponding exhibit in the record (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a copy of the relevant chapter or pages) for the Court to compare with Dr. Blier's statement. Given that virtually all of the other scientific literature in this case indicates that the mesolimbic reward pathway is a predominantly D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   -rich environment, Dr. Blier's representation to the contrary must be supported by more than just his\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit.

Dr. Blier testified that displaced endogenous dopamine can diffuse \"everywhere,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Blier Tr., ECF No. 596-8 at 27, including postsynaptic dopamine receptors \"not located in precise apposition to\" the presynaptic, sending neuron,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Blier Rep., ECF No. 455-1 at 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Blier Dep., ECF No. 455-2 at 56-58.

Bechara Motion, ECF No. 423-10 at 18-19, fails because it misrepresents the findings of the \"numerous\"\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   studies that Defendants claim Dr. Bechara ignored. While it is true that there are studies in the medical literature evidencing Abilify's partial agonism at D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors, at least six of those studies report findings related to Abilify's effects at\n   <em>\n    presynaptic\n   </em>\n   D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. In that respect, those six studies do not \"logically advance\" the resolution of questions about Abilify's effects at\n   <em>\n    postsynaptic\n   </em>\n   D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   and D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors. It was not unreliable for Dr. Bechara to discount those six studies in reaching his opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Moreover, according to Dr. Bechara, five studies, including all but one of the studies discussed above involving presynaptic D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors, also report\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   findings based on tissue cultures that were \"artificially manipulated\" by researchers to increase the number of D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors, called a\n   receptor reserve, far beyond the amount present in the human brain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Tr., ECF No. 596-3 at 90-92; Bechara Dep., ECF No. 423-1 at 290-96.\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Bechara testified that such artificially manipulated tissues \"do not reflect what actually happens in a normal brain,\" therefore the findings about a drug's effects on those tissues cannot be reliably extrapolated to predict the drug's effect in humans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Tr., 596-3 at 90-92; Bechara Dep., ECF No. 423-1 at 290-96. Defendants essentially concede this point, responding only that \"most\" of the\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   studies of postsynaptic D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors also involve artificially high receptor density. This response is unpersuasive. None of Defendants' experts criticized the\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   data involving D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marmo v. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789558\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/457/748/#p759\">\n    457 F.3d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759 (8th Cir. 2006) (\"The function of rebuttal testimony is to explain, repel, counteract or disprove evidence of the adverse party.\"). Moreover, Defendants do not identify which of the\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   studies of D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors is allegedly tainted by artificial manipulation. On this record, the Court finds that it was entirely reliable for Dr. Bechara to rely on\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   studies involving D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors and to exclude from consideration the studies involving artificially high D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptor reserves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   There are two other scientific articles containing data points that Defendants claim Dr. Bechara ignored. The first, Lawler 1999, DX-051, Dr. Bechara clearly cites in his expert report,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bechara Rep., ECF No. 423-1 at 12. Moreover, at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, Dr. Bechara referenced the Lawler article as part of the basis for his opinion that Abilify exerts very low partial agonist to antagonistic action at postsynaptic D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Tr., ECF No. 596-3 at 92. The second article, Maeda 2014, DX-062, described an\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   finding that Abilify exhibited 61% intrinsic activity at postsynaptic D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors. At the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, Dr. Bechara acknowledged that he did not rely on or cite the Maeda article as part of his opinion in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Tr., ECF No. 596-3 at 126. However, there is no evidence that Dr. Bechara knew of and willfully excluded the Maeda article from his analysis. There also is no evidence that his search of the scientific literature was in any other way infirm. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Dr. Bechara's failure to cite a single article out of the vast body of scientific literature connected with this case cannot render his entire analysis and opinion unreliable. This issue may be fodder for vigorous cross-examination, but it is not grounds for exclusion of Dr. Bechara's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In sum, the Court finds there is a methodologically sound basis for Dr. Bechara's conclusion that Abilify acts with greater intrinsic activity at D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors than it does at postsynaptic D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors. Dr. Bechara did not simply ignore the medical science that did not support his opinion. Instead, he analyzed all of the available medical literature and explained how and why certain studies did not alter\n   or undermine his opinion regarding Abilify's functional antagonism at postsynaptic D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors and partial agonism at D\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   receptors. Defendants' criticisms go to the credibility, and thus the weight, of Dr. Bechara's opinion, not its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Negative Reward Prediction Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Defendants also argue there is insufficient evidentiary support for Dr. Bechara's opinion that Abilify impairs negative reward prediction error, also called reversal learning. On this issue, the Court agrees. Reward prediction error learning refers to the process by which the brain learns from associations between actions and consequences. The mesolimbic dopamine system plays a central role in such reward-motivated behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roy A. Wise,\n   <em>\n    Brain Reward Circuitry: Insights from Unsensed Incentives\n   </em>\n   , 36 NEURON 229, 234 (2002) (\"Wise 2002\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   In brief, mesolimbic dopamine neurons have been shown to fire in two modes, tonic and phasic, which are thought to modulate two distinct aspects of human behavior. The tonic firing mode involves a slow and steady release of dopamine that maintains the baseline levels necessary for proper brain function. Tonically fired dopamine binds with and activates autoreceptors on presynaptic neurons, which regulate dopamine synthesis and release; it cannot activate or produce a physiological response in postsynaptic receptors. In phasic mode, dopamine neurons sharply increase or decrease their firing rate based on events or stimuli with motivational significance. For example, where an action yields more reward than predicted (positive prediction error), the neurons fire in short, high frequency bursts, rapidly increasing the concentration of synaptic dopamine. The release of dopamine and accompanying positive feelings motivate repetition of the rewarding activity. In contrast, where a reward is worse than predicted (negative prediction error), phasic firing activity drops, sharply decreasing synaptic dopamine concentrations. This \"dip\" in dopamine levels and the accompanying negative feelings motivate avoidance of the aversive activity. In either scenario, learning occurs and behavior changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Dr. Bechara opines that Abilify may cause pathological gambling and impulse control disorders by preventing the dopamine \"dip\" that is critical for \"teach[ing]\" an individual to avoid activities with negative consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bechara Rep., ECF No. 423-1 at 11. According to Dr. Bechara, Abilify's functional antagonism at 90% of D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors signals a drop in baseline dopamine concentration, which triggers increased tonic transmission of dopamine. The excess tonically fired dopamine accumulates in the synapses and offsets, or blocks the effects of, the phasic dopamine dips associated with negative prediction errors. Without the phasic dips, no negative dopaminergic signal is sent when an activity should be stopped and avoided. The behavioral effect is an increase in risky, reward-directed activities, such as pathological gambling and other impulse control disorders, despite the potential for and occurrence of negative consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As support for his negative reward prediction error opinion, Dr. Bechara relies heavily on the findings of a 2006 study investigating reward and punishment processing in Parkinson's disease patients taking one or more dopamine replacement medications, none of which was Abilify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roshan Cools\n   <em>\n    et al., Reversal Learning in Parkinson's Disease Depends on Medication Status and Outcome Valence\n   </em>\n   , 44 NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA 1663 (2006) (\"Cools Study\"), DX-143. The Cools Study found that patients on dopamine replacement medications exhibited \"significantly impaired\" capacity to process and learn from unexpected negative outcomes (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , punishment) relative to healthy controls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1670, DX-143 at 8. Consistent with theoretical models proposed in earlier medical literature, the Cools Study attributed the patients' negative reward prediction errors to artificially high tonic dopamine levels induced by the dopamine replacement medications, which the authors hypothesized as having functionally eliminated the effectiveness of phasic dopamine dips.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1669, DX-143 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Court finds that the Cools Study cannot reliably establish biological plausibility in this case because it involved dopamine replacement medications that either directly increase dopamine levels in the brain (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Levodopa ) or directly stimulate dopamine receptors, including D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors, by mimicking the activity of endogenous dopamine (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , full agonists like Mirapex). None of the drugs in the Cools Study were functional antagonists at D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors like Abilify, blocking dopamine neurotransmission at those sites. Importantly, none of Plaintiffs' experts explained why the Cools Study's findings as to the behavioral effects of stimulating D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors through dopamine replacement therapy can be extrapolated to reliably predict the behavioral effects of a D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptor antagonist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176778\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/1233/#p1242\">\n    401 F.3d at 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (extrapolation between drugs permissible only with reliable evidence establishing validity of the analogy). The Court recognizes that both categories of drugs appear to enhance tonic transmission of dopamine to some degree. But the extent to which Abilify actually does so-that is, whether its antagonism at D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptors increases tonic dopamine concentrations to a level that could trigger negative reward prediction errors-is far from clear based on the record as it currently stands. At most, the record reflects that, with Abilify, phasic dopaminergic transmission (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , bursts and dips associated with motivational stimuli) is \"relatively more suppressed than\" tonic transmission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hamamura 2007, PX-020 at 2. Without more, this evidence cannot bridge the gap between D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   antagonism and the \"excessive [tonic dopamine ] levels\" thought to have been produced by the dopamine replacement therapies in the Cools Study.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cools 2006 at 1669, DX-143 at 7. Therefore, the Cools Study must be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Additionally, a 2015 study of reversal learning in individuals taking the D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptor antagonist Sulpiride, which was cited by Dr. Hollander, also presents an extrapolation problem, although it is a closer call.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L. Janssen\n   <em>\n    et al., Abnormal Modulation of Reward Versus Punishment Learning by a Dopamine D2-Receptor Antagonist in Pathological Gamblers\n   </em>\n   , 232 PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY 3345 (2015) (\"Janssen Study\"), DX-189. The Janssen Study found that administration of the drug Sulpiride impaired reversal learning in healthy controls, but did not appear to alter reversal learning in pathological gamblers. The Study's authors also described the \"seemingly paradoxical\" state of the scientific literature with respect to a relationship between D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptor antagonism and reward prediction error learning: some studies report that D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptor antagonists impaired reward prediction error learning, while other studies report that they improved it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3350-51, DX-189 at 6-7. None of the studies investigating D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptor antagonism and reward prediction errors involved Abilify. Moreover, none of Plaintiffs' experts even attempted to explain how or why Abilify is sufficiently similar to Sulpiride in its mechanism of\n   action to warrant an extrapolation. This is significant because within a given class of drugs-such as D\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   receptor antagonists-there may be \"great chemical diversity\" and those \"minor deviations in chemical structure can radically change a particular substance's properties and propensities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414989\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1194/#p1199\">\n    295 F.3d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Glastetter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090072\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/986/#p990\">\n    252 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   990 ). Without evidence establishing the validity of the analogy, an extrapolation between Abilify and Sulpiride is impermissible and the Janssen Study must be excluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176778\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/1233/#p1242\">\n    401 F.3d at 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, because the scientific literature offered in support of Plaintiffs' experts' negative reward prediction error opinion is inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' motions to exclude this aspect of their biological plausibility opinions is due to be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In sum, the Court finds Plaintiffs' experts' biological plausibility opinions that Abilify can cause impulse control problems through its effects on dopamine neurotransmission in the brain to be scientifically reliable, based on current biochemistry and pharmacological knowledge. Each element of this proposed mechanism of action is adequately supported by peer-reviewed, published scientific literature and sound scientific reasoning. Moreover, Plaintiffs' experts' opinions are consistent with the FDA's assessment, based on the scientific literature, that Abilify's partial agonism, upregulation, and sensitization \"could theoretically stimulate dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic pathway, a core component of the brain reward circuitry, providing biological plausibility for treatment-emergent [impulse control disorders ].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA Pharm.

Case Studies and Adverse Event Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Since 2010, there have been hundreds of reports of gambling and/or impulse control disorders in patients treated with Abilify. A number of the reports are published case studies that contain details about dosage, duration of use, concomitant medications, comorbid conditions, and other pertinent clinical information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many\n   more involve adverse event reports submitted to Defendants or the FDA, with varying levels of narrative detail about the patient and the relevant medical circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue, broadly, that case studies and adverse event reports cannot reliably support a general causation opinion in the Eleventh Circuit. This is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Although it is true that case studies and other anecdotal evidence may not, standing alone, support a general causation opinion,\n   <em>\n    Rider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414989\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1194/#p1199\">\n    295 F.3d at 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , these materials may reliably bolster other, more substantial evidence of general causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414989\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1194/#p1199\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, none of Plaintiffs' experts relied solely on case studies and adverse event reports in forming his general causation opinion. Instead, each used those materials to supplement his review of the epidemiological evidence (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Etminan Study), medical literature evidencing a plausible biological mechanism of action, and clinical trial data. This was an entirely reliable use of case studies and adverse event reports under Eleventh Circuit precedent, particularly given the substantial volume of case studies and adverse event reports associating Abilify with pathological gambling and impulse control disorders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414989\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1194/#p1199\">\n    295 F.3d at 1199, 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating in dicta that reliable evidence on causality includes,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"a very large number of case reports\").

Disproportionality Analyses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Several statistical analyses, called disproportionality analyses, have been conducted by the FDA and Defendant Otsuka on the FAERS and VigiBase adverse event reporting databases, comparing the relative frequency of pathological gambling reports among various patient populations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n   Disproportionality analysis is an industry standard pharmacovigilance technique used to detect and evaluate safety signals-that is, the existence of an excess of reported adverse medical events-associated with the use of FDA-regulated medical products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA Pharm.

Guide, DX-299 at 11. An EB05 of 1.0 means there is no association between the drug and reports of the adverse effect. An EB05 greater than 1.0 is indicative of elevated adverse event reporting with the subject drug relative to the reporting rate with comparator drugs. An EB05 greater than 2.0 is the \"widely-accepted threshold\" indicator of a statistically significant association between adverse event reports and a drug, signaling potential safety issues that require further investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., 596-4 at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FDA Pharm Vigil., ECF No. 428-11 at 28.

Antoine Bechara, Ph.D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Dr. Antoine Bechara is a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of Southern California with extensive professional experience in neurobiology and, in particular, the anatomical and neurotransmitter systems involved in human decision-making, behavioral addictions, and gambling. ECF No. 423-1 at 2. He is offered primarily for the purpose of explaining how Abilify can cause Plaintiffs' impulse control disorders. More specifically, Dr. Bechara has offered his opinion that there is a biologically plausible mechanism by which Abilify causes impulsive gambling and other impulse control behaviors,\n   namely, its effect on dopamine neurotransmission in the brain. Defendants challenge Dr. Bechara's testimony on qualification and reliability grounds. The Court has already found that the science on which Dr. Bechara based his biological plausibility opinion is reliable.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II(C). Therefore, the only question that remains to be resolved with respect to Dr. Bechara is whether he is qualified to render an expert opinion in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Defendants argue that Dr. Bechara is not qualified to offer opinions on biological plausibility or general causation because he does not have a medical degree or a degree in pharmacology, has never diagnosed or treated patients with impulse control disorders, and has conducted no independent studies into how Abilify affects brain chemistry. As to biological plausibility, the Court disagrees. First, the record evidence reflects that Dr. Bechara does, in fact, have \"a university degree in pharmacology from the University of Toronto,\" as well as a Ph.D. in neuroscience. ECF No. 423-1 at 80-82. More importantly, Dr. Bechara has over 25 years of clinical experience studying, publishing, and teaching courses on brain function and the effects of drugs-both prescription and street drugs-on human behavior. Of particular relevance to this case is the extensive research Dr. Bechara has conducted on dopamine systems and the neurobiological mechanisms of human decision-making, substance use and abuse, and behavioral and psychiatric disorders, including impulsive gambling and other impulse control disorders. He has written and collaborated on hundreds of peer-reviewed articles, papers, and book chapters on these subjects. Finally, Dr. Bechara developed the Iowa Gambling Task, which is currently used worldwide to detect and measure brain dysfunction and decision-making deficits in numerous clinical populations. As Dr. Bechara has not been offered as a medical doctor, it is irrelevant that he lacks a medical degree. Given the breadth of Dr. Bechara's knowledge and clinical experience in the field of neurobiology, the fact that he had not studied Abilify until he became involved in this case does not disqualify him from reviewing the scientific literature and offering an expert opinion on Abilify's mechanism of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   As to a more comprehensive general causation opinion-that is, an opinion beyond the neurobiological mechanisms by which Abilify can cause pathological gambling or impulse control disorders-the Court agrees with Defendants. Although Dr. Bechara's expert reports frequently frame his conclusions in very broad and definitive language (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , explaining that Abilify\"causes\" impulsive behaviors, rather than how it \"can cause\" the behaviors), most of the scientific support for his positions relates only to biological plausibility. His opinion does not meaningfully depend on any of the three categories of primary evidence considered indispensable in the Eleventh Circuit. He did not perform a Bradford Hill or weight-of-the-evidence analysis of general causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n   These facts do not disqualify him from testifying as an expert regarding Abilify's biological mechanism of action, but they do preclude him from offering a comprehensive general causation opinion. Accordingly, Defendants' Motion to Exclude the General Causation Opinion of Antoine Bechara, ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   No. 423, is granted with respect to medical causation and denied with respect to biological plausibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Dr. Glenmullen offers a general causation opinion that Abilify is capable of causing pathological gambling and impulse control disorders. Dr. Glenmullen supports his opinion with epidemiological evidence (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Etminan Study), medical literature evidencing a plausible mechanism of action, case and adverse event reports, disproportionality analyses and clinical trial data, all of which he analyzed under the Bradford Hill factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants challenge Dr. Glenmullen's testimony on qualification and reliability grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Qualification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Defendants argue that Dr. Glenmullen lacks the requisite expertise to offer opinions related to general causation, such as biological plausibility, epidemiology, toxicology, biostatistics, FDA regulations, and pathological gambling. In essence, Defendants contend that Dr. Glenmullen's medical education, post-graduate training, and professional experience in the field of psychiatry do not translate into qualifications that enable him to testify competently based on the scientific evidence in this case. Defendants read the \"qualification\" prong of Rule 702 too stringently. \"An expert is not necessarily unqualified simply because [his] experience does not precisely match the matter at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Furmanite Am., Inc. v.

Again, Dr. Glenmullen is a medical doctor and board-certified psychiatrist who has spent most of his career training psychiatric residents at Harvard Medical School and treating psychiatric patients in private practice, including \"plenty of\" patients with pathological gambling or impulse control disorders, albeit none with a diagnosis of drug-induced pathological gambling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glenmullen\n   Tr., ECF No. 596-2 at 135-36.

Second, Defendants maintain that Dr. Glenmullen did not reliably apply the Bradford Hill factors in reaching his conclusion on general causation. With one exception, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   With respect to the evidence, the Court has already found that most of the scientific literature on which Dr. Glenmullen relied, including the Etminan Study, is sufficiently reliable to support or bolster his general causation opinion.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II(C). However, one of the studies cited by Dr. Glenmullen, referred to by the parties as the Moore Study, must be excluded as unhelpful in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Thomas J.

Thus, the fact that Dr. Glenmullen found that all of the Bradford Hill factors supported a causal inference does not, standing alone, render his methodology unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Dr. Glenmullen began his Bradford Hill analysis by assessing the \"experiment\" and \"strength of association\" factors, which address whether a body of experimental findings exists showing a statistically significant association between a drug and disease of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref.

Dr. Glenmullen found that the various types of research evidence in this case-including epidemiological evidence, analyses of clinical trial data, and disproportionality analyses of the FDA adverse event reporting database-consistently demonstrate the existence of an association between Abilify and impulsive behaviors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glenmullen Rep., ECF No. 424-1 at 133. Therefore, this is not a case in which there is a completely novel theory of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Regarding temporality and cessation of exposure, Defendants concede that the numerous case studies cited by Dr. Glenmullen \"show ... a temporal relationship\" between the use of Abilify and \"a change in the presence or severity of symptoms\" of gambling and other impulse control disorders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Glenmullen Motion, ECF No. 424-15 at 24. These case studies, as well as the many adverse event reports Dr. Glenmullen describes, are strongly suggestive of a dose-response relationship between Abilify, gambling and other impulse control disorders. Dr. Glenmullen also references\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glenmullen Rep., ECF No. 424-1 at 134.

The Court has already found this reasoning on biological plausibility sufficiently reliable to support a general causation opinion.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II(C). Dr. Glenmullen also stated that the association in this case is specific in that Abilify has been shown to be strongly associated with a single, very specific adverse effect, which manifests as uncontrollable impulsivity to engage in certain, harmful behaviors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref. Man. at 605-06; Glenmullen Rep., ECF No. 424-1 at 134-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   On balance, the Court finds that Dr. Glenmullen's application of the Bradford Hill factors is sufficiently reliable to support a conclusion that the observed association between Abilify and impulsive behaviors, such as pathological gambling, reflects a \"true cause-effect relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref.

Qualification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Defendants argue that Dr. Hollander is not qualified to offer a general causation opinion because he lacks sufficient training and experience in the fields of epidemiology and toxicology. The Court disagrees. As already explained, a witness may be qualified \"by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" to offer an expert opinion that will help the trier of fact understand the evidence or resolve a factual issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Dr. Hollander is a medical doctor and board-certified psychiatrist with over thirty years of experience researching, publishing, and teaching in the fields of psychopharmacology and neuropsychopharmacology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Curriculum Vitae, ECF No. 459-1 at 38-96. This background, with its emphasis on the study of how psychiatric drugs affect brain chemistry and behavior, well equips Dr. Hollander to assist the trier of fact in understanding the biological mechanisms by which Abilify can cause impulsive behaviors. Dr. Hollander also has formal training in epidemiology, has \"worked closely with epidemiologists to publish epidemiologic papers in peer review[ed] journals,\" and as an academic, has taught \"epidemiologic principles as it relates to psychiatry and psychopharmacology\" to \"medical students, residents, and fellows.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Tr., 596-4 at 114-15. This specialized education and experience with epidemiology qualifies Dr. Hollander to give an expert opinion about the epidemiological study in this case (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Etminan Study).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9336063\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/107/#p114\">\n    317 F.3d at 114-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (medical doctor specializing in asbestos-related disease permitted to testify about various epidemiological studies of asbestos exposure).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Notably, Defendants do not dispute that Dr. Hollander is a leading expert on the etiology and treatment of impulse control disorders, including impulsive gambling. Indeed, Dr. Hollander was a member of the research agenda workgroup that, quite literally, wrote the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling and, several years later, he oversaw the reorganization of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder and impulse control disorders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Tr., 596-4 at 113-14. Dr. Hollander also has written and collaborated on hundreds of peer-reviewed articles related to uncontrollable impulsive behaviors, such as pathological gambling, and the brain circuitry underlying these psychiatric problems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Curriculum\n   Vitae, ECF No. 459-1 at 57-96. Finally, Dr. Hollander has treated thousands of patients with impulse control disorders, including hundreds with gambling disorders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 111. Given the breadth of Dr. Hollander's academic and clinical experience in the fields of psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and neuropsychopharmacology, the Court finds him qualified to offer an expert opinion on general causation in this case. Objections to the level of Dr. Hollander's expertise go to the credibility and weight of his opinion, not its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hendrix I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3392127\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/255/568/\">\n    255 F.R.D. at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Reliability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Defendants challenge the reliability of Dr. Hollander's general causation opinion on two primary grounds. First, they argue that the evidence on which Dr. Hollander bases his opinion is unreliable and, thus, insufficient to support his opinion. Second, Defendants maintain that Dr. Hollander did not reliably analyze the evidence in reaching his conclusion on general causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Regarding the evidence, the Court has already found that most of the scientific literature on which Dr. Hollander relied, including the Etminan Study, is sufficiently reliable to support or bolster his general causation opinion.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II(C). Only one of Defendants' specific evidentiary challenges warrants additional comment. As part of the support for his general causation opinion, Dr. Hollander cites a 2016 article from the scientific literature comparing the characteristics of \"possibly iatrogenic\" problem gambling in patients taking Abilify with the characteristics of such gambling in patients taking a full dopamine replacement therapy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marie Grall-Bronnec\n   <em>\n    et al., Pathological Gambling Associated with Aripiprazole or Dopamine Replacement Therapy: Do Patients Share the Same Features? A Review\n   </em>\n   , 36 J. CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY 63, 64 (2016) (\"Grall-Bronnec Article\"), ECF No. 425-4 at 2, 3. Defendants argue that the Grall-Bronnec Article is not a valid epidemiological study and, therefore, cannot support a general causation opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Hollander Motion, ECF No. 425-14 at 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The problem with Defendants' challenge to the Grall-Bronnec Article is that neither Dr. Hollander nor the Article's authors offered the Article as epidemiological evidence of causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Rep., ECF No. 459-1 at 22; Grall-Bronnec Article, ECF No. 425-4 at 7. Defendants' argument appears to be based on a misinterpretation of the authors' use of the term \"cohort\" to describe the \"problem gamblers\" who were interviewed as part of their research. A \"cohort,\" as defined by Merriam-Webster, is \"a group of individuals having a statistical factor (such as age or class membership) in common in a demographic study.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Merriam-Webster\n   Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cohort (retrieved Dec. 3, 2017). In this case, the Grall-Bronnec Article's authors evaluated a group of individuals with the statistical factors of problem gambling and Abilify use in common. Thus, the term \"cohort\" aptly describes the subjects of their work. A \"cohort,\" as used in this context, differs from a \"cohort study,\" which is a type of epidemiological study used to \"measure and compare the incidence of disease\" in certain populations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref. Man. at 557. Neither Dr. Hollander nor the Article's authors characterize the Grall-Bronnec Article as a cohort study, and neither treats the Article's findings as carrying the same weight as epidemiology. Indeed, the Grall-Bronnec Article's authors actually\n   <em>\n    recommend\n   </em>\n   a cohort study as \"a promising way to obtain further evidence\" on causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grall-Bronnec Article, ECF No. 425-4 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   While the Court agrees that the Grall-Bronnec Article is not based on epidemiology, that fact does not preclude Dr. Hollander from relying on the Article as support for his general causation opinion. The Grall-Bronnec Article's authors' objective was to further scientific understanding of the nature of iatrogenic gambling by analyzing the sociodemographic profiles, gambling characteristics, comorbidities, and personality traits of patients whose \"problem gambling\" behaviors \"could possibly result from an adverse drug reaction after the administration of a dopamine medication.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 425-4 at 3-4. The authors identified nine published case reports and conducted in-person clinical evaluations of eight individual patients in treatment for problem gambling, resulting in 17 discrete cases involving the use of Abilify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   From this anecdotal data, the Article's authors concluded it was \"possible\" that the gambling behavior in 16 of the 17 cases was \"actually due to\" Abilify, but cautioned that more research would be necessary before the relationship could be characterized as causal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 7. Notably, Defendants do not challenge the reliability of the authors' methodology, findings, or substantive conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Court finds that the Grall-Bronnec Article presents a reliable and probative analysis of 17 patients' personal experiences while taking Abilify. In particular, the authors' in-depth clinical assessments and comparisons of the eight individual patients facilitate understanding and evaluation of the characteristics associated with \"possibly\" iatrogenic (medication-induced) gambling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the Grall-Bronnec Article is not quantitative research and, as acknowledged by the authors, its results cannot be generalized to definitively establish that Abilify causes compulsive gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The Article essentially is a compilation of thoroughly examined case studies and, therefore, it cannot, standing alone, prove general causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414989\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1194/#p1199\">\n    295 F.3d at 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But it may supplement other, more substantive\n   evidence of causation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414989\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1194/#p1199\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , which is exactly how it was used by Dr. Hollander in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hollander Rep., ECF No. 459-1 at 22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' challenge to the Grall-Bronnec Article affects only its weight, not its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Defendants' last argument for excluding Dr. Hollander is that he did not reliably analyze the scientific evidence in this case. More specifically, Defendants contend that Dr. Hollander improperly relied on the Naranjo Scale and WHO-UMC criteria, which are specific causation methodologies, to reach his general causation opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants also argue, in the alternative, that Dr. Hollander did not reliably apply the Bradford Hill factors. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   With respect to the Naranjo Scale and WHO-UMC criteria, Defendants' argument is misplaced because Dr. Hollander did not employ either technique during his analysis of the scientific evidence in this case. Dr. Hollander testified that he used a weight-of-the-evidence methodology and fully considered all of the Bradford Hill factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 117-19. This is evident from Dr. Hollander's initial expert report, which, in addition to explicitly citing his reliance on the Bradford Hill factors, demonstrates that he applied those factors, in substance, in reaching his general causation opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Rep., ECF No. 459-1. Dr. Hollander only ever mentions the Naranjo Scale or WHO-UMC criteria twice-once to identify them as \"additional method[s]\" for determining whether a drug caused an isolated adverse medical event,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, and once to disclose that the authors of the Grall-Bronnec Article used the Naranjo Scale to assess whether Abilify caused the \"problem gambling\" behaviors exhibited by individual patients in their cohort,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant has not referenced, and the Court has not found, any other instance in which Dr. Hollander further discussed either the Naranjo Scale or the WHO-UMC criteria in his report or in his testimony, much less relied on them in forming his causation opinion. Consequently, this challenge fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Defendants' challenge to the reliability of Dr. Hollander's application of the Bradford Hill factors also fails. As an initial matter, Defendants' argument that Dr. Hollander erred by considering the Bradford Hill factors at all is moot because the prerequisite for applying those factors-that is, an epidemiological study reliably establishing a statistically significant association between the use of a drug and an adverse medical effect-is satisfied by the Etminan Study.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II(C). Thus, the only remaining question is whether Dr. Hollander reliably weighed the Bradford\n   Hill factors as part of his general causation analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Dr. Hollander found a \"very strong\" association between Abilify and impulse control disorders based on his assessments of the Etminan Study, the FDA's 2016 Pharmacovigilance Review and\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Tr., 596-5 at 37. As the Court has already observed, this evidence reliably establishes the existence of a statistically significant association between both (1) Abilify and medical diagnoses of pathological gambling and other impulse control disorders ; and (2) Abilify and adverse event reports of pathological gambling and other impulse control disorders. The Bradford Hill factor of specificity is also met, as the association in this case involves only the very narrow and specific adverse effect of impulse control problems. Dr. Hollander found that the evidence also reliably demonstrates the Bradford Hill factor of consistency, in that the association has been shown to be consistently present in a number of different analyses using different criteria, populations and methods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Rep., 459-1 at 27; Hollander Tr., ECF No. 596-5 at 36. As Dr. Hollander noted, there does not appear to be \"any evidence at all that suggests\" there is\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   association between Abilify and impulsive behaviors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Tr., ECF No. 596-5 at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   As to temporality, Dr. Hollander cites numerous case studies and adverse event reports in which impulsive behaviors emerged only after a patient's exposure to Abilify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Rep., ECF No. 459-1 at 23. These case studies and adverse event reports, although not dispositive of the issue, also are strongly suggestive of a dose-response relationship between Abilify and impulse control disorders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II(C); Hollander Rep., ECF No. 459-1 at 30-31. Moreover, the reports of dechallenge events, in particular, satisfy the Bradford Hill factor of cessation of exposure, as they reliably demonstrate that, with many individual patients, impulse control problems disappeared once Abilify was decreased or discontinued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Much like Dr. Glenmullen, Dr. Hollander ruled out alternative explanations for the association between Abilify and impulsive behaviors by reference to the Etminan Study and the FDA's 2016 Pharmacovigilance Review, as well as to case studies describing dechallenge events. According to Dr. Hollander, the FDA's disproportionality analysis of 11 different atypical antipsychotics is particularly significant because, although those medications all treat the same patient population with the same underlying conditions, only Abilify showed a statistically significant incidence of adverse event reports involving uncontrollable impulsive behaviors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Tr., ECF No. 596-1 at 25-27. Dr. Hollander concluded that if the patients' underlying psychiatric conditions caused the uncontrollable impulses, then all of the atypical antipsychotics should have had statistically significant reporting of impulse control problems.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Hollander observed that the Etminan Study specifically controlled for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance abuse disorder, which ruled out those conditions as possible explanations for the association between Abilify and impulsive behaviors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander\n   Rep., ECF No. 459-1 at 33; Hollander Tr., 596-5 at 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Regarding the Bradford Hill factor of biological plausibility, Dr. Hollander's opinion as to Abilify's mechanism of action \"mirror[s]\" that of Plaintiffs' neurobiology expert, Dr. Antoine Bechara,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Hollander Motion, ECF No. 425-14 at 24, and is reliable for the same reasons,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section II(C). This proposed biological mechanism of action-Abilify's effect on dopamine neurotransmission in the brain-is coherent with existing scientific knowledge about psychopharmacology, neuropsychopharmacology, and the biochemistry of the brain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II(C). Importantly, Dr. Hollander demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the scientific evidence in support of his opinion. In sum, the Court finds that Dr. Hollander reliably considered all of the Bradford Hill factors in reaching his opinion that Abilify can cause impulse control problems. Dr. Hollander also reliably explained his methodology, reasoning and conclusions at length, both in his expert reports and at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hollander Rep., ECF No. 459-1 at 1-36; Hollander Supp., DX-641;\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hollander Tr., ECF Nos. 596-4 at 108-45, 596-5. For these reasons, Dr. Hollander's expert opinion is sufficiently reliable under Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Defendants' Motion to Exclude the General Causation Opinion of Eric Hollander, ECF No. 425-14, is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Russell V. Luepker, M.D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Dr. Russell V. Luepker is a board-certified cardiologist, and a professor of public health and medicine at the University of Minnesota. He holds a master's degree in epidemiology from Harvard University, is certified in epidemiology by the American College of Epidemiology, and served as head of the Division of Epidemiology at the University of Minnesota for over 13 years. Dr. Luepker also has over 40 years of experience researching, publishing, and teaching on the \"design, implementation and interpretation of clinical research\" methods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luepker Rep., ECF No. 462-1 at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no dispute that Dr. Luepker possesses the formal credentials necessary to offer an expert opinion on medical causation. The Court's concern with respect to Dr. Luepker, based on his expert reports and deposition testimony, is that he does not appear to have brought his considerable expertise to bear in his analysis of the evidence in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luepker Rep., ECF No. 462-1 at 2-15; Luepker Supp., ECF No. 426-5 at 2-10; Luepker Dep., ECF No. 462-1 at 97-181.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   This presents a reliability problem under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs have not overcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The \"primary focus\" of Dr. Luepker's \"teaching, research, and clinical career\" has been epidemiology and other types of clinical research in humans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luepker Rep., ECF No. 462-1 at 2. The Court is of the view that this background well equips him to offer unique insights into the methodological soundness of the only epidemiological evidence in this case, the Etminan Study. Yet, Dr. Luepker devotes just a single paragraph of his initial expert report to the Etminan Study, in which he provides only a cursory statement of the Study's findings and nothing more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Almost two pages of his rebuttal report discuss the Etminan Study further, but this too lacks any meaningful analysis\n   beyond general assertions about health insurance claims database research becoming a \"major trend[ ] in epidemiology over the past 10 years.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luepker Supp., ECF No. 426-5 at 3. Dr. Luepker also failed to meaningfully examine the background risk of pathological gambling and other impulse control problems in either the general or psychiatric patient populations. Although Dr. Luepker expressed \"some hesitation\" and \"worry\" about Dr. Potenza's background risk estimates, he did not attempt to independently verify the accuracy of those figures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luepker Dep., ECF No. 462-1 at 118-19. Since the aim of epidemiology is to \"identif[y] agents that are associated with an increased risk of disease,\" the Court would expect a more robust background risk analysis from an expert epidemiologist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref. Man. at 552. Equally, if not more troubling is Dr. Luepker's opinion that a published case series, and even a single case report, are \"definitely\" types of epidemiological studies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luepker Dep., ECF No. 462-1 at 128. Both from a scientific perspective and for legal causation purposes, the distinction between epidemiological evidence and anecdotal evidence (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , case series and case reports) is substantial and consequential. Dr. Luepker, apparently, disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   There are also\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability problems with Dr. Luepker's general causation analysis. First, he employed the WHO-UMC causality criteria, which, as the Court has already discussed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section (II)(D)(1)(c)(ii), is a scientific tool designed to assess specific causation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   WHO-UMC Reference at 1. It \"cannot\" be used to prove general causation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Second, Dr. Luepker's explanation of the biological mechanism by which Abilify can cause impulse control problems is inadequate, likely because much of the subject matter is, by his own admission, beyond the scope of his expertise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, he does not appear to have much more than a superficial understanding of how dopamine functions in the brain. He readily conceded as much at his deposition, testifying that he has only \"some ancillary knowledge\" about dopamine binding, intrinsic activity,\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   toxicological studies of activity at dopamine receptors, and dopaminergic drugs, including Abilify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luepker Dep., ECF No. 462-1 at 114-16. As a result, Dr. Luepker's initial expert report speaks in overly broad and general terms about the complex and nuanced proposed mechanism of action in this case. While the report contains a lengthy appendix of scientific literature that he \"reviewed\" or \"relied upon\" as part of his general causation analysis, at no point does he directly connect these publications to his own biological plausibility analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words,\n   there is very little evidence, based on Dr. Luepker's written submissions and deposition testimony, that these materials meaningfully informed his biological plausibility opinion. This is unacceptable, given Dr. Luepker's unfamiliarity with the biochemistry of the brain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Taken together, these are not insignificant failings and they cannot be cured by the fact that Dr. Luepker's conclusions are consistent with those of Plaintiffs' other experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Polypropylene Carpet Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11532031\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/93/1348/#p1357\">\n    93 F.Supp.2d 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1357 (N.D.

This requires a district court to \"undertake an independent analysis of each step in the logic leading to the expert's conclusions; if the analysis is deemed unreliable at any step, the expert's entire opinion must be excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hendrix I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3392127\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/255/568/\">\n    255 F.R.D. at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons discussed above, the Court has deemed several critical steps in Dr. Luepker's analysis to be unreliable; therefore, his entire opinion must be excluded. This decision was not made lightly. It is obvious from Dr. Luepker's curriculum vitae that he is a prominent, highly respected cardiologist and research scientist, and deservedly so. However, it appears that the general causation questions presented in this case are beyond the ken of his expertise, which hindered his ability to provide a reliable expert opinion. Accordingly, Defendants' Motion to Exclude the General Causation Opinion of Russell Luepker, ECF No. 426-16, is due to be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   <strong>\n    e. David Madigan, Ph.D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Dr. David Madigan is a biostatistician with over thirty years of experience researching, publishing, teaching, and consulting in the fields of statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and pharmacovigilance. He is offered for the purposes of providing: (1) a biostatistical analysis of the scientific evidence in this case; (2) background and contextual information about pharmacovigilance practices, as well as the design and analysis of clinical trials; and (3) a medical causation opinion that Abilify is capable of causing the specific adverse effects of pathological gambling and impulse control disorder. Defendants challenge Dr. Madigan on qualification and reliability grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Qualification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Defendants argue that Dr. Madigan lacks the medical knowledge and experience to offer a general causation opinion. The Court agrees. \"Dr. Madigan is a man of statistics, not medicine.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Madigan Motion, ECF No. 427-20 at 9. He is not a medical doctor, toxicologist, pharmacologist, or psychologist. He also has no specialized knowledge of, or clinical experience with, pathological gambling or impulse control disorders. The Court finds that Dr. Madigan's admitted lack of expertise in the aforementioned fields precludes him from offering a medical or scientific opinion that Abilify is capable of causing pathological gambling and impulse control disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court finds Dr. Madigan amply qualified to offer a biostatistical analysis of the evidence in this case, as well as opinions related to pharmacovigilance and clinical trials generally, as his credentials in these fields are well beyond reasonable challenge. Briefly, Dr. Madigan is a Professor of Statistics at Columbia University, where he is also Dean of the Faculty and Executive Vice-President for Arts and Sciences. He holds a bachelor's\n   degree in Mathematical Sciences and a doctorate in Statistics. He is an elected Fellow of both the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the American Statistical Association. He has published more than 160 peer-reviewed academic articles in the areas of statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and pharmacovigilance. Drug safety, with a focus on the development and application of statistical methods for pharmacovigilance, is a \"significant research interest\" of Dr. Madigan's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 2. Over the years, he has served the FDA in a number of different capacities related to the identification and evaluation of safety risks of medical products, and he currently serves the FDA as a consultant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   He has also consulted for various pharmaceutical companies on issues related to statistics, drug safety, and clinical trials. Finally, Dr. Madigan has \"extensive experience\" designing and analyzing clinical trials, both as a consultant and in the academic context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that Dr. Madigan is a leading expert on biostatistics, pharmacovigilance, and clinical trials. Indeed, Dr. Madigan has been qualified to offer expert opinions in these areas in numerous federal and state courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise here, the Court finds Dr. Madigan qualified to offer expert opinions on the design and analysis of clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and to provide expert biostatistical analyses of the scientific evidence in this case, including, but not limited to, the Etminan Study, adverse event reports\n   in the FAERS database, various disproportionality analyses by Defendants and the FDA, and Defendants' clinical trial data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Dr. Madigan's Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Dr. Madigan used a series of different statistical analyses to assess whether and to what extent the evidence in this case indicates the presence of an association between Abilify, pathological gambling, and impulse control disorders. The Court has already discussed Dr. Madigan's statistical analysis of the Etminan Study and his opinion that the Study evidences a \"strong\" association between Abilify and these two adverse effects.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Dr. Madigan also conducted several disproportionality analyses of the FDA's adverse event reporting database (FAERS), comparing the relative frequency of pathological gambling reports among Abilify and 10 other atypical antipsychotics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   To address concerns about potential litigation-driven reporting (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , reporting bias), Dr. Madigan excluded all adverse event reports from lawyers and analyzed the data as of four different dates he considered significant in the life of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also controlled for potential confounders by performing separate disproportionality analyses restricted to pathological gambling reports involving patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. On each of the four dates, and in each of the separate analyses, Dr. Madigan found that Abilify had statistically significant percentages of pathological gambling reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, according to Dr. Madigan, the association between Abilify and pathological gambling reports was \"very strong\" at all times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 23-24; Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 19. None of the other atypical antipsychotics exhibited an association with pathological gambling reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 23; Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 19. Importantly, Defendants do not dispute Dr. Madigan's statistical calculations or findings. Indeed, Dr. Madigan's findings are consistent with the findings of\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   , and of the FDA's disproportionality analysis in 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FDA Pharm. Vigil., ECF No. 428-11 at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Next, Dr. Madigan analyzed Defendants' clinical trial materials related to pathological gambling. He found that the clinical trials results reflected no patient reports of pathological gambling, so he analyzed the underlying trial data to determine whether the trial was sufficiently powered-essentially, whether it was large enough-to detect a statistically significant association between Abilify and pathological gambling, if in fact such an association existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   He found that it was not. More specifically, Dr. Madigan's analysis showed that Defendants' clinical trials were not large enough to detect a statistically significant increased risk of pathological gambling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 30. Dr. Madigan further determined that, to have been adequately powered to detect a statistically significant association, the clinical trials would have needed to have been approximately five times larger than they were.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan PPT, PX-051 at 10; Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 33. Again, Defendants do not dispute Dr. Madigan's calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Dr. Madigan also analyzed\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   . Dr. Madigan first calculated the frequency of these three categories of adverse effects in patients exposed to Abilify as compared with the frequency of those effects with comparator drugs and a placebo. This analysis yielded, in statistical terms, an estimate of the relative risk of developing the adverse effect among the three groups.\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref.

Dr. Madigan then calculated\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   -values for the relative risk findings to determine whether the increased risk of hypersexuality, impulsive behavior, and increased libido with Abilify was statistically significant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Based on Dr. Madigan's calculations,\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   . Dr. Madigan testified that the other five\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   -values, although not statistically significant, still indicate that the probability that chance alone explains the other relative risk ratios is \"very slim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 37.\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   . According to Dr. Madigan, although the corresponding\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   -value, 0.08, is not statistically significant, it is still relevant because it indicates that the likelihood of the 2.7 relative risk being explained by chance is only 8%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 38-39. Dr. Madigan characterizes his findings with respect to the hypersexuality, impulsive behavior, and increased libido events reported during the clinical trials as evidence of a \"trend or concern.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Tr., ECF No. 596-4 at 39;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 29 (\"This shows a concerning trend against [Abilify ].\"),\n   <strong>\n    [* * * REDACTED * * *]\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Reliability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Defendants challenge the reliability of Dr. Madigan's methodology on multiple grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the Court has already found that Dr. Madigan is not qualified to offer expert opinions on medical causation, several of Defendants' reliability objections are now moot. The Court addresses the remaining objections in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Defendants first challenge Dr. Madigan's expert opinions on the grounds that his initial expert report offers \"no discernible methodology\" as to how he reached his conclusions and that, at any rate, his opinions are not supported by any of the methodologies-epidemiology, dose-response, and background risk-that the Eleventh Circuit considers \"indispensable\" for proving that a drug can cause an adverse effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201160\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/1296/#p1303\">\n    766 F.3d at 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Dr. Madigan's opinions are very clearly based on the application of widely accepted statistical methods to data drawn from the \"indispensable\" field of epidemiology (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Etminan Study), the FAERS database, and Defendants' clinical trials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Madigan Rep., ECF No. 427-1 at 2-30; Madigan Supp., ECF No. 427-1 at 79-92.\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Madigan's reports and testimony describe, in great detail, the precise steps he took to (1) evaluate the strengths and limitations of the Etminan Study; (2) to determine whether and to what extent a safety signal for pathological gambling existed for Abilify in the FAERS database; and (3) to assess whether Defendants' clinical trials were capable of detecting an association between pathological gambling and Abilify. Notably, Defendants do not challenge the accuracy and reliability of Dr. Madigan's calculations or offer an expert statistician to contradict or refute his mathematical conclusions. Given the scientific support for Dr. Madigan's methodologies and the lack of rebuttal evidence to discredit any step in his analysis, the Court finds no basis for Defendants' argument that his methodology is not discernible or reliable enough to be admissible. To the contrary, in the Eleventh Circuit, mathematical and statistical analyses are well-recognized as reliable and acceptable means of supporting an expert opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chemicals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11670161\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/548/#p565\">\n    158 F.3d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565-66 (11th Cir. 1998) (statistician's expert opinion reliable where based on \"well-established\" mathematical and statistical methods);\n   <em>\n    State of Ga., Dept. of Human Res. v.

Ga. 1977) (same). Because the Court has already found Dr. Madigan qualified to testify on the basis of statistics in this case, and because Dr. Madigan thoroughly explained the steps in his analysis, the Court finds his methodology sufficiently transparent and reliable to support his expert opinion on the strength of the statistical evidence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Defendants also raise arguments regarding Dr. Madigan's analysis of their clinical trial data. First, they challenge as \"pure speculation\" Dr. Madigan's opinion that the clinical trials were not powered to detect a statistically significant increased risk of pathological gambling, which Defendants appear to claim is based solely on his observation that placebo subjects in the trials had no reports of pathological gambling. The premise of this argument is incorrect. When a study, such as the randomized clinical trials in this case, fails to find a statistically significant association between a drug and an adverse effect, an \"important question is whether [that] result tends to exonerate the [drug's] toxicity or is essentially inconclusive with regard to toxicity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ref. Man. at 582. A statistical power analysis is a well-established scientific means of evaluating whether the study's outcome is exonerative or inconclusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991025\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/446/404/#p409\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, \"power\" quantifies the ability of a study to detect a statistically significant association of a given magnitude, if it exists, in light of the sample sizes used in the study.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.; ASARCO\n   </em>\n   , 746 F.2d at 493 n.19.

She holds an undergraduate degree in psychology and physiology, as well as a doctorate in behavioral neuroscience. She has extensive professional experience in the design and use of\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   studies of \"impulsivity and risky decision-making\" in rodents to investigate and understand these conditions in humans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Winstanley Rep., ECF No. 461-1 at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   In brief, Dr. Winstanley offers an opinion that none of the available\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   data supports Plaintiffs' experts' conclusions that Abilify can cause gambling disorder or impulsivity. Plaintiffs challenge Dr. Winstanley's testimony on a number of grounds, most notably, her lack of qualifications to testify on general causation and her failure to adequately explain how and why\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   findings about the effects of various drugs on impulsivity in rodents may be reliably extrapolated to prove that Abilify would have comparable effects on gambling and impulsivity in humans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   As to Dr. Winstanley's qualifications, the Court agrees that she is not qualified to\n   offer a comprehensive general causation opinion. She is not a medical doctor, toxicologist, pharmacologist, or epidemiologist, and she has no specialized knowledge of, or clinical experience with, Abilify, pathological gambling, or impulse control disorders in humans. Dr. Winstanley's admitted lack of expertise in the aforementioned areas precludes her from offering a medical or scientific opinion that Abilify cannot cause impulse control problems. However, given Dr. Winstanley's knowledge and experience with animal models of impulsivity, the Court finds her qualified to offer an expert opinion regarding any such evidence that is ultimately deemed admissible in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Dr. Winstanley's opinion is based on her review of\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   studies investigating impulse control and gambling-related behavior in rodents, studies that she considers contradictory to Plaintiffs' experts' opinions regarding the biological mechanism by which Abilify can cause gambling and impulsivity problems in humans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Winstanley Tr., ECF No. 596-8 at 107.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Winstanley refers to these\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   studies as \"translationally valid,\" by which she means that the behavioral test each study used to assess impulsivity in rodents is a scientifically accepted, valid model of impulsivity in humans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Winstanley Tr., ECF No. 596-8 at 110-11. Although Dr. Winstanley defines, in general terms, the three components of a translationally valid animal model, it is not entirely clear from her expert report or her testimony how or why the animal models she cites in this case meet that definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is problematic because, as gatekeeper for the expert evidence presented to the jury, the Court must ensure that any extrapolations from rodents to humans are based on more than just the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   of an expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191531\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/1283/#p1298\">\n    392 F.3d at 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"there is no fit where a large analytical leap must be made between the facts and the [proposed expert's] opinion,\" such as the proffer of animal studies concerning one type of cancer in mice to establish a different type of cancer in humans).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Dr. Winstanley testified that it is \"impossible\" to translationally validate any model of gambling disorder in rodents and that, to her knowledge, Abilify has never been tested in any rodent models of gambling-related behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Winstanley Tr., ECF No. 596-8 at 99, 108. Therefore, to the extent she has extrapolated from the\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   studies in this case any conclusions about gambling disorder or gambling-related behavior in humans, the Court finds those conclusions inadmissible at trial. Dr. Winstanley also offers opinions based on the findings of\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   studies involving drugs that are pharmacologically different from Abilify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, she failed to offer\n   any evidence establishing the reliability of an analogy between those other drugs and Abilify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414989\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1194/#p1199\">\n    295 F.3d at 1200-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that extrapolations between drugs are impermissible unless reliable scientific evidence establishes the validity of the analogy). Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   studies concerning other drugs (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not Abilify ) are inadmissible and may not support Dr. Winstanley's opinion. Finally, with respect to the remaining\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   studies (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those involving Abilify ), the Court has lingering questions about how and why the behavioral tests used on rodents are translationally valid, such that it is reliable to extrapolate from them a conclusion about Abilify's effects in humans. At the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, Dr. Winstanley spent a total of 21 minutes on the witness stand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Winstanley Tr., ECF No. 596-8 at 93-11. This was neither party's fault; rather, time constraints and the late hour at which her testimony began limited each side's ability to thoroughly flesh out Dr. Winstanley's positions. Under these circumstances, the Court finds it appropriate to defer ruling on the reliability of this single aspect of Dr. Winstanley's opinion and give Defendants an opportunity to recall her at the next\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, at which time Plaintiffs may also cross-examine her on the issue.

For starters, there is reliable evidence of a broad scientific consensus regarding the existence of an association between Abilify and increased risk of impulse control problems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDA, EMA, and Health Canada have all concluded as much, based on their reviews of largely the\n   same scientific literature and statistical analyses discussed in this Order, and, as a result, have required that safety warnings be added to the Abilify product labels.

The FDA's 2016 pharmacovigilance review \"confirm[ed]\" Defendants' conclusions as to a \"possible causal association\" between Abilify use and impulse control disorders, and it also called for a case-control study to \"help clarify\" the nature of the association.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA Pharm. Vigil., ECF No. 428-11 at 29-30. The Etminan Study-an epidemiological case-control study that is peer-reviewed, published, and unchallenged in the scientific literature to date-reliably confirms the association as causal. Moreover, the biological mechanism by which Abilify can cause impulse control problems has been reliably established by peer-reviewed, published scientific literature, and notably, Plaintiffs' experts' biological plausibility opinions are consistent with both the FDA and Defendants' assessments of Abilify's mechanism of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section (II)(C)(4)(e). Defendants' experts hotly dispute Plaintiffs' general causation evidence, but a hot dispute is not a basis for excluding Plaintiffs' experts' opinions. \"[T]he subject of scientific testimony [need not be] 'known' to a certainty; arguably, there are no certainties in science.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
