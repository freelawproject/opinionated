Plaintiff and the putative class seek recovery from Defendant, who owns and operates sixty-seven restaurants nationwide known as Smokey Bones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff primarily alleges that Defendant, while taking advantage of the FLSA's tip credit provision, required her and the putative class members to perform non-tipped side work that\n   <em>\n    was not\n   </em>\n   related to their tipped occupations as servers and bartenders, as well as requiring that Plaintiff and the putative class members spend more than twenty percent of their shifts performing non-tipped side work that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   related to their tipped occupations. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that she and the putative class members were required to pay Defendant out of their tips when a customer walked out, were required to purchase additional Smokey Bones t-shirts with their tips, and were never notified that Smokey Bones was paying them less than minimum wage pursuant to the FLSA's tip-credit provision. Plaintiff alleges that all three of those requirements violate the tip-credit provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant filed its motion to dismiss on May 31, 2017.

According to Defendant, so long as Plaintiff's average wage per hour, including her tips, was above minimum wage over the course of the workweek, then Defendant could not have violated the FLSA. Defendant's argument derives from the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Klinghoffer Bros.

In other words, Plaintiff claims that when she was performing non-tipped side work, she did not qualify as a tipped employee under \u00a7 203(m) of the FLSA and was entitled to be paid the full minimum wage of $7.25 an hour for the hours she spent performing non-tipped side work. Thus, Plaintiff claims that even if her total direct wages and tips for the week averaged to greater than minimum wage, Defendant was still not entitled to pay her the $2.13 tip-credit wage when she was performing non-tipped side work. Plaintiff's claim for non-tipped related side work is based on the FOH's twenty-percent rule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   while her claim for non-tipped unrelated side work is based on the dual-jobs regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FLSA treats the related and unrelated non-tipped side work differently, but the majority of courts, including this Court, have concluded that a plaintiff can allege an FLSA cause of action based on both types of non-tipped tasks.\n   <em>\n    Irvine v.

The FOH provides the basis for Plaintiff's cause of action based on her performance of non-tipped side work that was related to her tipped occupation.

The Court takes this view for a number of reasons. First, the Tenth Circuit correctly notes that\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer\n   </em>\n   was decided before the FLSA's tip-credit provision existed.\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277985\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1281/\">\n    849 F.3d at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer\n   </em>\n   -derived argument has very little weight. Second, Defendant's argument runs counter to the FLSA's plain requirement that an employer pay its employees a direct wage in addition to their tips.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277985\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1281/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As discussed in\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   , if the Court were to accept Defendant's argument then employers would not need to pay an employee anything \"so long as the employee's weekly tips-when divided by the number of hours he or she worked-average at least $7.25 an hour.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277985\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court cannot accept Defendant's argument because \u00a7 203(m) of the FLSA \"explicitly requires employers to pay their tipped employees\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   , regardless of how much those employees receive in tips.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277985\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m) (\"[T]he cash wage paid such employee...shall be not less than [$2.13 an hour.]\"). Finally, although not entitled to any special deference, the Department of Labor submitted an amicus brief in\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   supporting the plaintiff's position that\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer\n   </em>\n   had no applicability in the tip-credit context. All of these factors weigh heavily in Plaintiff's favor. The Court concludes that Plaintiff can state a cause of action against Defendant even if her average wage per hour was above minimum wage, so long as she can sufficiently allege that Defendant improperly paid her using the tip-credit provision for the hours she spent performing related or unrelated non-tipped side work. She has done so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant required tipped workers to \"spend a substantial amount of time performing non-tip producing work including, but not limited to, general cleaning of the restaurant, rinsing, washing, and rolling silverware, and making sauces and refilling condiments.\" (Am. Compl., ECF No. 10, at \u00b6 33.) Plaintiff also alleges that \"Defendant requires tipped workers to perform non-tipped work before the restaurant is open or after the restaurant has closed and customers have left.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) \"For instance, Defendant typically requires tipped workers to arrive at least an hour prior to serving their first customer and to stay at work approximately one and a half to two or more hours after serving their last customer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) Plaintiff then provided further examples of non-tipped work she and the putative class members were required to perform. Those examples include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) sweeping floors; (2) taking out trash and cleaning trash receptacle areas; (3) restocking to-go boxes and other items; (4) filling bottles and pans with dressings and labeling them; (5) cleaning tables, chairs, and booths; (6) cleaning baseboards and lamps; (7) scrubbing walls and drains; (8) making sauces following\n   restaurant recipes; (9) cleaning out the keg room; (10) cleaning and restocking caddies; (11) rinsing dirty silverware and running it through the dishwasher; (12) polishing and rolling silverware; (13) removing and replacing rechargeable batteries from tabletop customer computers; (14) prepping and garnishing food and desserts before serving to customers; (15) deep cleaning light fixtures, booths, and woodwork with Murphy's Oil; (16) restocking mini fridges with sour cream, cheese, dressing, etc.; (17) scrubbing floors in restaurant with a deck brush; and (18) breaking down and cleaning the tea/coffee and soda stations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) Finally, Plaintiff alleges that \"[t]he non-tipped work which Plaintiff and others similarly situated were required to perform exceeded twenty percent (20%) of their time at work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This Court has previously rejected Defendant's arguments regarding the viability of causes of action based on the FOH's twenty-percent rule and the dual-jobs regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irvine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361257\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/106/729/#p733\">\n    106 F.Supp.3d at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court will address each request in turn, along with Defendant's request to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel regarding the terms of the proposed notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Conditional Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff moves to conditionally certify a nationwide class of servers and bartenders who worked at any of the sixty-seven Smokey Bones locations across the country. Defendant objects to the conditional certification of the proposed class, as well as to the breadth of the proposed class in the event that a class is conditionally certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the proposed class is similarly situated because they were all subject to the same policies and duties. According to Plaintiff, Smokey Bones is not a franchise and it maintains uniform policies across each of its sixty-seven restaurants. As support for this assertion, Plaintiff points to the corporate nationwide job descriptions for servers and bartenders. In those job descriptions, Smokey Bones lays out the job duties for its server and bartender positions nationwide. Those job duties include descriptions of the side work that servers and bartenders are expected to perform. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Decl. Kevin Journiette, Ex. B, Smokey Bones Corp. Job Description Server Positions, ECF No. 39-1, at 12-13; Pl.'s Mot. Certify Class, Ex. D, Decl. Victoria Reaves, ECF No. 33-5, at 12-13.) Plaintiff asserts that those nationwide job descriptions, coupled with the declarations she has submitted from servers and bartenders at three different Smokey Bones restaurants in three different states, are more than enough to demonstrate that all Smokey Bones servers and bartenders are sufficiently similarly situated to surmount the low bar of conditional certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant disagrees, and argues that conditional certification of this action is neither warranted nor prudent. Defendant's primary argument against conditional certification is the same as the argument it made in its motion to dismiss-that Plaintiff cannot allege a violation of the FLSA because Plaintiff never made less than minimum wage over the course\n   of any workweek. Because the Court has already addressed that argument above, it does not rehash it here. However, Defendant also argues that the declarations of a smattering of employees from three Smokey Bones locations are insufficient to justify conditional certification of a nationwide class of servers and bartenders. Moreover, Defendant argues that a nationwide class would be untenable as a result of the individualized inquiries that Defendant contends will be necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court concludes that conditional certification of a nationwide class of servers and bartenders is warranted in this case. Plaintiff has produced evidence of nationwide Smokey Bones job descriptions for servers and bartenders that on their face require side work. There is no doubt that requiring side work does not necessarily violate the FLSA. However, Plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that Smokey Bones' nationwide side work policy potentially caused FLSA violations for all Smokey Bones servers and bartenders. Plaintiff and the other opt-ins' declarations state that at least three Smokey Bones locations in three different states all implemented the side work discussed in the server and bartender descriptions in such a way as to require violations of the dual-jobs regulation and/or the FOH's twenty-percent rule. The Court recognizes that Defendant has produced declarations from a number of Smokey Bones employees at various other locations throughout the country that dispute Plaintiff's claims. However, the Court does not make credibility determinations at the conditional certification stage.\n   <em>\n    Curtis v. Time Warner Entertainment-Advance/Newhouse Partnership\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:12-cv-2370-JFA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201874848\">\n    2013 WL 1874848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D.S.C. May 3, 2013). Instead, \"it is sufficient that [Plaintiff has] shown a reasonable basis for [her] claim that other similarly situated plaintiffs exist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201874848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court also recognizes, and shares to some extent, Defendant's concern about the manageability of the proposed class and the possibility that individual determinations will predominate. Nonetheless, because Plaintiff has provided evidence of Defendant's corporate side work policy by way of the server and bartender job descriptions, the Court is skeptical that individualized determinations will predominate after the class members are identified. Regardless, the answer to that question will be far clearer after discovery is complete. Accordingly, the Court conditionally certifies Plaintiff's proposed class of servers and bartenders as it pertains to violations of the dual-jobs regulation and the FOH's twenty-percent rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff requests that Defendant produce that information in an Excel spreadsheet within fourteen days of the date of this Order.

Unlike Plaintiff's side work claims, these other claims are individual to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff has not shown that those claims arose out of a corporate policy. Specifically, Plaintiff and the other declarants allege that they were not properly notified that Smokey Bones was using the tip-credit provision. Defendant has provided evidence that it hung Department of Labor posters in each of its locations, that it orally told Plaintiff and all other employees that they were being paid using the tip-credit provision, and that the tip-credit provision was explained in its employee handbook. Next, Plaintiff has alleged that she was required to compensate the restaurant when a customer walked out without paying. However, only Plaintiff makes such an allegation. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that she was required to pay for additional Smokey Bones t-shirts with her tips. Here, only two of the five employees who provided declarations stated that they themselves\n    <strong>\n     actually purchased\n    </strong>\n    additional Smokey Bones shirts with their tips.
